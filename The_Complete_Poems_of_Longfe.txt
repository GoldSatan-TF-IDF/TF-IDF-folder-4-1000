amid some sylvan scene where the long drooping boughs between shadows dark and sunlight sheen alternate come and go or where the denser grove receives no sunlight from above but the dark foliage interweaves in one unbroken roof of leaves underneath whose sloping eaves the shadows hardly move beneath some patriarchal tree i lay upon the ground his hoary arms uplifted he and all the broad leaves over me clapped their little hands in glee with one continuous sound a slumberous sound a sound that brings the feelings of a dream as of innumerable wings as when a bell no longer swings faint the hollow murmur rings oer meadow lake and stream and dreams of that which cannot die bright visions came to me as lapped in thought i used to lie and gaze into the summer sky where the sailing clouds went by like ships upon the sea dreams that the soul of youth engage ere fancy has been quelled old legends of the monkish page traditions of the saint and sage tales that have the rime of age and chronicles of eld and loving still these quaint old themes even in the citys throng i feel the freshness of the streams that crossed by shades and sunny gleams water the green land of dreams the holy land of song therefore at pentecost which brings the spring clothed like a bride when nestling buds unfold their wings and bishopscaps have golden rings musing upon many things i sought the woodlands wide the green trees whispered low and mild it was a sound of joy they were my playmates when a child and rocked me in their arms so wild still they looked at me and smiled as if i were a boy and ever whispered mild and low come be a child once more and waved their long arms to and fro and beckoned solemnly and slow o i could not choose but go into the woodlands hoar into the blithe and breathing air into the solemn wood solemn and silent everywhere nature with folded hands seemed there kneeling at her evening prayer like one in prayer i stood before me rose an avenue of tall and sombrous pines abroad their fanlike branches grew and where the sunshine darted through spread a vapor soft and blue in long and sloping lines and falling on my weary brain like a fastfalling shower the dreams of youth came back again low lispings of the summer rain dropping on the ripened grain as once upon the flower visions of childhood stay o stay ye were so sweet and wild and distant voices seemed to say it cannot be they pass away other themes demand thy lay thou art no more a child the land of song within thee lies watered by living springs the lids of fancys sleepless eyes are gates unto that paradise holy thoughts like stars arise its clouds are angels wings learn that henceforth thy song shall be not mountains capped with snow nor forests sounding like the sea nor rivers flowing ceaselessly where the woodlands bend to see the bending heavens below there is a forest where the din of iron branches sounds a mighty river roars between and whosoever looks therein sees the heavens all black with sin sees not its depths nor bounds athwart the swinging branches cast soft rays of sunshine pour then comes the fearful wintry blast our hopes like withered leaves fail fast pallid lips say it is past we can return no more look then into thine heart and write yes into lifes deep stream all forms of sorrow and delight all solemn voices of the night that can soothe thee or affright be these henceforth thy theme hymn to the night greek quotation i heard the trailing garments of the night sweep through her marble halls i saw her sable skirts all fringed with light from the celestial walls i felt her presence by its spell of might stoop oer me from above the calm majestic presence of the night as of the one i love i heard the sounds of sorrow and delight the manifold soft chimes that fill the haunted chambers of the night like some old poets rhymes from the cool cisterns of the midnight air my spirit drank repose the fountain of perpetual peace flows there from those deep cisterns flows o holy night from thee i learn to bear what man has borne before thou layest thy finger on the lips of care and they complain no more peace peace oresteslike i breathe this prayer descend with broadwinged flight the welcome the thriceprayed for the most fair the bestbeloved night a psalm of life what the heart of the young man said to the psalmist tell me not in mournful numbers life is but an empty dream for the soul is dead that slumbers and things are not what they seem life is real life is earnest and the grave is not its goal dust thou art to dust returnest was not spoken of the soul not enjoyment and not sorrow is our destined end or way but to act that each tomorrow find us farther than today art is long and time is fleeting and our hearts though stout and brave still like muffled drums are beating funeral marches to the grave in the worlds broad field of battle in the bivouac of life be not like dumb driven cattle be a hero in the strife trust no future howeer pleasant let the dead past bury its dead act act in the living present heart within and god oerhead lives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime and departing leave behind us footprints on the sands of time footprints that perhaps another sailing oer lifes solemn main a forlorn and shipwrecked brother seeing shall take heart again let us then be up and doing with a heart for any fate still achieving still pursuing learn to labor and to wait the reaper and the flowers there is a reaper whose name is death and with his sickle keen he reaps the bearded grain at a breath and the flowers that grow between shall i have naught that is fair saith he have naught but the bearded grain though the breath of these flowers is sweet to me i will give them all back again he gazed at the flowers with tearful eyes he kissed their drooping leaves it was for the lord of paradise he bound them in his sheaves my lord has need of these flowerets gay the reaper said and smiled dear tokens of the earth are they where he was once a child they shall all bloom in fields of light transplanted by my care and saints upon their garments white these sacred blossoms wear and the mother gave in tears and pain the flowers she most did love she knew she should find them all again in the fields of light above o not in cruelty not in wrath the reaper came that day t was an angel visited the green earth and took the flowers away the light of stars the night is come but not too soon and sinking silently all silently the little moon drops down behind the sky there is no light in earth or heaven but the cold light of stars and the first watch of night is given to the red planet mars is it the tender star of love the star of love and dreams o no from that blue tent above a heros armor gleams and earnest thoughts within me rise when i behold afar suspended in the evening skies the shield of that red star o star of strength i see thee stand and smile upon my pain thou beckonest with thy mailed hand and i am strong again within my breast there is no light but the cold light of stars i give the first watch of the night to the red planet mars the star of the unconquered will he rises in my breast serene and resolute and still and calm and selfpossessed and thou too whosoeer thou art that readest this brief psalm as one by one thy hopes depart be resolute and calm o fear not in a world like this and thou shalt know erelong know how sublime a thing it is to suffer and be strong footsteps of angels when the hours of day are numbered and the voices of the night wake the better soul that slumbered to a holy calm delight ere the evening lamps are lighted and like phantoms grim and tall shadows from the fitful firelight dance upon the parlor wall then the forms of the departed enter at the open door the beloved the truehearted come to visit me once more he the young and strong who cherished noble longings for the strife by the roadside fell and perished weary with the march of life they the holy ones and weakly who the cross of suffering bore folded their pale hands so meekly spake with us on earth no more and with them the being beauteous who unto my youth was given more than all things else to love me and is now a saint in heaven with a slow and noiseless footstep comes that messenger divine takes the vacant chair beside me lays her gentle hand in mine and she sits and gazes at me with those deep and tender eyes like the stars so still and saintlike looking downward from the skies uttered not yet comprehended is the spirits voiceless prayer soft rebukes in blessings ended breathing from her lips of air oh though oft depressed and lonely all my fears are laid aside if i but remember only such as these have lived and died flowers spake full well in language quaint and olden one who dwelleth by the castled rhine when he called the flowers so blue and golden stars that in earths firmament do shine stars they are wherein we read our history as astrologers and seers of eld yet not wrapped about with awful mystery like the burning stars which they beheld wondrous truths and manifold as wondrous god hath written in those stars above but not less in the bright flowerets under us stands the revelation of his love bright and glorious is that revelation written all over this great world of ours making evident our own creation in these stars of earth these golden flowers and the poet faithful and farseeing sees alike in stars and flowers a part of the selfsame universal being which is throbbing in his brain and heart gorgeous flowerets in the sunlight shining blossoms flaunting in the eye of day tremulous leaves with soft and silver lining buds that open only to decay brilliant hopes all woven in gorgeous tissues flaunting gayly in the golden light large desires with most uncertain issues tender wishes blossoming at night these in flowers and men are more than seeming workings are they of the selfsame powers which the poet in no idle dreaming seeth in himself and in the flowers everywhere about us are they glowing some like stars to tell us spring is born others their blue eyes with tears oerflowing stand like ruth amid the golden corn not alone in springs armorial bearing and in summers greenemblazoned field but in arms of brave old autumns wearing in the centre of his brazen shield not alone in meadows and green alleys on the mountaintop and by the brink of sequestered pools in woodland valleys where the slaves of nature stoop to drink not alone in her vast dome of glory not on graves of bird and beast alone but in old cathedrals high and hoary on the tombs of heroes carved in stone in the cottage of the rudest peasant in ancestral homes whose crumbling towers speaking of the past unto the present tell us of the ancient games of flowers in all places then and in all seasons flowers expand their light and soullike wings teaching us by most persuasive reasons how akin they are to human things and with childlike credulous affection we behold their tender buds expand emblems of our own great resurrection emblems of the bright and better land the beleaguered city i have read in some old marvellous tale some legend strange and vague that a midnight host of spectres pale beleaguered the walls of prague beside the moldaus rushing stream with the wan moon overhead there stood as in an awful dream the army of the dead white as a seafog landward bound the spectral camp was seen and with a sorrowful deep sound the river flowed between no other voice nor sound was there no drum nor sentrys pace the mistlike banners clasped the air as clouds with clouds embrace but when the old cathedral bell proclaimed the morning prayer the white pavilions rose and fell on the alarmed air down the broad valley fast and far the troubled army fled up rose the glorious morning star the ghastly host was dead i have read in the marvellous heart of man that strange and mystic scroll that an army of phantoms vast and wan beleaguer the human soul encamped beside lifes rushing stream in fancys misty light gigantic shapes and shadows gleam portentous through the night upon its midnight battleground the spectral camp is seen and with a sorrowful deep sound flows the river of life between no other voice nor sound is there in the army of the grave no other challenge breaks the air but the rushing of lifes wave and when the solemn and deep churchbell entreats the soul to pray the midnight phantoms feel the spell the shadows sweep away down the broad vale of tears afar the spectral camp is fled faith shineth as a morning star our ghastly fears are dead midnight mass for the dying year yes the year is growing old and his eye is pale and bleared death with frosty hand and cold plucks the old man by the beard sorely sorely the leaves are falling falling solemnly and slow caw caw the rooks are calling it is a sound of woe a sound of woe through woods and mountain passes the winds like anthems roll they are chanting solemn masses singing pray for this poor soul pray pray and the hooded clouds like friars tell their beads in drops of rain and patter their doleful prayers but their prayers are all in vain all in vain there he stands in the foul weather the foolish fond old year crowned with wild flowers and with heather like weak despised lear a king a king then comes the summerlike day bids the old man rejoice his joy his last o the man gray loveth that eversoft voice gentle and low to the crimson woods he saith to the voice gentle and low of the soft air like a daughters breath pray do not mock me so do not laugh at me and now the sweet day is dead cold in his arms it lies no stain from its breath is spread over the glassy skies no mist or stain then too the old year dieth and the forests utter a moan like the voice of one who crieth in the wilderness alone vex not his ghost then comes with an awful roar gathering and sounding on the stormwind from labrador the wind euroclydon the stormwind howl howl and from the forest sweep the red leaves away would the sins that thou abhorrest o soul could thus decay and be swept away for there shall come a mightier blast there shall be a darker day and the stars from heaven downcast like red leaves be swept away kyrie eleyson christe eleyson earlier poems an april day when the warm sun that brings seedtime and harvest has returned again t is sweet to visit the still wood where springs the first flower of the plain i love the season well when forest glades are teeming with bright forms nor dark and manyfolded clouds foretell the comingon of storms from the earths loosened mould the sapling draws its sustenance and thrives though stricken to the heart with winters cold the drooping tree revives the softlywarbled song comes from the pleasant woods and colored wings glance quick in the bright sun that moves along the forest openings when the bright sunset fills the silver woods with light the green slope throws its shadows in the hollows of the hills and wide the upland glows and when the eve is born in the blue lake the sky oerreaching far is hollowed out and the moon dips her horn and twinkles many a star inverted in the tide stand the gray rocks and trembling shadows throw and the fair trees look over side by side and see themselves below sweet april many a thought is wedded unto thee as hearts are wed nor shall they fail till to its autumn brought lifes golden fruit is shed autumn with what a glory comes and goes the year the buds of spring those beautiful harbingers of sunny skies and cloudless times enjoy lifes newness and earths garniture spread out and when the silver habit of the clouds comes down upon the autumn sun and with a sober gladness the old year takes up his bright inheritance of golden fruits a pomp and pageant fill the splendid scene there is a beautiful spirit breathing now its mellow richness on the clustered trees and from a beaker full of richest dyes pouring new glory on the autumn woods and dipping in warm light the pillared clouds morn on the mountain like a summer bird lifts up her purple wing and in the vales the gentle wind a sweet and passionate wooer kisses the blushing leaf and stirs up life within the solemn woods of ash deepcrimsoned and silver beech and maple yellowleaved where autumn like a faint old man sits down by the wayside aweary through the trees the golden robin moves the purple finch that on wild cherry and red cedar feeds a winter bird comes with its plaintive whistle and pecks by the witchhazel whilst aloud from cottage roofs the warbling bluebird sings and merrily with oftrepeated stroke sounds from the threshingfloor the busy flail o what a glory doth this world put on for him who with a fervent heart goes forth under the bright and glorious sky and looks on duties well performed and days well spent for him the wind ay and the yellow leaves shall have a voice and give him eloquent teachings he shall so hear the solemn hymn that death has lifted up for all that he shall go to his long restingplace without a tear woods in winter when winter winds are piercing chill and through the hawthorn blows the gale with solemn feet i tread the hill that overbrows the lonely vale oer the bare upland and away through the long reach of desert woods the embracing sunbeams chastely play and gladden these deep solitudes where twisted round the barren oak the summer vine in beauty clung and summer winds the stillness broke the crystal icicle is hung where from their frozen urns mute springs pour out the rivers gradual tide shrilly the skaters iron rings and voices fill the woodland side alas how changed from the fair scene when birds sang out their mellow lay and winds were soft and woods were green and the song ceased not with the day but still wild music is abroad pale desert woods within your crowd and gathering winds in hoarse accord amid the vocal reeds pipe loud chill airs and wintry winds my ear has grown familiar with your song i hear it in the opening year i listen and it cheers me long hymn of the moravian nuns of bethlehem at the consecration of pulaskis banner when the dying flame of day through the chancel shot its ray far the glimmering tapers shed faint light on the cowled head and the censer burning swung where before the altar hung the crimson banner that with prayer had been consecrated there and the nuns sweet hymn was heard the while sung low in the dim mysterious aisle take thy banner may it wave proudly oer the good and brave when the battles distant wail breaks the sabbath of our vale when the clarions music thrills to the hearts of these lone hills when the spear in conflict shakes and the strong lance shivering breaks take thy banner and beneath the battleclouds encircling wreath guard it till our homes are free guard it god will prosper thee in the dark and trying hour in the breaking forth of power in the rush of steeds and men his right hand will shield thee then take thy banner but when night closes round the ghastly fight if the vanquished warrior bow spare him by our holy vow by our prayers and many tears by the mercy that endears spare him he our love hath shared spare him as thou wouldst be spared take thy banner and if eer thou shouldst press the soldiers bier and the muffled drum should beat to the tread of mournful feet then this crimson flag shall be martial cloak and shroud for thee the warrior took that banner proud and it was his martial cloak and shroud sunrise on the hills i stood upon the hills when heavens wide arch was glorious with the suns returning march and woods were brightened and soft gales went forth to kiss the sunclad vales the clouds were far beneath me bathed in light they gathered midway round the wooded height and in their fading glory shone like hosts in battle overthrown as many a pinnacle with shifting glance through the gray mist thrust up its shattered lance and rocking on the cliff was left the dark pine blasted bare and cleft the veil of cloud was lifted and below glowed the rich valley and the rivers flow was darkened by the forests shade or glistened in the white cascade where upward in the mellow blush of day the noisy bittern wheeled his spiral way i heard the distant waters dash i saw the current whirl and flash and richly by the blue lakes silver beach the woods were bending with a silent reach then oer the vale with gentle swell the music of the village bell came sweetly to the echogiving hills and the wild horn whose voice the woodland fills was ringing to the merry shout that faint and far the glen sent out where answering to the sudden shot thin smoke through thickleaved branches from the dingle broke if thou art worn and hard beset with sorrows that thou wouldst forget if thou wouldst read a lesson that will keep thy heart from fainting and thy soul from sleep go to the woods and hills no tears dim the sweet look that nature wears the spirit of poetry there is a quiet spirit in these woods that dwells whereer the gentle southwind blows where underneath the whitethorn in the glade the wild flowers bloom or kissing the soft air the leaves above their sunny palms outspread with what a tender and impassioned voice it fills the nice and delicate ear of thought when the fast ushering star of morning comes oerriding the gray hills with golden scarf or when the cowled and duskysandaled eve in mourning weeds from out the western gate departs with silent pace that spirit moves in the green valley where the silver brook from its full laver pours the white cascade and babbling low amid the tangled woods slips down through mossgrown stones with endless laughter and frequent on the everlasting hills its feet go forth when it doth wrap itself in all the dark embroidery of the storm and shouts the stern strong wind and here amid the silent majesty of these deep woods lts presence shall uplift thy thoughts from earth as to the sunshine and the pure bright air their tops the green trees lift hence gifted bards have ever loved the calm and quiet shades for them there was an eloquent voice in all the sylvan pomp of woods the golden sun the flowers the leaves the river on its way blue skies and silver clouds and gentle winds the swelling upland where the sidelong sun aslant the wooded slope at evening goes groves through whose broken roof the sky looks in mountain and shattered cliff and sunny vale the distant lake fountains and mighty trees in many a lazy syllable repeating their old poetic legends to the wind and this is the sweet spirit that doth fill the world and in these wayward days of youth my busy fancy oft embodies it as a bright image of the light and beauty that dwell in nature of the heavenly forms we worship in our dreams and the soft hues that stain the wild birds wing and flush the clouds when the sun sets within her tender eye the heaven of april with its changing light and when it wears the blue of may is hung and on her lip the rich red rose her hair is like the summer tresses of the trees when twilight makes them brown and on her cheek blushes the richness of an autumn sky with evershifting beauty then her breath it is so like the gentle air of spring as front the mornings dewy flowers it comes full of their fragrance that it is a joy to have it round us and her silver voice is the rich music of a summer bird heard in the still night with its passionate cadence burial of the minnisink on sunny slope and beechen swell the shadowed light of evening fell and where the maples leaf was brown with soft and silent lapse came down the glory that the wood receives at sunset in its golden leaves far upward in the mellow light rose the blue hills one cloud of white around a far uplifted cone in the warm blush of evening shone an image of the silver lakes by which the indians soul awakes but soon a funeral hymn was heard where the soft breath of evening stirred the tall gray forest and a band of stern in heart and strong in hand came winding down beside the wave to lay the red chief in his grave they sang that by his native bowers he stood in the last moon of flowers and thirty snows had not yet shed their glory on the warriors head but as the summer fruit decays so died he in those naked days a dark cloak of the roebucks skin covered the warrior and within its heavy folds the weapons made for the hard toils of war were laid the cuirass woven of plaited reeds and the broad belt of shells and beads before a darkhaired virgin train chanted the death dirge of the slain behind the long procession came of hoary men and chiefs of fame with heavy hearts and eyes of grief leading the warhorse of their chief stripped of his proud and martial dress uncurbed unreined and riderless with darting eye and nostril spread and heavy and impatient tread he came and oft that eye so proud asked for his rider in the crowd they buried the dark chief they freed beside the grave his battle steed and swift an arrow cleaved its way to his stern heart one piercing neigh arose and on the dead mans plain the rider grasps his steed again l envoi ye voices that arose after the evenings close and whispered to my restless heart repose go breathe it in the ear of all who doubt and fear and say to them be of good cheer ye sounds so low and calm that in the groves of balm seemed to me like an angels psalm go mingle yet once more with the perpetual roar of the pine forest dark and hoar tongues of the dead not lost but speaking from deaths frost like fiery tongues at pentecost glimmer as funeral lamps amid the chills and darn ps of the vast plain where death encamps ballads and other poems the skeleton in armor speak speak i thou fearful guest who with thy hollow breast still in rude armor drest comest to daunt me wrapt not in eastern balms bat with thy fleshless palms stretched as if asking alms why dost thou haunt me then from those cavernous eyes pale flashes seemed to rise as when the northern skies gleam in december and like the waters flow under decembers snow came a dull voice of woe from the hearts chamber i was a viking old my deeds though manifold no skald in song has told no saga taught thee take heed that in thy verse thou dost the tale rehearse else dread a dead mans curse for this i sought thee far in the northern land by the wild baltics strand i with my childish hand tamed the gerfalcon and with my skates fastbound skimmed the halffrozen sound that the poor whimpering hound trembled to walk on oft to his frozen lair tracked i the grisly bear while from my path the hare fled like a shadow oft through the forest dark followed the werewolfs bark until the soaring lark sang from the meadow but when i older grew joining a corsairs crew oer the dark sea i flew with the marauders wild was the life we led many the souls that sped many the hearts that bled by our stern orders many a wassailbout wore the long winter out often our midnight shout set the cocks crowing as we the berserks tale measured in cups of ale draining the oaken pail filled to oerflowing once as i told in glee tales of the stormy sea soft eyes did gaze on me burning yet tender and as the white stars shine on the dark norway pine on that dark heart of mine fell their soft splendor i wooed the blueeyed maid yielding yet half afraid and in the forests shade our vows were plighted under its loosened vest fluttered her little breast like birds within their nest by the hawk frighted bright in her fathers hall shields gleamed upon the wall loud sang the minstrels all chanting his glory when of old hildebrand i asked his daughters hand mute did the minstrels stand to hear my story while the brown ale he quaffed loud then the champion laughed and as the windgusts waft the seafoam brightly so the loud laugh of scorn out of those lips unshorn from the deep drinkinghorn blew the foam lightly she was a princes child i but a viking wild and though she blushed and smiled i was discarded should not the dove so white follow the seamews flight why did they leave that night her nest unguarded scarce had i put to sea bearing the maid with me fairest of all was she among the norsemen when on the white seastrand waving his armed hand saw we old hildebrand with twenty horsemen then launched they to the blast bent like a reed each mast yet we were gaining fast when the wind failed us and with a sudden flaw came round the gusty skaw so that our foe we saw laugh as he hailed us and as to catch the gale round veered the flapping sail death i was the helmsmans hail death without quarter midships with iron keel struck we her ribs of steel down her black hulk did reel through the black water as with his wings aslant sails the fierce cormorant seeking some rocky haunt with his prey laden so toward the open main beating to sea again through the wild hurricane bore i the maiden three weeks we westward bore and when the storm was oer cloudlike we saw the shore stretching to leeward there for my ladys bower built i the lofty tower which to this very hour stands looking seaward there lived we many years time dried the maidens tears she had forgot her fears she was a mother death closed her mild blue eyes under that tower she lies neer shall the sun arise on such another still grew my bosom then still as a stagnant fen hateful to me were men the sunlight hateful in the vast forest here clad in my warlike gear fell i upon my spear o death was grateful thus seamed with many scars bursting these prison bars up to its native stars my soul ascended there from the flowing bowl deep drinks the warriors soul skoal to the northland skoal thus the tale ended the wreck of the hesperus it was the schooner hesperus that sailed the wintry sea and the skipper had taken his little daughter to bear him company blue were her eyes as the fairyflax her cheeks like the dawn of day and her bosom white as the hawthorn buds that ope in the month of may the skipper he stood beside the helm his pipe was in his month and he watched how the veering flaw did blow the smoke now west now south then up and spake an old sailor had sailed to the spanish main i pray thee put into yonder port for i fear a hurricane last night the moon had a golden ring and tonight no moon we see the skipper he blew a whiff from his pipe and a scornful laugh laughed he colder and louder blew the wind a gale from the northeast the snow fell hissing in the brine and the billows frothed like yeast down came the storm and smote amain the vessel in its strength she shuddered and paused like a frighted steed then leaped her cables length come hither come hither my little daughter and do not tremble so for i can weather the roughest gale that ever wind did blow he wrapped her warm in his seamans coat against the stinging blast he cut a rope from a broken spar and bound her to the mast o father i hear the churchbells ring o say what may it be tis a fogbell on a rockbound coast and he steered for the open sea o father i hear the sound of guns o say what may it be some ship in distress that cannot live in such an angry sea o father i see a gleaming light o say what may it be but the father answered never a word a frozen corpse was he lashed to the helm all stiff and stark with his face turned to the skies the lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow on his fixed and glassy eyes then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed that saved she might be and she thought of christ who stilled the wave on the lake of galilee and fast through the midnight dark and drear through the whistling sleet and snow like a sheeted ghost the vessel swept towrds the reef of normans woe and ever the fitful gusts between a sound came from the land it was the sound of the trampling surf on the rocks and the hard seasand the breakers were right beneath her bows she drifted a dreary wreck and a whooping billow swept the crew like icicles from her deck she struck where the white and fleecy waves looked soft as carded wool but the cruel rocks they gored her side like the horns of an angry bull her rattling shrouds all sheathed in ice with the masts went by the board like a vessel of glass she stove and sank ho ho the breakers roared at daybreak on the bleak seabeach a fisherman stood aghast to see the form of a maiden fair lashed close to a drifting mast the salt sea was frozen on her breast the salt tears in her eyes and he saw her hair like the brown seaweed on the billows fall and rise such was the wreck of the hesperus in the midnight and the snow christ save us all from a death like this on the reef of normans woe the village blacksmith under a spreading chestnuttree the village smithy stands the smith a mighty man is he with large and sinewy hands and the muscles of his brawny arms are strong as iron bands his hair is crisp and black and long his face is like the tan his brow is wet with honest sweat he earns whateer he can and looks the whole world in the face for he owes not any man week in week out from morn till night you can hear his bellows blow you can hear him swing his heavy sledge with measured beat and slow like a sexton ringing the village bell when the evening sun is low and children coming home from school look in at the open door they love to see the flaming forge and bear the bellows roar and catch the burning sparks that fly like chaff from a threshingfloor he goes on sunday to the church and sits among his boys he hears the parson pray and preach he hears his daughters voice singing in the village choir and it makes his heart rejoice it sounds to him like her mothers voice singing in paradise he needs must think of her once more how in the grave she lies and with his haul rough hand he wipes a tear out of his eyes toiling rejoicing sorrowing onward through life he goes each morning sees some task begin each evening sees it close something attempted something done has earned a nights repose thanks thanks to thee my worthy friend for the lesson thou hast taught thus at the flaming forge of life our fortunes must be wrought thus on its sounding anvil shaped each burning deed and thought endymion the rising moon has hid the stars her level rays like golden bars lie on the landscape green with shadows brown between and silver white the river gleams as if diana in her dreams had dropt her silver bow upon the meadows low on such a tranquil night as this she woke endymion with a kiss when sleeping in the grove he dreamed not of her love like dians kiss unasked unsought love gives itself but is not bought nor voice nor sound betrays its deep impassioned gaze it comes the beautiful the free the crown of all humanity in silence and alone to seek the elected one it lifts the boughs whose shadows deep are lifes oblivion the souls sleep and kisses the closed eyes of him who slumbering lies o weary hearts o slumbering eyes o drooping souls whose destinies are fraught with fear and pain ye shall be loved again no one is so accursed by fate no one so utterly desolate but some heart though unknown responds unto his own

of its stillness overflowed me like a tide and in better hours and brighter when i saw thy waters gleam i have felt my heart beat lighter and leap onward with thy stream not for this alone i love thee

and chant a melancholy hymn with solemn voice and slow no purple flowers no garlands green conceal the goblets shade or sheen nor maddening draughts of hippocrene like gleams of sunshine flash between thick leaves of mistletoe this goblet wrought with curious art is filled with waters that upstart when the deep fountains of the heart by strong convulsions rent apart are running all to waste and as it mantling passes round with fennel is it wreathed and crowned whose seed and foliage sunimbrowned are in its waters steeped and drowned and give a bitter taste above the lowly plants it towers the fennel with its yellow flowers and in an earlier age than ours was gifted with the wondrous powers lost vision to restore it gave new strength and fearless mood and gladiators fierce and rude mingled it in their daily food and he who battled and subdued a wreath of fennel wore then in lifes goblet freely press the leaves that give it bitterness nor prize the colored waters less for in thy darkness and distress new light and strength they give and he who has not learned to know how false its sparkling buhbles show how bitter are the drops of woe with which its brim may overflow he has not learned to live the prayer of ajax was for light through all that dark and desperate fight the blackness of that noonday night he asked but the return of sight to see his foemans face let our unceasing earnest prayer be too for light for strength to bear our portion of the weight of care that crushes into dumb despair one half the human race o suffering sad humanity o ye afflicted one who lie steeped to the lips in misery longing and yet afraid to die patient though sorely tried i pledge you in this cup of grief where floats the fennels bitter leaf the battle of our life is briet the

tresses wreathed in one as the braided streamlets run standing with reluctant feet where the brook and river meet womanhood and childhood fleet gazing with a timid glance on the brooklets swift advance on the rivers broad expanse deep and still that gliding stream beautiful to thee must seem as the river of a dream then why pause with indecision when bright angels in thy vision beckon thee to fields elysian seest thou shadows sailing by as the dove with startled eye sees the falcons shadow fly hearest thou voices on the shore that our ears perceive no more deafened by the cataracts roar

into wounds that cannot heal even as sleep our eyes doth seal and that smile like sunshine dart into many a sunless heart for a smile of god thou art excelsior the shades of night were falling fast as through an alpine village passed a youth who bore mid snow and ice a banner with the strange device excelsior his brow was sad his eye beneath flashed like a falchion from its sheath and like a silver clarion rung the accents of that unknown tongue excelsior in happy homes he saw the light of household fires gleam warm and bright above the spectral glaciers shone and from his lips escaped a groan excelsior try not the pass the old man said dark lowers the tempest overhead the roaring torrent is deep and wide and loud that clarion voice replied excelsior oh stay the maiden said and rest thy weary head upon this breast a tear stood in his bright blue eye but still he answered with a sigh excelsior beware the pinetrees withered branch beware the awful avalanche this was the peasants last goodnight a voice replied far up the height excelsior at break of day as heavenward the pious monks of saint bernard uttered the oftrepeated prayer a voice cried through the startled air excelsior a traveller by the faithful hound halfburied in the snow was found still grasping in his hand of ice that banner with the strange device excelsior there in the twilight cold and gray lifeless but beautiful he lay and from the sky serene and far a voice fell like a falling star excelsior poems on slavery the following poems with one exception were written at sea in the latter part of october i had not then heard of dr channings death since that event the poem addressed to him is no longer appropriate i have decided however to let it remain as it was written in testimony of my admiration for a great and good man to william e channing the pages of thy book i read and as i closed each one my heart responding ever said servant of god well done well done thy words are great and bold at times they seem to me like luthers in the days of old halfbattles for the free go on until this land revokes the old and chartered lie the feudal curse whose whips and yokes insult humanity a voice is ever at thy side speaking in tones of might like the prophetic voice that cried to john in patmos write write and tell out this bloody tale record this dire eclipse this day of wrath this endless wail this dread apocalypse the slaves dream beside the ungathered rice he lay his sickle in his hand his breast was bare his matted hair was buried in the sand again in the mist and shadow of sleep he saw his native land wide through the landscape of his dreams the lordly niger flowed beneath the palmtrees on the plain once more a king he strode and heard the tinkling caravans descend the mountainroad he saw once more his darkeyed queen among her children stand they clasped his neck they kissed his cheeks they held him by the hand a tear burst from the sleepers lids and fell into the sand and then at furious speed he rode along the nigers bank his bridlereins were golden chains and with a martial clank at each leap he could feel his scabbard of steel smiting his stallions flank before him like a bloodred flag the bright flamingoes flew from morn till night he followed their flight oer plains where the tamarind grew till he saw the roofs of caffre huts and the ocean rose to view at night he heard the lion roar and the hyena scream and the riverhorse as he crushed the reeds beside some hidden stream and it passed like a glorious roll of drums through the triumph of his dream the forests with their myriad tongues shouted of liberty and the blast of the desert cried aloud with a voice so wild and free that he started in his sleep and smiled at their tempestuous glee he did not feel the drivers whip nor the burning heat of day for death had illumined the land of sleep and his lifeless body lay a wornout fetter that the soul had broken and thrown away the good part that shall not be taken away she dwells by great kenhawas side in valleys green and cool and all her hope and all her pride are in the village school her soul like the transparent air that robes the hills above though not of earth encircles there all things with arms of love and thus she walks among her girls with praise and mild rebukes subduing een rude village churls by her angelic looks she reads to them at eventide of one who came to save to cast the captives chains aside and liberate the slave and oft the blessed time foretells when all men shall be free and musical as silver bells their falling chains shall be and following her beloved lord in decent poverty she makes her life one sweet record and deed of charity for she was rich and gave up all to break the iron bands of those who waited in her hall and labored in her lands long since beyond the southern sea their outbound sails have sped while she in meek humility now earns her daily bread it is their prayers which never cease that clothe her with such grace their blessing is the light of peace that shines upon her face the slave in the dismal swamp in dark fens of the dismal swamp the hunted negro lay he saw the fire of the midnight camp and heard at times a horses tramp and a bloodhounds distant bay where willothewisps and glowworms shine in bulrush and in brake where waving mosses shroud the pine and the cedar grows and the poisonous vine is spotted like the snake where hardly a human foot could pass or a human heart would dare on the quaking turf of the green morass he crouched in the rank and tangled grass like a wild beast in his lair a poor old slave infirm and lame great scars deformed his face on his forehead he bore the brand of shame and the rags that hid his mangled frame were the livery of disgrace all things above were bright and fair all things were glad and free lithe squirrels darted here and there and wild birds filled the echoing air with songs of liberty on him alone was the doom of pain from the morning of his birth on him alone the curse of cain fell like a flail on the garnered grain and struck him to the earth the slave singing at midnight loud he sang the psalm of david he a negro and enslaved sang of israels victory sang of zion bright and free in that hour when night is calmest sang he from the hebrew psalmist in a voice so sweet and clear that i could not choose but hear songs of triumph and ascriptions such as reached the swart egyptians when upon the red sea coast perished pharaoh and his host and the voice of his devotion filled my soul with strange emotion for its tones by turns were glad sweetly solemn wildly sad paul and silas in their prison sang of christ the lord arisen and an earthquakes arm of might broke their dungeongates at night but alas what holy angel brings the slave this glad evangel and what earthquakes arm of might breaks his dungeongates at night the witnesses in oceans wide domains half buried in the sands lie skeletons in chains with shackled feet and hands beyond the fall of dews deeper than plummet lies float ships with all their crews no more to sink nor rise there the black slaveship swims freighted with human forms whose fettered fleshless limbs are not the sport of storms these are the bones of slaves they gleam from the abyss they cry from yawning waves we are the witnesses within earths wide domains are markets for mens lives their necks are galled with chains their wrists are cramped with gyves dead bodies that the kite in deserts makes its prey murders that with affright scare schoolboys from their play all evil thoughts and deeds anger and lust and pride the foulest rankest weeds that choke lifes groaning tide these are the woes of slaves they glare from the abyss they cry from unknown graves we are the witnesses the quadroon girl the slaver in the broad lagoon lay moored with idle sail he waited for the rising moon and for the evening gale under the shore his boat was tied and all her listless crew watched the gray alligator slide into the still bayou odors of orangeflowers and spice reached them from time to time like airs that breathe from paradise upon a world of crime the planter under his roof of thatch smoked thoughtfully and slow the slavers thumb was on the latch he seemed in haste to go he said my ship at anchor rides in yonder broad lagoon i only wait the evening tides and the rising of the moon before them with her face upraised in timid attitude like one half curious half amazed a quadroon maiden stood her eyes were large and full of light her arms and neck were bare no garment she wore save a kirtle bright and her own long raven hair and on her lips there played a smile as holy meek and faint as lights in some cathedral aisle the features of a saint the soil is barren the farm is old the thoughtful planter said then looked upon the slavers gold and then upon the maid his heart within him was at strife with such accursed gains for he knew whose passions gave her life whose blood ran in her veins but the voice of nature was too weak he took the glittering gold then pale as death grew the maidens cheek her hands as icy cold the slaver led her from the door he led her by the hand to be his slave and paramour in a strange and distant land the warning beware the israelite of old who tore the lion in his path when poor and blind he saw the blessed light of heaven no more shorn of his noble strength and forced to grind in prison and at last led forth to be a pander to philistine revelry upon the pillars of the temple laid his desperate hands and in its overthrow destroyed himself and with him those who made a cruel mockery of his sightless woe the poor blind slave the scoff and jest of all expired and thousands perished in the fall there is a poor blind samson in this land shorn of his strength and bound in bonds of steel who may in some grim revel raise his hand and shake the pillars of this commonweal till the vast temple of our liberties a

dressinggown smoking and conversing with don carlos lara you were not at the play tonight don carlos how happened it don c i had engagements elsewhere pray who was there lara why all the town and court the house was crowded and the busy fans among the gayly dressed and perfumed ladies fluttered like butterflies among the flowers there was the countess of medina celi the goblin lady with her phantom lover her lindo don diego dona sol and dona serafina and her cousins don c what was the play lara it was a dull affair one of those comedies in which you see as lope says the history of the world brought down from genesis to the day of judgment there were three duels fought in the first act three gentlemen receiving deadly wounds laying their hands upon their hearts and saying o i am dead a lover in a closet an old hidalgo and a gay don juan a dona inez with a black mantilla followed at twilight by an unknown lover who looks intently where he knows she is not don c of course the preciosa danced tonight lara and never better every footstep fell as lightly as a sunbeam on the water i think the girl extremely beautiful don c almost beyond the privilege of woman i saw her in the prado yesterday her step was royal queenlike and her face as beautiful as a saints in paradise lara may not a saint fall from her paradise and be no more a saint don c why do you ask lara because i have heard it said this angel fell and though she is a virgin outwardly within she is a sinner like those panels of doors and altarpieces the old monks painted in convents with the virgin mary on the outside and on the inside venus don c you do her wrong indeed you do her wrong she is as virtuous as she is fair lara how credulous you are why look you friend theres not a virtuous woman in madrid in this whole city and would you persuade me that a mere dancinggirl who shows herself nightly half naked on the stage for money and with voluptuous motions fires the blood of inconsiderate youth is to be held a model for her virtue don c you forget she is a gypsy girl lara and therefore won the easier don c nay not to be won at all the only virtue that a gypsy prizes is chastity that is her only virtue dearer than life she holds it i remember a gypsy woman a vile shameless bawd whose craft was to betray the young and fair and yet this woman was above all bribes and when a noble lord touched by her beauty the wild and wizard beauty of her race offered her gold to be what she made others she turned upon him with a look of scorn and smote him in the face lara and does that prove that preciosa is above suspicion don c it proves a nobleman may be repulsed when he thinks conquest easy i believe that woman in her deepest degradation holds something sacred something undefiled some pledge and keepsake of her higher nature and like the diamond in the dark retains some quenchless gleam of the celestial light lara yet preciosa would have taken the gold don c rising i do not think so lara i am sure of it but why this haste stay yet a little longer and fight the battles of your dulcinea don c t is late i must begone for if i stay you will not be persuaded lara yes persuade me

was at cordova in the cathedral garden thou wast sitting under the orangetrees beside a fountain prec t was eastersunday the fullblossomed trees filled all the air with fragrance and with joy the priests were singing and the organ sounded and then anon the great cathedral bell it was the elevation of the host we both of us fell down upon our knees under the orange boughs and prayed together i never had been happy till that moment vict thou blessed angel prec and when thou wast gone i felt an acting here i did not speak to any one that day but from that day bartolome grew hateful unto me vict remember him no more let not his shadow come between thee and me sweet preciosa i loved thee even then though i was silent prec i thought i neer should see thy face again thy farewell had a sound of sorrow in it vict that was the first sound in the song of love scarce more than silence is and yet a sound hands of invisible spirits touch the strings of that mysterious instrument the soul and play the prelude of our fate we hear the voice prophetic and are not alone prec that is my faith dust thou believe these warnings vict so far as this our feelings and our thoughts tend ever on and rest not in the present as drops of rain fall into some dark well and from below comes a scarce audible sound so fall our thoughts into the dark hereafter and their mysterious echo reaches us prec i have felt it so but found no words to say it i cannot reason i can only feel but thou hast language for all thoughts and feelings thou art a scholar and sometimes i think we cannot walk together in this world the distance that divides us is too great henceforth thy pathway lies among the stars i must not hold thee back vict thou little sceptic dost thou still doubt what i most prize in woman is her affections not her intellect the intellect is finite but the affections are infinite and cannot be exhausted compare me with the great men of the earth what am i why a pygmy among giants but if thou lovest mark me i say lovest the greatest of thy sex excels thee not the world of the affections is thy world not that of mans ambition in that stillness which most becomes a woman calm and holy thou sittest by the fireside of the heart feeding its flame the element of fire is pure it cannot change nor hide its nature but burns as brightly in a gypsy camp as in a palace hall art thou convinced prec yes that i love thee as the good love heaven but not that i am worthy of that heaven how shall i more deserve it vict loving more prec i cannot love thee more my heart is full vict then let it overflow and i will drink it as in the summertime the thirsty sands drink the swift waters of the manzanares and still do thirst for more a watchman in the street ave maria purissima t is midnight and serene vict hearst thou that cry prec it is a hateful sound to scare thee from me vict as the hunters horn doth scare the timid stag or bark of hounds the moorfowl from his mate prec pray do not go vict i must away to alcala tonight think of me when i am away prec fear not i have no thoughts that do not think of thee vict giving her a ring and to remind thee of my love take this a serpent emblem of eternity a ruby say a drop of my hearts blood prec it is an ancient saying that the ruby brings gladness to the wearer and preserves the heart pure and if laid beneath the pillow drives away evil dreams but then alas it was a serpent tempted eve to sin vict what convent of barefooted carmelites taught thee so much theology prec laying her hand upon his mouth hush hush good night and may all holy angels guard thee vict good night good night thou art my guardian angel i have no other saint than thou to pray to he descends by the balcony prec take care and do not hurt thee art thou safe vict from the garden safe as my love for thee but art thou safe others can climb a balcony by moonlight as well as i pray shut thy window close i am jealous of the perfumed air of night that from this garden climbs to kiss thy lips prec throwing down her handkerchief thou silly child take this to blind thine eyes it is my benison vict and brings to me sweet fragrance from thy lips as the soft wind wafts to the outbound mariner the breath of the beloved land he leaves behind prec make not thy voyage long vict tomorrow night shall see me safe returned thou art the star to guide me

only place in which one cannot find him is his own cell heres his guitar that seldom feels the caresses of its masters hand open thy silent lips sweet instrument and make dull midnight merry with a song he plays and sings padre francisco padre francisco what do you want of padre francisco here is a pretty young maiden who wants to confess her sins open the door and let her come in i will shrive her from every sin enter victorian vict padre hypolito padre hypolito hyp what do you want of padre hypolito vict come shrive me straight for if love be a sin i am the greatest sinner that doth live i will confess the sweetest of all crimes a maiden wooed and won hyp the same old tale of the old woman in the chimneycorner wnward wavering gleaming sank the ugudwash the sunfish ll thee a story of my weddingd vict nay listen for my heart is full so full that i must speak hyp alas that heart of thine is like a scene in the old play the curtain rises to solemn music and lo enter the eleven thousand virgins of cologne vict nay like the sibyls volumes thou shouldst say those that remained after the six were burned being held more precious than the nine together but listen to my tale dost thou remember the gypsy girl we saw at cordova dance the romalis in the marketplace hyp thou meanest preciosa vict ay the same thou knowest how her image haunted me long after we returned to alcala shes in madrid hyp i know it vict and im in love hyp and therefore in madrid when thou shouldst be in alcala vict o pardon me my friend if i so long have kept this secret from thee but silence is the charm that guards such treasures and if a word be spoken ere the time they sink again they were not meant for us hyp alas alas i see thou art in love love keeps the cold out better than a cloak it serves for food and raiment give a spaniard his mass his olla and his dona luisa thou knowest the proverb but pray tell me lover how speeds thy wooing is the maiden coy write her a song beginning with an ave sing as the monk sang to the virgin mary ave cujus calcem clare nec centenni commendare sciret seraph studio vict pray do not jest this is no time for it i am in earnest hyp seriously enamored what ho the primus of great alcala enamored of a gypsy tell me frankly how meanest thou vict i mean it honestly hyp surely thou wilt not marry her vict why not hyp she was betrothed to one bartolome if i remember rightly a young gypsy who danced with her at cordova vict they quarrelled and so the matter ended hyp but in truth thou wilt not marry her vict in truth i will the angels sang in heaven when she was born she is a precious jewel i have found among the filth and rubbish of the world ill stoop for it but when i wear it here set on my forehead like the morning star the world may wonder but it will not laugh hyp if thou wearst nothing else upon thy forehead t will be indeed a wonder vict out upon thee with thy unseasonable jests pray tell me is there no virtue in the world hyp not much what thinkst thou is she doing at this moment now while we speak of her vict she lies asleep and from her parted lips her gentle breath comes like the fragrance from the lips of flowers her tender limbs are still and on her breast the cross she prayed to ere she fell asleep rises and falls with the soft tide of dreams like a light barge safe moored hyp which means in prose shes sleeping with her mouth a little open vict o would i had the old magicians glass to see her as she lies in childlike sleep hyp and wouldst thou venture vict ay indeed i would hyp thou art courageous hast thou eer reflected how much lies hidden in that one word now vict yes all the awful mystery of life i oft have thought my dear hypolito that could we by some spell of magic change the world and its inhabitants to stone in the same attitudes they now are in what fearful glances downward might we cast into the hollow chasms of human life what groups should we behold about the deathbed putting to shame the group of niobe what joyful welcomes and what sad farewells what stony tears in those congealed eyes what visible joy or anguish in those cheeks what bridal pomps and what funereal shows what foes like gladiators fierce and struggling what lovers with their marble lips together hyp ay there it is and if i were in love that is the very point i most should dread this magic glass these magic spells of thine might tell a tale were better left untold for instance they might show us thy fair cousin the lady violante bathed in tears of love and anger like the maid of colchis whom thou another faithless argonaut having won that golden fleece a womans love desertest for this glauce vict hold thy peace she cares not for me she may wed another or go into a convent and thus dying marry achilles in the elysian fields hyp rising and so good night good morning i should say clock strikes three hark how the loud and ponderous mace of time knocks at the golden portals of the day and so once more good night well speak more largely of preciosa when we meet again get thee to bed and the magician sleep shall show her to thee in his magic glass in all her loveliness good night exit vict good night but not to bed for i must read awhile throws himself into the armchair which hypolito has left and lays a large book open upon his knees must read or sit in revery and watch the changing color of the waves that break upon the idle seashore of the mind visions of fame that once did visit me making night glorious with your smile where are ye o who shall give me now that ye are gone juices of those immortal plants that bloom upon olympus making us immortal or teach me where that wondrous mandrake grows whose magic root torn from the earth with groans at midnight hour can scare the fiends away and make the mind prolific in its fancies i have the wish but want the will to act souls of great men departed ye whose words have come to light from the swift river of time like roman swords found in the tagus bed where is the strength to wield the arms ye bore from the barred visor of antiquity reflected shines the eternal light of truth as from a mirror all the means of action the shapeless masses the materials lie everywhere about us what we need is the celestial fire to change the flint into transparent crystal bright and clear that fire is genius the rude peasant sits at evening in his smoky cot and draws with charcoal uncouth figures on the wall the son of genius comes footsore with travel and begs a shelter from the inclement night he takes the charcoal from the peasants hand and by the magic of his touch at once transfigured all its hidden virtues shine and in the eyes of the astonished clown it gleams a diamond even thus transformed rude popular traditions and old tales shine as immortal poems at the touch of some poor houseless homeless wandering bard who had but a nights lodging for his pains but there are brighter dreams than those of fame which are the dreams of love out of the heart rises the bright ideal of these dreams as from some woodland fount a spirit rises and sinks again into its silent deeps ere the enamored knight can touch her robe t is this ideal that the soul of man like the enamored knight beside the fountain waits for upon the margin of lifes stream waits to behold her rise from the dark waters clad in a mortal shape alas how many must wait in vain the stream flows evermore but from its silent deeps no spirit rises yet i born under a propitious star have found the bright ideal of my dreams yes she is ever with me i can feel here as i sit at midnight and alone her gentle breathing on my breast can feel the pressure of her head gods benison rest ever on it close those beauteous eyes sweet sleep and all the flowers that bloom at night

whistled i have missed her o my god the shot is returned bartolome falls the belfry of bruges and other poems the belfry of bruges carillon in the ancient town of bruges in the quaint old flemish city as the evening shades descended low and loud and sweetly blended low at times and loud at times and changing like a poets rhymes rang the beautiful wild chimes from the belfry in the market of the ancient town of bruges then with deep sonorous clangor calmly answering their sweet anger when the wrangling bells had ended slowly struck the clock eleven and from out the silent heaven silence on the town descended silence silence everywhere on the earth and in the air save that footsteps here and there of some burgher home returning by the street lamps faintly burning for a moment woke the echoes of the ancient town of bruges but amid my broken slumbers still i heard those magic numbers as they loud proclaimed the flight and stolen marches of the night till their chimes in sweet collision mingled with each wandering vision mingled with the fortunetelling gypsybands of dreams and fancies which amid the waste expanses of the silent land of trances have their solitary dwelling all else seemed asleep in bruges in the quaint old flemish city and i thought how like these chimes are the poets airy rhymes all his rhymes and roundelays his conceits and songs and ditties from the belfry of his brain scattered downward though in vain on the roofs and stones of cities for by night the drowsy ear under its curtains cannot hear and by day men go their ways hearing the music as they pass but deeming it no more alas than the hollow sound of brass yet perchance a sleepless wight lodging at some humble inn in the narrow lanes of life when the dusk and hush of night shut out the incessant din of daylight and its toil and strife may listen with a calm delight to the poets melodies till he hears or dreams he hears intermingled with the song thoughts that he has cherished long hears amid the chime and singing the bells of his own village ringing and wakes and finds his slumberous eyes wet with most delicious tears thus dreamed i as by night i lay in bruges at the fleurdeble listening with a wild delight to the chimes that through the night bang their changes from the belfry of that quaint old flemish city the belfry of bruges in the marketplace of bruges stands the belfry old and brown thrice consumed and thrice rebuilded still it watches oer the town as the summer morn was breaking on that lofty tower i stood and the world threw off the darkness like the weeds of widowhood thick with towns and hamlets studded and with streams and vapors gray like a shield embossed with silver round and vast the landscape lay at my feet the city slumbered from its chimneys here and there wreaths of snowwhite smoke ascending vanished ghostlike into air not a sound rose from the city at that early morning hour but i heard a heart of iron beating in the ancient tower from their nests beneath the rafters sang the swallows wild and high and the world beneath me sleeping seemed more distant than the sky then most musical and solemn bringing back the olden times with their strange unearthly changes rang the melancholy chimes like the psalms from some old cloister when the nuns sing in the choir and the great bell tolled among them like the chanting of a friar visions of the days departed shadowy phantoms filled my brain they who live in history only seemed to walk the earth again all the foresters of flanders mighty baldwin bras de fer lyderick du bucq and cressy philip guy de dampierre i beheld the pageants splendid that adorned those days of old stately dames like queens attended knights who bore the fleece of gold lombard and venetian merchants with deepladen argosies ministers from twenty nations more than royal pomp and ease i beheld proud maximilian kneeling humbly on the ground i beheld the gentle mary hunting with her hawk and hound and her lighted bridalchamber where a duke slept with the queen and the armed guard around them and the sword unsheathed between i beheld the flemish weavers with namur and juliers bold marching homeward from the bloody battle of the spurs of gold saw the light at minnewater saw the white hoods moving west saw great artevelde victorious scale the golden dragons nest and again the whiskered spaniard all the land with terror smote and again the wild alarum sounded from the tocsins throat till the bell of ghent responded oer lagoon and dike of sand i am roland i am roland there is victory in the land then the sound of drums aroused me the awakened citys roar chased the phantoms i had summoned back into their graves once more hours had passed away like minutes and before i was aware lo the shadow of the belfry crossed the sunillumined square a gleam of sunshine this is the place stand still my steed let me review the scene and summon from the shadowy past the forms that once have been the past and present here unite beneath times flowing tide like footprints hidden by a brook but seen on either side here runs the highway to the town there the green lane descends through which i walked to church with thee o gentlest of my friends the shadow of the lindentrees lay moving on the grass between them and the moving boughs a shadow thou didst pass thy dress was like the lilies and thy heart as pure as they one of gods holy messengers did walk with me that day i saw the branches of the trees bend down thy touch to meet the cloverblossoms in the grass rise up to kiss thy feet sleep sleep today tormenting cares of earth and folly born solemnly sang the village choir on that sweet sabbath morn through the closed blinds the golden sun poured in a dusty beam like the celestial ladder seen by jacob in his dream and ever and anon the wind sweetscented with the hay turned oer the hymnbooks fluttering leaves that on the window lay long was the good mans sermon yet it seemed not so to me for he spake of ruth the beautiful and still i thought of thee long was the prayer he uttered yet it seemed not so to me for in my heart i prayed with him and still i thought of thee but now alas the place seems changed thou art no longer here part of the sunshine of the scene with thee did disappear though thoughts deeprooted in my heart like pinetrees dark and high subdue the light of noon and breathe a low and ceaseless sigh this memory brightens oer the past as when the sun concealed behind some cloud that near us hangs shines on a distant field the arsenal at springfield this is the arsenal from floor to ceiling like a huge organ rise the burnished arms but front their silent pipes no anthem pealing startles the villages with strange alarms ah what a sound will rise how wild and dreary when the deathangel touches those swift keys what loud lament and dismal miserere will mingle with their awful symphonies i hear even now the infinite fierce chorus the cries of agony the endless groan which through the ages that have gone before us in long reverberations reach our own on helm and harness rings the saxon hammer through cimbric forest roars the norsemans song and loud amid the universal clamor oer distant deserts sounds the tartar gong i hear the florentine who from his palace wheels out his battlebell with dreadful din and aztec priests upon their teocallis beat the wild wardrums made of serpents skin the tumult of each sacked and burning village the shout that every prayer for mercy drowns the soldiers revels in the midst of pillage the wail of famine in beleaguered towns the bursting shell the gateway wrenched asunder the rattling musketry the clashing blade and ever and anon in tones of thunder the diapason of the cannonade is it o man with such discordant noises with such accursed instruments as these thou drownest natures sweet and kindly voices and jarrest the celestial harmonies were half the power that fills the world with terror were half the wealth bestowed on camps and courts given to redeem the human mind from error there were no need of arsenals or forts the warriors name would be a name abhorred and every nation that should lift again its hand against a brother on its forehead would wear forevermore the curse of cain down the dark future through long generations the echoing sounds grow fainter and then cease and like a bell with solemn sweet vibrations i hear once more the voice of christ say peace peace and no longer from its brazen portals the blast of wars great organ shakes the skies but beautiful as songs of the immortals the holy melodies of love arise nuremberg in the valley of the pegnitz where across broad meadowlands rise the blue franconian mountains nuremberg the ancient stands quaint old town of toil and traffic quaint old town of art and song memories haunt thy pointed gables like the rooks that round them throng memories of the middle ages when the emperors rough and bold had their dwelling in thy castle timedefying centuries old and thy brave and thrifty burghers boasted in their uncouth rhyme that their great imperial city stretched its hand through every clime in the courtyard of the castle bound with many an iron hand stands the mighty linden planted by queen cunigundes hand on the square the oriel window where in old heroic days sat the poet melchior singing kaiser maximilians praise everywhere i see around me rise the wondrous world of art fountains wrought with richest sculpture standing in the common mart and above cathedral doorways saints and bishops carved in stone by

castleturret shook in this fight was death the gainer spite of vassal and retainer and the lands his sires had plundered written in the doomsday book by his bed a monk was seated who in humble voice repeated many a prayer and paternoster from the missal on his knee and amid the tempest pealing sounds of bells came faintly stealing bells that from the neighboring kloster rang for the nativity in the hall the serf and vassal held that night their christmas wassail many a carol old and saintly sang the minstrels and the waits and so loud these saxon gleemen sang to slaves the songs of freemen that the storm was heard but faintly knocking at the castlegates till at length the lays they chanted reached the chamber terrorhaunted where the monk with accents holy whispered at the barons ear tears upon his eyelids glistened as he paused awhile and listened and the dying baron slowly turned his weary head to hear wassail for the kingly stranger born and cradled in a manger king like david priest like aaron christ is born to set us free and the lightning showed the sainted figures on the casement painted and exclaimed the shuddering baron miserere domine in that hour of deep contrition he beheld with clearer vision through all outward show and fashion justice the avenger rise all the pomp of earth had vanished falsehood and deceit were banished reason spake more loud than passion and the truth wore no disguise every vassal of his banner every serf born to his manor all those wronged and wretched creatures by his hand were freed again and as on the sacred missal he recorded

common dust but the good deed through the ages living in historic pages brighter grows and gleams immortal unconsumed by moth or rust rain in summer how beautiful is the rain after the dust and heat in the broad and fiery street in the narrow lane how beautiful is the rain how it clatters along the roofs like the tramp of hoofs how it gushes and struggles out from the throat of the overflowing spout across the windowpane it pours and pours and swift and wide with a muddy tide like a river down the gutter roars the rain the welcome rain the sick man from his chamber looks at the twisted brooks he can feel the cool breath of each little pool his fevered brain grows calm again and he breathes a blessing on the rain from the neighboring school come the boys with more than their wonted noise and commotion and down the wet streets sail their mimic fleets till the treacherous pool ingulfs them in its whirling and turbulent ocean in the country on every side where far and wide like a leopards tawny and spotted hide stretches the plain to the dry grass and the drier grain how welcome is the rain in the furrowed land the toilsome and patient oxen stand lifting the yoke encumbered head with their dilated nostrils spread they silently inhale the cloverscented gale and the vapors that arise from the wellwatered and smoking soil for this rest in the furrow after toil their large and lustrous eyes seem to thank the lord more than mans spoken word near at hand from under the sheltering trees the farmer sees his pastures and his fields of grain as they bend their tops to the numberless beating drops of the incessant rain he counts it as no sin that he sees therein only his own thrift and gain these and far more than these the poet sees he can behold aquarius old walking the fenceless fields of air and from each ample fold of the clouds about him rolled scattering everywhere the showery rain as the farmer scatters his grain he can behold things manifold that have not yet been wholly told have not been wholly sung nor said for his thought that never stops follows the waterdrops down to the graves of the dead down through chasms and gulfs profound to the dreary fountainhead of lakes and rivers under ground and sees them when the rain is done on the bridge of colors seven climbing up once more to heaven opposite the setting sun thus the seer with vision clear sees forms appear and disappear in the perpetual round of strange mysterious change from birth to death from death to birth from earth to heaven from heaven to earth till glimpses more sublime of things unseen before unto his wondering eyes reveal the universe as an immeasurable wheel turning forevermore in the rapid and rushing river of time to a child dear child how radiant on thy mothers knee with merrymaking eyes and jocund smiles thou gazest at the painted tiles whose figures grace with many a grotesque form and face the ancient chimney of thy nursery the lady with the gay macaw the dancing girl the grave bashaw with bearded lip and chin and leaning idly oer his gate beneath the imperial fan of state the chinese mandarin with what a look of proud command thou shakest in thy little hand the coral rattle with its silver bells making a merry tune thousands of years in indian seas that coral grew by slow degrees until some deadly and wild monsoon dashed it on coromandels sand those silver bells reposed of yore as shapeless ore far down in the deepsunken wells of darksome mines in some obscure and sunless place beneath huge chimborazos base or potosis oerhanging pines and thus for thee o little child through many a danger and escape the tall ships passed the stormy cape for thee in foreign lands remote beneath a burning tropic clime the indian peasant chasing the wild goat himself as swift and wild in falling clutched the frail arbute the fibres of whose shallow root uplifted from the soil betrayed the silver veins beneath it laid the buried treasures of the miser time but lo thy door is left ajar thou hearest footsteps from afar and at the sound thou turnest round with quick and questioning eyes like one who in a foreign land beholds on every hand some source of wonder and surprise and restlessly impatiently thou strivest strugglest to be free the four walls of thy nursery are now like prison walls to thee no more thy mothers smiles no more the painted tiles delight thee nor the playthings on the floor that won thy little beating heart before thou strugglest for the open door through these once solitary halls thy pattering footstep falls the sound of thy merry voice makes the old walls jubilant and they rejoice with the joy of thy young heart oer the light of whose gladness no shadows of sadness from the sombre background of memory start once ah once within these walls one whom memory oft recalls the father of his country dwelt and yonder meadows broad and damp the fires of the besieging camp encircled with a burning belt up and down these echoing stairs heavy with the weight of cares sounded his majestic tread yes within this very room sat he in those hours of gloom weary both in heart and head but what are these grave thoughts to thee out out into the open air thy only dream is liberty thou carest little how or where i see thee eager at thy play now shouting to the apples on the tree with cheeks as round and red as they and now among the yellow stalks among the flowering shrubs and plants as restless as the bee along the garden walks the tracks of thy small carriagewheels i trace and see at every turn how they efface whole villages of sandroofed tents that rise like golden domes above the cavernous and secret homes of wandering and nomadic tribes of ants ah cruel little tamerlane who with thy dreadful reign dost persecute and overwhelm these hapless troglodytes of thy realm what tired already with those suppliant looks and voice more beautiful than a poets books or murmuring sound of water as it flows thou comest back to parley with repose this rustic seat in the old appletree with its oerhanging golden canopy of leaves illuminate with autumnal hues and shining with the argent light of dews shall for a season be our place of rest beneath us like an orioles pendent nest from which the laughing birds have taken wing by thee abandoned hangs thy vacant swing dreamlike the waters of the river gleam a sailless vessel drops adown the stream and like it to a sea as wide and deep thou driftest gently down the tides of sleep o child o newborn denizen of lifes great city on thy head the glory of the morn is shed like a celestial benison here at the portal thou dost stand and with thy little hand thou openest the mysterious gate into the futures undiscovered land i see its valves expand as at the touch of fate into those realms of love and hate into that darkness blank and drear by some prophetic feeling taught i launch the bold adventurous thought freighted with hope and fear as upon subterranean streams in caverns unexplored and dark men sometimes launch a fragile bark laden with flickering fire and watch its swiftreceding beams until at length they disappear and in the distant dark expire by what astrology of fear or hope dare i to cast thy horoscope like the new moon thy life appears a little strip of silver light and widening outward into night the shadowy disk of future years and yet upon its outer rim a luminous circle faint and dim and scarcely visible to us here rounds and completes the perfect sphere a prophecy and intimation a pale and feeble adumbration of the great world of light that lies behind all human destinies ah if thy fate with anguish fraught should be to wet the dusty soil with the hot tears and sweat of toil to struggle with imperious thought until the overburdened brain weary with labor faint with pain like a jarred pendulum retain only its motion not its power remember in that perilous hour when most afflicted and oppressed from labor there shall come forth rest and if a more auspicious fate on thy advancing steps await still let it ever be thy pride to linger by the laborers side with words of sympathy or song to cheer the dreary march along of the great army of the poor oer desert sand oer dangerous moor nor to thyself the task shall be without reward for thou shalt learn the wisdom early to discern true beauty in utility as great pythagoras of yore standing beside the blacksmiths door and hearing the hammers as they smote the anvils with a different note stole from the varying tones that hung vibrant on every iron tongue the secret of the sounding wire and formed the sevenchorded lyre enough i will not play the seer i will no longer strive to ope the mystic volume where appear the herald hope forerunning fear and fear the pursuivant of hope thy destiny remains untold for like acestes shaft of old the swift thought kindles as it flies and burns to ashes in the skies the occultation of orion i saw as in a dream sublime the balance in the hand of time oer east and west its beam impended and day with all its hours of light was slowly sinking out of sight while opposite the scale of night silently with the stars ascended like the astrologers of eld in that bright vision i beheld greater and deeper mysteries i saw with its celestial keys its chords of air its frets of fire the samians great aeolian lyre rising through all its sevenfold bars from earth unto the fixed stars and through the dewy atmosphere not only could i see but hear its wondrous and harmonious strings in sweet vibration sphere by sphere from dians circle light and near onward to vaster and wider rings where chanting through his beard of snows majestic mournful saturn goes and down the sunless realms of space reverberates the thunder of his bass beneath the skys triumphal arch this music sounded like a march and with its chorus seemed to be preluding some great tragedy sirius was rising in the east and slow ascending one by one the kindling constellations shone begirt with many a blazing star stood the great giant algebar orion hunter of the beast his sword hung gleaming by his side and on his arm the lions hide scattered across the midnight air the golden radiance of its hair the moon was pallid but not faint and beautiful as some fair saint serenely moving on her way in hours of trial and dismay as if she heard the voice of god unharmed with naked feet she trod upon the hot and burning stars as on the glowing coals and bars that were to prove her strength and try her holiness and her purity thus moving on with silent pace and triumph in her sweet pale face she reached the station of orion aghast he stood in strange alarm and suddenly from his outstretched arm down fell the red skin of the lion into the river at his feet his mighty club no longer beat the forehead of the bull but he reeled as of yore beside the sea when blinded by oenopion he sought the blacksmith at his forge and climbing up the mountain gorge fixed his blank eyes upon the sun then through the silence overhead an angel with a trumpet said forevermore forevermore the reign of violence is oer and like an instrument that flings its music on anothers strings the trumpet of the angel cast upon the heavenly lyre its blast and on from sphere to sphere the words reechoed down the burning chords forevermore forevermore the reign of violence is oer the bridge i stood on the bridge at midnight as the clocks were striking the hour and the moon rose oer the city behind the dark churchtower i saw her bright reflection in the waters under me like a golden goblet falling and sinking into the sea and far in the hazy distance of that lovely night in june the blaze of the flaming furnace gleamed redder than the moon among the long black rafters the wavering shadows lay and the current that came from the ocean seemed to lift and bear them away as sweeping and eddying through them rose the belated tide and streaming into the moonlight the seaweed floated wide and like those waters rushing among the wooden piers a flood of thoughts came oer me that filled my eyes with tears how often oh how often in the days that had gone by i had stood on that bridge at midnight and gazed on that wave and sky how often oh how often i had wished that the ebbing tide would bear me away on its bosom oer the ocean wild and wide for my heart was hot and restless and my life was full of care and the burden laid upon me seemed greater than i could bear but now it has fallen from me it is buried in the sea and only the sorrow of others throws its shadow over me yet whenever i cross the river on its bridge with wooden piers like the odor of brine from the ocean comes the thought of other years and i think how many thousands of careencumbered men each bearing his burden of sorrow have crossed the bridge since then i see the long procession still passing to and fro the young heart hot and restless and the old subdued and slow and forever and forever as long as the river flows as long as the heart has passions as long as life has woes the moon and its broken reflection and its shadows shall appear as the symbol of love in heaven and its wavering image here to the driving cloud gloomy and dark art thou o chief of the mighty omahas gloomy and dark as the driving cloud whose name thou hast taken wrapt in thy scarlet blanket i see thee stalk through the citys narrow and populous streets as once by the margin of rivers stalked those birds unknown that have left us only their footprints what in a few short years will remain of thy race but the footprints how canst thou walk these streets who hast trod the green turf of the prairies how canst thou breathe this air who hast breathed the sweet air of the mountains ah t is in vain that with lordly looks of disdain thou dost challenge looks of disdain in return and question these walls and these pavements claiming the soil for thy huntinggrounds while downtrodden millions starve in the garrets of europe and cry from its caverns that they too have been created heirs of the earth and claim its division back then back to thy woods in the regions west of the wabash there as a monarch thou reignest in autumn the leaves of the maple pave the floors of thy palacehalls with gold and in summer pinetrees waft through its chambers the odorous breath of their branches there thou art strong and great a hero a tamer of horses there thou chasest the stately stag on the banks of the elkhorn or by the roar of the runningwater or where the omaha calls thee and leaps through the wild ravine like a brave of the blackfeet hark what murmurs arise from the heart of those mountainous deserts is it the cry of the foxes and crows or the mighty behemoth who unharmed on his tusks once caught the bolts of the thunder and now lurks in his lair to destroy the race of the red man far more fatal to thee and thy race than the crows and the foxes far more fatal to thee and thy race than the tread of behemoth lo the big thundercanoe that steadily breasts the missouris merciless current and yonder afar on the prairies the campfires gleam through the night and the cloud of dust in the gray of the daybreak marks not the buffalos track nor the mandans dexterous horserace it is a caravan whitening the desert where dwell the camanches ha how the breath of these saxons and celts like the blast of the eastwind drifts evermore to the west the scanty smokes of thy wigwams songs the day is done the day is done and the darkness falls from the wings of night as a feather is wafted downward from an eagle in his flight i see the lights of the village gleam through the rain and the mist and a feeling of sadness comes oer me that my soul cannot resist a feeling of sadness and longing that is not akin to pain and resembles sorrow only as the mist resembles the rain come read to me some poem some simple and heartfelt lay that shall soothe this restless feeling and banish the thoughts of day not from the grand old masters not from the bards sublime whose distant footsteps echo through the corridors of time for like strains of martial music their mighty thoughts suggest lifes endless toil and endeavor and tonight i long for rest read from some humbler poet whose songs gushed from his heart as showers from the clouds of summer or tears from the eyelids start who through long days of labor and nights devoid of ease still heard in his soul the music of wonderful melodies such songs have power to quiet the restless pulse of care and come like the benediction that follows after prayer then read from the treasured volume the poem of thy choice and lend to the rhyme of the poet the beauty of thy voice and the night shall be filled with music and the cares that infest the day shall fold their tents like the arabs and as silently steal away afternoon in february the day is ending the night is descending the marsh is frozen the river dead through clouds like ashes the red sun flashes on village windows that glimmer red the snow recommences the buried fences mark no longer the road oer the plain while through the meadows like fearful shadows slowly passes a funeral train the bell is pealing and every feeling within me responds to the dismal knell shadows are trailing my heart is bewailing and tolling within like a funeral bell to an old danish songbook welcome my old friend welcome to a foreign fireside while the sullen gales of autumn shake the windows the ungrateful world has it seems dealt harshly with thee since beneath the skies of denmark first i met thee there are marks of age there are thumbmarks on thy margin made by hands that clasped thee rudely at the alehouse soiled and dull thou art yellow are thy timeworn pages as the russet rainmolested leaves of autumn thou art stained with wine scattered from hilarious goblets as the leaves with the libations of olympus yet dost thou recall days departed halfforgotten when in dreamy youth i wandered by the baltic when i paused to hear the old ballad of king christian shouted from suburban taverns in the twilight thou recallest bards who in solitary chambers and with hearts by passion wasted wrote thy pages thou recallest homes where thy songs of love and friendship made the gloomy northern winter bright as summer once some ancient scald in his bleak ancestral iceland chanted staves of these old ballads to the vikings once in elsinore at the court of old king hamlet yorick and his boon companions sang these ditties once prince fredericks guard sang them in their smoky barracks suddenly the english cannon joined the chorus peasants in the field sailors on the roaring ocean students tradesmen pale mechanics all have sung them thou hast been their friend they alas have left thee friendless yet at least by one warm fireside art thou welcome and as swallows build in these wide oldfashioned chimneys so thy twittering songs shall nestle in my bosom quiet close and warm sheltered from all molestation and recalling by their voices youth and travel walter von der vogelweid vogelweid the minnesinger when he left this world of ours laid his body in the cloister under wurtzburgs minster towers and he gave the monks his treasures gave them all with this behest they should feed the birds at noontide daily on his place of rest saying from these wandering minstrels i have learned the art of song let me now repay the lessons they have taught so well and long thus the bard of love departed and fulfilling his desire on his tomb the birds were feasted by the children of the choir day by day oer tower and turret in foul weather and in fair day by day in vaster numbers flocked the poets of the air on the tree whose heavy branches overshadowed all the place on the pavement on the tombstone on the poets sculptured face on the crossbars of each window on the lintel of each door they renewed the war of wartburg which the bard had fought before there they sang their merry carols sang their lauds on every side and the name their voices uttered was the name of vogelweid till at length the portly abbot murmured why this waste of food be it changed to loaves henceforward for our tasting brotherhood then in vain oer tower and turret from the walls and woodland nests when the minster bells rang noontide gathered the unwelcome guests then in vain with cries discordant clamorous round the gothic spire screamed the feathered minnesingers for the children of the choir time has long effaced the inscriptions on the cloisters funeral stones and tradition only tells us where repose the poets bones but around the vast cathedral by sweet echoes multiplied still the birds repeat the legend and the name of vogelweid drinking song inscription for an antique pitcher come old friend sit down and listen from the pitcher placed between us how the waters laugh and glisten in the head of old silenus old silenus bloated drunken led by his inebriate satyrs on his breast his head is sunken vacantly he leers and chatters fauns with youthful bacchus follow ivy crowns that brow supernal as the forehead of apollo and possessing youth eternal round about him fair bacchantes bearing cymbals flutes and thyrses wild from naxian groves or zantes vineyards sing delirious verses thus he won through all the nations bloodless

the old clock on the stairs leternite est une pendule dont le balancier dit et redit sans cesse ces deux mots seulement dans le silence des tombeaux toujours jamais jamais toujours jacques bridaine somewhat back from the village street stands the oldfashioned countryseat across its antique portico tall poplartrees their shadows throw and from its station in the hall an ancient timepiece says to all forever never never forever halfway up the stairs it stands and points and beckons with its hands from its case of massive oak like a monk who under his cloak crosses himself and sighs alas with sorrowful voice to all who pass forever never never forever by day its voice is low and light but in the silent dead of night distinct as a passing footsteps fall it echoes along the vacant hall along the ceiling along the floor and seems to say at each chamberdoor forever never never forever through days of sorrow and of mirth through days of death and days of birth through every swift vicissitude of changeful time unchanged it has stood and as if like god it all things saw it calmly repeats those words of awe forever never never forever in that mansion used to be freehearted hospitality his great fires up the chimney roared the stranger feasted at his board but like the skeleton at the feast that warning timepiece never ceased forever never never forever there groups of merry children played there youths and maidens dreaming strayed o precious hours o golden prime and affluence of love and time even as a miser counts his gold those hours the ancient timepiece told forever never never forever from that chamber clothed in white the bride came forth on her wedding night there in that silent room below the dead lay in his shroud of snow and in the hush that followed the prayer was heard the old clock on the stair forever never never forever all are scattered now and fled some are married some are dead and when i ask with throbs of pain ah when shall they all meet again as in the days long since gone by the ancient timepiece makes reply forever never never forever never here forever there where all parting pain and care and death and time shall disappear forever there but never here the horologe of eternity sayeth this incessantly forever never never forever the arrow and the song i shot an arrow into the air it fell to earth i knew not where for so swiftly it flew the sight could not follow it in its flight i breathed a song into the air it fell to earth i knew not where for who has sight so keen and strong that it can follow the flight of song long long afterward in an oak i found the arrow still unbroke and the song from beginning to end i found again in the heart of a friend sonnets mezzo cammin half of my life is gone and i have let the years slip from me and have not fulfilled the aspiration of my youth to build some tower of song with lofty parapet not indolence nor pleasure nor the fret of restless passions chat would not be stilled but sorrow and a care that almost killed kept me from what i may accomplish yet though half way up the hill i see the past lying beneath me with its sounds and sights a city in the twilight dim and vast with smoking roofs soft bells and gleaming lights and hear above me on the autumnal blast the cataract of death far thundering from the heights the evening star lo in the painted oriel of the west whose panes the sunken sun incarnadines like a fair lady at her casement shines the evening star the star of love and rest and then anon she doth herself divest of all her radiant garments and reclines behind the sombre screen of yonder pines with slumber and soft dreams of love oppressed o my beloved my sweet hesperus my morning and my evening star of love my best and gentlest lady even thus as that fair planet in the sky above dost thou retire unto thy rest at night and from thy darkened window fades the light autumn thou comest autumn heralded by the rain with banners by great gales incessant fanned brighter than brightest silks of samarcand and stately oxen harnessed to thy wain thou standest like imperial charlemagne upon thy bridge of gold thy royal hand outstretched with benedictions oer the land blessing the farms through all thy vast domain thy shield is the red harvest moon suspended so long beneath the heavens oerhanging eaves thy steps are by the farmers prayers attended like flames upon an altar shine the sheaves and following thee in thy ovation splendid thine almoner the wind scatters the golden leaves dante tuscan that wanderest through the realms of gloom with thoughtful pace and sad majestic eyes stern thoughts and awful from thy soul arise like farinata from his fiery tomb thy sacred song is like the trump of doom yet in thy heart what human sympathies what soft compassion glows as in the skies the tender stars their clouded lamps relume methinks i see thee stand with pallid cheeks by fra hilario in his diocese as up the conventwalls in golden streaks the ascending sunbeams mark the days decrease and as he asks what there the stranger seeks thy voice along the cloister whispers peace curfew i solemnly mournfully dealing its dole the curfew bell is beginning to toll cover the embers and put out the light toil comes with the morning and rest with the night dark grow the windows and quenched is the fire sound fades into silence all footsteps retire no voice in the chambers no sound in the hall sleep and oblivion reign over all ii the book is completed and closed like the day and the hand that has written it lays it away dim grow its fancies forgotten they lie like coals in the ashes they darken and die song sinks into silence the story is told the windows are darkened the hearthstone is cold darker and darker the black shadows fall sleep and oblivion reign over all evangeline a tale of acadie this is the forest primeval the murmuring pines and the hemlocks bearded with moss and in garments green indistinct in the twilight stand like druids of eld with voices sad and prophetic stand like harpers hoar with beards that rest on their bosoms loud from its rocky caverns the deepvoiced neighboring ocean speaks and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest this is the forest primeval but where are the hearts that beneath it leaped like the roe when he hears in the woodland the voice of the huntsman where is the thatchroofed village the home of acadian farmers men whose lives glided on like rivers that water the woodlands darkened by shadows of earth but reflecting an image of heaven waste are those pleasant farms and the farmers forever departed scattered like dust and leaves when the mighty blasts of october seize them and whirl them aloft and sprinkle them far oer the ocean naught but tradition remains of the beautiful village of grandpre ye who believe in affection that hopes and endures and is patient ye who believe in the beauty and strength of womans devotion list to the mournful tradition still sung by the pines of the forest list to a tale of love in acadie home of the happy part the first i in the acadian land on the shores of the basin of minas distant secluded still the little village of grandpre lay in the fruitful valley vast meadows stretched to the eastward giving the village its name and pasture to flocks without number dikes that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant shut out the turbulent tides but at stated seasons the floodgates opened and welcomed the sea to wander at will oer the meadows west and south there were fields of flax and orchards and cornfields spreading afar and unfenced oer the plain and away to the northward blomidon rose and the forests old and aloft on the mountains seafogs pitched their tents and mists from the mighty atlantic looked on the happy valley but neer from their station descended there in the midst of its farms reposed the acadian village strongly built were the houses with frames of oak and of hemlock such as the peasants of normandy built in the reign of the henries thatched were the roofs with dormerwindows and gables projecting over the basement below protected and shaded the doorway there in the tranquil evenings of summer when brightly the sunset lighted the village street and gilded the vanes on the chimneys matrons and maidens sat in snowwhite caps and in kirtles scarlet and blue and green with distaffs spinning the golden flax for the gossiping looms whose noisy shuttles within doors mingled their sound with the whir of the wheels and the songs of the maidens solemnly down the street came the parish priest and the children paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless them reverend walked he among them and up rose matrons and maidens hailing his slow approach with words of affectionate welcome then came the laborers home from the field and serenely the sun sank down to his rest and twilight prevailed anon from the belfry softly the angelus sounded and over the roofs of the village columns of pale blue smoke like clouds of incense ascending rose from a hundred hearths the homes of peace and contentment thus dwelt together in love these simple acadian farmers dwelt in the love of god and of man alike were they free from fear that reigns with the tyrant and envy the vice of republics neither locks had they to their doors nor bars to their windows but their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of their owners there the richest was poor and the poorest lived in abundance somewhat apart from the village and nearer the basin of minas benedict bellefontaine the wealthiest farmer of grandpre dwelt on his goodly acres and with him directing his household gentle evangeline lived his child and the pride of the village stalworth and stately in form was the man of seventy winters hearty and hale was he an oak that is covered with snowflakes white as the snow were his locks and his cheeks as brown as the oakleaves fair was she to behold that maiden of seventeen summers black were her eyes as the berry that grows on the thorn by the wayside black yet how softly they gleamed beneath the brown shade of her tresses sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that feed in the meadows when in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noontide flagons of homebrewed ale ah fair in sooth was the maiden fairer was she when on sunday morn while the bell from its turret sprinkled with holy sounds the air as the priest with his hyssop sprinkles the congregation and scatters blessings upon them down the long street she passed with her chaplet of beads and her missal wearing her norman cap and her kirtle of blue and the earrings brought in the olden time from france and since as an heirloom handed down from mother to child through long generations but a celestial brightness a more ethereal beauty shone on her face and encircled her form when after confession homeward serenely she walked with gods benediction upon her when she had passed it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music firmly builded with rafters of oak the house of the farmer stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea and a shady sycamore grew by the door with a woodbine wreathing around it rudely carved was the porch with seats beneath and a footpath led through an orchard wide and disappeared in the meadow under the sycamoretree were hives overhung by a penthouse such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside built oer a box for the poor or the blessed image of mary farther down on the slope of the hill was the well with its mossgrown bucket fastened with iron and near it a trough for the horses shielding the house from storms on the north were the barns and the farmyard there stood the broadwheeled wains and the antique ploughs and the harrows there were the folds for the sheep and there in his feathered seraglio strutted the lordly turkey and crowed the cock with the selfsame voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent peter bursting with hay were the barns themselves a village in each one far oer the gable projected a roof of thatch and a staircase under the sheltering eaves led up to the odorous cornloft there too the dovecot stood with its meek and innocent inmates murmuring ever of love while above in the variant breezes numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation thus at peace with god and the world the farmer of grandpre lived on his sunny farm and evangeline governed his household many a youth as he knelt in the church and opened his missal fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment many a suitor came to her door by the darkness befriended and as he knocked and waited to hear the sound of her footsteps knew not which beat the louder his heart or the knocker of iron or at the joyous feast of the patron saint of the village bolder grew and pressed her hand in the dance as he whispered hurried words of love that seemed a part of the music but among all who came young gabriel only was welcome gabriel lajeunesse the son of basil the blacksmith who was a mighty man in the village and honored of all men for since the birth of time throughout all ages and nations has the craft of the smith been held in repute by the people basil was benedicts friend their children from earliest childhood grew up together as brother and sister and father felician priest and pedagogue both in the village had taught them their letters out of the selfsame book with the hymns of the church and the plainsong but when the hymn was sung and the daily lesson completed swiftly they hurried away to the forge of basil the blacksmith there at the door they stood with wondering eyes to behold him take in his leathern lap the hoof of the horse as a plaything nailing the shoe in its place while near him the tire of the cartwheel lay like a fiery snake coiled round in a circle of cinders oft on autumnal eves when without in the gathering darkness bursting with light seemed the smithy through every cranny and crevice warm by the forge within they watched the laboring bellows and as its panting ceased and the sparks expired in the ashes merrily laughed and said they were nuns going into the chapel oft on sledges in winter as swift as the swoop of the eagle down the hillside hounding they glided away oer the meadow oft in the barns they climbed to the populous nests on the rafters seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone which the swallow brings from the shore of the sea to restore the sight of its fledglings lucky was he who found that stone in the nest of the swallow thus passed a few swift years and they no longer were children he was a valiant youth and his face like the face of the morning gladdened the earth with its light and ripened thought into action she was a woman now with the heart and hopes of a woman sunshine of saint eulalie was she called for that was the sunshine which as the farmers believed would load their orchards with apples she too would bring to her husbands house delight and abundance filling it full of love and the ruddy faces of children ii now had the season returned when the nights grow colder and longer and the retreating sun the sign of the scorpion enters birds of passage sailed through the leaden air from the icebound desolate northern bays to the shores of tropical islands harvests were gathered in and wild with the winds of september wrestled the trees of the forest as jacob of old with the angel all the signs foretold a winter long and inclement bees with prophetic instinct of want had hoarded their honey till the hives overflowed and the indian bunters asserted cold would the winter be for thick was the fur of the foxes such was the advent of autumn then followed that beautiful season called by the pious acadian peasants the summer of allsaints filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light and the landscape lay as if newcreated in all the freshness of childhood peace seemed to reign upon earth and the restless heart of the ocean was for a moment consoled all sounds were in harmony blended voices of children at play the crowing of cocks in the farmyards whir of wings in the drowsy air and the cooing of pigeons all were subdued and low as the murmurs of love and the great sun looked with the eye of love through the golden vapors around him while arrayed in its robes of russet and scarlet and yellow bright with the sheen of the dew each glittering tree of the forest flashed like the planetree the persian adorned with mantles and jewels now recommenced the reign of rest and affection and stillness day with its burden and heat had departed and twilight descending brought back the evening star to the sky and the herds to the homestead pawing the ground they came and resting their necks on each other and with their nostrils distended inhaling the freshness of evening foremost bearing the bell evangelines beautiful heifer proud of her snowwhite hide and the ribbon that waved from her collar quietly paced and slow as if conscious of human affection then came the shepherd back with his bleating flocks from the seaside where was their favorite pasture behind them followed the watchdog patient full of importance and grand in the pride of his instinct walking from side to side with a lordly air and superbly waving his bushy tail and urging forward the stragglers regent of flocks was he when the shepherd slept their protector when from the forest at night through the starry silence the wolves howled late with the rising moon returned the wains from the marshes laden with briny hay that filled the air with its odor cheerily neighed the steeds with dew on their manes and their fetlocks while aloft on their shoulders the wooden and ponderous saddles painted with brilliant dyes and adorned with tassels of crimson nodded in bright array like hollyhocks heavy with blossoms patiently stood the cows meanwhile and yielded their udders unto the milkmaids hand whilst loud and in regular cadence into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets descended lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were heard in the farmyard echoed back by the barns anon they sank into stillness heavily closed with a jarring sound the valves of the barndoors rattled the wooden bars and all for a season was silent indoors warm by the widemouthed fireplace idly the farmer sat in his elbowchair and watched how the flames and the smokewreaths struggled together like foes in a burning city behind him nodding and mocking along the wall with gestures fantastic darted his own huge shadow and vanished away into darkness faces clumsily carved in oak on the back of his armchair laughed in the flickering light and the pewter plates on the dresser caught and reflected the flame as shields of armies the sunshine fragments of song the old man sang and carols of christmas such as at home in the olden time his fathers before him sang in their norman orchards and bright burgundian vineyards close at her fathers side was the gentle evangeline seated spinning flax for the loom that stood in the corner behind her silent awhile were its treadles at rest was its diligent shuttle while the monotonous drone of the wheel like the drone of a bagpipe followed the old mans songs and united the fragments together as in a church when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases footfalls are heard in the aisles or words of the priest at the altar so in each pause of the song with measured motion the clock clicked thus as they sat there were footsteps heard and suddenly lifted sounded the wooden latch and the door swung back on its hinges benedict knew by the hobnailed shoes it was basil the blacksmith and by her beating heart evangeline knew who was with him welcome the farmer exclaimed as their footsteps paused on the threshold welcome basil my friend come take thy place on the settle close by the chimneyside which is always empty without thee take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco never so much thyself art thou as when through the curling smoke of the pipe or the forge thy friendly and jovial face gleams round and red as the harvest moon through the mist of the marshes then with a smile of content thus answered basil the blacksmith taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside benedict bellefontaine thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad ever in cheerfullest mood art thou when others are filled with gloomy forebodings of ill and see only ruin before them happy art thou as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe pausing a moment to take the pipe that evangeline brought him and with a coal from the embers had lighted he slowly continued four days now are passed since the english ships at their anchors ride in the gaspereaus mouth with their cannon pointed against us what their design may be is unknown but all are commanded on the morrow to meet in the church where his majestys mandate will be proclaimed as law in the land alas in the mean time many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the people then made answer the farmer perhaps some friendlier purpose brings these ships to our shores perhaps the harvests in england by untimely rains or untimelier heat have been blighted and from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children not so thinketh the folk in the village said warmly the blacksmith shaking his head as in doubt then heaving a sigh he continued louisburg is not forgotten nor beau sejour nor port royal many already have fled to the forest and lurk on its outskirts waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of tomorrow arms have been taken from us and warlike weapons of all kinds nothing is left but the blacksmiths sledge and the scythe of the mower then with a pleasant smile made answer the jovial farmer safer are we unarmed in the midst of our flocks and our cornfields safer within these peaceful dikes besieged by the ocean than our fathers in forts besieged by the enemys cannon fear no evil my friend and tonight may no shadow of sorrow fall on this house and hearth for this is the night of the contract built are the house and the barn the merry lads of the village strongly have built them and well and breaking the glebe round about them filled the barn with hay and the house with food for a twelvemonth rene leblanc will be here anon with his papers and inkhorn shall we not then be glad and rejoice in the joy of our children as apart by the window she stood with her hand in her lovers blushing evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken and as they died on his lips the worthy notary entered iii bent like a laboring oar that toils in the surf of the ocean bent but not broken by age was the form of the notary public shocks of yellow hair like the silken floss of the maize hung over his shoulders his forehead was high and glasses with horn bows sat astride on his nose with a look of wisdom supernal father of twenty children was he and more than a hundred childrens children rode on his knee and heard his great watch tick four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive suffering much in an old french fort as the friend of the english now though warier grown without all guile or suspicion ripe in wisdom was he but patient and simple and childlike he was beloved by all and most of all by the children for he told them tales of the loupgarou in the forest and of the goblin that came in the night to water the horses and of the white letiche the ghost of a child who unchristened died and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of children and how on christmas eve the oxen talked in the stable and how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell and of the marvellous powers of fourleaved clover and horseshoes with whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village then up rose from his seat by the fireside basil the blacksmith knocked from his pipe the ashes and slowly extending his right hand father leblanc he exclaimed thou hast heard the talk in the village and perchance canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public gossip enough have i heard in sooth yet am never the wiser and what their errand may be i know not better than others yet am i not of those who imagine some evil intention brings them here for we are at peace and why then molest us gods name shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith must we in all things look for the how and the why and the wherefore daily injustice is done and might is the right of the strongest but without heeding his warmth continued the notary public man is unjust but god is just and finally justice triumphs and well i remember a story that often consoled me when as a captive i lay in the old french fort at port royal this was the old mans favorite tale and he loved to repeat it when his neighbors complained that any injustice was done them once in an ancient city whose name i no longer remember raised aloft on a column a brazen statue of justice stood in the public square upholding the scales in its left hand and in its right a sword as an emblem that justice presided over the laws of the land and the hearts and homes of the people even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them but in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted might took the place of right and the weak were oppressed and the mighty ruled with an iron rod then it chanced in a noblemans palace that a necklace of pearls was lost and erelong a suspicion fell on an orphan girl who lived as maid in the household she after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of justice as to her father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended lo oer the city a tempest rose and the bolts of the thunder smote the statue of bronze and hurled in wrath from its left hand down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance and in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie into whose claybuilt walls the necklace of pearls was inwoven silenced but not convinced when the story was ended the blacksmith stood like a man who fain would speak but findeth no language all his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face as the vapors freeze in fantastic shapes on the windowpanes in the winter then evangeline lighted the brazen lamp on the table filled till it overflowed the pewter tankard with homebrewed nutbrown ale that was famed for its strength in the village of grandpre while from his pocket the notary drew his papers and inkhorn wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle orderly all things proceeded and duly and well were completed and the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table three times the old mans fee in solid pieces of silver and the notary rising and blessing the bride and the bridegroom lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare wiping the foam from his lip he solemnly bowed and departed while in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside till evangeline brought the draughtboard out of its corner soon was the game begun in friendly contention the old men laughed at each lucky hit or unsuccessful manoeuver laughed when a man was crowned or a breach was made in the kingrow meanwhile apart in the twilight gloom of a windows embrasure sat the lovers and whispered together beholding the moon rise over the pallid sea and the silvery mist of the meadows silently one by one in the infinite meadows of heaven blossomed the lovely stars the forgetmenots of the angels thus was the evening passed anon the bell from the belfry rang out the hour of nine the village curfew and straightway rose the guests and departed and silence reigned in the household many a farewell word and sweet goodnight on the doorstep lingered long in evangelines heart and filled it with gladness carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearthstone and on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer soon with a soundless step the foot of evangeline followed up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden silent she passed the hall and entered the door of her chamber simple that chamber was with its curtains of white and its clothespress ample and high on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded linen and woollen stuffs by the hand of evangeline woven this was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage better than flocks and herds being proofs of her skill as a housewife soon she extinguished her lamp for the mellow and radiant moonlight streamed through the windows and lighted the room till the heart of the maiden swelled and obeyed its power like the tremulous tides of the ocean ah she was fair exceeding fair to behold as she stood with naked snowwhite feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber little she dreamed that below among the trees of the orchard waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow yet were her thoughts of him and at times a feeling of sadness passed oer her soul as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment and as she gazed from the window she saw serenely the moon pass forth from the folds of a cloud and one star follow her footsteps as out of abrahams tent young ishmael wandered with hagar iv pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the village of grandpre pleasantly gleamed in the soft sweet air the basin of minas where the ships with their wavering shadows were riding at anchor life had long been astir in the village and clamorous labor knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning now from the country around from the farms and neighboring hamlets came in their holiday dresses the blithe acadian peasants many a glad goodmorrow and jocund laugh from the young folk made the bright air brighter as up from the numerous meadows where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward group after group appeared and joined or passed on the highway long ere noon in the village all sounds of labor were silenced thronged were the streets with people and noisy groups at the housedoors sat in the cheerful sun and rejoiced and gossiped together every house was an inn where all were welcomed and feasted for with this simple people who lived like brothers together all things were held in common and what one had was anothers yet under benedicts roof hospitality seemed more abundant for evangeline stood among the guests of her father bright was her face with smiles and words of welcome and gladness fell from her beautiful lips and blessed the cup as she gave it under the open sky in the odorous air of the orchard stript of its golden fruit was spread the feast of betrothal there in the shade of the porch were the priest and the notary seated there good benedict sat and sturdy basil the blacksmith not far withdrawn from these by the ciderpress and the beehives michael the fiddler was placed with the gayest of hearts and of waistcoats shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snowwhite hair as it waved in the wind and the jolly face of the fiddler glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers gayly the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle tous les bourgeois de chartres and le carillon de dunkerque and anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music merrily merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances under the orchardtrees and down the path to the meadows old folk and young together and children mingled among them fairest of all the maids was evangeline benedicts daughter noblest of all the youths was gabriel son of the blacksmith so passed the morning away and lo with a summons sonorous sounded the bell from its tower and over the meadows a drum beat thronged erelong was the church with men without in the churchyard waited the women they stood by the graves and hung on the headstones garlands of autumnleaves and evergreens fresh from the forest then came the guard from the ships and marching proudly among them entered the sacred portal with loud and dissonant clangor echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement echoed a moment only and slowly the ponderous portal closed and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers then uprose their commander and spoke from the steps of the altar holding aloft in his hands with its seals the royal commission you are convened this day he said by his majestys orders clement and kind has he been but how you have answered his kindness let your own hearts reply to my natural make and my temper painful the task is i do which to you i know must be grievous yet must i bow and obey and deliver the will of our monarch namely that all your lands and dwellings and cattle of all kinds forfeited be to the crown and that you yourselves from this province be transported to other lands god grant you may dwell there ever as faithful subjects a happy and peaceable people prisoners now i declare you for such is his majestys pleasure as when the air is serene in the sultry solstice of summer suddenly gathers a storm and the deadly sling of the hailstones beats down the farmers corn in the field and shatters his windows hiding the sun and strewing the ground with thatch from the houseroofs bellowing fly the herds and seek to break their enclosures so on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder and then rose louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger and by one impulse moved they madly rushed to the doorway vain was the hope of escape and cries and fierce imprecations rang through the house of prayer and high oer the heads of the others rose with his arms uplifted the figure of basil the blacksmith as on a stormy sea a spar is tossed by the billows flushed was his face and distorted with passion and wildly he shouted down with the tyrants of england we never have sworn them allegiance death to these foreign soldiers who seize on our homes and our harvests more he fain would have said but the merciless hand of a soldier smote him upon the mouth and dragged him down to the pavement in the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention lo the door of the chancel opened and father felician entered with serious mien and ascended the steps of the altar raising his reverend hand with a gesture he awed into silence all that clamorous throng and thus he spake to his people deep were his tones and solemn in accents measured and mournful spake he as after the tocsins alarum distinctly the clock strikes what is this that ye do my children what madness has seized you forty years of my life have i labored among you and taught you not in word alone but in deed to love one another is this the fruit of my toils of my vigils and prayers and privations have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness this is the house of the prince of peace and would you profane it thus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred lo where the crucified christ from his cross is gazing upon you see in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion hark how those lips still repeat the prayer o father forgive them let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us let us repeat it now and say o father forgive them few were his words of rebuke but deep in the hearts of his people sank they and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak while they repeated his prayer and said o father forgive them then came the evening service the tapers gleamed from the altar fervent and deep was the voice of the priest and the people responded not with their lips alone but their hearts and the ave maria sang they and fell on their knees and their souls with devotion translated rose on the ardor of prayer like elijah ascending to heaven meanwhile had spread in the village the tidings of ill and on all sides wandered wailing from house to house the women and children long at her fathers door evangeline stood with her right hand shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun that descending lighted the village street with mysterious splendor and roofed each peasants cottage with golden thatch and emblazoned its windows long within had been spread the snowwhite cloth on the table there stood the wheaten loaf and the honey fragrant with wildflowers there stood the tankard of ale and the cheese fresh brought from the dairy and at the head of the board the great armchair of the farmer thus did evangeline wait at her fathers door as the sunset threw the long shadows of trees oer the broad ambrosial meadows ah on her spirit within a deeper shadow had fallen and from the fields of her soul a fragrance celestial ascended charity meekness love and hope and forgiveness and patience then allforgetful of self she wandered into the village cheering with looks and words the mournful hearts of the women as oer the darkening fields with lingering steps they departed urged by their household cares and the weary feet of their children down sank the great red sun and in golden glimmering vapors veiled the light of his face like the prophet descending from sinai sweetly over the village the bell of the angelus sounded meanwhile amid the gloom by the church evangeline lingered all was silent within and in vain at the door and the windows stood she and listened and looked till overcome by emotion gabriel cried she aloud with tremulous voice but no answer came from the graves of the dead nor the gloomier grave of the living slowly at length she returned to the tenantless house of her father smouldered the fire on the hearth on the board was the supper untasted empty and drear was each room and haunted with phantoms of terror sadly echoed her step on the stair and the floor of her chamber in the dead of the night she heard the disconsolate rain fall loud on the withered leaves of the sycamoretree by the window keenly the lightning flashed and the voice of the echoing thunder told her that god was in heaven and governed the world he created then she remembered the tale she had heard of the justice of heaven soothed was her troubled soul and she peacefully slumbered till morning v four times the sun had risen and set and now on the fifth day cheerily called the cock to the sleeping maids of the farmhouse soon oer the yellow fields in silent and mournful procession came from the neighboring hamlets and farms the acadian women driving in ponderous wains their household goods to the seashore pausing and looking back to gaze once more on their dwellings ere they were shut from sight by the winding road and the woodland close at their sides their children ran and urged on the oxen while in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings thus to the gaspereaus mouth they hurried and there on the seabeach piled in confusion lay the household goods of the peasants all day long between the shore and the ships did the boats ply all day long the wains came laboring down from the village late in the afternoon when the sun was near to his setting echoed far oer the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard thither the women and children thronged on a sudden the churchdoors opened and forth came the guard and marching in gloomy procession followed the longimprisoned but patient acadian farmers even as pilgrims who journey afar from their homes and their country sing as they go and in singing forget they are weary and wayworn so with songs on their lips the acadian peasants descended down from the church to the shore amid their wives and their daughters foremost the young men came and raising together their voices sang with tremulous lips a chant of the catholic missions sacred heart of the saviour o inexhaustible fountain fill our hearts this day with strength and submission and patience then the old men as they marched and the women that stood by the wayside joined in the sacred psalm and the birds in the sunshine above them mingled their notes therewith like voices of spirits departed halfway down to the shore evangeline waited in silence not overcome with grief but strong in the hour of affliction calmly and sadly she waited until the procession approached her and she beheld the face of gabriel pale with emotion team then filled her eyes and eagerly running to meet him clasped she his hands and laid her head on his shoulder and whispered gabriel be of good cheer for if we love one another nothing in truth can harm us whatever mischances may happen smiling she spake these words then suddenly paused for her father saw she slowly advancing alas how changed was his aspect gone was the glow from his cheek and the fire from his eye and his footstep heavier seemed with the weight of the heavy heart in his bosom but with a smile and a sigh she clasped his neck and embraced him speaking words of endearment where words of comfort availed not thus to the gaspereaus mouth moved on that mournful procession there disorder prevailed and the tumult and stir of embarking busily plied the freighted boats and in the confusion wives were torn from their husbands and mothers too late saw their children left on the land extending their arms with wildest entreaties so unto separate ships were basil and gabriel carried while in despair on the shore evangeline stood with her father half the task was not done when the sun went down and the twilight deepened and darkened around and in haste the refluent ocean fled away from the shore and left the line of the sandbeach covered with waifs of the tide with kelp and the slippery seaweed farther back in the midst of the household goods and the wagons like to a gypsy camp or a leaguer after a battle all escape cut off by the sea and the sentinels near them lay encamped for the night the houseless acadian farmers back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles and leaving inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors then as the night descended the herds returned from their pastures sweet was the moist still air with the odor of milk from their udders lowing they waited and long at the wellknown bars of the farmyard waited and looked in vain for the voice and the hand of the milkmaid silence reigned in the streets from the church no angelus sounded rose no smoke from the roofs and gleamed no lights from the windows but on the shores meanwhile the evening fires had been kindled built of the driftwood thrown on the sands from wrecks in the tempest round them shapes of gloom and sorrowful faces were gathered voices of women were heard and of men and the crying of children onward from fire to fire as from hearth to hearth in his parish wandered the faithful priest consoling and blessing and cheering like unto shipwrecked paul on melitas desolate seashore thus he approached the place where evangeline sat with her father and in the flickering light beheld the face of the old man haggard and hollow and wan and without either thought or emotion een as the face of a clock from which the hands have been taken vainly evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him vainly offered him food yet he moved not he looked not he spake not but with a vacant stare ever gazed at the flickering firelight benedicite murmured the priest in tones of compassion more he fain would have said but his heart was full and his accents faltered and paused on his lips as the feet of a child on a threshold hushed by the scene he beholds and the awful presence of sorrow silently therefore he laid his hand on the head of the maiden raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them moved on their way unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals then sat he down at her side and they wept together in silence suddenly rose from the south a light as in autumn the bloodred moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven and oer the horizon titanlike stretches its hundred hands upon mountain and meadow seizing the rocks and the rivers and piling huge shadows together broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village gleamed on the sky and the sea and the ships that lay in the roadstead columns of shining smoke uprose and flashes of flame were thrust through their folds and withdrawn like the quivering hands of a martyr then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch and uplifting whirled them aloft through the air at once from a hundred housetops started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled these things beheld in dismay the crowd on the shore and on shipboard speechless at first they stood then cried aloud in their anguish we shall behold no more our homes in the village of grandpre loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farmyards thinking the day had dawned and anon the lowing of cattle came on the evening breeze by the barking of dogs interrupted then rose a sound of dread such as startles the sleeping encampments far in the western prairies or forests that skirt the nebraska when the wild horses affrighted sweep by with the speed of the whirlwind or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush to the river such was the sound that arose on the night as the herds and the horses broke through their folds and fences and madly rushed oer the meadows overwhelmed with the sight yet speechless the priest and the maiden gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and widened before them and as they turned at length to speak to their silent companion lo from his seat he had fallen and stretched abroad on the seashore motionless lay his form from which the soul had departed slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head and the maiden knelt at her fathers side and wailed aloud in her terror then in a swoon she sank and lay with her head on his bosom through the long night she lay in deep oblivious slumber and when she woke from the trance she beheld a multitude near her faces of friends she beheld that were mournfully gazing upon her pallid with tearful eyes and looks of saddest compassion still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape reddened the sky overhead and gleamed on the faces around her and like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses then a familiar voice she heard as it said to the people let us bury him here by the sea when a happier season brings us again to our homes from the unknown land of our exile then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the churchyard such were the words of the priest and there in haste by the seaside having the glare of the burning village for funeral torches but without bell or book they buried the farmer of grandpre and as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow lo with a mournful sound like the voice of a vast congregation solemnly answered the sea and mingled its roar with the dirges t was the returning tide that afar from the waste of the ocean with the first dawn of the day came heaving and hurrying landward then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking and with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor leaving behind them the dead on the shore and the village in ruins part the second i many a weary year had passed since the burning of grandpre when on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed bearing a nation with all its household gods into exile exile without an end and without an example in story far asunder on separate coasts the acadians landed scattered were they like flakes of snow when the wind from the northeast strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the banks of newfoundland friendless homeless hopeless they wandered from city to city from the cold lakes of the north to sultry southern savannas from the bleak shores of the sea to the lands where the father of waters seizes the hills in his hands and drags them down to the ocean deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones of the mammoth friends they sought and homes and many despairing heartbroken asked of the earth but a grave and no longer a friend nor a fireside written their history stands on tablets of stone in the churchyards long among them was seen a maiden who waited and wandered lowly and meek in spirit and patiently suffering all things fair was she and young but alas before her extended dreary and vast and silent the desert of life with its pathway marked by the graves of those who had sorrowed and suffered before her passions long extinguished and hopes long dead and abandoned as the emigrants way oer the western desert is marked by campfires long consumed and bones that bleach in the sunshine something there was in her life incomplete imperfect unfinished as if a morning of june with all its music and sunshine suddenly paused in the sky and fading slowly descended into the east again from whence it late had arisen sometimes she lingered in towns till urged by the fever within her urged by a restless longing the hunger and thirst of the spirit she would commence again her endless search and endeavor sometimes in churchyards strayed and gazed on the crosses and tombstones sat by some nameless grave and thought that perhaps in its bosom he was already at rest and she longed to slumber beside him sometimes a rumor a hearsay an inarticulate whisper came with its airy hand to point and beckon her forward sometimes she spake with those who had seen her beloved and known him but it was long ago in some faroff place or forgotten gabriel lajeunesse they said yes we have seen him he was with basil the blacksmith and both have gone to the prairies coureursdesbois are they and famous hunters and trappers gabriel lajeunesse said others o yes we have seen him he is a voyageur in the lowlands of louisiana then would they say dear child why dream and wait for him longer are there not other youths as fair as gabriel others who have hearts as tender and true and spirits as loyal here is baptiste leblanc the notarys son who has loved thee many a tedious year come give him thy hand and be happy thou art too fair to be left to braid st catherines tresses then would evangeline answer serenely but sadly i cannot whither my heart has gone there follows my hand and not elsewhere for when the heart goes before like a lamp and illumines the pathway many things are made clear that else lie hidden in darkness thereupon the priest her friend and fatherconfessor said with a smile o daughter thy god thus speaketh within thee talk not of wasted affection affection never was wasted if it enrich not the heart of another its waters returning back to their springs like the rain shall fill them full of refreshment that which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain patience accomplish thy labor accomplish thy work of affection sorrow and silence are strong and patient endurance is godlike therefore accomplish thy labor of love till the heart is made godlike purified strengthened perfected and rendered more worthy of heaven cheered by the good mans words evangeline labored and waited still in her heart she heard the funeral dirge of the ocean but with its sound there was mingled a voice that whispered despair not thus did that poor soul wander in want and cheerless discomfort bleeding barefooted over the shards and thorns of existence let me essay o muse to follow the wanderers footsteps not through each devious path each changeful year of existence but as a traveller follows a streamlets course through the valley far from its margin at times and seeing the gleam of its water here and there in some open space and at intervals only then drawing nearer its banks through sylvan glooms that conceal it though he behold it not he can hear its continuous murmur happy at length if he find the spot where it reaches an outlet ii it was the month of may far down the beautiful river past the ohio shore and past the mouth of the wabash into the golden stream of the broad and swift mississippi floated a cumbrous boat that was rowed by acadian boatmen it was a band of exiles a raft as it were from the shipwrecked nation scattered along the coast now floating together bound by the bonds of a common belief and a common misfortune men and women and children who guided by hope or by hearsay sought for their kith and their kin among the fewacred farmers on the acadian coast and the prairies of fair opelousas with them evangeline went and her guide the father felician onward oer sunken sands through a wilderness sombre with forests day after day they glided adown the turbulent river night after night by their blazing fires encamped on its borders now through rushing chutes among green islands where plumelike cottontrees nodded their shadowy crests they swept with the current then emerged into broad lagoons where silvery sandbars lay in the stream and along the wimpling waves of their margin shining with snowwhite plumes large flocks of pelicans waded level the landscape grew and along the shores of the river shaded by chinatrees in the midst of luxuriant gardens stood the houses of planters with negrocabins and dovecots they were approaching the region where reigns perpetual summer where through the golden coast and groves of orange and citron sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward they too swerved from their course and entering the bayou of plaquemine soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters which like a network of steel extended in every direction over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress met in a dusky arch and trailing mosses in midair waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals deathlike the silence seemed and unbroken save by the herons home to their roasts in the cedartrees returning at sunset or by the owl as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin dreamlike and indistinct and strange were all things around them and oer their spirits there came a feeling of wonder and sadness strange forebodings of ill unseen and that cannot be compassed as at the tramp of a horses hoof on the turf of the prairies far in advance are closed the leaves of the shrinking mimosa so at the hoofbeats of fate with sad forebodings of evil shrinks and closes the heart ere the stroke of doom has attained it but evangelines heart was sustained by a vision that faintly floated before her eyes and beckoned her on through the moonlight it was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom through those shadowy aisles had gabriel wandered before her and every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer then in his place at the prow of the boat rose one of the oarsmen and as a signal sound if others like them peradventure sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams blew a blast on his bugle wild through the dark colonnades and corridors leafy the blast rang breaking the seal of silence and giving tongues to the forest soundless above them the banners of moss just stirred to the music multitudinous echoes awoke and died in the distance over the watery floor and beneath the reverberant branches but not a voice replied no answer came from the darkness and when the echoes had ceased like a sense of pain was the silence then evangeline slept but the boatmen rowed through the midnight silent at times then singing familiar canadian boatsongs such as they sang of old on their own acadian rivers while through the night were heard the mysterious sounds of the desert far off indistinct as of wave or wind in the forest mixed with the whoop of the crane and the roar of the grim alligator thus ere another noon they emerged from the shades and before them lay in the golden sun the lakes of the atchafalaya waterlilies in myriads rocked on the slight undulations made by the passing oars and resplendent in beauty the lotus lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen faint was the air with the odorous breath of magnolia blossoms and with the heat of noon and numberless sylvan islands fragrant and thickly embowered with blossoming hedges of roses near to whose shores they glided along invited to slumber soon by the fairest of these their weary oars were suspended under the boughs of wachita willows that grew by the margin safely their boat was moored and scattered about on the greensward tired with their midnight toil the weary travellers slumbered over them vast and high extended the cope of a cedar swinging from its great arms the trumpetflower and the grapevine hung their ladder of ropes aloft like the ladder of jacob on whose pendulous stairs the angels ascending descending were the swift hummingbirds that flitted from blossom to blossom such was the vision evangeline saw as she slumbered beneath it filled was her heart with love and the dawn of an opening heaven lighted her soul in sleep with the glory of regions celestial nearer ever nearer among the numberless islands darted a light swift boat that sped away oer the water urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers northward its prow was turned to the land of the bison and beaver at the helm sat a youth with countenance thoughtful and careworn dark and neglected locks overshadowed his brow and a sadness somewhat beyond his years on his face was legibly written gabriel was it who weary with waiting unhappy and restless sought in the western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow swiftly they glided along close under the lee of the island but by the opposite bank and behind a screen of palmettos so that they saw not the boat where it lay concealed in the willows all undisturbed by the dash of their oars and unseen were the sleepers angel of god was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden swiftly they glided away like the shade of a cloud on the prairie after the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance as from a magic trance the sleepers awoke and the maiden said with a sigh to the friendly priest o father felician something says in my heart that near me gabriel wanders is it a foolish dream an idle and vague superstition or has an angel passed and revealed the truth to my spirit then with a blush she added alas for my credulous fancy unto ears like thine such words as these have no meaning but made answer the reverend man and he smiled as he answered daughter thy words are not idle nor are they to me without meaning feeling is deep and still and the word that floats on the surface is as the tossing buoy that betrays where the anchor is hidden therefore trust to thy heart and to what the world calls illusions gabriel truly is near thee for not far away to the southward on the banks of the teche are the towns of st maur and st martin there the longwandering bride shall be given again to her bridegroom there the longabsent pastor regain his flock and his sheepfold beautiful is the land with its prairies and forests of fruittrees under the feet a garden of flowers and the bluest of heavens bending above and resting its dome on the walls of the forest they who dwell there have named it the eden of louisiana with these words of cheer they arose and continued their journey softly the evening came the sun from the western horizon like a magician extended his golden wand oer the landscape twinkling vapors arose and sky and water and forest seemed all on fire at the touch and melted and mingled together hanging between two skies a cloud with edges of silver floated the boat with its dripping oars on the motionless water filled was evangelines heart with inexpressible sweetness touched by the magic spell the sacred fountains of feeling glowed with the light of love as the skies and waters around her then from a neighboring thicket the mockingbird wildest of singers swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung oer the water shook from his little throat such floods of delirious music that the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen plaintive at first were the tones and sad then soaring to madness seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied bacchantes single notes were then heard in sorrowful low lamentation till having gathered them all he flung them abroad in derision as when after a storm a gust of wind through the treetops shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches with such a prelude as this and hearts that throbbed with emotion slowly they entered the teche where it flows through the green opelousas and through the amber air above the crest of the woodland saw the column of smoke that arose from a neighboring dwelling sounds of a horn they heard and the distant lowing of cattle iii near to the bank of the river oershadowed by oaks from whose branches garlands of spanish moss and of mystic mistletoe flaunted such as the druids cut down with golden hatchets at yuletide stood secluded and still the house of the herdsman a garden girded it round about with a belt of luxuriant blossoms filling the air with fragrance the house itself was of timbers hewn from the cypresstree and carefully fitted together large and low was the roof and on slender columns supported rosewreathed vineencircled a broad and spacious veranda haunt of the hummingbird and the bee extended around it at each end of the house amid the flowers of the garden stationed the dovecots were as loves perpetual symbol scenes of endless wooing and endless contentions of rivals silence reigned oer the place the line of shadow and sunshine ran near the tops of the trees but the house itself was in shadow and from its chimneytop ascending and slowly expanding into the evening air a thin blue column of smoke rose in the rear of the house from the garden gate ran a pathway through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending full in his track of light like ships with shadowy canvas hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics stood a cluster of trees with tangled cordage of grapevines just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie mounted upon his horse with spanish saddle and stirrups sat a herdsman arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin broad and brown was the face that from under the spanish sombrero gazed on the peaceful scene with the lordly look of its master round about him were numberless herds of kine that were grazing quietly in the meadows and breathing the vapory freshness that uprose from the river and spread itself over the landscape slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side and expanding fully his broad deep chest he blew a blast that resounded wildly and sweet and far through the still damp air of the evening suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean silent a moment they gazed then bellowing rushed oer the prairie and the whole mass became a cloud a shade in the distance then as the herdsman turned to the house through the gate of the garden saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement and forward rushed with extended arms and exclamations of wonder when they beheld his face they recognized basil the blacksmith hearty his welcome was as he led his guests to the garden there in an arbor of roses with endless question and answer gave they vent to their hearts and renewed their friendly embraces laughing and weeping by turns or sitting silent and thoughtful thoughtful for gabriel came not and now dark doubts and misgivings stole oer the maidens heart and basil somewhat embarrassed broke the silence and said if you came by the atchafalaya how have you nowhere encountered my gabriels boat on the bayous over evangelines face at the words of basil a shade passed tears came into her eyes and she said with a tremulous accent gone is gabriel gone and concealing her face on his shoulder all her oerburdened heart gave way and she wept and lamented then the good basil said and his voice grew blithe as he said it be of good cheer my child it is only today he departed foolish boy he has left me alone with my herds and my horses moody and restless grown and tried and troubled his spirit could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence thinking ever of thee uncertain and sorrowful ever ever silent or speaking only of thee and his troubles he at length had become so tedious to men and to maidens tedious even to me that at length i bethought me and sent him unto the town of adayes to trade for mules with the spaniards thence he will follow the indian trails to the ozark mountains hunting for furs in the forests on rivers trapping the beaver therefore be of good cheer we will follow the fugitive lover he is not far on his way and the fates and the streams are against him up and away tomorrow and through the red dew of the morning we will follow him fast and bring him back to his prison then glad voices were heard and up from the banks of the river borne aloft on his comrades arms came michael the fiddler long under basils roof had he lived like a god on olympus having no other care than dispensing music to mortals far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle long live michael they cried our brave acadian minstrel as they bore him aloft in triumphal procession and straightway father felician advanced with evangeline greeting the old man kindly and oft and recalling the past while basil enraptured hailed with hilarious joy his old companions and gossips laughing loud and long and embracing mothers and daughters much they marvelled to see the wealth of the cidevant blacksmith all his domains and his herds and his patriarchal demeanor much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate and of the prairie whose numberless herds were his who would take them each one thought in his heart that he too would go and do likewise thus they ascended the steps and crossing the breezy veranda entered the hall of the house where already the supper of basil waited his late return and they rested and feasted together over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended all was silent without and illuming the landscape with silver fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars but within doors brighter than these shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight then from his station aloft at the head of the table the herdsman poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion lighting his pipe that was filled with sweet natchitoches tobacco thus he spake to his guests who listened and smiled as they listened welcome once more my friends who long have been friendless and homeless welcome once more to a home that is better perchance than the old one here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer smoothly the ploughshare runs through the soil as a keel through the water all the year round the orangegroves are in blossom and grass grows more in a single night than a whole canadian summer here too numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies here too lands may be had for the asking and forests of timber with a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses after your houses are built and your fields are yellow with harvests no king george of england shall drive you away from your homesteads burning your dwellings and barns and stealing your farms and your cattle speaking these words he blew a wrathful cloud from his nostrils while his huge brown hand came thundering down on the table so that the guests all started and father felician astounded suddenly paused with a pinch of snuff halfway to his nostrils but the brave basil resumed and his words were milder and gayer only beware of the fever my friends beware of the fever for it is not like that of our cold acadian climate cured by wearing a spider hung round ones neck in a nutshell then there were voices heard at the door and footsteps approaching sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda it was the neighboring creoles and small acadian planters who had been summoned all to the house of basil the herdsman merry the meeting was of ancient comrades and neighbors friend clasped friend in his arms and they who before were as strangers meeting in exile became straightway as friends to each other drawn by the gentle bond of a common country together but in the neighboring hall a strain of music proceeding from the accordant strings of michaels melodious fiddle broke up all further speech away like children delighted all things forgotten beside they gave themselves to the maddening whirl of the dizzy dance as it swept and swayed to the music dreamlike with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments meanwhile apart at the head of the hall the priest and the herdsman sat conversing together of past and present and future while evangeline stood like one entranced for within her olden memories rose and loud in the midst of the music heard she the sound of the sea and an irrepressible sadness came oer her heart and unseen she stole forth into the garden beautiful was the night behind the black wall of the forest tipping its summit with silver arose the moon on the river fell here and there through the branches a tremulous gleam of the moonlight like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit nearer and round about her the manifold flowers of the garden poured out their souls in odors that were their prayers and confessions unto the night as it went its way like a silent carthusian fuller of fragrance than they and as heavy with shadows and nightdews hung the heart of the maiden the calm and the magical moonlight seemed to inundate her soul with indefinable longing as through the garden gate and beneath the shade of the oaktrees passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie silent it lay with a silvery haze upon it and fireflies gleaming and floating away in mingled and infinite numbers over her head the stars the thoughts of god in the heavens shone on the eyes of man who had ceased to marvel and worship save when a blazing comet was seen on the walls of that temple as if a hand had appeared and written upon them upharsin and the soul of the maiden between the stars and the fireflies wandered alone and she cried o gabriel o my beloved art thou so near unto me and yet i cannot behold thee art thou so near unto me and yet thy voice does not reach me ah how often thy feet have trod this path to the prairie ah how often thine eyes have looked on the woodlands around me ah how often beneath this oak returning from labor thou hast lain down to rest and to dream of me in thy slumbers when shall these eyes behold these arms be folded about thee loud and sudden and near the note of a whippoorwill sounded like a flute in the woods and anon through the neighboring thickets farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence patience whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness and from the moonlit meadow a sigh responded tomorrow bright rose the sun next day and all the flowers of the garden bathed his shining feet with their tears and anointed his tresses with the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal farewell said the priest as he stood at the shadowy threshold see that you bring us the prodigal son from his fasting and famine and too the foolish virgin who slept when the bridegroom was coming farewell answered the maiden and smiling with basil descended down to the rivers brink where the boatmen already were waiting thus beginning their journey with morning and sunshine and gladness swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert not that day nor the next nor yet the day that succeeded found they trace of his course in lake or forest or river nor after many days had they found him but vague and uncertain rumors alone were their guides through a wild and desolate country till at the little inn of the spanish town of adayes weary and worn they alighted and learned from the garrulous landlord that on the day before with horses and guides and companions gabriel left the village and took the road of the prairies iv far in the west there lies a desert land where the mountains lift through perpetual snows their lofty and luminous summits down from their jagged deep ravines where the gorge like a gateway opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrants wagon westward the oregon flows and the walleway and owyhee eastward with devious course among the windriver mountains through the sweetwater valley precipitate leaps the nebraska and to the south from fontainequibout and the spanish sierras fretted with sands and rocks and swept by the wind of the desert numberless torrents with ceaseless sound descend to the ocean like the great chords of a harp in loud and solemn vibrations spreading between these streams are the wondrous beautiful prairies billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and purple amorphas over them wandered the buffalo herds and the elk and the roebuck over them wandered the wolves and herds of riderless horses fires that blast and blight and winds that are weary with travel over them wander the scattered tribes of ishmaels children staining the desert with blood and above their terrible wartrails circles and sails aloft on pinions majestic the vulture like the implacable soul of a chieftain slaughtered in battle by invisible stairs ascending and scaling the heavens here and there rise smokes from the camps of these savage marauders here and there rise groves from the margins of swiftrunning rivers and the grim taciturn bear the anchorite monk of the desert climbs down their dark ravines to dig for roots by the brookside and over all is the sky the clear and crystalline heaven like the protecting hand of god inverted above them into this wonderful land at the base of the ozark mountains gabriel far had entered with hunters and trappers behind him day after day with their indian guides the maiden and basil followed his flying steps and thought each day to oertake him sometimes they saw or thought they saw the smoke of his campfire rise in the morning air from the distant plain but at nightfall when they had reached the place they found only embers and ashes and though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary hope still guided them on as the magic fata morgana showed them her lakes of light that retreated and vanished before them once as they sat by their evening fire there silently entered into the little camp an indian woman whose features wore deep traces of sorrow and patience as great as her sorrow she was a shawnee woman returning home to her people from the faroff huntinggrounds of the cruel camanches where her canadian husband a coureurdesbois had been murdered touched were their hearts at her story and warmest and friendliest welcome gave they with words of cheer and she sat and feasted among them on the buffalomeat and the venison cooked on the embers but when their meal was done and basil and all his companions worn with the long days march and the chase of the deer and the bison stretched themselves on the ground and slept where the quivering firelight flashed on their swarthy cheeks and their forms wrapped up in their blankets then at the door of evangelines tent she sat and repeated slowly with soft low voice and the charm of her indian accent all the tale of her love with its pleasures and pains and reverses much evangeline wept at the tale and to know that another hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed moved to the depths of her soul by pity and womans compassion yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her she in turn related her love and all its disasters mute with wonder the shawnee sat and when she had ended still was mute but at length as if a mysterious horror passed through her brain she spake and repeated the tale of the mowis mowis the bridegroom of snow who won and wedded a maiden but when the morning came arose and passed from the wigwam fading and melting away and dissolving into the sunshine till she beheld him no more though she followed far into the forest then in those sweet low tones that seemed like a weird incantation told she the tale of the fair lilinau who was wooed by a phantom that through the pines oer her fathers lodge in the hush of the twilight breathed like the evening wind and whispered love to the maiden till she followed his green and waving plume through the forest and nevermore returned nor was seen again by her people silent with wonder and strange surprise evangeline listened to the soft flow of her magical words till the region around her seemed like enchanted ground and her swarthy guest the enchantress slowly over the tops of the ozark mountains the moon rose lighting the little tent and with a mysterious splendor touching the sombre leaves and embracing and filling the woodland with a delicious sound the brook rushed by and the branches swayed and sighed overhead in scarcely audible whispers filled with the thoughts of love was evangelines heart but a secret subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror as the cold poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow it was no earthly fear a breath from the region of spirits seemed to float in the air of night and she felt for a moment that like the indian maid she too was pursuing a phantom with this thought she slept and the fear and the phantom had vanished early upon the morrow the march was resumed and the shawnee said as they journeyed along on the western slope of these mountains dwells in his little village the black robe chief of the mission much he teaches the people and tells them of mary and jesus loud laugh their hearts with joy and weep with pain as they hear him then with a sudden and secret emotion evangeline answered let us go to the mission for there good tidings await us thither they turned their steeds and behind a spur of the mountains just as the sun went down they heard a murmur of voices and in a meadow green and broad by the bank of a river saw the tents of the christians the tents of the jesuit mission under a towering oak that stood in the midst of the village knelt the black robe chief with his children a crucifix fastened high on the trunk of the tree and overshadowed by grapevines looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it this was their rural chapel aloft through the intricate arches of its aerial roof arose the chant of their vespers mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches silent with heads uncovered the travellers nearer approaching knelt on the swarded floor and joined in the evening devotions but when the service was done and the benediction had fallen forth from the hands of the priest like seed from the hands of the sower slowly the reverend man advanced to the strangers and bade them welcome and when they replied he smiled with benignant expression hearing the homelike sounds of his mothertongue in the forest and with words of kindness conducted them into his wigwam there upon mats and skins they reposed and on cakes of the maizeear feasted and slaked their thirst from the watergourd of the teacher soon was their story told and the priest with solemnity answered not six suns have risen and set since gabriel seated on this mat by my side where now the maiden reposes told me this same sad tale then arose and continued his journey soft was the voice of the priest and he spake with an accent of kindness but on evangelines heart fell his words as in winter the snowflakes fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed far to the north he has gone continued the priest but in autumn when the chase is done will return again to the mission then evangeline said and her voice was meek and submissive let me remain with thee for my soul is sad and afflicted so seemed it wise and well unto all and betimes on the morrow mounting his mexican steed with his indian guides and companions homeward basil returned and evangeline stayed at the mission slowly slowly slowly the days succeeded each other days and weeks and months and the fields of maize that were springing green from the ground when a stranger she came now waving above her lifted their slender shafts with leaves interlacing and forming cloisters for mendicant crows and granaries pillaged by squirrels then in the golden weather the maize was husked and the maidens blushed at each bloodred ear for that betokened a lover but at the crooked laughed and called it a thief in the cornfield even the bloodred ear to evangeline brought not her lover patience the priest would say have faith and thy prayer will be answered look at this vigorous plant that lifts its head from the meadow see how its leaves are turned to the north as true as the magnet this is the compassflower that the finger of god has planted here in the houseless wild to direct the travellers journey over the sealike pathless limitless waste of the desert such in the soul of man is faith the blossoms of passion gay and luxuriant flowers are brighter and fuller of fragrance but they beguile us and lead us astray and their odor is deadly only this humble plant can guide us here and hereafter crown us with asphodel flowers that are wet with the dews of nepenthe so came the autumn and passed and the winter yet gabriel came not blossomed the opening spring and the notes of the robin and bluebird sounded sweet upon wold and in wood yet gabriel came not but on the breath of the summer winds a rumor was wafted sweeter than song of bird or hue or odor of blossom far to the north and east it said in the michigan forests gabriel had his lodge by the banks of the saginaw river and with returning guides that sought the lakes of st lawrence saying a sad farewell evangeline went from the mission when over weary ways by long and perilous marches she had attained at length the depths of the michigan forests found she the hunters lodge deserted and fallen to ruin thus did the long sad years glide on and in seasons and places divers and distant far was seen the wandering maiden now in the tents of grace of the meek moravian missions now in the noisy camps and the battlefields of the army now in secluded hamlets in towns and populous cities like a phantom she came and passed away unremembered fair was she and young when in hope began the long journey faded was she and old when in disappointment it ended each succeeding year stole something away from her beauty leaving behind it broader and deeper the gloom and the shadow then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray oer her forehead dawn of another life that broke oer her earthy horizon as in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning v in that delightful land which is washed by the delawares waters guarding in sylvan shades the name of penn the apostle stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded there all the air is balm and the peach is the emblem of beauty and the streets still reecho the names of the trees of the forest as if they fain would appease the dryads whose haunts they molested there from the troubled sea had evangeline landed an exile finding among the children of penn a home and a country there old rene leblanc had died and when he departed saw at his side only one of all his hundred descendants something at least there was in the friendly streets of the city something that spake to her heart and made her no longer a stranger and her ear was pleased with the thee and thou of the quakers for it recalled the past the old acadian country where all men were equal and all were brothers and sisters so when the fruitless search the disappointed endeavor ended to recommence no more upon earth uncomplaining thither as leaves to the light were turned her thoughts and her footsteps as from a mountains top the rainy mists of the morning roll away and afar we behold the landscape below us sunillumined with shining rivers and cities and hamlets so fell the mists from her mind and she saw the world far below her dark no longer but all illumined with love and the pathway which she had climbed so far lying smooth and fair in the distance gabriel was not forgotten within her heart was his image clothed in the beauty of love and youth as last she beheld him only more beautiful made by his deathlike silence and absence into her thoughts of him time entered not for it was not over him years had no power he was not changed but transfigured he had become to her heart as one who is dead and not absent patience and abnegation of self and devotion to others this was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her so was her love diffused but like to some odorous spices suffered no waste nor loss though filling the air with aroma other hope had she none nor wish in life but to follow meekly with reverent steps the sacred feet of her saviour thus many years she lived as a sister of mercy frequenting lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes of the city where distress and want concealed themselves from the sunlight where disease and sorrow in garrets languished neglected night after night when the world was asleep as the watchman repeated loud through the gusty streets that all was well in the city high at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper day after day in the gray of the dawn as slow through the suburbs plodded the german farmer with flowers and fruits for the market met he that meek pale face returning home from its watchings then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city presaged by wondrous signs and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons darkening the sun in their flight with naught in their craws but an acorn and as the tides of the sea arise in the month of september flooding some silver stream till it spreads to a lake in the meadow so death flooded life and oerflowing its natural margin spread to a brackish lake the silver stream of existence wealth had no power to bribe nor beauty to charm the oppressor but all perished alike beneath the scourge of his anger only alas the poor who had neither friends nor attendants crept away to die in the almshouse home of the homeless then in the suburbs it stood in the midst of meadows and woodlands now the city surrounds it but still with its gateway and wicket meek in the midst of splendor its humble walls seem to echo softly the words of the lord the poor ye always have with you thither by night and by day came the sister of mercy the dying looked up into her face and thought indeed to behold there gleams of celestial light encircle her forehead with splendor such as the artist paints oer the brows of saints and apostles or such as hangs by night oer a city seen at a distance unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city celestial into whose shining gates erelong their spirits would enter thus on a sabbath morn through the streets deserted and silent wending her quiet way she entered the door of the almshouse sweet on the summer air was the odor of flowers in the garden and she paused on her way to gather the fairest among them that the dying once more might rejoice in their fragrance and beauty then as she mounted the stairs to the corridors cooled by the eastwind distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes from the belfry of christ church while intermingled with these across the meadows were wafted sounds of psalms that were sung by the swedes in their church at wicaco soft as descending wings fell the calm of the hour on her spirit something within her said at length thy trials are ended and with light in her looks she entered the chambers of sickness noiselessly moved about the assiduous careful attendants moistening the feverish lip and the aching brow and in silence closing the sightless eyes of the dead and concealing their faces where on their pallets they lay like drifts of snow by the roadside many a languid head upraised as evangeline entered turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she passed for her presence fell on their hearts like a ray of the sun on the walls of a prison and as she looked around she saw how death the consoler laying his hand upon many a heart had healed it forever many familiar forms had disappeared in the night time vacant their places were or filled already by strangers suddenly as if arrested by fear or a feeling of wonder still she stood with her colorless lips apart while a shudder ran through her frame and forgotten the flowerets dropped from her fingers and from her eyes and cheeks the light and bloom of the morning then there escaped from her lips a cry of such terrible anguish that the dying heard it and started up from their pillows on the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man long and thin and gray were the locks that shaded his temples but as he lay in the in morning light his face for a moment seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood so are wont to be changed the faces of those who are dying hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever as if life like the hebrew with blood had besprinkled its portals that the angel of death might see the sign and pass over motionless senseless dying he lay and his spirit exhausted seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness darkness of slumber and death forever sinking and sinking then through those realms of shade in multiplied reverberations heard he that cry of pain and through the hush that succeeded whispered a gentle voice in accents tender and saintlike gabriel o my beloved and died away into silence then he beheld in a dream once more the home of his childhood green acadian meadows with sylvan rivers among them village and mountain and woodlands and walking under their shadow as in the days of her youth evangeline rose in his vision tears came into his eyes and as slowly he lifted his eyelids vanished the vision away but evangeline knelt by his bedside vainly he strove to whisper her name for the accents unuttered died on his lips and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken vainly he strove to rise and evangeline kneeling beside him kissed his dying lips and laid his head on her bosom sweet was the light of his eyes but it suddenly sank into darkness as when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement all was ended now the hope and the fear and the sorrow all the aching of heart the restless unsatisfied longing all the dull deep pain and constant anguish of patience and as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom meekly she bowed her own and murmured father i thank thee still stands the forest primeval but far away from its shadow side by side in their nameless graves the lovers are sleeping under the humble walls of the little catholic churchyard in the heart of the city they lie unknown and unnoticed daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing beside them thousands of throbbing hearts where theirs are at rest and forever thousands of aching brains where theirs no longer are busy thousands of toiling hands where theirs have ceased from their labors thousands of weary feet where theirs have completed their journey still stands the forest primeval but under the shade of its branches dwells another race with other customs and language only along the shore of the mournful and misty atlantic linger a few acadian peasants whose fathers from exile wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom in the fishermans cot the wheel and the loom are still busy maidens still wear their norman caps and their kirtles of homespun and by the evening fire repeat evangelines story while from its rocky caverns the deepvoiced neighboring ocean speaks and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest the seaside and the fireside dedication as one who walking in the twilight gloom hears round about him voices as it darkens and seeing not the forms from which they come pauses from time to time and turns and hearkens so walking here in twilight o my friends i hear your voices softened by the distance and pause and turn to listen as each sends his words of friendship comfort and assistance if any thought of mine or sung or told has ever given delight or consolation ye have repaid me back a thousandfold by every friendly sign and salutation thanks for the sympathies that ye have shown thanks for each kindly word each silent token that teaches me when seeming most alone friends are around us though no word be spoken kind messages that pass from land to land kind letters that betray the hearts deep history in which we feel the pressure of a hand one touch of fire and all the rest is mystery the pleasant books that silently among our household treasures take familiar places and are to us as if a living tongue spice from the printed leaves or pictured faces perhaps on earth i never shall behold with eye of sense your outward form and semblance therefore to me ye never will grow old but live forever young in my remembrance never grow old nor change nor pass away your gentle voices will flow on forever when life grows bare and tarnished with decay as through a leafless landscape flows a river not chance of birth or place has made us friends being oftentimes of different tongues and nations but the endeavor for the selfsame ends with the same hopes and fears and aspirations therefore i hope to join your seaside walk saddened and mostly silent with emotion not interrupting with intrusive talk the grand majestic symphonies of ocean therefore i hope as no unwelcome guest at your warm fireside when the lamps are lighted to have my place reserved among the rest nor stand as one unsought and uninvited by the seaside the building of the ship build me straight o worthy master stanch and strong a goodly vessel that shall laugh at all disaster and with wave and whirlwind wrestle the merchants word delighted the master heard for his heart was in his work and the heart giveth grace unto every art a quiet smile played round his lips as the eddies and dimples of the tide play round the bows of ships that steadily at anchor ride and with a voice that was full of glee he answered erelong we will launch a vessel as goodly and strong and stanch as ever weathered a wintry sea and first with nicest skill and art perfect and finished in every part a little model the master wrought which should be to the larger plan what the child is to the man its counterpart in miniature that with a hand more swift and sure the greater labor might be brought to answer to his inward thought and as he labored his mind ran oer the various ships that were built of yore and above them all and strangest of all towered the great harry crank and tall whose picture was hanging on the wall with bows and stern raised high in air and balconies hanging here and there and signal lanterns and flags afloat and eight round towers like those that frown from some old castle looking down upon the drawbridge and the moat and he said with a smile our ship i wis shall be of another form than this it was of another form indeed built for freight and yet for speed a beautiful and gallant craft broad in the beam that the stress of the blast pressing down upon sail and mast might not the sharp bows overwhelm broad in the beam but sloping aft with graceful curve and slow degrees that she might be docile to the helm and that the currents of parted seas closing behind with mighty force might aid and not impede her course in the shipyard stood the master with the model of the vessel that should laugh at all disaster and with wave and whirlwind wrestle covering many a rood of ground lay the timber piled around timber of chestnut and elm and oak and scattered here and there with these the knarred and crooked cedar knees brought from regions far away from pascagoulas sunny bay and the banks of the roaring roanoke ah what a wondrous thing it is to note how many wheels of toil one thought one word can set in motion theres not a ship that sails the ocean but every climate every soil must bring its tribute great or small and help to build the wooden wall the sun was rising oer the sea and long the level shadows lay as if they too the beams would be of some great airy argosy framed and launched in a single day that silent architect the sun had hewn and laid them every one ere the work of man was yet begun beside the master when he spoke a youth against an anchor leaning listened to catch his slightest meaning only the long waves as they broke in ripples on the pebbly beach interrupted the old mans speech beautiful they were in sooth the old man and the fiery youth the old man in whose busy brain many a ship that sailed the main was modelled oer and oer again the fiery youth who was to be the heir of his dexterity the heir of his house and his daughters hand when he had built and launched from land what the elder head had planned thus said he will we build this ship lay square the blocks upon the slip and follow well this plan of mine choose the timbers with greatest care of all that is unsound beware for only what is sound and strong to this vessel stall belong cedar of maine and georgia pine here together shall combine a goodly frame and a goodly fame and the union be her name for the day that gives her to the sea shall give my daughter unto thee the masters word enraptured the young man heard and as he turned his face aside with a look of joy and a thrill of pride standing before her fathers door he saw the form of his promised bride the sun shone on her golden hair and her cheek was glowing fresh and fair with the breath of morn and the soft sea air like a beauteous barge was she still at rest on the sandy beach just beyond the billows reach but he was the restless seething stormy sea ah how skilful grows the hand that obeyeth loves command it is the heart and not the brain that to the highest doth attain and he who followeth loves behest far excelleth all the rest thus with the rising of the sun was the noble task begun and soon throughout the shipyards bounds were heard the intermingled sounds of axes and of mallets plied with vigorous arms on every side plied so deftly and so well that ere the shadows of evening fell the keel of oak for a noble ship scarfed and bolted straight and strong was lying ready and stretched along the blocks well placed upon the slip happy thrice happy every one who sees his labor well begun and not perplexed and multiplied by idly waiting for time and tide and when the hot long day was oer the young man at the masters door sat with the maiden calm and still and within the porch a little more removed beyond the evening chill the father sat and told them tales of wrecks in the great september gales of pirates coasting the spanish main and ships that never came back again the chance and change of a sailors life want and plenty rest and strife his roving fancy like the wind that nothing can stay and nothing can bind and the magic charm of foreign lands with shadows of palms and shining sands where the tumbling surf oer the coral reefs of madagascar washes the feet of the swarthy lascar as he lies alone and asleep on the turf and the trembling maiden held her breath at the tales of that awful pitiless sea with all its terror and mystery the dim dark sea so like unto death that divides and yet unites mankind and whenever the old man paused a gleam from the bowl of his pipe would awhile illume the silent group in the twilight gloom and thoughtful faces as in a dream and for a moment one might mark what had been hidden by the dark that the head of the maiden lay at rest tenderly on the young mans breast day by day the vessel grew with timbers fashioned strong and true stemson and keelson and sternsonknee till framed with perfect symmetry a skeleton ship rose up to view and around the bows and along the side the heavy hammers and mallets plied till after many a week at length wonderful for form and strength sublime in its enormous bulk loomed aloft the shadowy hulk and around it columns of smoke upwreathing rose from the boiling bubbling seething caldron that glowed and overflowed with the black tar heated for the sheathing and amid the clamors of clattering hammers he who listened heard now and then the song of the master and his men build me straight o worthy master stanch and strong a goodly vessel that shall laugh at all disaster and with wave and whirlwind wrestle with oaken brace and copper band lay the rudder on the sand that like a thought should have control over the movement of the whole and near it the anchor whose giant hand would reach down and grapple with the land and immovable and fast hold the great ship against the bellowing blast and at the bows an image stood by a cunning artist carved in wood with robes of white that far behind seemed to be fluttering in the wind it was not shaped in a classic mould not like a nymph or goddess of old or naiad rising from the water but modelled from the masters daughter on many a dreary and misty night t will be seen by the rays of the signal light speeding along through the rain and the dark like a ghost in its snowwhite sark the pilot of some phantom bark guiding the vessel in its flight by a path none other knows aright behold at last each tall and tapering mast is swung into its place shrouds and stays holding it firm and fast long ago in the deerhaunted forests of maine when upon mountain and plain lay the snow they fell those lordly pines those grand majestic pines mid shouts and cheers the jaded steers panting beneath the goad dragged down the weary winding road those captive kings so straight and tall to be shorn of their streaming hair and naked and bare to feel the stress and the strain of the wind and the reeling main whose roar would remind them forevermore of their native forests they should not see again and everywhere the slender graceful spars poise aloft in the air and at the masthead white blue and red a flag unrolls the stripes and stars ah when the wanderer lonely friendless in foreign harbors shall behold that flag unrolled t will be as a friendly hand stretched out from his native land filling his heart with memories sweet and endless all is finished and at length has come the bridal day of beauty and of strength today the vessel shall be launched with fleecy clouds the sky is blanched and oer the bay slowly in all his splendors dight the great sun rises to behold the sight the ocean old centuries old strong as youth and as uncontrolled paces restless to and fro up and down the sands of gold his beating heart is not at rest and far and wide with ceaseless flow his beard of snow heaves with the heaving of his breast he waits impatient for his bride there she stands with her foot upon the sands decked with flags and streamers gay in honor of her marriage day her snowwhite signals fluttering blending round her like a veil descending ready to be the bride of the gray old sea on the deck another bride is standing by her lovers side shadows from the flags and shrouds like the shadows cast by clouds broken by many a sunny fleck fall around them on the deck the prayer is said the service read the joyous bridegroom bows his head and in tears the good old master shakes the brown hand of his son kisses his daughters glowing cheek in silence for he cannot speak and ever faster down his own the tears begin to run the worthy pastor the shepherd of that wandering flock that has the ocean for its wold that has the vessel for its fold leaping ever from rock to rock spake with accents mild and clear words of warning words of cheer but tedious to the bridegrooms ear he knew the chart of the sailors heart all its pleasures and its griefs all its shallows and rocky reefs all those secret currents that flow with such resistless undertow and lift and drift with terrible force the will from its moorings and its course therefore he spake and thus said he like unto ships far off at sea outward or homeward bound are we before behind and all around floats and swings the horizons bound seems at its distant rim to rise and climb the crystal wall of the skies and then again to turn and sink as if we could slide from its outer brink ah it is not the sea it is not the sea that sinks and shelves but ourselves that rock and rise with endless and uneasy motion now touching the very skies now sinking into the depths of ocean ah if our souls but poise and swing like the compass in its brazen ring ever level and ever true to the toil and the task we have to do we shall sail securely and safely reach the fortunate isles on whose shining beach the sights we see and the sounds we hear will he those of joy and not of fear then the master with a gesture of command waved his hand and at the word loud and sudden there was heard all around them and below the sound of hammers blow on blow knocking away the shores and spurs and see she stirs she starts she moves she seems to feel the thrill of life along her keel and spurning with her foot the ground with one exulting joyous bound she leaps into the oceans arms and lo from the assembled crowd there rose a shout prolonged and loud that to the ocean seemed to say take her o bridegroom old and gray take her to thy protecting arms with all her youth and all her charms how beautiful she is how fair she lies within those arms that press her form with many a soft caress of tenderness and watchful care sail forth into the sea o ship through wind and wave right onward steer the moistened eye the trembling lip are not the signs of doubt or fear sail forth into the sea of life o gentle loving trusting wife and safe from all adversity upon the bosom of that sea thy comings and thy goings be for gentleness and love and trust prevail oer angry wave and gust and in the wreck of noble lives something immortal still survives thou too sail on o ship of state sail on o union strong and great humanity with all its fears with all the hopes of future years is hanging breathless on thy fate we know what master laid thy keel what workmen wrought thy ribs of steel who made each mast and sail and rope what anvils rang what hammers beat in what a forge and what a heat were shaped the anchors of thy hope fear not each sudden sound and shock t is of the wave and not the rock t is but the flapping of the sail and not a rent made by the gale in spite of rock and tempests roar in spite of false lights on the shore sail on nor fear to breast the sea our hearts our hopes are all with thee our hearts our hopes our prayers our tears our faith triumphant oer our fears are all with thee are all with thee seaweed when descends on the atlantic the gigantic stormwind of the equinox landward in his wrath he scourges the toiling surges laden with seaweed from the rocks from bermudas reefs from edges of sunken ledges in some faroff bright azore from bahama and the dashing silverflashing surges of san salvador from the tumbling surf that buries the orkneyan skerries answering the hoarse hebrides and from wrecks of ships and drifting spars uplifting on the desolate rainy seas ever drifting drifting drifting on the shifting currents of the restless main till in sheltered coves and reaches of sandy beaches all have found repose again so when storms of wild emotion strike the ocean of the poets soul erelong from each cave and rocky fastness in its vastness floats some fragment of a song front the faroff isles enchanted heaven has planted with the golden fruit of truth from the flashing surf whose vision gleams elysian in the tropic clime of youth from the strong will and the endeavor that forever wrestle with the tides of fate from the wreck of hopes farscattered tempestshattered floating waste and desolate ever drifting drifting drifting on the shifting currents of the restless heart till at length in books recorded they like hoarded household words no more depart chrysaor just above yon sandy bar as the day grows fainter and dimmer lonely and lovely a single star lights the air with a dusky glimmer into the ocean faint and far falls the trail of its golden splendor and the gleam of that single star is ever refulgent soft and tender chrysaor rising out of the sea showed thus glorious and thus emulous leaving the arms of callirrhoe forever tender soft and tremulous thus oer the ocean faint and far trailed the gleam of his falchion brightly is it a god or is it a star that entranced i gaze on nightly the secret of the sea ah what pleasant visions haunt me as i gaze upon the sea all the old romantic legends all my dreams come back to me sails of silk and ropes of sandal such as gleam in ancient lore and the singing of the sailors and the answer from the shore most of all the spanish ballad haunts me oft and tarries long of the noble count arnaldos and the sailors mystic song like the long waves on a seabeach where the sand as silver shines with a soft monotonous cadence flow its unrhymed lyric lines telling how the count arnaldos with his hawk upon his hand saw a fair and stately galley steering onward to the land how he heard the ancient helmsman chant a song so wild and clear that the sailing seabird slowly poised upon the mast to hear till his soul was full of longing and he cried with impulse strong helmsman for the love of heaven teach me too that wondrous song wouldst thou so the helmsman answered learn the secret of the sea only those who brave its dangers comprehend its mystery in each sail that skims the horizon in each landwardblowing breeze i behold that stately galley hear those mournful melodies till my soul is full of longing for the secret of the sea and the heart of the great ocean sends a thrilling pulse through me twilight the twilight is sad and cloudy the wind blows wild and free and like the wings of seabirds flash the white caps of the sea but in the fishermans cottage there shines a ruddier light and a little face at the window peers out into the night close close it is pressed to the window as if those childish eyes were looking into the darkness to see some form arise and a womans waving shadow is passing to and fro now rising to the ceiling now bowing and bending low what tale do the roaring ocean and the nightwind bleak and wild as they beat at the crazy casement tell to that little child and why do the roaring ocean and the nightwind wild and bleak as they beat at the heart of the mother drive the color from her cheek sir humphrey gilbert southward with fleet of ice sailed the corsair death wild and fast blew the blast and the eastwind was his breath his lordly ships of ice glisten in the sun on each side like pennons wide flashing crystal streamlets run his sails of white seamist dripped with silver rain but where he passed there were cast leaden shadows oer the main eastward from campobello sir humphrey gilbert sailed three days or more seaward he bore then alas the landwind failed alas the landwind failed and icecold grew the night and nevermore on sea or shore should sir humphrey see the light he sat upon the deck the book was in his hand do not fear heaven is as near he said by water as by land in the first watch of the night without a signals sound out of the sea mysteriously the fleet of death rose all around the moon and the evening star were hanging in the shrouds every mast as it passed seemed to rake the passing clouds they grappled with their prize at midnight black and cold as of a rock was the shock heavily the groundswell rolled southward through day and dark they drift in close embrace with mist and rain oer the open main yet there seems no change of place southward forever southward they drift through dark and day and like a dream in the gulfstream sinking vanish all away the lighthouse the rocky ledge runs far into the sea and on its outer point some miles away the lighthouse lifts its massive masonry a pillar of fire by night of cloud by day even at this distance i can see the tides upheaving break unheard along its base a speechless wrath that rises and subsides in the white lip and tremor of the face and as the evening darkens lo how bright through the deep purple of the twilight air beams forth the sudden radiance of its light with strange unearthly splendor in the glare not one alone from each projecting cape and perilous reef along the oceans verge starts into life a dim gigantic shape holding its lantern oer the restless surge like the great giant christopher it stands upon the brink of the tempestuous wave wading far out among the rocks and sands the nightoertaken mariner to save and the great ships sail outward and return bending and bowing oer the billowy swells and ever joyful as they see it burn they wave their silent welcomes and farewells they come forth from the darkness and their sails gleam for a moment only in the blaze and eager faces as the light unveils gaze at the tower and vanish while they gaze the mariner remembers when a child on his first voyage he saw it fade and sink and when returning from adventures wild he saw it rise again oer oceans brink steadfast serene immovable the same year after year through all the silent night burns on forevermore that quenchless flame shines on that inextinguishable light it sees the ocean to its bosom clasp the rocks and seasand with the kiss of peace it sees the wild winds lift it in their grasp and hold it up and shake it like a fleece the startled waves leap over it the storm smites it with all the scourges of the rain and steadily against its solid form press the great shoulders of the hurricane the seabird wheeling round it with the din of wings and winds and solitary cries blinded and maddened by the light within dashes himself against the glare and dies a new prometheus chained upon the rock still grasping in his hand the fire of jove it does not hear the cry nor heed the shock but hails the mariner with words of love sail on it says sail on ye stately ships and with your floating bridge the ocean span be mine to guard this light from all eclipse be yours to bring man nearer unto man the fire of driftwood devereux farm near marblehead we sat within the farmhouse old whose windows looking oer the bay gave to the seabreeze damp and cold an easy entrance night and day not far away we saw the port the strange oldfashioned silent town the lighthouse the dismantled fort the wooden houses quaint and brown we sat and talked until the night descending filled the little room our faces faded from the sight our voices only broke the gloom we spake of many a vanished scene of what we once had thought and said of what had been and might have been and who was changed and who was dead and all that fills the hearts of friends when first they feel with secret pain their lives thenceforth have separate ends and never can be one again the first slight swerving of the heart that words are powerless to express and leave it still unsaid in part or say it in too great excess the very tones in which we spake had something strange i could but mark the leaves of memory seemed to make a mournful rustling in the dark oft died the words upon our lips as suddenly from out the fire built of the wreck of stranded ships the flames would leap and then expire and as their splendor flashed and failed we thought of wrecks upon the main of ships dismasted that were hailed and sent no answer back again the windows rattling in their frames the ocean roaring up the beach the gusty blast the bickering flames all mingled vaguely in our speech until they made themselves a part of fancies floating through the brain the longlost ventures of the heart that send no answers back again o flames that glowed o hearts that yearned they were indeed too much akin the driftwood fire without that burned the thoughts that burned and glowed within by the fireside resignation there is no flock however watched and tended but one dead lamb is there there is no fireside howsoeer defended but has one vacant chair the air is full of farewells to the dying and mournings for the dead the heart of rachel for her children crying will not be comforted let us be patient these severe afflictions not from the ground arise but oftentimes celestial benedictions assume this dark disguise we see but dimly through the mists and vapors amid these earthly damps what seem to us but sad funereal tapers may be heavens distant lamps there is no death what seems so is transition this life of mortal breath is but a suburb of the life elysian whose portal we call death she is not dead the child of our affection but gone unto that school where she no longer needs our poor protection and christ himself doth rule in that great cloisters stillness and seclusion by guardian angels led safe from temptation safe from sins pollution she lives whom we call dead day after day we think what she is doing in those bright realms of air year after year her tender steps pursuing behold her grown more fair thus do we walk with her and keep unbroken the bond which nature gives thinking that our remembrance though unspoken may reach her where she lives not as a child shall we again behold her for when with raptures wild in our embraces we again enfold her she will not be a child but a fair maiden in her fathers mansion clothed with celestial grace and beautiful with all the souls expansion shall we behold her face and though at times impetuous with emotion and anguish long suppressed the swelling heart heaves moaning like the ocean that cannot be at rest we will be patient and assuage the feeling we may not wholly stay by silence sanctifying not concealing the grief that must have way the builders all are architects of fate working in these walls of time some with massive deeds and great some with ornaments of rhyme nothing useless is or low each thing in its place is best and what seems but idle show strengthens and supports the rest for the structure that we raise time is with materials filled our todays and yesterdays are the blocks with which we build truly shape and fashion these leave no yawning gaps between think not because no man sees such things will remain unseen in the elder days of art builders wrought with greatest care each minute and unseen part for the gods see everywhere let us do our work as well both the unseen and the seen make the house where gods may dwell beautiful entire and clean else our lives are incomplete standing in these walls of time broken stairways where the feet stumble as they seek to climb build today then strong and sure with a firm and ample base and ascending and secure shall tomorrow find its place thus alone can we attain to those turrets where the eye sees the world as one vast plain and one boundless reach of sky sand of the desert in an hourglass a handful of red sand from the hot clime of arab deserts brought within this glass becomes the spy of time the minister of thought how many weary centuries has it been about those deserts blown how many strange vicissitudes has seen how many histories known perhaps the camels of the ishmaelite trampled and passed it oer when into egypt from the patriarchs sight his favorite son they bore perhaps the feet of moses burnt and bare crushed it beneath their tread or pharaohs flashing wheels into the air scattered it as they sped or mary with the christ of nazareth held close in her caress whose pilgrimage of hope and love and faith illumed the wilderness or anchorites beneath engaddis palms pacing the dead sea beach and singing slow their old armenian psalms in halfarticulate speech or caravans that from bassoras gate with westward steps depart or meccas pilgrims confident of fate and resolute in heart these have passed over it or may have passed now in this crystal tower imprisoned by some curious hand at last it counts the passing hour and as i gaze these narrow walls expand before my dreamy eye stretches the desert with its shifting sand its unimpeded sky and borne aloft by the sustaining blast this little golden thread dilates into a column high and vast a form of fear and dread and onward and across the setting sun across the boundless plain the column and its broader shadow run till thought pursues in vain the vision vanishes these walls again shut out the lurid sun shut out the hot immeasurable plain the halfhours sand is run the open window the old house by the lindens stood silent in the shade and on the gravelled pathway the light and shadow played i saw the nursery windows wide open to the air but the faces of the children they were no longer there the large newfoundland housedog was standing by the door he looked for his little playmates who would return no more they walked not under the lindens they played not in the hall but shadow and silence and sadness were hanging over all the birds sang in the branches with sweet familiar tone but the voices of the children will be heard in dreams alone and the boy that walked beside me he could not understand why closer in mine ah closer i pressed his warm soft hand king witlafs drinkinghorn witlaf a king of the saxons ere yet his last he breathed to the merry monks of croyland his drinkinghorn bequeathed that whenever they sat at their revels and drank from the golden bowl they might remember the donor and breathe a prayer for his soul so sat they once at christmas and bade the goblet pass in their beards the red wine glistened like dewdrops in the grass they drank to the soul of witlaf they drank to christ the lord and to each of the twelve apostles who had preached his holy word they drank to the saints and martyrs of the dismal days of yore and as soon as the horn was empty they remembered one saint more and the reader droned from the pulpit like the murmur of many bees the legend of good saint guthlac and saint basils homilies till the great bells of the convent from their prison in the tower guthlac and bartholomaeus proclaimed the midnight hour and the yulelog cracked in the chimney and the abbot bowed his head and the flamelets flapped and flickered but the abbot was stark and dead yet still in his pallid fingers he clutched the golden bowl in which like a pearl dissolving had sunk and dissolved his soul but not for this their revels the jovial monks forbore for they cried fill high the goblet we must drink to one saint more gaspar becerra by his evening fire the artist pondered oer his secret shame baffled weary and disheartened still he mused and dreamed of fame t was an image of the virgin that had tasked his utmost skill but alas his fair ideal vanished and escaped him still from a distant eastern island had the precious wood been brought day and night the anxious master at his toil untiring wrought till discouraged and desponding sat he now in shadows deep and the days humiliation found oblivion in sleep then a voice cried rise o master from the burning brand of oak shape the thought that stirs within thee and the startled artist woke woke and from the smoking embers seized and quenched the glowing wood and therefrom he carved an image and he saw that it was good o thou sculptor painter poet take this lesson to thy heart that is best which lieth nearest shape from that thy work of art pegasus in pound once into a quiet village without haste and without heed in the golden prime of morning strayed the poets winged steed it was autumn and incessant piped the quails from shocks and sheaves and like living coals the apples burned among the withering leaves loud the clamorous bell was ringing from its belfry gaunt and grim t was the daily call to labor not a triumph meant for him not the less he saw the landscape in its gleaming vapor veiled not the less he breathed the odors that the dying leaves exhaled thus upon the village common by the schoolboys he was found and the wise men in their wisdom put him straightway into pound then the sombre village crier ringing loud his brazen bell wandered down the street proclaiming there was an estray to sell and the curious country people rich and poor and young and old came in haste to see this wondrous winged steed with mane of gold thus the day passed and the evening fell with vapors cold and dim but it brought no food nor shelter brought no straw nor stall for him patiently and still expectant looked he through the wooden bars saw the moon rise oer the landscape saw the tranquil patient stars till at length the bell at midnight sounded from its dark abode and from out a neighboring farmyard loud the cock alectryon crowed then with nostrils wide distended breaking from his iron chain and unfolding far his pinions to those stars he soared again on the morrow when the village woke to all its toil and care lo the strange steed had departed and they knew not when nor where but they found upon the greensward where his straggling hoofs had trod pure and bright a fountain flowing from the hoofmarks in the sod from that hour the fount unfailing gladdens the whole region round strengthening all who drink its waters while it soothes them with its sound tegners drapa i heard a voice that cried balder the beautiful is dead is dead and through the misty air passed like the mournful cry of sunward sailing cranes i saw the pallid corpse of the dead sun borne through the northern sky blasts from niffelheim lifted the sheeted mists around him as he passed and the voice forever cried balder the beautiful is dead is dead and died away through the dreary night in accents of despair balder the beautiful god of the summer sun fairest of all the gods light from his forehead beamed runes were upon his tongue as on the warriors sword all things in earth and air bound were by magic spell never to do him harm even the plants and stones all save the mistletoe the sacred mistletoe hoeder the blind old god whose feet are shod with silence pierced through that gentle breast with his sharp spear by fraud made of the mistletoe the accursed mistletoe they laid him in his ship with horse and harness as on a funeral pyre odin placed a ring upon his finger and whispered in his ear they launched the burning ship it floated far away over the misty sea till like the sun it seemed sinking beneath the waves balder returned no more so perish the old gods but out of the sea of time rises a new land of song fairer than the old over its meadows green walk the young bards and sing build it again o ye bards fairer than before ye fathers of the new race feed upon morning dew sing the new song of love the law of force is dead the law of love prevails thor the thunderer shall rule the earth no more no more with threats challenge the meek christ sing no more o ye bards of the north of vikings and of jarls of the days of eld preserve the freedom only not the deeds of blood sonnet on mrs kembles readings from shakespeare o precious evenings all too swiftly sped leaving us heirs to amplest heritages of all the best thoughts of the greatest sages and giving tongues unto the silent dead how our hearts glowed and trembled as she read interpreting by tones the wondrous pages of the great poet who foreruns the ages anticipating all that shall be said o happy reader having for thy text the magic book whose sibylline leaves have caught the rarest essence of all human thought o happy poet by no critic vext how must thy listening spirit now rejoice to be interpreted by such a voice the singers god sent his singers upon earth with songs of sadness and of mirth that they might touch the hearts of men and bring them back to heaven again the first a youth with soul of fire held in his hand a golden lyre through groves he wandered and by streams playing the music of our dreams the second with a bearded face stood singing in the marketplace and stirred with accents deep and loud the hearts of all the listening crowd a gray old man the third and last sang in cathedrals dim and vast while the majestic organ rolled contrition from its mouths of gold and those who heard the singers three disputed which the best might be for still their music seemed to start discordant echoes in each heart but the great master said i see no best in kind but in degree i gave a various gift to each to charm to strengthen and to teach these are the three great chords of might and he whose ear is tuned aright will hear no discord in the three but the most perfect harmony suspiria take them o death and bear away whatever thou canst call thine own thine image stamped upon this clay doth give thee that but that alone take them o grave and let them lie folded upon thy narrow shelves as garments by the soul laid by and precious only to ourselves take them o great eternity our little life is but a gust that bends the branches of thy tree and trails its blossoms in the dust hymn for my brothers ordination christ to the young man said yet one thing more if thou wouldst perfect be sell all thou hast and give it to the poor and come and follow me within this temple christ again unseen those sacred words hath said and his invisible hands today have been laid on a young mans head and evermore beside him on his way the unseen christ shall move that he may lean upon his arm and say dost thou dear lord

heron the shuhshuhgah and the grouse the mushkodasa if still further you should ask me saying who was nawadaha tell us of this nawadaha i should answer your inquiries straightway in such words as follow in the vale of tawasentha in the green and silent valley by the pleasant watercourses dwelt the singer nawadaha round about the indian village spread the meadows and the cornfields and beyond them stood the forest stood the groves of singing pinetrees green in summer white in winter ever sighing ever singing and the pleasant watercourses you could trace them through the valley by the rushing in the springtime by the alders in the summer by the white fog in the autumn by the black line in the winter and beside them dwelt the singer in the vale of tawasentha in the green and silent valley there he sang of hiawatha sang the song of hiawatha sang his wondrous birth and being how he prayed and how be fasted how he lived and toiled and suffered that the tribes of men might prosper that he might advance his people ye who love the haunts of nature love the sunshine of the meadow love the shadow of the forest love the wind among the branches and the rainshower and the snowstorm

song of hiawatha ye who love a nations legends love the ballads of a people that like voices from afar off call to us to pause and listen speak in tones so plain and childlike scarcely can the ear distinguish whether they are sung or spoken listen to this indian legend to this song of hiawatha ye whose hearts are fresh and simple who have faith in god and nature who believe that in all ages every human heart is human that in even savage bosoms there are longings yearnings strivings for the good they comprehend not that the feeble hands and helpless groping blindly in the darkness touch gods right hand in that darkness and are lifted up and strengthened listen to this simple story to this song of hiawatha ye who sometimes in your rambles through the green lanes of the country where the tangled barberrybushes hang their tufts of crimson berries over stone walls gray with mosses pause by some neglected graveyard for a while to muse and ponder on a halfeffaced inscription written with little skill of songcraft homely phrases but each letter full of hope and yet of heartbreak full of all the tender pathos of the here and the hereafter stay and read this rude inscription read this song of hiawatha i the peacepipe on the mountains of the prairie on the great red pipestone quarry gitche manito the mighty he the master of life descending on the red crags of the quarry stood erect and called the nations called the tribes of men together from his footprints flowed a river leaped into the light of morning oer the precipice plunging downward gleamed like ishkoodah the comet and the spirit stooping earthward with his finger on the meadow traced a winding pathway for it saying to it run in this way from the red stone of the quarry with his hand he broke a fragment moulded it into a pipehead shaped and fashioned it with figures from the margin of the river took a long reed for a pipestem with its dark green leaves upon it filled the pipe with bark of willow with the bark of the red willow breathed upon the neighboring forest made its great boughs chafe together till in flame they burst and kindled and erect upon the mountains gitche manito the mighty smoked the calumet the peacepipe as a signal to the nations and the smoke rose slowly slowly through the tranquil air of morning first a single line of darkness then a denser bluer vapor then a snowwhite cloud unfolding like the treetops of the forest ever rising rising rising till it touched the top of heaven till it broke against the heaven and rolled outward all around it from the vale of tawasentha from the valley of wyoming from the groves of tuscaloosa from the faroff rocky mountains from the northern lakes and rivers all the tribes beheld the signal saw the distant smoke ascending the pukwana of the peacepipe and the prophets of the nations said behold it the pukwana by the signal of the peacepipe bending like a wand of willow waving like a hand that beckons gitche manito the mighty calls the tribes of men together calls the warriors to his council down the rivers oer the prairies came the warriors of the nations came the delawares and mohawks came the choctaws and camanches came the shoshonies and blackfeet came the pawnees and omahas came the mandans and dacotahs came the hurons and ojibways all the warriors drawn together by the signal of the peacepipe to the mountains of the prairie to the great red pipestone quarry and they stood there on the meadow with their weapons and their wargear painted like the leaves of autumn painted like the sky of morning wildly glaring at each other in their faces stern defiance in their hearts the feuds of ages the hereditary hatred the ancestral thirst of vengeance gitche manito the mighty the creator of the nations looked upon them with compassion with paternal love and pity looked upon their wrath and wrangling but as quarrels among children but as feuds and fights of children over them he stretched his right hand to subdue their stubborn natures to allay their thirst and fever by the shadow of his right hand spake to them with voice majestic as the sound of faroff waters falling into deep abysses warning chiding spake in this wise o my children my poor children listen to the words of wisdom listen to the words of warning from the lips of the great spirit from the master of life who made you i have given you lands to hunt in i have given you streams to fish in i have given you bear and bison i have given you roe and reindeer i have given you brant and beaver filled the marshes full of wildfowl filled the rivers full of fishes why then are you not contented why then will you hunt each other i am weary of your quarrels weary of your wars and bloodshed weary of your prayers for vengeance of your wranglings and dissensions all your strength is in your union all your danger is in discord therefore be at peace henceforward and as brothers live together i will send a prophet to you a deliverer of the nations who shall guide you and shall teach you who shall toil and suffer with you if you listen to his counsels you will multiply and prosper if his warnings pass unheeded you will fade away and perish bathe now in the stream before you wash the warpaint from your faces wash the bloodstains from your fingers bury your warclubs and your weapons break the red stone from this quarry mould and make it into peacepipes take the reeds that grow beside you deck them with your brightest feathers smoke the calumet together and as brothers live henceforward then upon the ground the warriors threw their cloaks and shirts of deerskin threw their weapons and their wargear leaped into the rushing river washed the warpaint from their faces clear above them flowed the water clear and limpid from the footprints of the master of life descending dark below them flowed the water soiled and stained with streaks of crimson as if blood were mingled with it from the river came the warriors clean and washed from all their warpaint on the banks their clubs they buried buried all their warlike weapons gitche manito the mighty the great spirit the creator smiled upon his helpless children and in silence all the warriors broke the red stone of the quarry smoothed and formed it into peacepipes broke the long reeds by the river decked them with their brightest feathers and departed each one homeward while the master of life ascending through the opening of cloudcurtains through the doorways of the heaven vanished from before their faces in the smoke that rolled around him the pukwana of the peacepipe ii the four winds honor be to mudjekeewis cried the warriors cried the old men when he came in triumph homeward with the sacred belt of wampum from the regions of the northwind from the kingdom of wabasso from the land of the white rabbit he had stolen the belt of wampum from the neck of mishemokwa from the great bear of the mountains from the terror of the nations as he lay asleep and cumbrous on the summit of the mountains like a rock with mosses on it spotted brown and gray with mosses silently he stole upon him till the red nails of the monster almost touched him almost scared him till the hot breath of his nostrils warmed the hands of mudjekeewis as he drew the belt of wampum over the round ears that heard not over the small eyes that saw not over the long nose and nostrils the black muffle of the nostrils out of which the heavy breathing warmed the hands of mudjekeewis then he swung aloft his warclub shouted loud and long his warcry smote the mighty mishemokwa in the middle of the forehead right between the eyes he smote him with the heavy blow bewildered rose the great bear of the mountains but his knees beneath him trembled and he whimpered like a woman as he reeled and staggered forward as he sat upon his haunches and the mighty mudjekeewis standing fearlessly before him taunted him in loud derision spake disdainfully in this wise hark you bear you are a coward and no brave as you pretended else you would not cry and whimper like a miserable woman bear you know our tribes are hostile long have been at war together now you find that we are strongest you go sneaking in the forest you go hiding in the mountains had you conquered me in battle not a groan would i have uttered but you bear sit here and whimper and disgrace your tribe by crying like a wretched shaugodaya like a cowardly old woman then again he raised his warclub smote again the mishemokwa in the middle of his forehead broke his skull as ice is broken when one goes to fish in winter thus was slain the mishemokwa he the great bear of the mountains he the terror of the nations honor be to mudjekeewis with a shout exclaimed the people honor be to mudjekeewis henceforth he shall be the westwind and hereafter and forever shall he hold supreme dominion over all the winds of heaven call him no more mudjekeewis call him kabeyun the westwind thus was mudjekeewis chosen father of the winds of heaven for himself he kept the westwind gave the others to his children unto wabun gave the eastwind gave the south to shawondasee and the northwind wild and cruel to the fierce kabibonokka young and beautiful was wabun he it was who brought the morning he it was whose silver arrows chased the dark oer hill and valley he it was whose cheeks were painted with the brightest streaks of crimson and whose voice awoke the village called the deer and called the hunter lonely in the sky was wabun though the birds sang gayly to him though the wildflowers of the meadow filled the air with odors for him though the forests and the rivers sang and shouted at his coming still his heart was sad within him for he was alone in heaven but one morning gazing earthward while the village still was sleeping and the fog lay on the river like a ghost that goes at sunrise he beheld a maiden walking all alone upon a meadow gathering waterflags and rushes by a river in the meadow every morning gazing earthward still the first thing he beheld there was her blue eyes looking at him two blue lakes among the rushes and he loved the lonely maiden who thus waited for his coming for they both were solitary she on earth and he in heaven and he wooed her with caresses wooed her with his smile of sunshine with his flattering words he wooed her with his sighing and his singing gentlest whispers in the branches softest music sweetest odors till he drew her to his bosom folded in his robes of crimson till into a star he changed her trembling still upon his bosom and forever in the heavens they are seen together walking wabun and the wabunannung wabun and the star of morning but the fierce kabibonokka had his dwelling among icebergs in the everlasting snowdrifts in the kingdom of wabasso in the land of the white rabbit he it was whose hand in autumn painted all the trees with scarlet stained the leaves with red and yellow he it was who sent the snowflake sifting hissing through the forest froze the ponds the lakes the rivers drove the loon and seagull southward drove the cormorant and curlew to their nests of sedge and seatang in the realms of shawondasee once the fierce kabibonokka issued from his lodge of snowdrifts from his home among the icebergs and his hair with snow besprinkled streamed behind him like a river like a black and wintry river as he howled and hurried southward over frozen lakes and moorlands there among the reeds and rushes found he shingebis the diver trailing strings of fish behind him oer the frozen fens and moorlands lingering still among the moorlands though his tribe had long departed to the land of shawondasee cried the fierce kabibonokka who is this that dares to brave me dares to stay in my dominions when the wawa has departed when the wildgoose has gone southward and the heron the shuhshuhgah long ago departed southward i will go into his wigwam i will put his smouldering fire out and at night kabibonokka to the lodge came wild and wailing heaped the snow in drifts about it shouted down into the smokeflue shook the lodgepoles in his fury flapped the curtain of the doorway shingebis the diver feared not shingebis the diver cared not four great logs had he for firewood one for each moon of the winter and for food the fishes served him by his blazing fire he sat there warm and merry eating laughing singing o kabibonokka you are but my fellowmortal then kabibonokka entered and though shingebis the diver felt his presence by the coldness felt his icy breath upon him still he did not cease his singing still he did not leave his laughing only turned the log a little only made the fire burn brighter made the sparks fly up the smokeflue from kabibonokkas forehead from his snowbesprinkled tresses drops of sweat fell fast and heavy making dints upon the ashes as along the eaves of lodges as from drooping boughs of hemlock drips the melting snow in springtime making hollows in the snowdrifts till at last he rose defeated could not bear the heat and laughter could not bear the merry singing but rushed headlong through the doorway stamped upon the crusted snowdrifts stamped upon the lakes and rivers made the snow upon them harder made the ice upon them thicker challenged shingebis the diver to come forth and wrestle with him to come forth and wrestle naked on the frozen fens and moorlands forth went shingebis the diver wrestled all night with the northwind wrestled naked on the moorlands with the fierce kabibonokka till his panting breath grew fainter till his frozen grasp grew feebler till he reeled and staggered backward and retreated baffled beaten to the kingdom of wabasso to the land of the white rabbit hearing still the gusty laughter hearing shingebis the diver singing o kabibonokka you are but my fellowmortal shawondasee fat and lazy had his dwelling far to southward in the drowsy dreamy sunshine in the neverending summer he it was who sent the woodbirds sent the robin the opechee sent the bluebird the owaissa sent the shawshaw sent the swallow sent the wildgoose wawa northward sent the melons and tobacco and the grapes in purple clusters from his pipe the smoke ascending filled the sky with haze and vapor filled the air with dreamy softness gave a twinkle to the water touched the rugged hills with smoothness brought the tender indian summer to the melancholy northland in the dreary moon of snowshoes listless careless shawondasee in his life he had one shadow in his heart one sorrow had he once as he was gazing northward far away upon a prairie he beheld a maiden standing saw a tall and slender maiden all alone upon a prairie brightest green were all her garments and her hair was like the sunshine day by day he gazed upon her day by day he sighed with passion day by day his heart within him grew more hot with love and longing for the maid with yellow tresses but he was too fat and lazy to bestir himself and woo her yes too indolent and easy to pursue her and persuade her so he only gazed upon her only sat and sighed with passion for the maiden of the prairie till one morning looking northward he beheld her yellow tresses changed and covered oer with whiteness covered as with whitest snowflakes ah my brother from the northland from the kingdom of wabasso from the land of the white rabbit you have stolen the maiden from me you have laid your hand upon her you have wooed and won my maiden with your stories of the northland thus the wretched shawondasee breathed into the air his sorrow and the southwind oer the prairie wandered warm with sighs of passion with the sighs of shawondasee till the air seemed full of snowflakes full of thistledown the prairie and the maid with hair like sunshine vanished from his sight forever never more did shawondasee see the maid with yellow tresses poor deluded shawondasee t was no woman that you gazed at t was no maiden that you sighed for t was the prairie dandelion that through all the dreamy summer you had gazed at with such longing you had sighed for with such passion and had puffed away forever blown into the air with sighing ah deluded shawondasee thus the four winds were divided thus the sons of mudjekeewis had their stations in the heavens at the corners of the heavens for himself the westwind only kept the mighty mudjekeewis iii hiawathas childhood downward through the evening twilight in the days that are forgotten in the unremembered ages from the full moon fell nokomis fell the beautiful nokomis she a wife but not a mother she was sporting with her women swinging in a swing of grapevines when her rival the rejected full of jealousy and hatred cut the leafy swing asunder cut in twain the twisted grapevines and nokomis fell affrighted downward through the evening twilight on the muskoday the meadow on the prairie full of blossoms see a star falls said the people from the sky a star is falling there among the ferns and mosses there among the prairie lilies on the muskoday the meadow in the moonlight and the starlight fair nokomis bore a daughter and she called her name wenonah as the firstborn of her daughters and the daughter of nokomis grew up like the prairie lilies grew a tall and slender maiden with the beauty of the moonlight with the beauty of the starlight and nokomis warned her often saying oft and oft repeating oh beware of mudjekeewis of the westwind mudjekeewis listen not to what he tells you lie not down upon the meadow stoop not down among the lilies lest the westwind come and harm you but she heeded not the warning heeded not those words of wisdom and the westwind came at evening walking lightly oer the prairie whispering to the leaves and blossoms bending low the flowers and grasses found the beautiful wenonah lying there among the lilies wooed her with his words of sweetness wooed her with his soft caresses till she bore a son in sorrow bore a son of love and sorrow thus was born my hiawatha thus was born the child of wonder but the daughter of nokomis hiawathas gentle mother in her anguish died deserted by the westwind false and faithless by the heartless mudjekeewis for her daughter long and loudly wailed and wept the sad nokomis oh that i were dead she murmured oh that i were dead as thou art no more work and no more weeping wahonowin wahonowin by the shores of gitche gumee by the shining bigseawater stood the wigwam of nokomis daughter of the moon nokomis dark behind it rose the forest rose the black and gloomy pinetrees rose the firs with cones upon them bright before it beat the water beat the clear and sunny water beat the shining bigseawater there the wrinkled old nokomis nursed the little hiawatha rocked him in his linden cradle bedded soft in moss and rushes safely bound with reindeer sinews stilled his fretful wail by saying hush the naked bear will hear thee lulled him into slumber singing ewayea my little owlet who is this that lights the wigwam with his great eyes lights the wigwam ewayea my little owlet many things nokomis taught him of the stars that shine in heaven showed him ishkoodah the comet ishkoodah with fiery tresses showed the deathdance of the spirits warriors with their plumes and warclubs flaring far away to northward in the frosty nights of winter showed the broad white road in heaven pathway of the ghosts the shadows running straight across the heavens crowded with the ghosts the shadows at the door on summer evenings sat the little hiawatha heard the whispering of the pinetrees heard the lapping of the water sounds of music words of wonder minnewawa said the pinetrees mudwayaushka said the water saw the firefly wahwahtaysee flitting through the dusk of evening with the twinkle of its candle lighting up the brakes and bushes and he sang the song of children sang the song nokomis taught him wahwahtaysee little firefly little flitting whitefire insect little dancing whitefire creature light me with your little candle ere upon my bed i lay me ere in sleep i close my eyelids saw the moon rise from the water rippling rounding from the water saw the flecks and shadows on it whispered what is that nokomis and the good nokomis answered once a warrior very angry seized his grandmother and threw her up into the sky at midnight right against the moon he threw her t is her body that you see there saw the rainbow in the heaven in the eastern sky the rainbow whispered what is that nokomis and the good nokomis answered t is the heaven of flowers you see there all the wildflowers of the forest all the lilies of the prairie when on earth they fade and perish blossom in that heaven above us when he heard the owls at midnight hooting laughing in the forest what is that he cried in terror what is that he said nokomis and the good nokomis answered that is but the owl and owlet talking in their native language talking scolding at each other then the little hiawatha learned of every bird its language learned their names and all their secrets how they built their nests in summer where they hid themselves in winter talked with them wheneer he met them called them hiawathas chickens of all beasts he learned the language learned their names and all their secrets how the beavers built their lodges where the squirrels hid their acorns how the reindeer ran so swiftly why the rabbit was so timid talked with them wheneer he met them called them hiawathas brothers then iagoo the great boaster he the marvellous storyteller he the traveller and the talker he the friend of old nokomis made a bow for hiawatha from a branch of ash he made it from an oakbough made the arrows tipped with flint and winged with feathers and the cord he made of deerskin then he said to hiawatha go my son into the forest where the red deer herd together kill for us a famous roebuck kill for us a deer with antlers forth into the forest straightway all alone walked hiawatha proudly with his bow and arrows and the birds sang round him oer him do not shoot us hiawatha sang the robin the opechee sang the bluebird the owaissa do not shoot us hiawatha up the oaktree close beside him sprang the squirrel adjidaumo in and out among the branches coughed and chattered from the oaktree laughed and said between his laughing do not shoot me hiawatha and the rabbit from his pathway leaped aside and at a distance sat erect upon his haunches half in fear and half in frolic saying to the little hunter do not shoot me hiawatha but he heeded not nor heard them for his thoughts were with the red deer on their tracks his eyes were fastened leading downward to the river to the ford across the river and as one in slumber walked he hidden in the alderbushes there he waited till the deer came till he saw two antlers lifted saw two eyes look from the thicket saw two nostrils point to windward and a deer came down the pathway flecked with leafy light and shadow and his heart within him fluttered trembled like the leaves above him like the birchleaf palpitated as the deer came down the pathway then upon one knee uprising hiawatha aimed an arrow scarce a twig moved with his motion scarce a leaf was stirred or rustled but the wary roebuck started stamped with all his hoofs together listened with one foot uplifted leaped as if to meet the arrow ah the singing fatal arrow like a wasp it buzzed and stung him dead he lay there in the forest by the ford across the river beat his timid heart no longer but the heart of hiawatha throbbed and shouted and exulted as he bore the red deer homeward and iagoo and nokomis hailed his coming with applauses from the red deers hide nokomis made a cloak for hiawatha from the red deers flesh nokomis made a banquet to his honor all the village came and feasted all the guests praised hiawatha called him strongheart soangetaha called him loonheart mahngotaysee iv hiawatha and mudjekeewis out of childhood into manhood now had grown my hiawatha skilled in all the craft of hunters learned in all the lore of old men in all youthful sports and pastimes in all manly arts and labors swift of foot was hiawatha he could shoot an arrow from him and run forward with such fleetness that the arrow fell behind him strong of arm was hiawatha he could shoot ten arrows upward shoot them with such strength and swiftness that the tenth had left the bowstring ere the first to earth had fallen he had mittens minjekahwun magic mittens made of deerskin when upon his hands he wore them he could smite the rocks asunder he could grind them into powder he had moccasins enchanted magic moccasins of deerskin when he bound them round his ankles when upon his feet he tied them at each stride a mile he measured much he questioned old nokomis of his father mudjekeewis learned from her the fatal secret of the beauty of his mother of the falsehood of his father and his heart was hot within him like a living coal his heart was then he said to old nokomis i will go to mudjekeewis see how fares it with my father at the doorways of the westwind at the portals of the sunset from his lodge went hiawatha dressed for travel armed for hunting dressed in deerskin shirt and leggings richly wrought with quills and wampum on his head his eaglefeathers round his waist his belt of wampum in his hand his bow of ashwood strung with sinews of the reindeer in his quiver oaken arrows tipped with jasper winged with feathers with his mittens minjekahwun with his moccasins enchanted warning said the old nokomis go not forth o hiawatha to the kingdom of the westwind to the realms of mudjekeewis lest he harm you with his magic lest he kill you with his cunning but the fearless hiawatha heeded not her womans warning forth he strode into the forest at each stride a mile he measured lurid seemed the sky above him lurid seemed the earth beneath him hot and close the air around him filled with smoke and fiery vapors as of burning woods and prairies for his heart was hot within him like a living coal his heart was so he journeyed westward westward left the fleetest deer behind him left the antelope and bison crossed the rushing esconaba crossed the mighty mississippi passed the mountains of the prairie passed the land of crows and foxes passed the dwellings of the blackfeet came unto the rocky mountains to the kingdom of the westwind where upon the gusty summits sat the ancient mudjekeewis ruler of the winds of heaven filled with awe was hiawatha at the aspect of his father on the air about him wildly tossed and streamed his cloudy tresses gleamed like drifting snow his tresses glared like ishkoodah the comet like the star with fiery tresses filled with joy was mudjekeewis when he looked on hiawatha saw his youth rise up before him in the face of hiawatha saw the beauty of wenonah from the grave rise up before him welcome said he hiawatha to the kingdom of the westwind long have i been waiting for you youth is lovely age is lonely youth is fiery age is frosty you bring back the days departed you bring back my youth of passion and the beautiful wenonah many days they talked together questioned listened waited answered much the mighty mudjekeewis boasted of his ancient prowess of his perilous adventures his indomitable courage his invulnerable body patiently sat hiawatha listening to his fathers boasting with a smile he sat and listened uttered neither threat nor menace neither word nor look betrayed him but his heart was hot within him like a living coal his heart was then he said o mudjekeewis is there nothing that can harm you nothing that you are afraid of and the mighty mudjekeewis grand and gracious in his boasting answered saying there is nothing nothing but the black rock yonder nothing but the fatal wawbeek and he looked at hiawatha with a wise look and benignant with a countenance paternal looked with pride upon the beauty of his tall and graceful figure saying o my hiawatha is there anything can harm you anything you are afraid of but the wary hiawatha paused awhile as if uncertain held his peace as if resolving and then answered there is nothing nothing but the bulrush yonder nothing but the great apukwa and as mudjekeewis rising stretched his hand to pluck the bulrush hiawatha cried in terror cried in welldissembled terror kago kago do not touch it ah kaween said mudjekeewis no indeed i will not touch it then they talked of other matters first of hiawathas brothers first of wabun of the eastwind of the southwind shawondasee of the north kabibonokka then of hiawathas mother of the beautiful wenonah of her birth upon the meadow of her death as old nokomis had remembered and related and he cried o mudjekeewis it was you who killed wenonah took her young life and her beauty broke the lily of the prairie trampled it beneath your footsteps you confess it you confess it and the mighty mudjekeewis tossed upon the wind his tresses bowed his hoary head in anguish with a silent nod assented then up started hiawatha and with threatening look and gesture laid his hand upon the black rock on the fatal wawbeek laid it with his mittens minjekahwun rent the jutting crag asunder smote and crushed it into fragments hurled them madly at his father the remorseful mudjekeewis for his heart was hot within him like a living coal his heart was but the ruler of the westwind blew the fragments backward from him with the breathing of his nostrils with the tempest of his anger blew them back at his assailant seized the bulrush the apukwa dragged it with its roots and fibres from the margin of the meadow from its ooze the giant bulrush long and loud laughed hiawatha then began the deadly conflict hand to hand among the mountains from his eyry screamed the eagle the keneu the great wareagle sat upon the crags around them wheeling flapped his wings above them like a tall tree in the tempest bent and lashed the giant bulrush and in masses huge and heavy crashing fell the fatal wawbeek till the earth shook with the tumult and confusion of the battle and the air was full of shoutings and the thunder of the mountains starting answered baimwawa back retreated mudjekeewis rushing westward oer the mountains stumbling westward down the mountains three whole days retreated fighting still pursued by hiawatha to the doorways of the westwind to the portals of the sunset to the earths remotest border where into the empty spaces sinks the sun as a flamingo drops into her nest at nightfall in the melancholy marshes hold at length cried mudjekeewis hold my son my hiawatha t is impossible to kill me for you cannot kill the immortal i have put you to this trial but to know and prove your courage now receive the prize of valor go back to your home and people live among them toil among them cleanse the earth from all that harms it clear the fishinggrounds and rivers slay all monsters and magicians all the wendigoes the giants all the serpents the kenabeeks as i slew the mishemokwa slew the great bear of the mountains and at last when death draws near you when the awful eyes of pauguk glare upon you in the darkness i will share my kingdom with you ruler shall you be thenceforward of the northwestwind keewaydin of the homewind the keewaydin thus was fought that famous battle in the dreadful days of shahshah in the days long since departed in the kingdom of the westwind still the hunter sees its traces scattered far oer hill and valley sees the giant bulrush growing by the ponds and watercourses sees the masses of the wawbeek lying still in every valley homeward now went hiawatha pleasant was the landscape round him pleasant was the air above him for the bitterness of anger had departed wholly from him from his brain the thought of vengeance from his heart the burning fever only once his pace he slackened only once he paused or halted paused to purchase heads of arrows of the ancient arrowmaker in the land of the dacotahs where the falls of minnehaha flash and gleam among the oaktrees laugh and leap into the valley there the ancient arrowmaker made his arrowheads of sandstone arrowheads of chalcedony arrowheads of flint and jasper smoothed and sharpened at the edges hard and polished keen and costly with him dwelt his darkeyed daughter wayward as the minnehaha with her moods of shade and sunshine eyes that smiled and frowned alternate feet as rapid as the river tresses flowing like the water and as musical a laughter and he named her from the river from the waterfall he named her minnehaha laughing water was it then for heads of arrows arrowheads of chalcedony arrowheads of flint and jasper that my hiawatha halted in the land of the dacotahs was it not to see the maiden see the face of laughing water peeping from behind the curtain hear the rustling of her garments from behind the waving curtain as one sees the minnehaha gleaming glancing through the branches as one hears the laughing water from behind its screen of branches who shall say what thoughts and visions fill the fiery brains of young men who shall say what dreams of beauty filled the heart of hiawatha all he told to old nokomis when he reached the lodge at sunset was the meeting with his father was his fight with mudjekeewis not a word he said of arrows not a word of laughing water v hiawathas fasting you shall hear how hiawatha prayed and fasted in the forest not for greater skill in hunting not for greater craft in fishing not for triumphs in the battle and renown among the warriors but for profit of the people for advantage of the nations first he built a lodge for fasting built a wigwam in the forest by the shining bigseawater in the blithe and pleasant springtime in the moon of leaves he built it and with dreams and visions many seven whole days and nights he fasted on the first day of his fasting through the leafy woods he wandered saw the deer start from the thicket saw the rabbit in his burrow heard the pheasant bena drumming heard the squirrel adjidaumo rattling in his hoard of acorns saw the pigeon the omeme building nests among the pinetrees and in flocks the wildgoose wawa flying to the fenlands northward whirring wailing far above him master of life he cried desponding must our lives depend on these things on the next day of his fasting by the rivers brink he wandered through the muskoday the meadow saw the wild rice mahnomonee saw the blueberry meenahga and the strawberry odahmin and the gooseberry shahbomin and the grapevine the bemahgut trailing oer the alderbranches filling all the air with fragrance master of life he cried desponding must our lives depend on these things on the third day of his fasting by the lake he sat and pondered by the still transparent water saw the sturgeon nahma leaping scattering drops like beads of wampum saw the yellow perch the sahwa like a sunbeam in the water saw the pike the maskenozha and the herring okahahwis and the shawgashee the crawfish master of life he cried desponding must our lives depend on these things on the fourth day of his fasting in his lodge he lay exhausted from his couch of leaves and branches gazing with halfopen eyelids full of shadowy dreams and visions on the dizzy swimming landscape on the gleaming of the water on the splendor of the sunset and he saw a youth approaching dressed in garments green and yellow coming through the purple twilight through the splendor of the sunset plumes of green bent oer his forehead and his hair was soft and golden standing at the open doorway long he looked at hiawatha looked with pity and compassion on his wasted form and features and in accents like the sighing of the southwind in the treetops said he o my hiawatha all your prayers are heard in heaven for you pray not like the others not for greater skill in hunting not for greater craft in fishing not for triumph in the battle nor renown among the warriors but for profit of the people for advantage of the nations from the master of life descending i the friend of man mondamin come to warn you and instruct you how by struggle and by labor you shall gain what you have prayed for rise up from your bed of branches rise o youth and wrestle with me faint with famine hiawatha started from his bed of branches from the twilight of his wigwam forth into the flush of sunset came and wrestled with mondamin at his touch he felt new courage throbbing in his brain and bosom felt new life and hope and vigor run through every nerve and fibre so they wrestled there together in the glory of the sunset and the more they strove and struggled stronger still grew hiawatha till the darkness fell around them and the heron the shuhshuhgah from her nest among the pinetrees gave a cry of lamentation gave a scream of pain and famine t is enough then said mondamin smiling upon hiawatha but tomorrow when the sun sets i will come again to try you and he vanished and was seen not whether sinking as the rain sinks whether rising as the mists rise hiawatha saw not knew not only saw that he had vanished leaving him alone and fainting with the misty lake below him and the reeling stars above him on the morrow and the next day when the sun through heaven descending like a red and burning cinder from the hearth of the great spirit fell into the western waters came mondamin for the trial for the strife with hiawatha came as silent as the dew comes from the empty air appearing into empty air returning taking shape when earth it touches but invisible to all men in its coming and its going thrice they wrestled there together in the glory of the sunset till the darkness fell around them till the heron the shuhshuhgah from her nest among the pinetrees uttered her loud cry of famine and mondamin paused to listen tall and beautiful he stood there in his garments green and yellow to and fro his plumes above him waved and nodded with his breathing and the sweat of the encounter stood like drops of dew upon him and he cried o hiawatha bravely have you wrestled with me thrice have wrestled stoutly with me and the master of life who sees us he will give to you the triumph then he smiled and said tomorrow is the last day of your conflict is the last day of your fasting you will conquer and oercome me make a bed for me to lie in where the rain may fall upon me where the sun may come and warm me strip these garments green and yellow strip this nodding plumage from me lay me in the earth and make it soft and loose and light above me let no hand disturb my slumber let no weed nor worm molest me let not kahgahgee the raven come to haunt me and molest me only come yourself to watch me till i wake and start and quicken till i leap into the sunshine and thus saying he departed peacefully slept hiawatha but he heard the wawonaissa heard the whippoorwill complaining perched upon his lonely wigwam heard the rushing sebowisha heard the rivulet rippling near him talking to the darksome forest heard the sighing of the branches as they lifted and subsided at the passing of the nightwind heard them as one hears in slumber faroff murmurs dreamy whispers peacefully slept hiawatha on the morrow came nokomis on the seventh day of his fasting came with food for hiawatha came imploring and bewailing lest his hunger should oercome him lest his fasting should be fatal but he tasted not and touched not only said to her nokomis wait until the sun is setting till the darkness falls around us till the heron the shuhshuhgah crying from the desolate marshes tells us that the day is ended homeward weeping went nokomis sorrowing for her hiawatha fearing lest his strength should fail him lest his fasting should be fatal he meanwhile sat weary waiting for the coming of mondamin till the shadows pointing eastward lengthened over field and forest till the sun dropped from the heaven floating on the waters westward as a red leaf in the autumn falls and floats upon the water falls and sinks into its bosom and behold the young mondamin with his soft and shining tresses with his garments green and yellow with his long and glossy plumage stood and beckoned at the doorway and as one in slumber walking pale and haggard but undaunted from the wigwam hiawatha came and wrestled with mondamin round about him spun the landscape sky and forest reeled together and his strong heart leaped within him as the sturgeon leaps and struggles in a net to break its meshes like a ring of fire around him blazed and flared the red horizon and a hundred suns seemed looking at the combat of the wrestlers suddenly upon the greensward all alone stood hiawatha panting with his wild exertion palpitating with the struggle and before him breathless lifeless lay the youth with hair dishevelled plumage torn and garments tattered dead he lay there in the sunset and victorious hiawatha made the grave as he commanded stripped the garments from mondamin stripped his tattered plumage from him laid him in the earth and made it soft and loose and light above him and the heron the shuhshuhgah from the melancholy moorlands gave a cry of lamentation gave a cry of pain and anguish homeward then went hiawatha to the lodge of old nokomis and the seven days of his fasting were accomplished and completed but the place was not forgotten where he wrestled with mondamin nor forgotten nor neglected was the grave where lay mondamin sleeping in the rain and sunshine where his scattered plumes and garments faded in the rain and sunshine day by day did hiawatha go to wait and watch beside it kept the dark mould soft above it kept it clean from weeds and insects drove away with scoffs and shoutings kahgahgee the king of ravens till at length a small green feather from the earth shot slowly upward then another and another and before the summer ended stood the maize in all its beauty with its shining robes about it and its long soft yellow tresses and in rapture hiawatha cried aloud it is mondamin yes the friend of man mondamin then he called to old nokomis and iagoo the great boaster showed them where the maize was growing told them of his wondrous vision of his wrestling and his triumph of this new gift to the nations which should be their food forever and still later when the autumn changed the long green leaves to yellow and the soft and juicy kernels grew like wampum hard and yellow then the ripened ears he gathered stripped the withered husks from off them as he once had stripped the wrestler gave the first feast of mondamin and made known unto the people this new gift of the great spirit vi hiawathas friends two good friends had hiawatha singled out from all the others bound to him in closest union and to whom he gave the right hand of his heart in joy and sorrow chibiabos the musician and the very strong man kwasind straight between them ran the pathway never grew the grass upon it singing birds that utter falsehoods storytellers mischiefmakers found no eager ear to listen could not breed illwill between them for they kept each others counsel spake with naked hearts together pondering much and much contriving how the tribes of men might prosper most beloved by hiawatha was the gentle chibiabos he the best of all musicians he the sweetest of all singers beautiful and childlike was he brave as man is soft as woman pliant as a wand of willow stately as a deer with antlers when he sang the village listened all the warriors gathered round him all the women came to hear him now he stirred their souls to passion now he melted them to pity from the hollow reeds he fashioned flutes so musical and mellow that the brook the sebowisha ceased to murmur in the woodland that the woodbirds ceased from singing and the squirrel adjidaumo ceased his chatter in the oaktree and the rabbit the wabasso sat upright to look and listen yes the brook the sebowisha pausing said o chibiabos teach my waves to flow in music softly as your words in singing yes the bluebird the owaissa envious said o chibiabos teach me tones as wild and wayward teach me songs as full of frenzy yes the robin the opechee joyous said o chibiabos teach me tones as sweet and tender teach me songs as full of gladness and the whippoorwill wawonaissa sobbing said o chibiabos teach me tones as melancholy teach me songs as full of sadness all the many sounds of nature borrowed sweetness from his singing all the hearts of men were softened by the pathos of his music for he sang of peace and freedom sang of beauty love and longing sang of death and life undying in the islands of the blessed in the kingdom of ponemah in the land of the hereafter very dear to hiawatha was the gentle chibiabos he the best of all musicians he the sweetest of all singers for his gentleness he loved him and the magic of his singing dear too unto hiawatha was the very strong man kwasind he the strongest of all mortals he the mightiest among many for his very strength he loved him for his strength allied to goodness idle in his youth was kwasind very listless dull and dreamy never played with other children never fished and never hunted not like other children was he but they saw that much he fasted much his manito entreated much besought his guardian spirit lazy kwasind said his mother in my work you never help me in the summer you are roaming idly in the fields and forests in the winter you are cowering oer the firebrands in the wigwam in the coldest days of winter i must break the ice for fishing with my nets you never help me at the door my nets are hanging dripping freezing with the water go and wring them yenadizze go and dry them in the sunshine slowly from the ashes kwasind rose but made no angry answer from the lodge went forth in silence took the nets that hung together dripping freezing at the doorway like a wisp of straw he wrung them like a wisp of straw he broke them could not wring them without breaking such the strength was in his fingers lazy kwasind said his father in the hunt you never help me every bow you touch is broken snapped asunder every arrow yet come with me to the forest you shall bring the hunting homeward down a narrow pass they wandered where a brooklet led them onward where the trail of deer and bison marked the soft mud on the margin till they found all further passage shut against them barred securely by the trunks of trees uprooted lying lengthwise lying crosswise and forbidding further passage we must go back said the old man oer these logs we cannot clamber not a woodchuck could get through them not a squirrel clamber oer them and straightway his pipe he lighted and sat down to smoke and ponder but before his pipe was finished lo the path was cleared before him all the trunks had kwasind lifted to the right hand to the left hand shot the pinetrees swift as arrows hurled the cedars light as lances lazy kwasind said the young men as they sported in the meadow why stand idly looking at us leaning on the rock behind you come and wrestle with the others let us pitch the quoit together lazy kwasind made no answer to their challenge made no answer only rose and slowly turning seized the huge rock in his fingers tore it from its deep foundation poised it in the air a moment pitched it sheer into the river sheer into the swift pauwating where it still is seen in summer once as down that foaming river down the rapids of pauwating kwasind sailed with his companions in the stream he saw a beaver saw ahmeek the king of beavers struggling with the rushing currents rising sinking in the water without speaking without pausing kwasind leaped into the river plunged beneath the bubbling surface through the whirlpools chased the beaver followed him among the islands stayed so long beneath the water that his terrified companions cried alas goodby to kwasind we shall never more see kwasind but he reappeared triumphant and upon his shining shoulders brought the beaver dead and dripping brought the king of all the beavers and these two as i have told you were the friends of hiawatha chibiabos the musician and the very strong man kwasind long they lived in peace together spake with naked hearts together pondering much and much contriving how the tribes of men might prosper vii hiawathas sailing give me of your bark o birchtree of your yellow bark o birchtree growing by the rushing river tall and stately in the valley i a light canoe will build me build a swift cheemaun for sailing that shall float on the river like a yellow leaf in autumn like a yellow waterlily lay aside your cloak o birchtree lay aside your whiteskin wrapper for the summertime is coming and the sun is warm in heaven and you need no whiteskin wrapper thus aloud cried hiawatha in the solitary forest by the rushing taquamenaw when the birds were singing gayly in the moon of leaves were singing and the sun from sleep awaking started up and said behold me gheezis the great sun behold me and the tree with all its branches rustled in the breeze of morning saying with a sigh of patience take my cloak o hiawatha with his knife the tree he girdled just beneath its lowest branches just above the roots he cut it till the sap came oozing outward down the trunk from top to bottom sheer he cleft the bark asunder with a wooden wedge he raised it stripped it from the trunk unbroken give me of your boughs o cedar of your strong and pliant branches my canoe to make more steady make more strong and firm beneath me through the summit of the cedar went a sound a cry of horror went a murmur of resistance but it whispered bending downward take my boughs o hiawatha down he hewed the boughs of cedar shaped them straightway to a framework like two bows he formed and shaped them like two bended bows together give me of your roots o tamarack of your fibrous roots o larchtree my canoe to bind together so to bind the ends together that the water may not enter that the river may not wet me and the larch with all its fibres shivered in the air of morning touched his forehead with its tassels slid with one long sigh of sorrow take them all o hiawatha from the earth he tore the fibres tore the tough roots of the larchtree closely sewed the bark together bound it closely to the framework give me of your balm o firtree of your balsam and your resin so to close the seams together that the water may not enter that the river may not wet me and the firtree tall and sombre sobbed through all its robes of darkness rattled like a shore with pebbles answered wailing answered weeping take my balm o hiawatha and he took the tears of balsam took the resin of the firtree smeared therewith each seam and fissure made each crevice safe from water give me of your quills o hedgehog all your quills o kagh the hedgehog i will make a necklace of them make a girdle for my beauty and two stars to deck her bosom from a hollow tree the hedgehog with his sleepy eyes looked at him shot his shining quills like arrows saying with a drowsy murmur through the tangle of his whiskers take my quills o hiawatha from the ground the quills he gathered all the little shining arrows stained them red and blue and yellow with the juice of roots and berries into his canoe he wrought them round its waist a shining girdle round its bows a gleaming necklace on its breast two stars resplendent thus the birch canoe was builded in the valley by the river in the bosom of the forest and the forests life was in it all its mystery and its magic all the lightness of the birchtree all the toughness of the cedar all the larchs supple sinews and it floated on the river like a yellow leaf in autumn like a yellow waterlily paddles none had hiawatha paddles none he had or needed for his thoughts as paddles served him and his wishes served to guide him swift or slow at will he glided veered to right or left at pleasure then he called aloud to kwasind to his friend the strong man kwasind saying help me clear this river of its sunken logs and sandbars straight into the river kwasind plunged as if he were an otter dived as if he were a beaver stood up to his waist in water to his armpits in the river swam and scouted in the river tugged at sunken logs and branches with his hands he scooped the sandbars with his feet the ooze and tangle and thus sailed my hiawatha down the rushing taquamenaw sailed through all its bends and windings sailed through all its deeps and shallows while his friend the strong man kwasind swam the deeps the shallows waded up and down the river went they in and out among its islands cleared its bed of root and sandbar dragged the dead trees from its channel made its passage safe and certain made a pathway for the people from its springs among the mountains to the waters of pauwating to the bay of taquamenaw viii hiawathas fishing forth upon the gitche gumee on the shining bigseawater with his fishingline of cedar of the twisted bark of cedar forth to catch the sturgeon nahma mishenahma king of fishes in his birch canoe exulting all alone went hiawatha through the clear transparent water he could see the fishes swimming far down in the depths below him see the yellow perch the sahwa like a sunbeam in the water see the shawgashee the crawfish like a spider on the bottom on the white and sandy bottom at the stern sat hiawatha with his fishingline of cedar in his plumes the breeze of morning played as in the hemlock branches on the bows with tail erected sat the squirrel adjidaumo in his fur the breeze of morning played as in the prairie grasses on the white sand of the bottom lay the monster mishenahma lay the sturgeon king of fishes through his gills he breathed the water with his fins he fanned and winnowed with his tail he swept the sandfloor there he lay in all his armor on each side a shield to guard him plates of bone upon his forehead down his sides and back and shoulders plates of bone with spines projecting painted was he with his warpaints stripes of yellow red and azure spots of brown and spots of sable and he lay there on the bottom fanning with his fins of purple as above him hiawatha in his birch canoe came sailing with his fishingline of cedar take my bait cried hiawatha down into the depths beneath him take my bait o sturgeon nahma come up from below the water let us see which is the stronger and he dropped his line of cedar through the clear transparent water waited vainly for an answer long sat waiting for an answer and repeating loud and louder take my bait o king of fishes quiet lay the sturgeon nahma fanning slowly in the water looking up at hiawatha listening to his call and clamor his unnecessary tumult till he wearied of the shouting and he said to the kenozha to the pike the maskenozha take the bait of this rude fellow break the line of hiawatha in his fingers hiawatha felt the loose line jerk and tighten as he drew it in it tugged so that the birch canoe stood endwise like a birch log in the water with the squirrel adjidaumo perched and frisking on the summit full of scorn was hiawatha when he saw the fish rise upward saw the pike the maskenozha coming nearer nearer to him and he shouted through the water esa esa shame upon you you are but the pike kenozha you are not the fish i wanted you are not the king of fishes reeling downward to the bottom sank the pike in great confusion and the mighty sturgeon nahma said to ugudwash the sunfish to the bream with scales of crimson take the bait of this great boaster break the line of hiawatha slowly upward wavering gleaming rose the ugudwash the sunfish seized the line of hiawatha swung with all his weight upon it made a whirlpool in the water whirled the birch canoe in circles round and round in gurgling eddies till the circles in the water reached the faroff sandy beaches till the waterflags and rushes nodded on the distant margins but when hiawatha saw him slowly rising through the water lifting up his disk refulgent loud he shouted in derision esa esa shame upon you you are ugudwash the sunfish you are not the fish i wanted you are not the king of fishes slowly downward wavering gleaming sank the ugudwash the sunfish and again the sturgeon nahma heard the shout of hiawatha heard his challenge of defiance the unnecessary tumult ringing far across the water from the white sand of the bottom up he rose with angry gesture quivering in each nerve and fibre clashing all his plates of armor gleaming bright with all his warpaint in his wrath he darted upward flashing leaped into the sunshine opened his great jaws and swallowed both canoe and hiawatha down into that darksome cavern plunged the headlong hiawatha as a log on some black river shoots and plunges down the rapids found himself in utter darkness groped about in helpless wonder till he felt a great heart beating throbbing in that utter darkness and he smote it in his anger with his fist the heart of nahma felt the mighty king of fishes shudder through each nerve and fibre heard the water gurgle round him as he leaped and staggered through it sick at heart and faint and weary crosswise then did hiawatha drag his birchcanoe for safety lest from out the jaws of nahma in the turmoil and confusion forth he might be hurled and perish and the squirrel adjidaumo frisked and chatted very gayly toiled and tugged with hiawatha till the labor was completed then said hiawatha to him o my little friend the squirrel bravely have you toiled to help me take the thanks of hiawatha and the name which now he gives you for hereafter and forever boys shall call you adjidaumo tailinair the boys shall call you and again the sturgeon nahma gasped and quivered in the water then was still and drifted landward till he grated on the pebbles till the listening hiawatha heard him grate upon the margin felt him strand upon the pebbles knew that nahma king of fishes lay there dead upon the margin then he heard a clang and flapping as of many wings assembling heard a screaming and confusion as of birds of prey contending saw a gleam of light above him shining through the ribs of nahma saw the glittering eyes of seagulls of kayoshk the seagulls peering gazing at him through the opening heard them saying to each other t is our brother hiawatha and he shouted from below them cried exulting from the caverns o ye seagulls o my brothers i have slain the sturgeon nahma make the rifts a little larger with your claws the openings widen set me free from this dark prison and henceforward and forever men shall speak of your achievements calling you kayoshk the seagulls yes kayoshk the noble scratchers and the wild and clamorous seagulls toiled with beak and claws together made the rifts and openings wider in the mighty ribs of nahma and from peril and from prison from the body of the sturgeon from the peril of the water they released my hiawatha he was standing near his wigwam on the margin of the water and he called to old nokomis called and beckoned to nokomis pointed to the sturgeon nahma lying lifeless on the pebbles with the seagulls feeding on him i have slain the mishenahma slain the king of fishes said he look the seagulls feed upon him yes my friends kayoshk the seagulls drive them not away nokomis they have saved me from great peril in the body of the sturgeon wait until their meal is ended till their craws are full with feasting till they homeward fly at sunset to their nests among the marshes then bring all your pots and kettles and make oil for us in winter and she waited till the sun set till the pallid moon the nightsun rose above the tranquil water till kayoshk the sated seagulls from their banquet rose with clamor and across the fiery sunset winged their way to faroff islands to their nests among the rushes to his sleep went hiawatha and nokomis to her labor toiling patient in the moonlight till the sun and moon changed places till the sky was red with sunrise and kayoshk the hungry seagulls came back from the reedy islands clamorous for their morning banquet three whole days and nights alternate old nokomis and the seagulls stripped the oily flesh of nahma till the waves washed through the ribbones till the seagulls came no longer and upon the sands lay nothing but the skeleton of nahma ix hiawatha and the pearlfeather on the shores of gitche gumee of the shining bigseawater stood nokomis the old woman pointing with her finger westward oer the water pointing westward to the purple clouds of sunset fiercely the red sun descending burned his way along the heavens set the sky on fire behind him as warparties when retreating burn the prairies on their wartrail and the moon the nightsun eastward suddenly starting from his ambush followed fast those bloody footprints followed in that fiery wartrail with its glare upon his features and nokomis the old woman pointing with her finger westward spake these words to hiawatha yonder dwells the great pearlfeather megissogwon the magician manito of wealth and wampum guarded by his fiery serpents guarded by the black pitchwater you can see his fiery serpents the kenabeek the great serpents coiling playing in the water you can see the black pitchwater stretching far away beyond them to the purple clouds of sunset he it was who slew my father by his wicked wiles and cunning when he from the moon descended when he came on earth to seek me he the mightiest of magicians sends the fever from the marshes sends the pestilential vapors sends the poisonous exhalations sends the white fog from the fenlands sends disease and death among us take your bow o hiawatha take your arrows jasperheaded take your warclub puggawaugun and your mittens minjekahwun and your birchcanoe for sailing and the oil of mishenahma so to smear its sides that swiftly you may pass the black pitchwater slay this merciless magician save the people from the fever that he breathes across the fenlands and avenge my fathers murder straightway then my hiawatha armed himself with all his wargear launched his birchcanoe for sailing with his palm its sides he patted said with glee cheemaun my darling o my birchcanoe leap forward where you see the fiery serpents where you see the black pitchwater forward leaped cheemaun exulting and the noble hiawatha sang his warsong wild and woful and above him the wareagle the keneu the great wareagle master of all fowls with feathers screamed and hurtled through the heavens soon he reached the fiery serpents the kenabeek the great serpents lying huge upon the water sparkling rippling in the water lying coiled across the passage with their blazing crests uplifted breathing fiery fogs and vapors so that none could pass beyond them but the fearless hiawatha cried aloud and spake in this wise let me pass my way kenabeek let me go upon my journey and they answered hissing fiercely with their fiery breath made answer back go back o shaugodaya back to old nokomis faintheart then the angry hiawatha raised his mighty bow of ashtree seized his arrows jasperheaded shot them fast among the serpents every twanging of the bowstring was a warcry and a deathcry every whizzing of an arrow was a deathsong of kenabeek weltering in the bloody water dead lay all the fiery serpents and among them hiawatha harmless sailed and cried exulting onward o cheemaun my darling onward to the black pitchwater then he took the oil of nahma and the bows and sides anointed smeared them well with oil that swiftly he might pass the black pitchwater all night long he sailed upon it sailed upon that sluggish water covered with its mould of ages black with rotting waterrushes rank with flags and leaves of lilies stagnant lifeless dreary dismal lighted by the shimmering moonlight and by willothewisps illumined fires by ghosts of dead men kindled in their weary nightencampments all the air was white with moonlight all the water black with shadow and around him the suggema the mosquito sang his warsong and the fireflies wahwahtaysee waved their torches to mislead him and the bullfrog the dahinda thrust his head into the moonlight fixed his yellow eyes upon him sobbed and sank beneath the surface and anon a thousand whistles answered over all the fenlands and the heron the shuhshuhgah far off on the reedy margin heralded the heros coming westward thus fared hiawatha toward the realm of megissogwon toward the land of the pearlfeather till the level moon stared at him in his face stared pale and haggard till the sun was hot behind him till it burned upon his shoulders and before him on the upland he could see the shining wigwam of the manito of wampum of the mightiest of magicians then once more cheemaun he patted to his birchcanoe said onward and it stirred in all its fibres and with one great bound of triumph leaped across the waterlilies leaped through tangled flags and rushes and upon the beach beyond them dryshod landed hiawatha straight he took his bow of ashtree on the sand one end he rested with his knee he pressed the middle stretched the faithful bowstring tighter took an arrow jasperheaded shot it at the shining wigwam sent it singing as a herald as a bearer of his message of his challenge loud and lofty come forth from your lodge pearlfeather hiawatha waits your coming straightway from the shining wigwam came the mighty megissogwon tall of stature broad of shoulder dark and terrible in aspect clad from head to foot in wampum armed with all his warlike weapons painted like the sky of morning streaked with crimson blue and yellow crested with great eaglefeathers streaming upward streaming outward well i know you hiawatha cried he in a voice of thunder in a tone of loud derision hasten back o shaugodaya hasten back among the women back to old nokomis faintheart i will slay you as you stand there as of old i slew her father but my hiawatha answered nothing daunted fearing nothing big words do not smite like warclubs boastful breath is not a bowstring taunts are not so sharp as arrows deeds are better things than words are actions mightier than boastings then began the greatest battle that the sun had ever looked on that the warbirds ever witnessed all a summers day it lasted from the sunrise to the sunset for the shafts of hiawatha harmless hit the shirt of wampum harmless fell the blows he dealt it with his mittens minjekahwun harmless fell the heavy warclub it could dash the rocks asunder but it could not break the meshes of that magic shirt of wampum till at sunset hiawatha leaning on his bow of ashtree wounded weary and desponding with his mighty warclub broken with his mittens torn and tattered and three useless arrows only paused to rest beneath a pinetree from whose branches trailed the mosses and whose trunk was coated over with the deadmans moccasinleather with the fungus white and yellow suddenly from the boughs above him sang the mama the woodpecker aim your arrows hiawatha at the head of megissogwon strike the tuft of hair upon it at their roots the long black tresses there alone can he be wounded winged with feathers tipped with jasper swift flew hiawathas arrow just as megissogwon stooping raised a heavy stone to throw it full upon the crown it struck him at the roots of his long tresses and he reeled and staggered forward plunging like a wounded bison yes like pezhekee the bison when the snow is on the prairie swifter flew the second arrow in the pathway of the other piercing deeper than the other wounding sorer than the other and the knees of megissogwon shook like windy reeds beneath him bent and trembled like the rushes but the third and latest arrow swiftest flew and wounded sorest and the mighty megissogwon saw the fiery eyes of pauguk saw the eyes of death glare at him heard his voice call in the darkness at the feet of hiawatha lifeless lay the great pearlfeather lay the mightiest of magicians then the grateful hiawatha called the mama the woodpecker from his perch among the branches of the melancholy pinetree and in honor of his service stained with blood the tuft of feathers on the little head of mama even to this day he wears it wears the tuft of crimson feathers as a symbol of his service then he stripped the shirt of wampum from the back of megissogwon as a trophy of the battle as a signal of his conquest on the shore he left the body half on land and half in water in the sand his feet were buried and his face was in the water and above him wheeled and clamored the keneu the great wareagle sailing round in narrower circles hovering nearer nearer nearer from the wigwam hiawatha bore the wealth of megissogwon all his wealth of skins and wampum furs of bison and of beaver furs of sable and of ermine wampum belts and strings and pouches quivers wrought with beads of wampum filled with arrows silverheaded homeward then he sailed exulting homeward through the black pitchwater homeward through the weltering serpents with the trophies of the battle with a shout and song of triumph on the shore stood old nokomis on the shore stood chibiabos and the very strong man kwasind waiting for the heros coming listening to his songs of triumph and the people of the village welcomed him with songs and dances made a joyous feast and shouted honor be to hiawatha he has slain the great pearlfeather slain the mightiest of magicians him who sent the fiery fever sent the white fog from the fenlands sent disease and death among us ever dear to hiawatha was the memory of mama and in token of his friendship as a mark of his remembrance he adorned and decked his pipestem with the crimson tuft of feathers with the bloodred crest of mama but the wealth of megissogwon all the trophies of the battle he divided with his people shared it equally among them x hiawathas wooing as unto the bow the cord is so unto the man is woman though she bends him she obeys him though she draws him yet she follows useless each without the other thus the youthful hiawatha said within himself and pondered much perplexed by various feelings listless longing hoping fearing dreaming still of minnehaha of the lovely laughing water in the land of the dacotahs wed a maiden of your people warning said the old nokomis go not eastward go not westward for a stranger whom we know not like a fire upon the hearthstone is a neighbors homely daughter like the starlight or the moonlight is the handsomest of strangers thus dissuading spake nokomis and my hiawatha answered only this dear old nokomis very pleasant is the firelight but i like the starlight better better do i like the moonlight gravely then said old nokomis bring not here an idle maiden bring not here a useless woman hands unskilful feet unwilling bring a wife with nimble fingers heart and hand that move together feet that run on willing errands smiling answered hiawatha in the land of the dacotahs lives the arrowmakers daughter minnehaha laughing water handsomest of all the women i will bring her to your wigwam she shall run upon your errands be your starlight moonlight firelight be the sunlight of my people still dissuading said nokomis bring not to my lodge a stranger from the land of the dacotahs very fierce are the dacotahs often is there war between us there are feuds yet unforgotten wounds that ache and still may open laughing answered hiawatha for that reason if no other would i wed the fair dacotah that our tribes might be united that old feuds might be forgotten and old wounds be healed forever thus departed hiawatha to the land of the dacotahs to the land of handsome women striding over moor and meadow through interminable forests through uninterrupted silence with his moccasins of magic at each stride a mile he measured yet the way seemed long before him and his heart outran his footsteps and he journeyed without resting till he heard the cataracts laughter heard the falls of minnehaha calling to him through the silence pleasant is the sound he murmured pleasant is the voice that calls me on the outskirts of the forests twixt the shadow and the sunshine herds of fallow deer were feeding but they saw not hiawatha to his bow he whispered fail not to his arrow whispered swerve not sent it singing on its errand to the red heart of the roebuck threw the deer across his shoulder and sped forward without pausing at the doorway of his wigwam sat the ancient arrowmaker in the land of the dacotahs making arrowheads of jasper arrowheads of chalcedony at his side in all her beauty sat the lovely minnehaha sat his daughter laughing water plaiting mats of flags and rushes of the past the old mans thoughts were and the maidens of the future he was thinking as he sat there of the days when with such arrows he had struck the deer and bison on the muskoday the meadow shot the wild goose flying southward on the wing the clamorous wawa thinking of the great warparties how they came to buy his arrows could not fight without his arrows ah no more such noble warriors could be found on earth as they were now the men were all like women only used their tongues for weapons she was thinking of a hunter from another tribe and country young and tall and very handsome who one morning in the springtime came to buy her fathers arrows sat and rested in the wigwam lingered long about the doorway looking back as he departed she had heard her father praise him praise his courage and his wisdom would he come again for arrows to the falls of minnehaha on the mat her hands lay idle and her eyes were very dreamy through their thoughts they heard a footstep heard a rustling in the branches and with glowing cheek and forehead with the deer upon his shoulders suddenly from out the woodlands hiawatha stood before them straight the ancient arrowmaker looked up gravely from his labor laid aside the unfinished arrow bade him enter at the doorway saying as he rose to meet him hiawatha you are welcome at the feet of laughing water hiawatha laid his burden threw the red deer from his shoulders and the maiden looked up at him looked up from her mat of rushes said with gentle look and accent you are welcome hiawatha very spacious was the wigwam made of deerskins dressed and whitened with the gods of the dacotahs drawn and painted on its curtains and so tall the doorway hardly hiawatha stooped to enter hardly touched his eaglefeathers as he entered at the doorway then uprose the laughing water from the ground fair minnehaha laid aside her mat unfinished brought forth food and set before them water brought them from the brooklet gave them food in earthen vessels gave them drink in bowls of basswood listened while the guest was speaking listened while her father answered but not once her lips she opened not a single word she uttered yes as in a dream she listened to the words of hiawatha as he talked of old nokomis who had nursed him in his childhood as he told of his companions chibiabos the musician and the very strong man kwasind and of happiness and plenty in the land of the ojibways in the pleasant land and peaceful after many years of warfare many years of strife and bloodshed there is peace between the ojibways and the tribe of the dacotahs thus continued hiawatha and then added speaking slowly that this peace may last forever and our hands be clasped more closely and our hearts be more united give me as my wife this maiden minnehaha laughing water loveliest of dacotah women and the ancient arrowmaker paused a moment ere he answered smoked a little while in silence looked at hiawatha proudly fondly looked at laughing water and made answer very gravely yes if minnehaha wishes let your heart speak minnehaha and the lovely laughing water seemed more lovely as she stood there neither willing nor reluctant as she went to hiawatha softly took the seat beside him while she said and blushed to say it i will follow you my husband this was hiawathas wooing thus it was he won the daughter of the ancient arrowmaker in the land of the dacotahs from the wigwam he departed leading with him laughing water hand in hand they went together through the woodland and the meadow left the old man standing lonely at the doorway of his wigwam heard the falls of minnehaha calling to them from the distance crying to them from afar off fare thee well o minnehaha and the ancient arrowmaker turned again unto his labor sat down by his sunny doorway murmuring to himself and saying thus it is our daughters leave us those we love and those who love us just when they have learned to help us when we are old and lean upon them comes a youth with flaunting feathers with his flute of reeds a stranger wanders piping through the village beckons to the fairest maiden and she follows where he leads her leaving all things for the stranger pleasant was the journey homeward through interminable forests over meadow over mountain over river hill and hollow short it seemed to hiawatha though they journeyed very slowly though his pace he checked and slackened to the steps of laughing water over wide and rushing rivers in his arms he bore the maiden light he thought her as a feather as the plume upon his headgear cleared the tangled pathway for her bent aside the swaying branches made at night a lodge of branches and a bed with boughs of hemlock and a fire before the doorway with the dry cones of the pinetree all the travelling winds went with them oer the meadows through the forest all the stars of night looked at them watched with sleepless eyes their slumber from his ambush in the oaktree peeped the squirrel adjidaumo watched with eager eyes the lovers and the rabbit the wabasso scampered from the path before them peering peeping from his burrow sat erect upon his haunches watched with curious eyes the lovers pleasant was the journey homeward all the birds sang loud and sweetly songs of happiness and heartsease sang the bluebird the owaissa happy are you hiawatha having such a wife to love you sang the robin the opechee happy are you laughing water having such a noble husband from the sky the sun benignant looked upon them through the branches saying to them o my children love is sunshine hate is shadow life is checkered shade and sunshine rule by love o hiawatha from the sky the moon looked at them filled the lodge with mystic splendors whispered to them o my children day is restless night is quiet man imperious woman feeble half is mine although i follow rule by patience laughing water thus it was they journeyed homeward thus it was that hiawatha to the lodge of old nokomis brought the moonlight starlight firelight brought the sunshine of his people minnehaha laughing water handsomest of all the women in the land of the dacotahs in the land of handsome women xi hiawathas weddingfeast you shall hear how paupukkeewis how the handsome yenadizze danced at hiawathas wedding how the gentle chibiabos he the sweetest of musicians sang his songs of love and longing how iagoo the great boaster he the marvellous storyteller told his tales of strange adventure that the feast might be more joyous that the time might pass more gayly and the guests be more contented sumptuous was the feast nokomis made at hiawathas wedding all the bowls were made of basswood white and polished very smoothly all the spoons of horn of bison black and polished very smoothly she had sent through all the village messengers with wands of willow as a sign of invitation as a token of the feasting and the wedding guests assembled clad in all their richest raiment robes of fur and belts of wampum splendid with their paint and plumage beautiful with beads and tassels first they ate the sturgeon nahma and the pike the maskenozha caught and cooked by old nokomis then on pemican they feasted pemican and buffalo marrow haunch of deer and hump of bison yellow cakes of the mondamin and the wild rice of the river but the gracious hiawatha and the lovely laughing water and the careful old nokomis tasted not the food before them only waited on the others only served their guests in silence and when all the guests had finished old nokomis brisk and busy from an ample pouch of otter filled the redstone pipes for smoking with tobacco from the southland mixed with bark of the red willow and with herbs and leaves of fragrance then she said o paupukkeewis dance for us your merry dances dance the beggars dance to please us that the feast may be more joyous that the time may pass more gayly and our guests be more contented then the handsome paupukkeewis he the idle yenadizze he the merry mischiefmaker whom the people called the stormfool rose among the guests assembled skilled was he in sports and pastimes in the merry dance of snowshoes in the play of quoits and ballplay skilled was he in games of hazard in all games of skill and hazard pugasaing the bowl and counters kuntassoo the game of plumstones though the warriors called him faintheart called him coward shaugodaya idler gambler yenadizze little heeded he their jesting little cared he for their insults for the women and the maidens loved the handsome paupukkeewis he was dressed in shirt of doeskin white and soft and fringed with ermine all inwrought with beads of wampum he was dressed in deerskin leggings fringed with hedgehog quills and ermine and in moccasins of buckskin thick with quills and beads embroidered on his head were plumes of swans down on his heels were tails of foxes in one hand a fan of feathers and a pipe was in the other barred with streaks of red and yellow streaks of blue and bright vermilion shone the face of paupukkeewis from his forehead fell his tresses smooth and parted like a womans shining bright with oil and plaited hung with braids of scented grasses as among the guests assembled to the sound of flutes and singing to the sound of drums and voices rose the handsome paupukkeewis and began his mystic dances first he danced a solemn measure very slow in step and gesture in and out among the pinetrees through the shadows and the sunshine treading softly like a panther then more swiftly and still swifter whirling spinning round in circles leaping oer the guests assembled eddying round and round the wigwam till the leaves went whirling with him till the dust and wind together swept in eddies round about him then along the sandy margin of the lake the bigseawater on he sped with frenzied gestures stamped upon the sand and tossed it wildly in the air around him till the wind became a whirlwind till the sand was blown and sifted like great snowdrifts oer the landscape heaping all the shores with sand dunes sand hills of the nagow wudjoo thus the merry paupukkeewis danced his beggars dance to please them and returning sat down laughing there among the guests assembled sat and fanned himself serenely with his fan of turkeyfeathers then they said to chibiabos to the friend of hiawatha to the sweetest of all singers to the best of all musicians sing to us o chibiabos songs of love and songs of longing that the feast may be more joyous that the time may pass more gayly and our guests be more contented and the gentle chibiabos sang in accents sweet and tender sang in tones of deep emotion songs of love and songs of longing looking still at hiawatha looking at fair laughing water sang he softly sang in this wise onaway awake beloved thou the wildflower of the forest thou the wildbird of the prairie thou with eyes so soft and fawnlike if thou only lookest at me i am happy i am happy as the lilies of the prairie when they feel the dew upon them sweet thy breath is as the fragrance of the wildflowers in the morning as their fragrance is at evening in the moon when leaves are falling does not all the blood within me leap to meet thee leap to meet thee as the springs to meet the sunshine in the moon when nights are brightest onaway my heart sings to thee sings with joy when thou art near me as the sighing singing branches in the pleasant moon of strawberries when thou art not pleased beloved then my heart is sad and darkened as the shining river darkens when the clouds drop shadows on it when thou smilest my beloved then my troubled heart is brightened as in sunshine gleam the ripples that the cold wind makes in rivers smiles the earth and smile the waters smile the cloudless skies above us but i lose the way of smiling when thou art no longer near me i myself myself behold me blood of my beating heart behold me oh awake awake beloved onaway awake beloved thus the gentle chibiabos sang his song of love and longing and iagoo the great boaster he the marvellous storyteller he the friend of old nokomis jealous of the sweet musician jealous of the applause they gave him saw in all the eyes around him saw in all their looks and gestures that the wedding guests assembled longed to hear his pleasant stories his immeasurable falsehoods very boastful was iagoo never heard he an adventure but himself had met a greater never any deed of daring but himself had done a bolder never any marvellous story but himself could tell a stranger would you listen to his boasting would you only give him credence no one ever shot an arrow half so far and high as he had ever caught so many fishes ever killed so many reindeer ever trapped so many beaver none could run so fast as he could none could dive so deep as he could none could swim so far as he could none had made so many journeys none had seen so many wonders as this wonderful iagoo as this marvellous storyteller thus his name became a byword and a jest among the people and wheneer a boastful hunter praised his own address too highly or a warrior home returning talked too much of his achievements all his hearers cried iagoo heres iagoo come among us he it was who carved the cradle of the little hiawatha carved its framework out of linden bound it strong with reindeer sinews he it was who taught him later how to make his bows and arrows how to make the bows of ashtree and the arrows of the oaktree so among the guests assembled at my hiawathas wedding sat iagoo old and ugly sat the marvellous storyteller and they said o good iagoo tell us now a tale of wonder tell us of some strange adventure that the feast may be more joyous that the time may pass more gayly and our guests be more contented and iagoo answered straightway you shall hear a tale of wonder you shall hear the strange adventures of osseo the magician from the evening star descending xii the son of the evening star can it be the sun descending oer the level plain of water or the red swan floating flying wounded by the magic arrow staining all the waves with crimson with the crimson of its lifeblood filling all the air with splendor with the splendor of its plumage yes it is the sun descending sinking down into the water all the sky is stained with purple all the water flushed with crimson no it is the red swan floating diving down beneath the water to the sky its wings are lifted with its blood the waves are reddened over it the star of evening melts and trembles through the purple hangs suspended in the twilight no it is a bead of wampum on the robes of the great spirit as he passes through the twilight walks in silence through the heavens this with joy beheld iagoo and he said in haste behold it see the sacred star of evening you shall hear a tale of wonder hear the story of osseo son of the evening star osseo once in days no more remembered ages nearer the beginning when the heavens were closer to us and the gods were more familiar in the northland lived a hunter with ten young and comely daughters tall and lithe as wands of willow only oweenee the youngest she the wilful and the wayward she the silent dreamy maiden was the fairest of the sisters all these women married warriors married brave and haughty husbands only oweenee the youngest laughed and flouted all her lovers all her young and handsome suitors and then married old osseo old osseo poor and ugly broken with age and weak with coughing always coughing like a squirrel ah but beautiful within him was the spirit of osseo from the evening star descended star of evening star of woman star of tenderness and passion all its fire was in his bosom all its beauty in his spirit all its mystery in his being all its splendor in his language and her lovers the rejected handsome men with belts of wampum handsome men with paint and feathers pointed at her in derision followed her with jest and laughter but she said i care not for you care not for your belts of wampum care not for your paint and feathers care not for your jests and laughter i am happy with osseo once to some great feast invited through the damp and dusk of evening walked together the ten sisters walked together with their husbands slowly followed old osseo with fair oweenee beside him all the others chatted gayly these two only walked in silence at the western sky osseo gazed intent as if imploring often stopped and gazed imploring at the trembling star of evening at the tender star of woman and they heard him murmur softly ah showain nemeshin nosa pity pity me my father listen said the eldest sister he is praying to his father what a pity that the old man does not stumble in the pathway does not break his neck by falling and they laughed till all the forest rang with their unseemly laughter on their pathway through the woodlands lay an oak by storms uprooted lay the great trunk of an oaktree buried half in leaves and mosses mouldering crumbling huge and hollow and osseo when he saw it gave a shout a cry of anguish leaped into its yawning cavern at one end went in an old man wasted wrinkled old and ugly from the other came a young man tall and straight and strong and handsome thus osseo was transfigured thus restored to youth and beauty but alas for good osseo and for oweenee the faithful strangely too was she transfigured changed into a weak old woman with a staff she tottered onward wasted wrinkled old and ugly and the sisters and their husbands laughed until the echoing forest rang with their unseemly laughter but osseo turned not from her walked with slower step beside her took her hand as brown and withered as an oakleaf is in winter called her sweetheart nenemoosha soothed her with soft words of kindness till they reached the lodge of feasting till they sat down in the wigwam sacred to the star of evening to the tender star of woman wrapt in visions lost in dreaming at the banquet sat osseo all were merry all were happy all were joyous but osseo neither food nor drink he tasted neither did he speak nor listen but as one bewildered sat he looking dreamily and sadly first at oweenee then upward at the gleaming sky above them then a voice was heard a whisper coming from the starry distance coming from the empty vastness low and musical and tender and the voice said o osseo o my son my best beloved broken are the spells that bound you all the charms of the magicians all the magic powers of evil come to me ascend osseo taste the food that stands before you it is blessed and enchanted it has magic virtues in it it will change you to a spirit all your bowls and all your kettles shall be wood and clay no longer but the bowls be changed to wampum and the kettles shall be silver they shall shine like shells of scarlet like the fire shall gleam and glimmer and the women shall no longer bear the dreary doom of labor but be changed to birds and glisten with the beauty of the starlight painted with the dusky splendors of the skies and clouds of evening what osseo heard as whispers what as words he comprehended was but music to the others music as of birds afar off of the whippoorwill afar off of the lonely wawonaissa singing in the darksome forest then the lodge began to tremble straight began to shake and tremble and they felt it rising rising slowly through the air ascending from the darkness of the treetops forth into the dewy starlight till it passed the topmost branches and behold the wooden dishes all were changed to shells of scarlet and behold the earthen kettles all were changed to bowls of silver and the roofpoles of the wigwam were as glittering rods of silver and the roof of bark upon them as the shining shards of beetles then osseo gazed around him and he saw the nine fair sisters all the sisters and their husbands changed to birds of various plumage some were jays and some were magpies others thrushes others blackbirds and they hopped and sang and twittered perked and fluttered all their feathers strutted in their shining plumage and their tails like fans unfolded only oweenee the youngest was not changed but sat in silence wasted wrinkled old and ugly looking sadly at the others till osseo gazing upward gave another cry of anguish such a cry as he had uttered by the oaktree in the forest then returned her youth and beauty and her soiled and tattered garments were transformed to robes of ermine and her staff became a feather yes a shining silver feather and again the wigwam trembled swayed and rushed through airy currents through transparent cloud and vapor and amid celestial splendors on the evening star alighted as a snowflake falls on snowflake as a leaf drops on a river as the thistledown on water forth with cheerful words of welcome came the father of osseo he with radiant locks of silver he with eyes serene and tender and he said my son osseo hang the cage of birds you bring there hang the cage with rods of silver and the birds with glistening feathers at the doorway of my wigwam at the door he hung the birdcage and they entered in and gladly listened to osseos father ruler of the star of evening as he said o my osseo i have had compassion on you given you back your youth and beauty into birds of various plumage changed your sisters and their husbands changed them thus because they mocked you in the figure of the old man in that aspect sad and wrinkled could not see your heart of passion could not see your youth immortal only oweenee the faithful saw your naked heart and loved you in the lodge that glimmers yonder in the little star that twinkles through the vapors on the left hand lives the envious evil spirit the wabeno the magician who transformed you to an old man take heed lest his beams fall on you for the rays he darts around him are the power of his enchantment are the arrows that he uses many years in peace and quiet on the peaceful star of evening dwelt osseo with his father many years in song and flutter at the doorway of the wigwam hung the cage with rods of silver and fair oweenee the faithful bore a son unto osseo with the beauty of his mother with the courage of his father and the boy grew up and prospered and osseo to delight him made him little bows and arrows opened the great cage of silver and let loose his aunts and uncles all those birds with glossy feathers for his little son to shoot at round and round they wheeled and darted filled the evening star with music with their songs of joy and freedom filled the evening star with splendor with the fluttering of their plumage till the boy the little hunter bent his bow and shot an arrow shot a swift and fatal arrow and a bird with shining feathers at his feet fell wounded sorely but o wondrous transformation t was no bird he saw before him t was a beautiful young woman with the arrow in her bosom when her blood fell on the planet on the sacred star of evening broken was the spell of magic powerless was the strange enchantment and the youth the fearless bowman suddenly felt himself descending held by unseen hands but sinking downward through the empty spaces downward through the clouds and vapors till he rested on an island on an island green and grassy yonder in the bigseawater after him he saw descending all the birds with shining feathers fluttering falling wafted downward like the painted leaves of autumn and the lodge with poles of silver with its roof like wings of beetles like the shining shards of beetles by the winds of heaven uplifted slowly sank upon the island bringing back the good osseo bringing oweenee the faithful then the birds again transfigured reassumed the shape of mortals took their shape but not their stature they remained as little people like the pygmies the pukwudjies and on pleasant nights of summer when the evening star was shining hand in hand they danced together on the islands craggy headlands on the sandbeach low and level still their glittering lodge is seen there on the tranquil summer evenings and upon the shore the fisher sometimes hears their happy voices sees them dancing in the starlight when the story was completed when the wondrous tale was ended looking round upon his listeners solemnly iagoo added there are great men i have known such whom their people understand not whom they even make a jest of scoff and jeer at in derision from the story of osseo let us learn the fate of jesters all the wedding guests delighted listened to the marvellous story listened laughing and applauding and they whispered to each other does he

banquet ended and the wedding guests departed leaving hiawatha happy with the night and minnehaha xiii blessing the cornfields sing o song of hiawatha of the happy days that followed in the land of the ojibways in the pleasant land and peaceful sing the mysteries of mondamin sing the blessing of the cornfields buried was the bloody hatchet buried was the dreadful warclub buried were all warlike weapons and the warcry was forgotten there was peace among the nations unmolested roved the hunters built the birch canoe for sailing caught the fish in lake and river shot the deer and trapped the beaver unmolested worked the women made their sugar from the maple gathered wild rice in the meadows dressed the skins of deer and beaver all around the happy village stood the maizefields green and shining waved the green plumes of mondamin waved his soft and sunny tresses filling all the land with plenty t was the women who in springtime planted the broad fields and fruitful buried in the earth mondamin t was the women who in autumn stripped the yellow husks of harvest stripped the garments from mondamin even as hiawatha taught them once when all the maize was planted hiawatha wise and thoughtful spake and said to minnehaha to his wife the laughing water you shall bless tonight the cornfields draw a magic circle round them to protect them from destruction blast of mildew blight of insect wagemin the thief of cornfields paimosaid who steals the maizeear in the night when all is silence in the night when all is darkness when the spirit of sleep nepahwin shuts the doors of all the wigwams so that not an ear can hear you so that not an eye can see you rise up from your bed in silence lay aside your garments wholly walk around the fields you planted round the borders of the cornfields covered by your tresses only robed with darkness as a garment thus the fields shall be more fruitful and the passing of your footsteps draw a magic circle round them so that neither blight nor mildew neither burrowing worm nor insect shall pass oer the magic circle not the dragonfly kwoneshe nor the spider subbekashe nor the grasshopper pahpukkeena nor the mighty caterpillar waymukkwana with the bearskin king of all the caterpillars on the treetops near the cornfields sat the hungry crows and ravens kahgahgee the king of ravens with his band of black marauders and they laughed at hiawatha till the treetops shook with laughter with their melancholy laughter at the words of hiawatha hear him said they hear the wise man hear the plots of hiawatha when the noiseless night descended broad and dark oer field and forest when the mournful wawonaissa sorrowing sang among the hemlocks and the spirit of sleep nepahwin shut the doors of all the wigwams from her bed rose laughing water laid aside her garments wholly and with darkness clothed and guarded unashamed and unaffrighted walked securely round the cornfields drew the sacred magic circle of her footprints round the cornfields no one but the midnight only saw her beauty in the darkness no one but the wawonaissa heard the panting of her bosom guskewau the darkness wrapped her closely in his sacred mantle so that none might see her beauty so that none might boast i saw her on the morrow as the day dawned kahgahgee the king of ravens gathered all his black marauders crows and blackbirds jays and ravens clamorous on the dusky treetops and descended fast and fearless on the fields of hiawatha on the grave of the mondamin we will drag mondamin said they from the grave where he is buried spite of all the magic circles laughing water draws around it spite of all the sacred footprints minnehaha stamps upon it but the wary hiawatha ever thoughtful careful watchful had oerheard the scornful laughter when they mocked him from the treetops kaw he said my friends the ravens kahgahgee my king of ravens i will teach you all a lesson that shall not be soon forgotten he had risen before the daybreak he had spread oer all the cornfields snares to catch the black marauders and was lying now in ambush in the neighboring grove of pinetrees waiting for the crows and blackbirds waiting for the jays and ravens soon they came with caw and clamor rush of wings and cry of voices to their work of devastation settling down upon the cornfields delving deep with beak and talon for the body of mondamin and with all their craft and cunning all their skill in wiles of warfare they perceived no danger near them till their claws became entangled till they found themselves imprisoned in the snares of hiawatha from his place of ambush came he striding terrible among them and so awful was his aspect that the bravest quailed with terror without mercy he destroyed them right and left by tens and twenties and their wretched lifeless bodies hung aloft on poles for scarecrows round the consecrated cornfields as a signal of his vengeance as a warning to marauders only kahgahgee the leader kahgahgee the king of ravens he alone was spared among them as a hostage for his people with his prisonerstring he bound him led him captive to his wigwam tied him fast with cords of elmbark to the ridgepole of his wigwam kahgahgee my raven said he you the leader of the robbers you the plotter of this mischief the contriver of this outrage i will keep you i will hold you as a hostage for your people as a pledge of good behavior and he left him grim and sulky sitting in the morning sunshine on the summit of the wigwam croaking fiercely his displeasure flapping his great sable pinions vainly struggling for his freedom vainly calling on his people summer passed and shawondasee breathed his sighs oer all the landscape from the southland sent his ardor wafted kisses warm and tender and the maizefield grew and ripened till it stood in all the splendor of its garments green and yellow of its tassels and its plumage and the maizeears full and shining gleamed from bursting sheaths of verdure then nokomis the old woman spake and said to minnehaha t is the moon when leaves are falling all the wildrice has been gathered and the maize is ripe and ready let us gather in the harvest let us wrestle with mondamin strip him of his plumes and tassels of his garments green and yellow and the merry laughing water went rejoicing from the wigwam with nokomis old and wrinkled and they called the women round them called the young men and the maidens to the harvest of the cornfields to the husking of the maizeear on the border of the forest underneath the fragrant pinetrees sat the old men and the warriors smoking in the pleasant shadow in uninterrupted silence looked they at the gamesome labor of the young men and the women listened to their noisy talking to their laughter and their singing heard them chattering like the magpies heard them laughing like the bluejays heard them singing like the robins and wheneer some lucky maiden found a red ear in the husking found a maizeear red as blood is nushka cried they all together nushka you shall have a sweetheart you shall have a handsome husband ugh the old men all responded from their seats beneath the pinetrees and wheneer a youth or maiden found a crooked ear in husking found a maizeear in the husking blighted mildewed or misshapen then they laughed and sang together crept and limped about the cornfields mimicked in their gait and gestures some old man bent almost double singing singly or together wagemin the thief of cornfields paimosaid who steals the maizeear till the cornfields rang with laughter till from hiawathas wigwam kahgahgee the king of ravens screamed and quivered in his anger and from all the neighboring treetops cawed and croaked the black marauders ugh the old men all responded from their seats beneath the pinetrees xiv picturewriting in those days said hiawatha lo how all things fade and perish from the memory of the old men pass away the great traditions the achievements of the warriors the adventures of the hunters all the wisdom of the medas all the craft of the wabenos all the marvellous dreams and visions of the jossakeeds the prophets great men die and are forgotten wise men speak their words of wisdom perish in the ears that hear them do not reach the generations that as yet unborn are waiting in the great mysterious darkness of the speechless days that shall be on the graveposts of our fathers are no signs no figures painted who are in those graves we know not only know they are our fathers of what kith they are and kindred from what old ancestral totem be it eagle bear or beaver they descended this we know not only know they are our fathers face to face we speak together but we cannot speak when absent cannot send our voices from us to the friends that dwell afar off cannot send a secret message but the bearer learns our secret may pervert it may betray it may reveal it unto others thus said hiawatha walking in the solitary forest pondering musing in the forest on the welfare of his people from his pouch he took his colors took his paints of different colors on the smooth bark of a birchtree painted many shapes and figures wonderful and mystic figures and each figure had a meaning each some word or thought suggested gitche manito the mighty he the master of life was painted as an egg with points projecting to the four winds of the heavens everywhere is the great spirit was the meaning of this symbol mitche manito the mighty he the dreadful spirit of evil as a serpent was depicted as kenabeek the great serpent very crafty very cunning is the creeping spirit of evil was the meaning of this symbol life and death he drew as circles life was white but death was darkened sun and moon and stars he painted man and beast and fish and reptile forests mountains lakes and rivers for the earth he drew a straight line for the sky a bow above it white the space between for daytime filled with little stars for nighttime on the left a point for sunrise on the right a point for sunset on the top a point for noontide and for rain and cloudy weather waving lines descending from it footprints pointing towards a wigwam were a sign of invitation were a sign of guests assembling bloody hands with palms uplifted were a symbol of destruction were a hostile sign and symbol all these things did hiawatha show unto his wondering people and interpreted their meaning and he said behold your graveposts have no mark no sign nor symbol go and paint them all with figures each one with its household symbol with its own ancestral totem so that those who follow after may distinguish them and know them and they painted on the graveposts on the graves yet unforgotten each his own ancestral totem each the symbol of his household figures of the bear and reindeer of the turtle crane and beaver each inverted as a token that the owner was departed that the chief who bore the symbol lay beneath in dust and ashes and the jossakeeds the prophets the wabenos the magicians and the medicinemen the medas painted upon bark and deerskin figures for the songs they chanted for each song a separate symbol figures mystical and awful figures strange and brightly colored and each figure had its meaning each some magic song suggested the great spirit the creator flashing light through all the heaven the great serpent the kenabeek with his bloody crest erected creeping looking into heaven in the sky the sun that listens and the moon eclipsed and dying owl and eagle crane and henhawk and the cormorant bird of magic headless men that walk the heavens bodies lying pierced with arrows bloody hands of death uplifted flags on graves and great warcaptains grasping both the earth and heaven such as these the shapes they painted on the birchbark and the deerskin songs of war and songs of hunting songs of medicine and of magic all were written in these figures for each figure had its meaning each its separate song recorded nor forgotten was the lovesong the most subtle of all medicines the most potent spell of magic dangerous more than war or hunting thus the lovesong was recorded symbol and interpretation first a human figure standing painted in the brightest scarlet t is the lover the musician and the meaning is my painting makes me powerful over others then the figure seated singing playing on a drum of magic and the interpretation listen t is my voice you hear my singing then the same red figure seated in the shelter of a wigwam and the meaning of the symbol i will come and sit beside you in the mystery of my passion then two figures man and woman standing hand in hand together with their hands so clasped together that they seemed in one united and the words thus represented are i see your heart within you and your cheeks are red with blushes next the maiden on an island in the centre of an island and the song this shape suggested was though you were at a distance were upon some faroff island such the spell i cast upon you such the magic power of passion i could straightway draw you to me then the figure of the maiden sleeping and the lover near her whispering to her in her slumbers saying though you were far from me in the land of sleep and silence still the voice of love would reach you and the last of all the figures was a heart within a circle drawn within a magic circle and the image had this meaning naked lies your heart before me to your naked heart i whisper thus it was that hiawatha in his wisdom taught the people all the mysteries of painting all the art of picturewriting on the smooth bark of the birchtree on the white skin of the reindeer on the graveposts of the village xv hiawathas lamentation in those days the evil spirits all the manitos of mischief fearing hiawathas wisdom and his love for chibiabos jealous of their faithful friendship and their noble words and actions made at length a league against them to molest them and destroy them hiawatha wise and wary often said to chibiabos o my brother do not leave me lest the evil spirits harm you chibiabos young and heedless laughing shook his coalblack tresses answered ever sweet and childlike do not fear for me o brother harm and evil come not near me once when peboan the winter roofed with ice the bigseawater when the snowflakes whirling downward hissed among the withered oakleaves changed the pinetrees into wigwams covered all the earth with silence armed with arrows shod with snowshoes heeding not his brothers warning fearing not the evil spirits forth to hunt the deer with antlers all alone went chibiabos right across the bigseawater sprang with speed the deer before him with the wind and snow he followed oer the treacherous ice he followed wild with all the fierce commotion and the rapture of the hunting but beneath the evil spirits lay in ambush waiting for him broke the treacherous ice beneath him dragged him downward to the bottom buried in the sand his body unktahee the god of water he the god of the dacotahs drowned him in the deep abysses of the lake of gitche gumee from the headlands hiawatha sent forth such a wail of anguish such a fearful lamentation that the bison paused to listen and the wolves howled from the prairies and the thunder in the distance starting answered baimwawa then his face with black he painted with his robe his head he covered in his wigwam sat lamenting seven long weeks he sat lamenting uttering still this moan of sorrow he is dead the sweet musician he the sweetest of all singers he has gone from us forever he has moved a little nearer to the master of all music to the master of all singing o my brother chibiabos and the melancholy firtrees waved their dark green fans above him waved their purple cones above him sighing with him to console him mingling with his lamentation their complaining their lamenting came the spring and all the forest looked in vain for chibiabos sighed the rivulet sebowisha sighed the rushes in the meadow from the treetops sang the bluebird sang the bluebird the owaissa chibiabos chibiabos he is dead the sweet musician from the wigwam sang the robin sang the robin the opechee chibiabos chibiabos he is dead the sweetest singer and at night through all the forest went the whippoorwill complaining wailing went the wawonaissa chibiabos chibiabos he is dead the sweet musician he the sweetest of all singers then the medicinemen the medas the magicians the wabenos and the jossakeeds the prophets came to visit hiawatha built a sacred lodge beside him to appease him to console him walked in silent grave procession bearing each a pouch of healing skin of beaver lynx or otter filled with magic roots and simples filled with very potent medicines when he heard their steps approaching hiawatha ceased lamenting called no more on chibiabos naught he questioned naught he answered but his mournful head uncovered from his face the mourning colors washed he slowly and in silence slowly and in silence followed onward to the sacred wigwam there a magic drink they gave him made of nahmawusk the spearmint and wabenowusk the yarrow roots of power and herbs of healing beat their drums and shook their rattles chanted singly and in chorus mystic songs like these they chanted i myself myself behold me t is the great gray eagle talking come ye white crows come and hear him the loudspeaking thunder helps me all the unseen spirits help me i can hear their voices calling all around the sky i hear them i can blow you strong my brother i can heal you hiawatha hiauha replied the chorus wayhaway the mystic chorus friends of mine are all the serpents hear me shake my skin of henhawk mahng the white loon i can kill him i can shoot your heart and kill it i can blow you strong my brother i can heal you hiawatha hiauha replied the chorus wayhaway the mystic chorus i myself myself the prophet when i speak the wigwam trembles shakes the sacred lodge with terror hands unseen begin to shake it when i walk the sky i tread on bends and makes a noise beneath me i can blow you strong my brother rise and speak o hiawatha hiauha replied the chorus wayhaway the mystic chorus then they shook their medicinepouches oer the head of hiawatha danced their medicinedance around him and upstarting wild and haggard like a man from dreams awakened he was healed of all his madness as the clouds are swept from heaven straightway from his brain departed all his moody melancholy as the ice is swept from rivers straightway from his heart departed all his sorrow and affliction then they summoned chibiabos from his grave beneath the waters from the sands of gitche gumee summoned hiawathas brother and so mighty was the magic of that cry and invocation that he heard it as he lay there underneath the bigseawater from the sand he rose and listened heard the music and the singing came obedient to the summons to the doorway of the wigwam but to enter they forbade him through a chink a coal they gave him through the door a burning firebrand ruler in the land of spirits ruler oer the dead they made him telling him a fire to kindle for all those that died thereafter campfires for their night encampments on their solitary journey to the kingdom of ponemah to the land of the hereafter from the village of his childhood from the homes of those who knew him passing silent through the forest like a smokewreath wafted sideways slowly vanished chibiabos where he passed the branches moved not where he trod the grasses bent not and the fallen leaves of last year made no sound beneath his footstep four whole days he journeyed onward down the pathway of the dead men on the deadmans strawberry feasted crossed the melancholy river on the swinging log he crossed it came unto the lake of silver in the stone canoe was carried to the islands of the blessed to the land of ghosts and shadows on that journey moving slowly many weary spirits saw he panting under heavy burdens laden with warclubs bows and arrows robes of fur and pots and kettles and with food that friends had given for that solitary journey ay why do the living said they lay such heavy burdens on us better were it to go naked better were it to go fasting than to bear such heavy burdens on our long and weary journey forth then issued hiawatha wandered eastward wandered westward teaching men the use of simples and the antidotes for poisons and the cure of all diseases thus was first made known to mortals all the mystery of medamin all the sacred art of healing xvi paupukkeewis you shall hear how paupukkeewis he the handsome yenadizze whom the people called the stormfool vexed the village with disturbance you shall hear of all his mischief and his flight from hiawatha and his wondrous transmigrations and the end of his adventures on the shores of gitche gumee on the dunes of nagow wudjoo by the shining bigseawater stood the lodge of paupukkeewis it was he who in his frenzy whirled these drifting sands together on the dunes of nagow wudjoo when among the guests assembled he so merrily and madly danced at hiawathas wedding danced the beggars dance to please them now in search of new adventures from his lodge went paupukkeewis came with speed into the village found the young men all assembled in the lodge of old iagoo listening to his monstrous stories to his wonderful adventures he was telling them the story of ojeeg the summermaker how he made a hole in heaven how he climbed up into heaven and let out the summerweather the perpetual pleasant summer how the otter first essayed it how the beaver lynx and badger tried in turn the great achievement from the summit of the mountain smote their fists against the heavens smote against the sky their foreheads cracked the sky but could not break it how the wolverine uprising made him ready for the encounter bent his knees down like a squirrel drew his arms back like a cricket once he leaped said old iagoo once he leaped and lo above him bent the sky as ice in rivers when the waters rise beneath it twice he leaped and lo above him cracked the sky as ice in rivers when the freshet is at highest thrice he leaped and lo above him broke the shattered sky asunder and he disappeared within it and ojeeg the fisher weasel with a bound went in behind him hark you shouted paupukkeewis as he entered at the doorway i am tired of all this talking tired of old iagoos stories tired of hiawathas wisdom here is something to amuse you better than this endless talking then from out his pouch of wolfskin forth he drew with solemn manner all the game of bowl and counters pugasaing with thirteen pieces white on one side were they painted and vermilion on the other two kenabeeks or great serpents two ininewug or wedgemen one great warclub pugamaugun and one slender fish the keego four round pieces ozawabeeks and three sheshebwug or ducklings all were made of bone and painted all except the ozawabeeks these were brass on one side burnished and were black upon the other in a wooden bowl he placed them shook and jostled them together threw them on the ground before him thus exclaiming and explaining red side up are all the pieces and one great kenabeek standing on the bright side of a brass piece on a burnished ozawabeek thirteen tens and eight are counted then again he shook the pieces shook and jostled them together threw them on the ground before him still exclaiming and explaining white are both the great kenabeeks white the ininewug the wedgemen red are all the other pieces five tens and an eight are counted thus he taught the game of hazard thus displayed it and explained it running through its various chances various changes various meanings twenty curious eyes stared at him full of eagerness stared at him many games said old iagoo many games of skill and hazard have i seen in different nations have i played in different countries he who plays with old iagoo must have very nimble fingers though you think yourself so skilful i can beat you paupukkeewis i can even give you lessons in your game of bowl and counters so they sat and played together all the old men and the young men played for dresses weapons wampum played till midnight played till morning played until the yenadizze till the cunning paupukkeewis of their treasures had despoiled them of the best of all their dresses shirts of deerskin robes of ermine belts of wampum crests of feathers warlike weapons pipes and pouches twenty eyes glared wildly at him like the eyes of wolves glared at him said the lucky paupukkeewis in my wigwam i am lonely in my wanderings and adventures i have need of a companion fain would have a meshinauwa an attendant and pipebearer i will venture all these winnings all these garments heaped about me all this wampum all these feathers on a single throw will venture all against the young man yonder t was a youth of sixteen summers t was a nephew of iagoo faceinamist the people called him as the fire burns in a pipehead dusky red beneath the ashes so beneath his shaggy eyebrows glowed the eyes of old iagoo ugh he answered very fiercely ugh they answered all and each one seized the wooden bowl the old man closely in his bony fingers clutched the fatal bowl onagon shook it fiercely and with fury made the pieces ring together as he threw them down before him red were both the great kenabeeks red the ininewug the wedgemen red the sheshebwug the ducklings black the four brass ozawabeeks white alone the fish the keego only five the pieces counted then the smiling paupukkeewis shook the bowl and threw the pieces lightly in the air he tossed them and they fell about him scattered dark and bright the ozawabeeks red and white the other pieces and upright among the others one ininewug was standing even as crafty paupukkeewis stood alone among the players saying five tens mine the game is twenty eyes glared at him fiercely like the eyes of wolves glared at him as he turned and left the wigwam followed by his meshinauwa by the nephew of iagoo by the tall and graceful stripling bearing in his arms the winnings shirts of deerskin robes of ermine belts of wampum pipes and weapons carry them said paupukkeewis pointing with his fan of feathers to my wigwam far to eastward on the dunes of nagow wudjoo hot and red with smoke and gambling were the eyes of paupukkeewis as he came forth to the freshness of the pleasant summer morning all the birds were singing gayly all the streamlets flowing swiftly and the heart of paupukkeewis sang with pleasure as the birds sing beat with triumph like the streamlets as he wandered through the village in the early gray of morning with his fan of turkeyfeathers with his plumes and tufts of swans down till he reached the farthest wigwam reached the lodge of hiawatha silent was it and deserted no one met him at the doorway no one came to bid him welcome but the birds were singing round it in and out and round the doorway hopping singing fluttering feeding and aloft upon the ridgepole kahgahgee the king of ravens sat with fiery eyes and screaming flapped his wings at paupukkeewis all are gone the lodge is empty thus it was spake paupukkeewis in his heart resolving mischief gone is wary hiawatha gone the silly laughing water gone nokomis the old woman and the lodge is left unguarded by the neck he seized the raven whirled it round him like a rattle like a medicinepouch he shook it strangled kahgahgee the raven from the ridgepole of the wigwam left its lifeless body hanging as an insult to its master as a taunt to hiawatha with a stealthy step he entered round the lodge in wild disorder threw the household things about him piled together in confusion bowls of wood and earthen kettles robes of buffalo and beaver skins of otter lynx and ermine as an insult to nokomis as a taunt to minnehaha then departed paupukkeewis whistling singing through the forest whistling gayly to the squirrels who from hollow boughs above him dropped their acornshells upon him singing gayly to the wood birds who from out the leafy darkness answered with a song as merry then he climbed the rocky headlands looking oer the gitche gumee perched himself upon their summit waiting full of mirth and mischief the return of hiawatha stretched upon his back he lay there far below him plashed the waters plashed and washed the dreamy waters far above him swam the heavens swam the dizzy dreamy heavens round him hovered fluttered rustled hiawathas mountain chickens flockwise swept and wheeled about him almost brushed him with their pinions and he killed them as he lay there slaughtered them by tens and twenties threw their bodies down the headland threw them on the beach below him till at length kayoshk the seagull perched upon a crag above them shouted it is paupukkeewis he is slaying us by hundreds send a message to our brother tidings send to hiawatha xvii the hunting of paupukkeewis full of wrath was hiawatha when he came into the village found the people in confusion heard of all the misdemeanors all the malice and the mischief of the cunning paupukkeewis hard his breath came through his nostrils through his teeth he buzzed and muttered words of anger and resentment hot and humming like a hornet i will slay this paupukkeewis slay this mischiefmaker said he not so long and wide the world is not so rude and rough the way is that my wrath shall not attain him that my vengeance shall not reach him then in swift pursuit departed hiawatha and the hunters on the trail of paupukkeewis through the forest where he passed it to the headlands where he rested but they found not paupukkeewis only in the trampled grasses in the whortleberrybushes found the couch where he had rested found the impress of his body from the lowlands far beneath them from the muskoday the meadow paupukkeewis turning backward made a gesture of defiance made a gesture of derision and aloud cried hiawatha from the summit of the mountains not so long and wide the world is not so rude and rough the way is but my wrath shall overtake you and my vengeance shall attain you over rock and over river through bush and brake and forest ran the cunning paupukkeewis like an antelope he bounded till he came unto a streamlet in the middle of the forest to a streamlet still and tranquil that had overflowed its margin to a dam made by the beavers to a pond of quiet water where kneedeep the trees were standing where the water lilies floated where the rushes waved and whispered on the dam stood paupukkeewis on the dam of trunks and branches through whose chinks the water spouted oer whose summit flowed the streamlet from the bottom rose the beaver looked with two great eyes of wonder eyes that seemed to ask a question at the stranger paupukkeewis on the dam stood paupukkeewis oer his ankles flowed the streamlet flowed the bright and silvery water and he spake unto the beaver with a smile he spake in this wise o my friend ahmeek the beaver cool and pleasant is the water let me dive into the water let me rest there in your lodges change me too into a beaver cautiously replied the beaver with reserve he thus made answer let me first consult the others let me ask the other beavers down he sank into the water heavily sank he as a stone sinks down among the leaves and branches brown and matted at the bottom on the dam stood paupukkeewis oer his ankles flowed the streamlet spouted through the chinks below him dashed upon the stones beneath him spread serene and calm before him and the sunshine and the shadows fell in flecks and gleams upon him fell in little shining patches through the waving rustling branches from the bottom rose the beavers silently above the surface rose one head and then another till the pond seemed full of beavers full of black and shining faces to the beavers paupukkeewis spake entreating said in this wise very pleasant is your dwelling o my friends and safe from danger can you not with all your cunning all your wisdom and contrivance change me too into a beaver yes replied ahmeek the beaver he the king of all the beavers let yourself slide down among us down into the tranquil water down into the pond among them silently sank paupukkeewis black became his shirt of deerskin black his moccasins and leggings in a broad black tail behind him spread his foxtails and his fringes he was changed into a beaver make me large said paupukkeewis make me large and make me larger larger than the other beavers yes the beaver chief responded when our lodge below you enter in our wigwam we will make you ten times larger than the others thus into the clear brown water silently sank paupukkeewis found the bottom covered over with the trunks of trees and branches hoards of food against the winter piles and heaps against the famine found the lodge with arching doorway leading into spacious chambers here they made him large and larger made him largest of the beavers ten times larger than the others you shall be our ruler said they chief and king of all the beavers but not long had paupukkeewis sat in state among the beavers when there came a voice of warning from the watchman at his station in the waterflags and lilies saying here is hiawatha hiawatha with his hunters then they heard a cry above them heard a shouting and a tramping heard a crashing and a rushing and the water round and oer them sank and sucked away in eddies and they knew their dam was broken on the lodges roof the hunters leaped and broke it all asunder streamed the sunshine through the crevice sprang the beavers through the doorway hid themselves in deeper water in the channel of the streamlet but the mighty paupukkeewis could not pass beneath the doorway he was puffed with pride and feeding he was swollen like a bladder through the roof looked hiawatha cried aloud o paupukkeewis vain are all your craft and cunning vain your manifold disguises well i know you paupukkeewis with their clubs they beat and bruised him beat to death poor paupukkeewis pounded him as maize is pounded till his skull was crushed to pieces six tall hunters lithe and limber bore him home on poles and branches bore the body of the beaver but the ghost the jeebi in him thought and felt as paupukkeewis still lived on as paupukkeewis and it fluttered strove and struggled waving hither waving thither as the curtains of a wigwam struggle with their thongs of deerskin when the wintry wind is blowing till it drew itself together till it rose up from the body till it took the form and features of the cunning paupukkeewis vanishing into the forest but the wary hiawatha saw the figure ere it vanished saw the form of paupukkeewis glide into the soft blue shadow of the pinetrees of the forest toward the squares of white beyond it toward an opening in the forest like a wind it rushed and panted bending all the boughs before it and behind it as the rain comes came the steps of hiawatha to a lake with many islands came the breathless paupukkeewis where among the waterlilies pishnekuh the brant were sailing through the tufts of rushes floating steering through the reedy islands now their broad black beaks they lifted now they plunged beneath the water now they darkened in the shadow now they brightened in the sunshine pishnekuh cried paupukkeewis pishnekuh my brothers said he change me to a brant with plumage with a shining neck and feathers make me large and make me larger ten times larger than the others straightway to a brant they changed him with two huge and dusky pinions with a bosom smooth and rounded with a bill like two great paddles made him larger than the others ten times larger than the largest just as shouting from the forest on the shore stood hiawatha up they rose with cry and clamor with a whir and beat of pinions rose up from the reedy islands from the waterflags and lilies and they said to paupukkeewis in your flying look not downward take good heed and look not downward lest some strange mischance should happen lest some great mishap befall you fast and far they fled to northward fast and far through mist and sunshine fed among the moors and fenlands slept among the reeds and rushes on the morrow as they journeyed buoyed and lifted by the southwind wafted onward by the southwind blowing fresh and strong behind them rose a sound of human voices rose a clamor from beneath them from the lodges of a village from the people miles beneath them for the people of the village saw the flock of brant with wonder saw the wings of paupukkeewis flapping far up in the ether broader than two doorway curtains paupukkeewis heard the shouting knew the voice of hiawatha knew the outcry of iagoo and forgetful of the warning drew his neck in and looked downward and the wind that blew behind him caught his mighty fan of feathers sent him wheeling whirling downward all in vain did paupukkeewis struggle to regain his balance whirling round and round and downward he beheld in turn the village and in turn the flock above him saw the village coming nearer and the flock receding farther heard the voices growing louder heard the shouting and the laughter saw no more the flocks above him only saw the earth beneath him dead out of the empty heaven dead among the shouting people with a heavy sound and sullen fell the brant with broken pinions but his soul his ghost his shadow still survived as paupukkeewis took again the form and features of the handsome yenadizze and again went rushing onward followed fast by hiawatha crying not so wide the world is not so long and rough the way is but my wrath shall overtake you but my vengeance shall attain you and so near he came so near him that his hand was stretched to seize him his right hand to seize and hold him when the cunning paupukkeewis whirled and spun about in circles fanned the air into a whirlwind danced the dust and leaves about him and amid the whirling eddies sprang into a hollow oaktree changed himself into a serpent gliding out through root and rubbish with his right hand hiawatha smote amain the hollow oaktree rent it into shreds and splinters left it lying there in fragments but in vain for paupukkeewis once again in human figure full in sight ran on before him sped away in gust and whirlwind on the shores of gitche gumee westward by the bigseawater came unto the rocky headlands to the pictured rocks of sandstone looking over lake and landscape and the old man of the mountain he the manito of mountains opened wide his rocky doorways opened wide his deep abysses giving paupukkeewis shelter in his caverns dark and dreary bidding paupukkeewis welcome to his gloomy lodge of sandstone there without stood hiawatha found the doorways closed against him with his mittens minjekahwun smote great caverns in the sandstone cried aloud in tones of thunder open i am hiawatha but the old man of the mountain opened not and made no answer from the silent crags of sandstone from the gloomy rock abysses then he raised his hands to heaven called imploring on the tempest called waywassimo the lightning and the thunder annemeekee and they came with night and darkness sweeping down the bigseawater from the distant thunder mountains and the trembling paupukkeewis heard the footsteps of the thunder saw the red eyes of the lightning was afraid and crouched and trembled then waywassimo the lightning smote the doorways of the caverns with his warclub smote the doorways smote the jutting crags of sandstone and the thunder annemeekee shouted down into the caverns saying where is paupukkeewis and the crags fell and beneath them dead among the rocky ruins lay the cunning paupukkeewis lay the handsome yenadizze slain in his own human figure ended were his wild adventures ended were his tricks and gambols ended all his craft and cunning ended all his mischiefmaking all his gambling and his dancing all his wooing of the maidens then the noble hiawatha took his soul his ghost his shadow spake and said o paupukkeewis never more in human figure shall you search for new adventures never more with jest and laughter dance the dust and leaves in whirlwinds but above there in the heavens you shall soar and sail in circles i will change you to an eagle to keneu the great wareagle chief of all the fowls with feathers chief of hiawathas chickens and the name of paupukkeewis lingers still among the people lingers still among the singers and among the storytellers and in winter when the snowflakes whirl in eddies round the lodges when the wind in gusty tumult oer the smokeflue pipes and whistles there they cry comes paupukkeewis he is dancing through the village he is gathering in his harvest xviii the death of kwasind far and wide among the nations spread the name and fame of kwasind no man dared to strive with kwasind no man could compete with kwasind but the mischievous pukwudjies they the envious little people they the fairies and the pygmies plotted and conspired against him if this hateful kwasind said they if this great outrageous fellow goes on thus a little longer tearing everything he touches rending everything to pieces filling all the world with wonder what becomes of the pukwudjies who will care for the pukwudjies he will tread us down like mushrooms drive us all into the water give our bodies to be eaten by the wicked neebanawbaigs by the spirits of the water so the angry little people all conspired against the strong man all conspired to murder kwasind yes to rid the world of kwasind the audacious overbearing heartless haughty dangerous kwasind now this wondrous strength of kwasind in his crown alone was seated in his crown too was his weakness there alone could he be wounded nowhere else could weapon pierce him nowhere else could weapon harm him even there the only weapon that could wound him that could slay him was the seedcone of the pinetree was the blue cone of the firtree this was kwasinds fatal secret known to no man among mortals but the cunning little people the pukwudjies knew the secret knew the only way to kill him so they gathered cones together gathered seedcones of the pinetree gathered blue cones of the firtree in the woods by taquamenaw brought them to the rivers margin heaped them in great piles together where the red rocks from the margin jutting overhang the river there they lay in wait for kwasind the malicious little people t was an afternoon in summer very hot and still the air was very smooth the gliding river motionless the sleeping shadows insects glistened in the sunshine insects skated on the water filled the drowsy air with buzzing with a far resounding warcry down the river came the strong man in his birch canoe came kwasind floating slowly down the current of the sluggish taquamenaw very languid with the weather very sleepy with the silence from the overhanging branches from the tassels of the birchtrees soft the spirit of sleep descended by his airy hosts surrounded his invisible attendants came the spirit of sleep nepahwin like a burnished dushkwoneshe like a dragonfly he hovered oer the drowsy head of kwasind to his ear there came a murmur as of waves upon a seashore as of faroff tumbling waters as of winds among the pinetrees and he felt upon his forehead blows of little airy warclubs wielded by the slumbrous legions of the spirit of sleep nepahwin as of some one breathing on him at the first blow of their warclubs fell a drowsiness on kwasind at the second blow they smote him motionless his paddle rested at the third before his vision reeled the landscape into darkness very sound asleep was kwasind so he floated down the river like a blind man seated upright floated down the taquamenaw underneath the trembling birchtrees underneath the wooded headlands underneath the war encampment of the pygmies the pukwudjies there they stood all armed and waiting hurled the pinecones down upon him struck him on his brawny shoulders on his crown defenceless struck him death to kwasind was the sudden warcry of the little people and he sideways swayed and tumbled sideways fell into the river plunged beneath the sluggish water headlong as an otter plunges and the birch canoe abandoned drifted empty down the river bottom upward swerved and drifted nothing more was seen of kwasind but the memory of the strong man lingered long among the people and whenever through the forest raged and roared the wintry tempest and the branches tossed and troubled creaked and groaned and split asunder kwasind cried they that is kwasind he is gathering in his firewood ix the ghosts never stoops the soaring vulture on his quarry in the desert on the sick or wounded bison but another vulture watching from his high aerial lookout sees the downward plunge and follows and a third pursues the second coming from the invisible ether first a speck and then a vulture till the air is dark with pinions so disasters come not singly but as if they watched and waited scanning one anothers motions when the first descends the others follow follow gathering flockwise round their victim sick and wounded first a shadow then a sorrow till the air is dark with anguish now oer all the dreary northland mighty peboan the winter breathing on the lakes and rivers into stone had changed their waters from his hair he shook the snowflakes till the plains were strewn with whiteness one uninterrupted level as if stooping the creator with his hand had smoothed them over through the forest wide and wailing roamed the hunter on his snowshoes in the village worked the women pounded maize or dressed the deerskin and the young men played together on the ice the noisy ballplay on the plain the dance of snowshoes one dark evening after sundown in her wigwam laughing water sat with old nokomis waiting for the steps of hiawatha homeward from the hunt returning on their faces gleamed the firelight painting them with streaks of crimson in the eyes of old nokomis glimmered like the watery moonlight in the eyes of laughing water glistened like the sun in water and behind them crouched their shadows in the corners of the wigwam and the smoke in wreaths above them climbed and crowded through the smokeflue then the curtain of the doorway from without was slowly lifted brighter glowed the fire a moment and a moment swerved the smokewreath as two women entered softly passed the doorway uninvited without word of salutation without sign of recognition sat down in the farthest corner crouching low among the shadows from their aspect and their garments strangers seemed they in the village very pale and haggard were they as they sat there sad and silent trembling cowering with the shadows was it the wind above the smokeflue muttering down into the wigwam was it the owl the kokokoho hooting from the dismal forest sure a voice said in the silence these are corpses clad in garments these are ghosts that come to haunt you from the kingdom of ponemah from the land of the hereafter homeward now came hiawatha from his hunting in the forest with the snow upon his tresses and the red deer on his shoulders at the feet of laughing water down he threw his lifeless burden nobler handsomer she thought him than when first he came to woo her first threw down the deer before her as a token of his wishes as a promise of the future then he turned and saw the strangers cowering crouching with the shadows said within himself who are they what strange guests has minnehaha but he questioned not the strangers only spake to bid them welcome to his lodge his food his fireside when the evening meal was ready and the deer had been divided both the pallid guests the strangers springing from among the shadows seized upon the choicest portions seized the white fat of the roebuck set apart for laughing water for the wife of hiawatha without asking without thanking eagerly devoured the morsels flitted back among the shadows in the corner of the wigwam not a word spake hiawatha not a motion made nokomis not a gesture laughing water not a change came oer their features only minnehaha softly whispered saying they are famished let them do what best delights them let them eat for they are famished many a daylight dawned and darkened many a night shook off the daylight as the pine shakes off the snowflakes from the midnight of its branches day by day the guests unmoving sat there silent in the wigwam but by night in storm or starlight forth they went into the forest bringing firewood to the wigwam bringing pinecones for the burning always sad and always silent and whenever hiawatha came from fishing or from hunting when the evening meal was ready and the food had been divided gliding from their darksome corner came the pallid guests the strangers seized upon the choicest portions set aside for laughing water and without rebuke or question flitted back among the shadows never once had hiawatha by a word or look reproved them never once had old nokomis made a gesture of impatience never once had laughing water shown resentment at the outrage all had they endured in silence that the rights of guest and stranger that the virtue of freegiving by a look might not be lessened by a word might not be broken once at midnight hiawatha ever wakeful ever watchful in the wigwam dimly lighted by the brands that still were burning by the glimmering flickering firelight heard a sighing oft repeated heard a sobbing as of sorrow from his couch rose hiawatha from his shaggy hides of bison pushed aside the deerskin curtain saw the pallid guests the shadows sitting upright on their couches weeping in the silent midnight and he said o guests why is it that your hearts are so afflicted that you sob so in the midnight has perchance the old nokomis has my wife my minnehaha wronged or grieved you by unkindness failed in hospitable duties then the shadows ceased from weeping ceased from sobbing and lamenting and they said with gentle voices we are ghosts of the departed souls of those who once were with you from the realms of chibiabos hither have we come to try you hither have we come to warn you cries of grief and lamentation reach us in the blessed islands cries of anguish from the living calling back their friends departed sadden us with useless sorrow therefore have we come to try you no one knows us no one heeds us we are but a burden to you and we see that the departed have no place among the living think of this o hiawatha speak of it to all the people that henceforward and forever they no more with lamentations sadden the souls of the departed in the islands of the blessed do not lay such heavy burdens in the graves of those you bury not such weight of furs and wampum not such weight of pots and kettles for the spirits faint beneath them only give them food to carry only give them fire to light them four days is the spirits journey to the land of ghosts and shadows four its lonely night encampments four times must their fires be lighted therefore when the dead are buried let a fire as night approaches four times on the grave be kindled that the soul upon its journey may not lack the cheerful firelight may not grope about in darkness farewell noble hiawatha we have put you to the trial to the proof have put your patience by the insult of our presence by the outrage of our actions we have found you great and noble fail not in the greater trial faint not in the harder struggle when they ceased a sudden darkness fell and filled the silent wigwam hiawatha heard a rustle as of garments trailing by him heard the curtain of the doorway lifted by a hand he saw not felt the cold breath of the night air for a moment saw the starlight but he saw the ghosts no longer saw no more the wandering spirits from the kingdom of ponemah from the land of the hereafter xx the famine oh the long and dreary winter oh the cold and cruel winter ever thicker thicker thicker froze the ice on lake and river ever deeper deeper deeper fell the snow oer all the landscape fell the covering snow and drifted through the forest round the village hardly from his buried wigwam could the hunter force a passage with his mittens and his snowshoes vainly walked he through the forest sought for bird or beast and found none saw no track of deer or rabbit in the snow beheld no footprints in the ghastly gleaming forest fell and could not rise from weakness perished there from cold and hunger oh the famine and the fever oh the wasting of the famine oh the blasting of the fever oh the wailing of the children oh the anguish of the women all the earth was sick and famished hungry was the air around them hungry was the sky above them and the hungry stars in heaven like the eyes of wolves glared at them into hiawathas wigwam came two other guests as silent as the ghosts were and as gloomy waited not to be invited did not parley at the doorway sat there without word of welcome in the seat of laughing water looked with haggard eyes and hollow at the face of laughing water and the foremost said behold me i am famine bukadawin and the other said behold me i am fever ahkosewin and the lovely minnehaha shuddered as they looked upon her shuddered at the words they uttered lay down on her bed in silence hid her face but made no answer lay there trembling freezing burning at the looks they cast upon her at the fearful words they uttered forth into the empty forest rushed the maddened hiawatha in his heart was deadly sorrow in his face a stony firmness on his brow the sweat of anguish started but it froze and fell not wrapped in furs and armed for hunting with his mighty bow of ashtree with his quiver full of arrows with his mittens minjekahwun into the vast and vacant forest on his snowshoes strode he forward gitche manito the mighty cried he with his face uplifted in that bitter hour of anguish give your children food o father give us food or we must perish give me food for minnehaha for my dying minnehaha through the farresounding forest through the forest vast and vacant rang that cry of desolation but there came no other answer than the echo of his crying than the echo of the woodlands minnehaha minnehaha all day long roved hiawatha in that melancholy forest through the shadow of whose thickets in the pleasant days of summer of that neer forgotten summer he had brought his young wife homeward from the land of the dacotahs when the birds sang in the thickets and the streamlets laughed and glistened and the air was full of fragrance and the lovely laughing water said with voice that did not tremble i will follow you my husband in the wigwam with nokomis with those gloomy guests that watched her with the famine and the fever she was lying the beloved she the dying minnehaha hark she said i hear a rushing hear a roaring and a rushing hear the falls of minnehaha calling to me from a distance no my child said old nokomis t is the nightwind in the pinetrees look she said i see my father standing lonely at his doorway beckoning to me from his wigwam in the land of the dacotahs no my child said old nokomis t is the smoke that waves and beckons ah said she the eyes of pauguk glare upon me in the darkness i can feel his icy fingers clasping mine amid the darkness hiawatha hiawatha and the desolate hiawatha far away amid the forest miles away among the mountains heard that sudden cry of anguish heard the voice of minnehaha calling to him in the darkness hiawatha hiawatha over snowfields waste and pathless under snowencumbered branches homeward hurried hiawatha emptyhanded heavyhearted heard nokomis moaning wailing wahonowin wahonowin would that i had perished for you would that i were dead as you are wahonowin wahonowin and he rushed into the wigwam saw the old nokomis slowly rocking to and fro and moaning saw his lovely minnehaha lying dead and cold before him and his bursting heart within him uttered such a cry of anguish that the forest moaned and shuddered that the very stars in heaven shook and trembled with his anguish then he sat down still and speechless on the bed of minnehaha at the feet of laughing water at those willing feet that never more would lightly run to meet him never more would lightly follow with both hands his face he covered seven long days and nights he sat there as if in a swoon he sat there speechless motionless unconscious of the daylight or the darkness then they buried minnehaha in the snow a grave they made her in the forest deep and darksome underneath the moaning hemlocks clothed her in her richest garments wrapped her in her robes of ermine covered her with snow like ermine thus they buried minnehaha and at night a fire was lighted on her grave four times was kindled for her soul upon its journey to the islands of the blessed from his doorway hiawatha saw it burning in the forest lighting up the gloomy hemlocks from his sleepless bed uprising from the bed of minnehaha stood and watched it at the doorway that it might not be extinguished might not leave her in the darkness farewell said he minnehaha farewell o my laughing water all my heart is buried with you all my thoughts go onward with you come not back again to labor come not back again to suffer where the famine and the fever wear the heart and waste the body soon my task will be completed soon your footsteps i shall follow to the islands of the blessed to the kingdom of ponemah to the land of the hereafter xxi the white mans foot in his lodge beside a river close beside a frozen river sat an old man sad and lonely white his hair was as a snowdrift dull and low his fire was burning and the old man shook and trembled folded in his waubewyon in his tattered whiteskinwrapper hearing nothing but the tempest as it roared along the forest seeing nothing but the snowstorm as it whirled and hissed and drifted all the coals were white with ashes and the fire was slowly dying as a young man walking lightly at the open doorway entered red with blood of youth his cheeks were soft his eyes as stars in springtime bound his forehead was with grasses bound and plumed with scented grasses on his lips a smile of beauty filling all the lodge with sunshine in his hand a bunch of blossoms filling all the lodge with sweetness ah my son exclaimed the old man happy are my eyes to see you sit here on the mat beside me sit here by the dying embers let us pass the night together tell me of your strange adventures of the lands where you have travelled i will tell you of my prowess of my many deeds of wonder from his pouch he drew his peacepipe very old and strangely fashioned made of red stone was the pipehead and the stem a reed with feathers filled the pipe with bark of willow placed a burning coal upon it gave it to his guest the stranger and began to speak in this wise when i blow my breath about me when i breathe upon the landscape motionless are all the rivers hard as stone becomes the water and the young man answered smiling when i blow my breath about me when i breathe upon the landscape flowers spring up oer all the meadows singing onward rush the rivers when i shake my hoary tresses said the old man darkly frowning all the land with snow is covered all the leaves from all the branches fall and fade and die and wither for i breathe and lo they are not from the waters and the marshes rise the wild goose and the heron fly away to distant regions for i speak and lo they are not and whereer my footsteps wander all the wild beasts of the forest hide themselves in holes and caverns and the earth becomes as flintstone when i shake my flowing ringlets said the young man softly laughing showers of rain fall warm and welcome plants lift up their heads rejoicing back into their lakes and marshes come the wild goose and the heron homeward shoots the arrowy swallow sing the bluebird and the robin and whereer my footsteps wander all the meadows wave with blossoms all the woodlands ring with music all the trees are dark with foliage while they spake the night departed from the distant realms of wabun from his shining lodge of silver like a warrior robed and painted came the sun and said behold me gheezis the great sun behold me then the old mans tongue was speechless and the air grew warm and pleasant and upon the wigwam sweetly sang the bluebird and the robin and the stream began to murmur and a scent of growing grasses through the lodge was gently wafted and segwun the youthful stranger more distinctly in the daylight saw the icy face before him it was peboan the winter from his eyes the tears were flowing as from melting lakes the streamlets and his body shrunk and dwindled as the shouting sun ascended till into the air it faded till into the ground it vanished and the young man saw before him on the hearthstone of the wigwam where the fire had smoked and smouldered saw the earliest flower of springtime saw the beauty of the springtime saw the miskodeed in blossom thus it was that in the northland after that unheardof coldness that intolerable winter came the spring with all its splendor all its birds and all its blossoms all its flowers and leaves and grasses sailing on the wind to northward flying in great flocks like arrows like huge arrows shot through heaven passed the swan the mahnahbezee speaking almost as a man speaks and in long lines waving bending like a bowstring snapped asunder came the white goose wawbewawa and in pairs or singly flying mahng the loon with clangorous pinions the blue heron the shuhshuhgah and the grouse the mushkodasa in the thickets and the meadows piped the bluebird the owaissa on the summit of the lodges sang the robin the opechee in the covert of the pinetrees cooed the pigeon the omemee and the sorrowing hiawatha speechless in his infinite sorrow heard their voices calling to him went forth from his gloomy doorway stood and gazed into the heaven gazed upon the earth and waters from his wanderings far to eastward from the regions of the morning from the shining land of wabun homeward now returned iagoo the great traveller the great boaster full of new and strange adventures marvels many and many wonders and the people of the village listened to him as he told them of his marvellous adventures laughing answered him in this wise ugh it is indeed iagoo no one else beholds such wonders he had seen he said a water bigger than the bigseawater broader than the gitche gumee bitter so that none could drink it at each other looked the warriors looked the women at each other smiled and said it cannot be so kaw they said it cannot be so oer it said he oer this water came a great canoe with pinions a canoe with wings came flying bigger than a grove of pinetrees taller than the tallest treetops and the old men and the women looked and tittered at each other kaw they said we dont believe it from its mouth he said to greet him came waywassimo the lightning came the thunder annemeekee and the warriors and the women laughed aloud at poor iagoo kaw they said what tales you tell us in it said he came a people in the great canoe with pinions came he said a hundred warriors painted white were all their faces and with hair their chins were covered and the warriors and the women laughed and shouted in derision like the ravens on the treetops like the crows upon the hemlocks kaw they said what lies you tell us do not think that we believe them only hiawatha laughed not but he gravely spake and answered to their jeering and their jesting true is all iagoo tells us i have seen it in a vision seen the great canoe with pinions seen the people with white faces seen the coming of this bearded people of the wooden vessel from the regions of the morning from the shining land of wabun gitche manito the mighty the great spirit the creator sends them hither on his errand sends them to us with his message wheresoeer they move before them swarms the stinging fly the ahmo swarms the bee the honeymaker wheresoeer they tread beneath them springs a flower unknown among us springs the whitemans foot in blossom let us welcome then the strangers hail them as our friends and brothers and the hearts right hand of friendship give them when they come to see us gitche manito the mighty said this to me in my vision i beheld too in that vision all the secrets of the future of the distant days that shall be i beheld the westward marches of the unknown crowded nations all the land was full of people restless struggling toiling striving speaking many tongues yet feeling but one heartbeat in their bosoms in the woodlands rang their axes smoked their towns in all the valleys over all the lakes and rivers rushed their great canoes of thunder then a darker drearier vision passed before me vague and cloudlike i beheld our nation scattered all forgetful of my counsels weakened warring with each other saw the remnants of our people sweeping westward wild and woful like the cloudrack of a tempest like the withered leaves of autumn xxii hiawathas departure by the shore of gitche gumee by the shining bigseawater at the doorway of his wigwam in the pleasant summer morning hiawatha stood and waited all the air was full of freshness all the earth was bright and joyous and before him through the sunshine westward toward the neighboring forest passed in golden swarms the ahmo passed the bees the honeymakers burning singing in the sunshine bright above him shone the heavens level spread the lake before him from its bosom leaped the sturgeon sparkling flashing in the sunshine on its margin the great forest stood reflected in the water every treetop had its shadow motionless beneath the water from the brow of hiawatha gone was every trace of sorrow as the fog from off the water as the mist from off the meadow with a smile of joy and triumph with a look of exultation as of one who in a vision sees what is to be but is not stood and waited hiawatha toward the sun his hands were lifted both the palms spread out against it and between the parted fingers fell the sunshine on his features flecked with light his naked shoulders as it falls and flecks an oaktree through the rifted leaves and branches oer the water floating flying something in the hazy distance something in the mists of morning loomed and lifted from the water now seemed floating now seemed flying coming nearer nearer nearer was it shingebis the diver or the pelican the shada or the heron the shuhshuhgah or the white goose wawbewawa with the water dripping flashing from its glossy neck and feathers it was neither goose nor diver neither pelican nor heron oer the water floating flying through the shining mist of morning but a birch canoe with paddles rising sinking on the water dripping flashing in the sunshine and within it came a people from the distant land of wabun from the farthest realms of morning came the blackrobe chief the prophet he the priest of prayer the paleface with his guides and his companions and the noble hiawatha with his hands aloft extended held aloft in sign of welcome waited full of exultation till the birch canoe with paddles grated on the shining pebbles stranded on the sandy margin till the blackrobe chief the paleface with the cross upon his bosom landed on the sandy margin then the joyous hiawatha cried aloud and spake in this wise beautiful is the sun o strangers when you come so far to see us all our town in peace awaits you all our doors stand open for you you shall enter all our wigwams for the hearts right hand we give you never bloomed the earth so gayly never shone the sun so brightly as today they shine and blossom when you come so far to see us never was our lake so tranquil nor so free from rocks and sandbars for your birch canoe in passing has removed both rock and sandbar never before had our tobacco such a sweet and pleasant flavor never the broad leaves of our cornfields were so beautiful to look on as they seem to us this morning when you come so far to see us and the blackrobe chief made answer stammered in his speech a little speaking words yet unfamiliar peace be with you hiawatha peace be with you and your people peace of prayer and peace of pardon peace of christ and joy of mary then the generous hiawatha led the strangers to his wigwam seated them on skins of bison seated them on skins of ermine and the careful old nokomis brought them food in bowls of basswood water brought in birchen dippers and the calumet the peacepipe filled and lighted for their smoking all the old men of the village all the warriors of the nation all the jossakeeds the prophets the magicians the wabenos and the medicinemen the medas came to bid the strangers welcome it is well they said o brothers that you come so far to see us in a circle round the doorway with their pipes they sat in silence waiting to behold the strangers waiting to receive their message till the blackrobe chief the paleface from the wigwam came to greet them stammering in his speech a little speaking words yet unfamiliar it is well they said o brother that you come so far to see us then the blackrobe chief the prophet told his message to the people told the purport of his mission told them of the virgin mary and her blessed son the saviour how in distant lands and ages he had lived on earth as we do how he fasted prayed and labored how the jews the tribe accursed mocked him scourged him crucified him how he rose from where they laid him walked again with his disciples and ascended into heaven and the chiefs made answer saying we have listened to your message we have heard your words of wisdom we will think on what you tell us it is well for us o brothers that you come so far to see us then they rose up and departed each one homeward to his wigwam to the young men and the women told the story of the strangers whom the master of life had sent them from the shining land of wabun heavy with the heat and silence grew the afternoon of summer with a drowsy sound the forest whispered round the sultry wigwam with a sound of sleep the water rippled on the beach below it from the cornfields shrill and ceaseless sang the grasshopper pahpukkeena and the guests of hiawatha weary with the heat of summer slumbered in the sultry wigwam slowly oer the simmering landscape fell the evenings dusk and coolness and the long and level sunbeams shot their spears into the forest breaking through its shields of shadow rushed into each secret ambush searched each thicket dingle hollow still the guests of hiawatha slumbered in the silent wigwam from his place rose hiawatha bade farewell to old nokomis spake in whispers spake in this wise did not wake the guests that slumbered i am going o nokomis on a long and distant journey to the portals of the sunset to the regions of the homewind of the northwestwind keewaydin but these guests i leave behind me in your watch and ward i leave them see that never harm comes near them see that never fear molests them never danger nor suspicion never want of food or shelter in the lodge of hiawatha forth into the village went he bade farewell to all the warriors bade farewell to all the young men spake persuading spake in this wise i am going o my people on a long and distant journey many moons and many winters will have come and will have vanished ere i come again to see you but my guests i leave behind me listen to their words of wisdom listen to the truth they tell you for the master of life has sent them from the land of light and morning on the shore stood hiawatha turned and waved his hand at parting on the clear and luminous water launched his birch canoe for sailing from the pebbles of the margin shoved it forth into the water whispered to it westward westward and with speed it darted forward and the evening sun descending set the clouds on fire with redness burned the broad sky like a prairie left upon the level water one long track and trail of splendor down whose stream as down a river westward westward hiawatha sailed into the fiery sunset sailed into the purple vapors sailed into the dusk of evening and the people from the margin watched him floating rising sinking till the birch canoe seemed lifted high into that sea of splendor till it sank into the vapors like the new moon slowly slowly sinking in the purple distance and they said farewell forever said farewell o hiawatha and the forests dark and lonely moved through all their depths of darkness sighed farewell o hiawatha and the waves upon the margin rising rippling on the pebbles sobbed farewell o hiawatha and the heron the shuhshuhgah from her haunts among the fenlands screamed farewell o hiawatha thus departed hiawatha hiawatha the beloved in the glory of the sunset in the purple mists of evening to the regions of the homewind of the northwestwind keewaydin to the islands of the blessed to the kingdom of ponemah to the land of the hereafter notes the song of hiawatha this indian edda if i may so call it is founded on a tradition prevalent among the north american indians of a personage of miraculous birth who was sent among them to clear their rivers forests and fishinggrounds and to teach them

is in albany county new york on the mountains of the prairie mr catlin in his letters and notes on the manners customs and condition of the north american indians vol ii p gives an interesting account of the coteau des prairies and the red pipestone quarry he says here according to their traditions happened the mysterious birth of the red pipe which has blown its fumes of peace and war to the remotest corners of the continent which has visited every warrior and passed through its reddened stem the irrevocable oath of war and desolation and here also the peacebreathing calumet was born and fringed with the eagles quills which has shed its thrilling fumes over the land and soothed the fury of the relentless savage the great spirit at an ancient period here called the indian nations together and standing on the precipice of the red pipestone rock broke from its wall a piece and made a huge pipe by turning it in his hand which he smoked over them and to the north the south the east and the west and told them that this stone was red that it was their flesh that they must use it for their pipes of peace that it belonged to them all and that the warclub and scalpingknife must not be raised on its ground at the last whiff of his pipe his head went into a great cloud and the whole surface of the rock for several miles was melted and glazed two great ovens were opened beneath and two women guardian spirits of the place entered them in a blaze of fire and they are heard there yet tsomeccostee aud tsomecostewondee answering to the invocations of the highpriests or medicinemen who consult them when they are visitors to this sacred place hark you bear you are a coward this anecdote is from heckewelder in his account of the indian nations he describes an indian hunter as addressing a bear in nearly these words i was present he says at the delivery of this curious invective when the hunter had despatched the bear i asked him how he thought that poor animal could understand what he said to it o said he in answer the bear understood me very well did you not observe how ashamed he looked while i was upbraiding him transactions of the american philosophical society vol i p hush the naked bear will hear thee heckewelder in a letter published in the transactions of the american philosophical society vol iv p speaks of this tradition as prevalent among the mohicans and delawares their reports he says run thus that among all animals that had been formerly in this country this was the most ferocious that it was much larger than the largest of the common bears and remarkably longbodied all over except a spot of hair on its back of a white color naked the history of this animal used to be a subject of conversation among the indians especially when in the woods a hunting i have also heard them say to their children when crying hush the naked bear will hear you be upon you and devour you where the falls of minnehaha etc the scenery about fort snelling is rich in beauty the falls of st anthony are familiar to travellers and to readers of indian sketches between the fort and these falls are the little falls forty feet in height on a stream that empties into the mississippi the indians called them minehahhah or laughing waters mrs eastmans dacotah or legends of the sioux introd p ii sand hills of the nagow wudjoo a description of the grand sable or great sanddunes of lake superior is given in foster and whitneys report on the geology of the lake superior land district part ii p the grand sable possesses a scenic interest little inferior to that of the pictured rocks the explorer passes abruptly from a coast of consolidated sand to one of loose materials and although in the one case the cliffs are less precipitous yet in the other they attain a higher altitude he sees before him a long reach of coast resembling a vast sandbank more than three hundred and fifty feet in height without a trace of vegetation ascending to the top rounded hillocks of blown sand are observed with occasional clumps of trees standing out like oases in the desert onaway awake beloved the original of this song may be found in littells living age vol xxv p on the red swan floating flying the fanciful tradition of the red swan may be found in schoolcrafts algic researches vol ii p three brothers were hunting on a wager to see who would bring home the first game they were to shoot no other animal so the legend says but such as each was in the habit of killing they set out different ways odjibwa the youngest had not gone far before he saw a bear an animal he was not to kill by the agreement he followed him close and drove an arrow through him which brought him to the ground although contrary to the bet he immediately commenced skinning him when suddenly something red tinged all the air around him he rubbed his eyes thinking he was perhaps deceived but without effect for the red hue continued at length he heard a strange noise at a distance it first appeared like a human voice but after following the sound for some distance he reached the shores of a lake and soon saw the object he was looking for at a distance out in the lake sat a most beautiful red swan whose plumage glittered in the sun and who would now and then make the same noise he had heard he was within long bowshot and pulling the arrow from the bowstring up to his ear took deliberate aim and shot the arrow took no effect and he shot and shot again till his quiver was empty still the swan remained moving round and round stretching its long neck and dipping its bill into the water as if heedless of the arrows shot at it odjibwa ran home and got all his own and his brothers arrows and shot them all away he then stood and gazed at the beautiful bird while standing he remembered his brothers saying that in their deceased fathers medicinesack were three magic arrows off he started his anxiety to kill the swan overcoming all scruples at any other time he would have deemed it sacrilege to open his fathers medicinesack but now he hastily seized the three arrows and ran back leaving the other contents of the sack scattered over the lodge the swan was still there he shot the first arrow with great precision and came very near to it the second came still closer as he took the last arrow he felt his arm firmer and drawing it up with vigor saw it pass through the neck of the swan a little above the breast still it did not prevent the bird from flying off which it did however at first slowly flapping its wings and rising gradually into the airs and teen flying off toward the sinking of the sun pp when i think of my beloved the original of this song may be found in oneota p sing the mysteries of mondamin the indians hold the maize or indian corn in great veneration they esteem it so important and divine a grain says schoolcraft that their storytellers invented various tales in which this idea is symbolized under the form of a special gift from the great spirit the odjibwaalgonquins who call it mondamin that is the spirits grain or berry have a pretty story of this kind in which the stalk in full tassel is represented as descending from the sky under the guise of a handsome youth in answer to the prayers of a young man at his fast of virility or coming to manhood it is well known that cornplanting and corngathering at least among all the still uncolonized tribes are left entirely to the females and children and a few superannuated old men it is not generally known perhaps that this labor is not compulsory and that it is assumed by the females as a just equivalent in their view for the onerous and continuous labor of the other sex in providing meats and skins for clothing by the chase and in defending their villages against their enemies and keeping intruders off their territories a good indian housewife deems this a part of her prerogative and prides herself to have a store of corn to exercise her hospitality or duly honor her husbands hospitality in the entertainment of the lodge guests oneota p thus the fields shall be more fruitful a singular proof of this belief in both sexes of the mysterious influence of the steps of a woman on the vegetable and in sect creation is found in an ancient custom which was related to me respecting cornplanting it was the practice of the hunters wife when the field of corn had been planted to choose the first dark or overclouded evening to perform a secret circuit sans habillement around the field for this purpose she slipped out of the lodge in the evening unobserved to some obscure nook where she completely disrobed then taking her matchecota or principal garment in one hand she dragged it around the field this was thought to insure a prolific crop and to prevent the assaults of insects and worms upon the grain it was supposed they could not creep over the charmed line oneota p with his prisonerstring he bound him these cords says mr tanner are made of the bark of the elmtree by boiling and then immersing it in cold water the leader of a war party commonly carries several fastened about his waist and if in the course of the fight any one of his young men take a prisoner it is his duty to bring him immediately to the chief to be tied and the latter is responsible for his safe keeping narrative of captivity and adventures p wagemin the thief of cornfields paimosaid who steals the maizeear if one of the young female huskers finds a red ear of corn it is typical of a brave admirer and is regarded as a fitting present to some young warrior but if the ear be crooked and tapering to a point no matter what color the whole circle is set in a roar and wagemin is the word shouted aloud it is the symbol of a thief in the cornfield it is considered as the image of an old man stooping as he enters the lot had the chisel of praxiteles been employed to produce this image it could not more vividly bring to the minds of the merry group the idea of a pilferer of their favorite mondamin the literal meaning of the term is a mass or crooked ear of grain but the ear of corn so called is a conventional type of a little old man pilfering ears of corn in a cornfield it is in this manner that a single word or term in these curious languages becomes the fruitful parent of many ideas and we can thus perceive why it is that the word wagemin is alone competent to excite merriment in the husking circle this term is taken as the basis of the cereal chorus or corn song as sung by the northern algonquin tribes it is coupled with the phrase paimosaid a permutative form of the indian substantive made from the verb pimosa to walk its literal meaning is he who walks or the walker but the ideas conveyed by it are he who walks by night to pilfer corn it offers therefore a kind of parallelism in expression to the preceding term oneota p pugasaing with thirteen pieces this game of the bowl is the principal game of hazard among the northern tribes of indians mr schoolcraft gives a particular account of it in oneota p this game he says is very fascinating to some portions of the indians they stake at it their ornaments weapons clothing canoes horses everything in fact they possess and have been known it is said to set up their wives and children and even to forfeit their own liberty of such desperate stakes i have seen no examples nor do i think the game itself in common use it is rather confined to certain persons who hold the relative rank of gamblers in indian society men who are not noted as hunters or warriors or steady providers for their families among these are persons who bear the term of ienadizzewug that is wanderers about the country braggadocios or fops it can hardly be classed with the popular games of amusement by which skill and dexterity are acquired i have generally found the chiefs and graver men of the tribes who encouraged the young men to play ball and are sure to be present at the customary sports to witness and sanction and applaud them speak lightly and disparagingly of this game of hazard yet it cannot be denied that some of the chiefs distinguished in war and the chase at the west can be referred to as lending their example to its fascinating power see also his history condition and prospects of the indian tribes part ii p to the pictured rocks of sandstone the reader will find a long description of the pictured rocks in foster and whitneys report on the geology of the lake superior land district part ii p from this i make the following extract the pictured rocks may be described in general terms as a series of sandstone bluffs extending along the shore of lake superior for about five miles and rising in most places vertically from the water without any beach at the base to a height varying from fifty to nearly two hundred feet were they simply a line of cliffs they might not so far as relates to height or extent be worthy of a rank among great natural curiosities although such an assemblage of rocky strata washed by the waves of the great lake would not under any circumstances be destitute of grandeur to the voyager coasting along their base in his frail canoe they would at all times be an object of dread the recoil of the surf the rockbound coast affording for miles no place of refuge the lowering sky the rising wind all these would excite his apprehension and induce him to ply a vigorous oar until the dreaded wall was passed but in the pictured rocks there are two features which communicate to the scenery a wonderful and almost unique character these are first the curious manner in which the cliffs have been excavated and worn away by the action of the lake which for centuries has dashed an oceanlike surf against their base and second the equally curious manner in which large portions of the surface have been colored by bands of brilliant hues it is from the latter circumstance that the name by which these cliffs are known to the american traveller is derived while that applied to them by the french voyageurs les portails is derived from the former and by far the most striking peculiarity the term pictured rocks has been in use for a great length of time but when it was first applied we have been unable to discover it would seem that the first travellers were more impressed with the novel and striking distribution of colors on the surface than with the astonishing variety of form into which the cliffs themselves have been worn our voyageurs had many legends to relate of the pranks of the mennibojou in these caverns and in answer to our inquiries seemed disposed to fabricate stories without end of the achievements of this indian deity toward the sun his hands were lifted in this manner and with such salutations was father marquette received by the illinois see his voyages et decouvertes section v end hiawatha notes the courtship of miles standish i miles standish in the old colony days in plymouth the land of the pilgrims to and fro in a room of his simple and primitive dwelling clad in doublet and hose and boots of cordovan leather strode with a martial air miles standish the puritan captain buried in thought he seemed with his hands behind him and pausing ever and anon to behold his glittering weapons of warfare hanging in shining array along the walls of the chamber cutlass and corselet of steel and his trusty sword of damascus curved at the point and inscribed with its mystical arabic sentence while underneath in a corner were fowlingpiece musket and matchlock short of stature he was but strongly built and athletic broad in the shoulders deepchested with muscles and sinews of iron brown as a nut was his face but his russet beard was already flaked with patches of snow as hedges sometimes in november near him was seated john alden his friend and household companion writing with diligent speed at a table of pine by the window fairhaired azureeyed with delicate saxon complexion having the dew of his youth and the beauty thereof as the captives whom saint gregory saw and exclaimed not angles but angels youngest of all was he of the men who came in the mayflower suddenly breaking the silence the diligent scribe interrupting spake in the pride of his heart miles standish the captain of plymouth look at these arms he said the warlike weapons that hang here burnished and bright and clean as if for parade or inspection this is the sword of damascus i fought with in flanders this breastplate well i remember the day once saved my life in a skirmish here in front you can see the very dint of the bullet fired pointblank at my heart by a spanish arcabucero had it not been of sheer steel the forgotten bones of miles standish would at this moment be mould in their grave in the flemish morasses thereupon answered john alden but looked not up from his writing truly the breath of the lord hath slackened the speed of the bullet he in his mercy preserved you to be our shield and our weapon still the captain continued unheeding the words of the stripling see how bright they are burnished as if in an arsenal hanging that is because i have done it myself and not left it to others serve yourself would you be well served is an excellent adage so i take care of my arms as you of your pens and your inkhorn then too there are my soldiers my great invincible army twelve men all equipped having each his rest and his matchlock eighteen shillings a month together with diet and pillage and like caesar i know the name of each of my soldiers this he said with a smile that danced in his eyes as the sunbeams dance on the waves of the sea and vanish again in a moment alden laughed as he wrote and still the captain continued look you can see from this window my brazen howitzer planted high on the roof of the church a preacher who speaks to the purpose steady straightforward and strong with irresistible logic orthodox flashing conviction right into the hearts of the heathen now we are ready i think for any assault of the indians let them come if they like and the sooner they try it the better let them come if they like be it sagamore sachem or powwow aspinet samoset corbitant squanto or tokamahamon long at the window he stood and wistfully gazed on the landscape washed with a cold gray mist the vapory breath of the eastwind forest and meadow and hill and the steelblue rim of the ocean lying silent and sad in the afternoon shadows and sunshine over his countenance flitted a shadow like those on the landscape gloom intermingled with light and his voice was subdued with emotion tenderness pity regret as after a pause he proceeded yonder there on the hill by the sea lies buried rose standish beautiful rose of love that bloomed for me by the wayside she was the first to die of all who came in the mayflower green above her is growing the field of wheat we have sown there better to hide from the indian scouts the graves of our people lest they should count them and see how many already have perished sadly his face he averted and strode up and down and was thoughtful fixed to the opposite wall was a shelf of books and among them prominent three distinguished alike for bulk and for binding bariffes artillery guide and the commentaries of caesar out of the latin translated by arthur goldinge of london and as if guarded by these between them was standing the bible musing a moment before them miles standish paused as if doubtful which of the three he should choose for his consolation and comfort whether the wars of the hebrews the famous campaigns of the romans or the artillery practice designed for belligerent christians finally down from its shelf he dragged the ponderous roman seated himself at the window and opened the book and in silence turned oer the wellworn leaves where thumbmarks thick on the margin like the trample of feet proclaimed the battle was hottest nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling busily writing epistles important to go by the mayflower ready to sail on the morrow or next day at latest god willing homeward bound with the tidings of all that terrible winter letters written by alden and full of the name of priscilla full of the name and the fame of the puritan maiden priscilla ii love and friendship nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling or an occasional sigh from the laboring heart of the captain reading the marvellous words and achievements of julius caesar after a while he exclaimed as he smote with his hand palm downwards heavily on the page a wonderful man was this caesar you are a writer and i am a fighter but here is a fellow who could both write and fight and in both was equally skilful straightway answered and spake john alden the comely the youthful yes he was equally skilled as you say with his pen and his weapons somewhere have i read but where i forget he could dictate seven letters at once at the same time writing his memoirs truly continued the captain not heeding or hearing the other truly a wonderful man was caius julius caesar better be first he said in a little iberian village than be second in rome and i think he was right when he said it twice was he married before he was twenty and many times after battles five hundred he fought and a thousand cities he conquered he too fought in flanders as he himself has recorded finally he was stabbed by his friend the orator brutus now do you know what he did on a certain occasion in flanders when the rearguard of his army retreated the front giving way too and the immortal twelfth legion was crowded so closely together there was no room for their swords why he seized a shield from a soldier put himself straight at the head of his troops and commanded the captains calling on each by his name to order forward the ensigns then to widen the ranks and give more room for their weapons so he won the day the battle of somethingorother thats what i always say if you wish a thing to be well done you must do it yourself you must not leave it to others all was silent again the captain continued his reading nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling writing epistles important to go next day by the mayflower filled with the name and the fame of the puritan maiden priscilla every sentence began or closed with the name of priscilla till the treacherous pen to which he confided the secret strove to betray it by singing and shouting the name of priscilla finally closing his book with a bang of the ponderous cover sudden and loud as the sound of a soldier grounding his musket thus to the young man spake miles standish the captain of plymouth when you have finished your work i have something important to tell you be not however in haste i can wait i shall not be impatient straightway alden replied as he folded the last of his letters pushing his papers aside and giving respectful attention speak for whenever you speak i am always ready to listen always ready to hear whatever pertains to miles standish thereupon answered the captain embarrassed and culling his phrases t is not good for a man to be alone say the scriptures this i have said before and again and again i repeat it every hour in the day i think it and feel it and say it since rose standish died my life has been weary and dreary sick at heart have i been beyond the healing of friendship oft in my lonely hours have i thought of the maiden priscilla she is alone in the world her father and mother and brother died in the winter together i saw her going and coming now to the grave of the dead and now to the bed of the dying patient courageous and strong and said to myself that if ever there were angels on earth as there are angels in heaven two have i seen and known and the angel whose name is priscilla holds in my desolate life the place which the other abandoned long have i cherished the thought but never have dared to reveal it being a coward in this though valiant enough for the most part go to the damsel priscilla the loveliest maiden of plymouth say that a blunt old captain a man not of words but of actions offers his hand and his heart the hand and heart of a soldier not in these words you know but this in short is my meaning i am a maker of war and not a maker of phrases you who are bred as a scholar can say it in elegant language such as you read in your books of the pleadings and wooings of lovers such as you think best adapted to win the heart of a maiden when he had spoken john alden the fairhaired taciturn stripling all aghast at his words surprised embarrassed bewildered trying to mask his dismay by treating the subject with lightness trying to smile and yet feeling his heart stand still in his bosom just as a timepiece stops in a house that is stricken by lightning thus made answer and spake or rather stammered than answered such a message as that i am sure i should mangle and mar it if you would have it well done i am only repeating your maxim you must do it yourself you must not leave it to others but with the air of a man whom nothing can turn from his purpose gravely shaking his head made answer the captain of plymouth truly the maxim is good and i do not mean to gainsay it but we must use it discreetly and not waste powder for nothing now as i said before i was never a maker of phrases i can march up to a fortress and summon the place to surrender but march up to a woman with such a proposal i dare not im not afraid of bullets nor shot from the mouth of a cannon but of a thundering no pointblank from the mouth of a woman that i confess im afraid of nor am i ashamed to confess it so you must grant my request for you are an elegant scholar having the graces of speech and skill in the turning of phrases taking the hand of his friend who still was reluctant and doubtful holding it long in his own and pressing it kindly he added though i have spoken thus lightly yet deep is the feeling that prompts me surely you cannot refuse what i ask in the name of our friendship then made answer john alden the name of friendship is sacred what you demand in that name i have not the power to deny you so the strong will prevailed subduing and moulding the gentler friendship prevailed over love and alden went on his errand iii the lovers errand so the strong will prevailed and alden went on his errand out of the street of the village and into the paths of the forest into the tranquil woods where bluebirds and robins were building towns in the populous trees with hanging gardens of verdure peaceful aerial cities of joy and affection and freedom all around him was calm but within him commotion and conflict love contending with friendship and self with each generous impulse to and fro in his breast his thoughts were heaving and dashing as in a foundering ship with every roll of the vessel washes the bitter sea the merciless surge of the ocean must i relinquish it all he cried with a wild lamentation must i relinquish it all the joy the hope the illusion was it for this i have loved and waited and worshipped in silence was it for this i have followed the flying feet and the shadow over the wintry sea to the desolate shores of new england truly the heart is deceitful and out of its depths of corruption rise like an exhalation the misty phantoms of passion angels of light they seem but are only delusions of satan all is clear to me now i feel it i see it distinctly this is the hand of the lord it is laid upon me in anger for i have followed too much the hearts desires and devices worshipping astaroth blindly and impious idols of baal this is the cross i must bear the sin and the swift retribution so through the plymouth woods john alden went on his errand crossing the brook at the ford where it brawled over pebble and shallow gathering still as he went the mayflowers blooming around him fragrant filling the air with a strange and wonderful sweetness children lost in the woods and covered with leaves in their slumber puritan flowers he said and the type of puritan maidens modest and simple and sweet the very type of priscilla so i will take them to her to priscilla the mayflower of plymouth modest and simple and sweet as a parting gift will i take them breathing their silent farewells as they fade and wither and perish soon to be thrown away as is the heart of the giver so through the plymouth woods john alden went on his errand came to an open space and saw the disk of the ocean sailless sombre and cold with the comfortless breath of the eastwind saw the newbuilt house and people at work in a meadow heard as he drew near the door the musical voice of priscilla singing the hundredth psalm the grand old puritan anthem music that luther sang to the sacred words of the psalmist full of the breath of the lord consoling and comforting many then as he opened the door he beheld the form of the maiden seated beside her wheel and the carded wool like a snowdrift piled at her knee her white hands feeding the ravenous spindle while with her foot on the treadle she guided the wheel in its motion open wide on her lap lay the wellworn psalmbook of ainsworth printed in amsterdam the words and the music together roughhewn angular notes like stones in the wall of a churchyard darkened and overhung by the running vine of the verses such was the book from whose pages she sang the old puritan anthem she the puritan girl in the solitude of the forest making the humble house and the modest apparel of homespun beautiful with her beauty and rich with the wealth of her being over him rushed like a wind that is keen and cold and relentless thoughts of what might have been and the weight and woe of his errand all the dreams that had faded and all the hopes that had vanished all his life henceforth a dreary and tenantless mansion haunted by vain regrets and pallid sorrowful faces still he said to himself and almost fiercely he said it let not him that putteth his hand to the plough look backwards though the ploughshare cut through the flowers of life to its fountains though it pass oer the graves of the dead and the hearths of the living it is the will of the lord and his mercy endureth for ever so he entered the house and the hum of the wheel and the singing suddenly ceased for priscilla aroused by his step on the threshold rose as he entered and gave him her hand in signal of welcome saying i knew it was you when i heard your step in the passage for i was thinking of you as i sat there singing and spinning awkward and dumb with delight that a thought of him had been mingled thus in the sacred psalm that came from the heart of the maiden silent before her he stood and gave her the flowers for an answer finding no words for his thought he remembered that day in the winter after the first great snow when he broke a path from the village reeling and plunging along through the drifts that encumbered the doorway stamping the snow from his feet as he entered the house and priscilla laughed at his snowy locks and gave him a seat by the fireside grateful and pleased to know he had thought of her in the snowstorm had he but spoken then perhaps not in vain had he spoken now it was all too late the golden moment had vanished so he stood there abashed and gave her the flowers for an answer then they sat down and talked of the birds and the beautiful springtime talked of their friends at home and the mayflower that sailed on the morrow i have been thinking all day said gently the puritan maiden dreaming all night and thinking all day of the hedgerows of england they are in blossom now and the country is all like a garden thinking of lanes and fields and the song of the lark and the linnet seeing the village street and familiar faces of neighbors going about as of old and stopping to gossip together and at the end of the street the village church with the ivy climbing the old gray tower and the quiet graves in the churchyard kind are the people i live with and dear to me my religion still my heart is so sad that i wish myself back in old england you will say it is wrong but i cannot help it i almost wish myself back in old england i feel so lonely and wretched thereupon answered the youth indeed i do not condemn you stouter hearts than a womans have quailed in this terrible winter yours is tender and trusting and needs a stronger to lean on so i have come to you now with an offer and proffer of marriage made by a good man and true miles standish the captain of plymouth thus he delivered his message the dexterous writer of letters did not embellish the theme nor array it in beautiful phrases but came straight to the point and blurted it out like a schoolboy even the captain himself could hardly have said it more bluntly mute with amazement and sorrow priscilla the puritan maiden looked into aldens face her eyes dilated with wonder feeling his words like a blow that stunned her and rendered her speechless till at length she exclaimed interrupting the ominous silence if the great captain of plymouth is so very eager to wed me why does he not come himself and take the trouble to woo me if i am not worth the wooing i surely am not worth the winning then john alden began explaining and smoothing the matter making it worse as he went by saying the captain was busy had no time for such things such things the words grating harshly fell on the ear of priscilla and swift as a flash she made answer has he no time for such things as you call it before he is married would he be likely to find it or make it after the wedding that is the way with you men you dont understand us you cannot when you have made up your minds after thinking of this one and that one choosing selecting rejecting comparing one with another then you make known your desire with abrupt and sudden avowal and are offended and hurt and indignant perhaps that a woman does not respond at once to a love that she never suspected does not attain at a bound the height to which you have been climbing this is not right nor just for surely a womans affection is not a thing to be asked for and had for only the asking when one is truly in love one not only says it but shows it had he but waited awhile had he only showed that he loved me even this captain of yours who knows at last might have won me old and rough as he is but now it never can happen still john alden went on unheeding the words of priscilla urging the suit of his friend explaining persuading expanding spoke of his courage and skill and of all his battles in flanders how with the people of god he had chosen to suffer affliction how in return for his zeal they had made him captain of plymouth he was a gentleman born could trace his pedigree plainly back to hugh standish of duxbury hall in lancashire england who was the son of ralph and the grandson of thurston de standish heir unto vast estates of which he was basely defrauded still bore the family arms and had for his crest a cock argent combed and wattled gules and all the rest of the blazon he was a man of honor of noble and generous nature though he was rough he was kindly she knew how during the winter he had attended the sick with a hand as gentle as womans somewhat hasty and hot he could not deny it and headstrong stern as a soldier might be but hearty and placable always not to be laughed at and scorned because he was little of stature for he was great of heart magnanimous courtly courageous any woman in plymouth nay any woman in england might be happy and proud to be called the wife of miles standish but as he warmed and glowed in his simple and eloquent language quite forgetful of self and full of the praise of his rival archly the maiden smiled and with eyes overrunning with laughter said in a tremulous voice why dont you speak for yourself john iv john alden into the open air john alden perplexed and bewildered rushed like a man insane and wandered alone by the seaside paced up and down the sands and bared his head to the eastwind cooling his heated brow and the fire and fever within him slowly as out of the heavens with apocalyptical splendors sank the city of god in the vision of john the apostle so with its cloudy walls of chrysolite jasper and sapphire sank the broad red sun and over its turrets uplifted glimmered the golden reed of the angel who measured the city welcome o wind of the east he exclaimed in his wild exultation welcome o wind of the east from the caves of the misty atlantic blowing oer fields of dulse and measureless meadows of seagrass blowing oer rocky wastes and the grottos and gardens of ocean lay thy cold moist hand on my burning forehead and wrap me close in thy garments of mist to allay the fever within me like an awakened conscience the sea was moaning and tossing beating remorseful and loud the mutable sands of the seashore fierce in his soul was the struggle and tumult of passions contending love triumphant and crowned and friendship wounded and bleeding passionate cries of desire and importunate pleadings of duty is it my fault he said that the maiden has chosen between us is it my fault that he failed my fault that i am the victor then within him there thundered a voice like the voice of the prophet it hath displeased the lord and he thought of davids transgression bathshebas beautiful face and his friend in the front of the battle shame and confusion of guilt and abasement and selfcondemnation overwhelmed him at once and he cried in the deepest contrition it hath displeased the lord it is the temptation of satan then uplifting his head he looked at the sea and beheld there dimly the shadowy form of the mayflower riding at anchor rocked on the rising tide and ready to sail on the morrow heard the voices of men through the mist the rattle of cordage thrown on the deck the shouts of the mate and the sailors ay ay sir clear and distinct but not loud in the dripping air of the twilight still for a moment he stood and listened and stared at the vessel then went hurriedly on as one who seeing a phantom stops then quickens his pace and follows the beckoning shadow yes it is plain to me now he murmured the hand of the lord is leading me out of the land of darkness the bondage of error through the sea that shall lift the walls of its waters around me hiding me cutting me off from the cruel thoughts that pursue me back will i go oer the ocean this dreary land will abandon her whom i may not love and him whom my heart has offended better to be in my grave in the green old churchyard in england close by my mothers side and among the dust of my kindred better be dead and forgotten than living in shame and dishonor sacred and safe and unseen in the dark of the narrow chamber with me my secret shall lie like a buried jewel that glimmers bright on the hand that is dust in the chambers of silence and darkness yes as the marriage ring of the great espousal hereafter thus as he spake he turned in the strength of his strong resolution leaving behind him the shore and hurried along in the twilight through the congenial gloom of the forest silent and sombre till he beheld the lights in the seven houses of plymouth shining like seven stars in the dusk and mist of the evening soon he entered his door and found the redoubtable captain sitting alone and absorbed in the martial pages of caesar fighting some great campaign in hainault or brabant or flanders long have you been on your errand he said with a cheery demeanor even as one who is waiting an answer and fears not the issue not far off is the house although the woods are between us but you have lingered so long that while you were going and coming i have fought ten battles and sacked and demolished a city come sit down and in order relate to me all that has happened then john alden spake and related the wondrous adventure from beginning to end minutely just as it happened how he had seen priscilla and how he had sped in his courtship only smoothing a little and softening down her refusal but when he came at length to the words priscilla had spoken words so tender and cruel why dont you speak for yourself john up leaped the captain of plymouth and stamped on the floor till his armor clanged on the wall where it hung with a sound of sinister omen all his pentup wrath burst forth in a sudden explosion even as a handgrenade that scatters destruction around it wildly he shouted and loud john alden you have betrayed me me miles standish your friend have supplanted defrauded betrayed me one of my ancestors ran his sword through the heart of wat tyler who shall prevent me from running my own through the heart of a traitor yours is the greater treason for yours is a treason to friendship you who lived under my roof whom i cherished and loved as a brother you who have fed at my board and drunk at my cup to whose keeping i have intrusted my honor my thoughts the most sacred and secret you too brutus ah woe to the name of friendship hereafter brutus was caesars friend and you were mine but henceforward let there be nothing between us save war and implacable hatred so spake the captain of plymouth and strode about in the chamber chafing and choking with rage like cords were the veins on his temples but in the midst of his anger a man appeared at the doorway bringing in uttermost haste a message of urgent importance rumors of danger and war and hostile incursions of indians straightway the captain paused and without further question or parley took from the nail on the wall his sword with its scabbard of iron buckled the belt round his waist and frowning fiercely departed alden was left alone he heard the clank of the scabbard growing fainter and fainter and dying away in the distance then he arose from his seat and looked forth into the darkness felt the cool air blow on his cheek that was hot with the insult lifted his eyes to the heavens and folding his hands as in childhood prayed in the silence of night to the father who seeth in secret meanwhile the choleric captain strode wrathful away to the council found it already assembled impatiently waiting his coming men in the middle of life austere and grave in deportment only one of them old the hill that was nearest to heaven covered with snow but erect the excellent elder of plymouth god had sifted three kingdoms to find the wheat for this planting then had sifted the wheat as the living seed of a nation so say the chronicles old and such is the faith of the people near them was standing an indian in attitude stern and defiant naked down to the waist and grim and ferocious in aspect while on the table before them was lying unopened a bible ponderous bound in leather brassstudded printed in holland and beside it outstretched the skin of a rattlesnake glittered filled like a quiver with arrows a signal and challenge of warfare brought by the indian and speaking with arrowy tongues of defiance this miles standish beheld as he entered and heard them debating what were an answer befitting the hostile message and menace talking of this and of that contriving suggesting objecting one voice only for peace and that the voice of the elder judging it wise and well that some at least were converted rather than any were slain for this was but christian behavior then out spake miles standish the stalwart captain of plymouth muttering deep in his throat for his voice was husky with anger what do you mean to make war with milk and the water of roses is it to shoot red squirrels you have your howitzer planted there on the roof of the church or is it to shoot red devils truly the only tongue that is understood by a savage must be the tongue of fire that speaks from the mouth of the cannon thereupon answered and said the excellent elder of plymouth somewhat amazed and alarmed at this irreverent language not so thought saint paul nor yet the other apostles not from the cannons mouth were the tongues of fire they spake with but unheeded fell this mild rebuke on the captain who had advanced to the table and thus continued discoursing leave this matter to me for to me by right it pertaineth war is a terrible trade but in the cause that is righteous sweet is the smell of powder and thus i answer the challenge then from the rattlesnakes skin with a sudden contemptuous gesture jerking the indian arrows he filled it with powder and bullets full to the very jaws and handed it back to the savage saying in thundering tones here take it this is your answer silently out of the room then glided the glistening savage bearing the serpents skin and seeming himself like a serpent winding his sinuous way in the dark to the depths of the forest v the sailing of the mayflower just in the gray of the dawn as the mists uprose from the meadows there was a stir and a sound in the slumbering village of plymouth clanging and clicking of arms and the order imperative forward given in tone suppressed a tramp of feet and then silence figures ten in the mist marched slowly out of the village standish the stalwart it was with eight of his valorous army led by their indian guide by hobomok friend of the white men northward marching to quell the sudden revolt of the savage giants they seemed in the mist or the mighty men of king david giants in heart they were who believed in god and the bible ay who believed in the smiting of midianites and philistines over them gleamed far off the crimson banners of morning under them loud on the sands the serried billows advancing fired along the line and in regular order retreated many a mile had they marched when at length the village of plymouth woke from its sleep and arose intent on its manifold labors sweet was the air and soft and slowly the smoke from the chimneys rose over roofs of thatch and pointed steadily eastward men came forth from the doors and paused and talked of the weather said that the wind had changed and was blowing fair for the mayflower talked of their captains departure and all the dangers that menaced he being gone the town and what should be done in his absence merrily sang the birds and the tender voices of women consecrated with hymns the common cares of the household out of the sea rose the sun and the billows rejoiced at his coming beautiful were his feet on the purple tops of the mountains beautiful on the sails of the mayflower riding at anchor battered and blackened and worn by all the storms of the winter loosely against her masts was hanging and flapping her canvas rent by so many gales and patched by the hands of the sailors suddenly from her side as the sun rose over the ocean darted a puff of smoke and floated seaward anon rang loud over field and forest the cannons roar and the echoes heard and repeated the sound the signalgun of departure ah but with louder echoes replied the hearts of the people meekly in voices subdued the chapter was read from the bible meekly the prayer was begun but ended in fervent entreaty then from their houses in haste came forth the pilgrims of plymouth men and women and children all hurrying down to the seashore eager with tearful eyes to say farewell to the mayflower homeward bound oer the sea and leaving them here in the desert foremost among them was alden all night he had lain without slumber turning and tossing about in the heat and unrest of his fever he had beheld miles standish who came back late from the council stalking into the room and heard him mutter and murmur sometimes it seemed a prayer and sometimes it sounded like swearing once he had come to the bed and stood there a moment in silence then he had turned away and said i will not awake him let him sleep on it is best for what is the use of more talking then he extinguished the light and threw himself down on his pallet dressed as he was and ready to start at the break of the morning covered himself with the cloak he had worn in his campaigns in flanders slept as a soldier sleeps in his bivouac ready for action but with the dawn he arose in the twilight alden beheld him put on his corselet of steel and all the rest of his armor buckle about his waist his trusty blade of damascus take from the corner his musket and so stride out of the chamber often the heart of the youth had burned and yearned to embrace him often his lips had essayed to speak imploring for pardon all the old friendship came back with its tender and grateful emotions but his pride overmastered the nobler nature within him pride and the sense of his wrong and the burning fire of the insult so he beheld his friend departing in anger but spake not saw him go forth to danger perhaps to death and he spake not then he arose from his bed and heard what the people were saying joined in the talk at the door with stephen and richard and gilbert joined in the morning prayer and in the reading of scripture and with the others in haste went hurrying down to the seashore down to the plymouth rock that had been to their feet as a doorstep into a world unknown the cornerstone of a nation there with his boat was the master already a little impatient lest he should lose the tide or the wind might shift to the eastward squarebuilt hearty and strong with an odor of ocean about him speaking with this one and that and cramming letters and parcels into his pockets capacious and messages mingled together into his narrow brain till at last he was wholly bewildered nearer the boat stood alden with one foot placed on the gunwale one still firm on the rock and talking at times with the sailors seated erect on the thwarts all ready and eager for starting he too was eager to go and thus put an end to his anguish thinking to fly from despair that swifter than keel is or canvas thinking to drown in the sea the ghost that would rise and pursue him but as he gazed on the crowd he beheld the form of priscilla standing dejected among them unconscious of all that was passing fixed were her eyes upon his as if she divined his intention fixed with a look so sad so reproachful imploring and patient that with a sudden revulsion his heart recoiled from its purpose as from the verge of a crag where one step more is destruction strange is the heart of man with its quick mysterious instincts strange is the life of man and fatal or fated are moments whereupon turn as on hinges the gates of the wall adamantine here i remain he exclaimed as he looked at the heavens above him thanking the lord whose breath had scattered the mist and the madness wherein blind and lost to death he was staggering headlong yonder snowwhite cloud that floats in the ether above me seems like a hand that is pointing and beckoning over the ocean there is another hand that is not so spectral and ghostlike holding me drawing me back and clasping mine for protection float o hand of cloud and vanish away in the ether roll thyself up like a fist to threaten and daunt me i heed not either your warning or menace or any omen of evil there is no land so sacred no air so pure and so wholesome as is the air she breathes and the soil that is pressed by her footsteps here for her sake will i stay and like an invisible presence hover around her for ever protecting supporting her weakness yes as my foot was the first that stepped on this rock at the landing so with the blessing of god shall it be the last at the leaving meanwhile the master alert but with dignified air and important scanning with watchful eye the tide and the wind and the weather walked about on the sands and the people crowded around him saying a few last words and enforcing his careful remembrance then taking each by the hand as if he were grasping a tiller into the boat he sprang and in haste shoved off to his vessel glad in his heart to get rid of all this worry and flurry glad to be gone from a land of sand and sickness and sorrow short allowance of victual and plenty of nothing but gospel lost in the sound of the oars was the last farewell of the pilgrims o strong hearts and true not one went back in the mayflower no not one looked back who had set his hand to this ploughing soon were heard on board the shouts and songs of the sailors heaving the windlass round and hoisting the ponderous anchor then the yards were braced and all sails set to the westwind blowing steady and strong and the mayflower sailed from the harbor rounded the point of the gurnet and leaving far to the southward island and cape of sand and the field of the first encounter took the wind on her quarter and stood for the open atlantic borne on the send of the sea and the swelling hearts of the pilgrims long in silence they watched the receding sail of the vessel much endeared to them all as something living and human then as if filled with the spirit and wrapt in a vision prophetic baring his hoary head the excellent elder of plymouth said let us pray and they prayed and thanked the lord and took courage mournfully sobbed the waves at the base of the rock and above them bowed and whispered the wheat on the hill of death and their kindred seemed to awake in their graves and to join in the prayer that they uttered sunillumined and white on the eastern verge of the ocean gleamed the departing sail like a marble slab in a graveyard buried beneath it lay for ever all hope of escaping lo as they turned to depart they saw the form of an indian watching them from the hill but while they spake with each other pointing with outstretched hands and saying look he had vanished so they returned to their homes but alden lingered a little musing alone on the shore and watching the wash of the billows round the base of the rock and the sparkle and flash of the sunshine like the spirit of god moving visibly over the waters vi priscilla thus for a while he stood and mused by the shore of the ocean thinking of many things and most of all of priscilla and as if thought had the power to draw to itself like the loadstone whatsoever it touches by subtile laws of its nature lo as he turned to depart priscilla was standing beside him are you so much offended you will not speak to me said she am i so much to blame that yesterday when you were pleading warmly the cause of another my heart impulsive and wayward pleaded your own and spake out forgetful perhaps of decorum certainly you can forgive me for speaking so frankly for saying what i ought not to have said yet now i can never unsay it for there are moments in life when the heart is so full of emotion that if by chance it be shaken or into its depths like a pebble drops some careless word it overflows and its secret spilt on the ground like water can never be gathered together yesterday i was shocked when i heard you speak of miles standish praising his virtues transforming his very defects into virtues praising his courage and strength and even his fighting in flanders as if by fighting alone you could win the heart of a woman quite overlooking yourself and the rest in exalting your hero therefore i spake as i did by an irresistible impulse you will forgive me i hope for the sake of the friendship between us which is too true and too sacred to be so easily broken thereupon answered john alden the scholar the friend of miles standish i was not angry with you with myself alone i was angry seeing how badly i managed the matter i had in my keeping no interrupted the maiden with answer prompt and decisive no you were angry with me for speaking so frankly and freely it was wrong i acknowledge for it is the fate of a woman long to be patient and silent to wait like a ghost that is speechless till some questioning voice dissolves the spell of its silence hence is the inner life of so many suffering women sunless and silent and deep like subterranean rivers running through caverns of darkness unheard unseen and unfruitful chafing their channels of stone with endless and profitless murmurs thereupon answered john alden the young man the lover of women heaven forbid it priscilla and truly they seem to me always more like the beautiful rivers that watered the garden of eden more like the river euphrates through deserts of havilah flowing filling the land with delight and memories sweet of the garden ah by these words i can see again interrupted the maiden how very little you prize me or care for what i am saying when from the depths of my heart in pain and with secret misgiving frankly i speak to you asking for sympathy only and kindness straightway you take up my words that are plain and direct and in earnest turn them away from their meaning and answer with flattering phrases this is not right is not just is not true to the best that is in you for i know and esteem you and feel that your nature is noble lifting mine up to a higher a more ethereal level therefore i value your friendship and feel it perhaps the more keenly if you say aught that implies i am only as one among many if you make use of those common and complimentary phrases most men think so fine in dealing and speaking with women but which women reject as insipid if not as insulting mute and amazed was alden and listened and looked at priscilla thinking he never had seen her more fair more divine in her beauty he who but yesterday pleaded so glibly the cause of another stood there embarrassed and silent and seeking in vain for an answer so the maiden went on and little divined or imagined what was at work in his heart that made him so awkward and speechless let us then be what we are and speak what we think and in all things keep ourselves loyal to truth and the sacred professions of friendship it is no secret i tell you nor am i ashamed to declare it i have liked to be with you to see you to speak with you always so i was hurt at your words and a little affronted to hear you urge me to marry your friend though he were the captain miles standish for i must tell you the truth much more to me is your friendship than all the love he could give were he twice the hero you think him then she extended her hand and alden who eagerly grasped it felt all the wounds in his heart that were aching and bleeding so sorely healed by the touch of that hand and he said with a voice full of feeling yes we must ever be friends and of all who offer you friendship let me be ever the first the truest the nearest and dearest casting a farewell look at the glimmering sail of the mayflower distant but still in sight and sinking below the horizon homeward together they walked with a strange indefinite feeling that all the rest had departed and left them alone in the desert but as they went through the fields in the blessing and smile of the sunshine lighter grew their hearts and priscilla said very archly now that our terrible captain has gone in pursuit of the indians where he is happier far than he would be commanding a household you may speak boldly and tell me of all that happened between you when you returned last night and said how ungrateful you found me thereupon answered john alden and told her the whole of the story told her his own despair and the direful wrath of miles standish whereat the maiden smiled and said between laughing and earnest he is a little chimney and heated hot in a moment but as he gently rebuked her and told her how much he had suffered how he had even determined to sail that day in the mayflower and had remained for her sake on hearing the dangers that threatened all her manner was changed and she said with a faltering accent truly i thank you for this how good you have been to me always thus as a pilgrim devout who toward jerusalem journeys taking three steps in advance and one reluctantly backward urged by importunate zeal and withheld by pangs of contrition slowly but steadily onward receding yet ever advancing journeyed this puritan youth to the holy land of his longings urged by the fervor of love and withheld by remorseful misgivings vii the march of miles standish meanwhile the stalwart miles standish was marching steadily northward winding through forest and swamp and along the trend of the seashore all day long with hardly a halt the fire of his anger burning and crackling within and the sulphurous odor of powder seeming more sweet to his nostrils than all the scents of the forest silent and moody he went and much he revolved his discomfort he who was used to success and to easy victories always thus to be flouted rejected and laughed to scorn by a maiden thus to be mocked and betrayed by the friend whom most he had trusted ah t was too much to be borne and he fretted and chafed in his armor i alone am to blame he muttered for mine was the folly what has a rough old soldier grown grim and gray in the harness used to the camp and its ways to do with the wooing of maidens t was but a dream let it pass let it vanish like so many others what i thought was a flower is only a weed and is worthless out of my heart will i pluck it and throw it away and henceforward be but a fighter of battles a lover and wooer of dangers thus he revolved in his mind his sorry defeat and discomfort while he was marching by day or lying at night in the forest looking up at the trees and the constellations beyond them after a three days march he came to an indian encampment pitched on the edge of a meadow between the sea and the forest women at work by the tents and the warriors horrid with warpaint seated about a fire and smoking and talking together who when they saw from afar the sudden approach of the white men saw the flash of the sun on breastplate and sabre and musket straightway leaped to their feet and two from among them advancing came to parley with standish and offer him furs as a present friendship was in their looks but in their hearts there was hatred braves of the tribe were these and brothers gigantic in stature huge as goliath of gath or the terrible og king of bashan one was pecksuot named and the other was called wattawamat round their necks were suspended their knives in scabbards of wampum twoedged trenchant knives with points as sharp as a needle other arms had they none for they were cunning and crafty welcome english they said these words they had learned from the traders touching at times on the coast to barter and chaffer for peltries then in their native tongue they began to parley with standish through his guide and interpreter hobomok friend of the white man begging for blankets and knives but mostly for muskets and powder kept by the white man they said concealed with the plague in his cellars ready to be let loose and destroy his brother the red man but when standish refused and said he would give them the bible suddenly changing their tone they began to boast and to bluster then wattawamat advanced with a stride in front of the other and with a lofty demeanor thus vauntingly spake to the captain now wattawamat can see by the fiery eyes of the captain angry is he in his heart but the heart of the brave wattawamat is not afraid at the sight he was not born of a woman but on a mountain at night from an oaktree riven by lightning forth he sprang at a bound with all his weapons about him shouting who is there here to fight with the brave wattawamat then he unsheathed his knife and whetting the blade on his left hand held it aloft and displayed a womans face on the handle saying with bitter expression and look of sinister meaning i have another at home with the face of a man on the handle by and by they shall marry and there will be plenty of children then stood pecksuot forth selfvaunting insulting miles standish while with his fingers he petted the knife that hung at his bosom drawing it half from its sheath and plunging it back as he muttered by and by it shall see it shall eat ah ha but shall speak not this is the mighty captain the white men have sent to destroy us he is a little man let him go and work with the women meanwhile standish had noted the faces and figures of indians peeping and creeping about from bush to tree in the forest feigning to look for game with arrows set on their bowstrings drawing about him still closer and closer the net of their ambush but undaunted he stood and dissembled and treated them smoothly so the old chronicles say that were writ in the days of the fathers but when he heard their defiance the boast the taunt and the insult all the hot blood of his race of sir hugh and of thurston de standish boiled and beat in his heart and swelled in the veins of his temples headlong he leaped on the boaster and snatching his knife from its scabbard plunged it into his heart and reeling backward the savage fell with his face to the sky and a fiendlike fierceness upon it straight there arose from the forest the awful sound of the warwhoop and like a flurry of snow on the whistling wind of december swift and sudden and keen came a flight of feathery arrows then came a cloud of smoke and out of the cloud came the lightning out of the lightning thunder and death unseen ran before it frightened the savages fled for shelter in swamp and in thicket hotly pursued and beset but their sachem the brave wattawamat fled not he was dead unswerving and swift had a bullet passed through his brain and he fell with both hands clutching the greensward seeming in death to hold back from his foe the land of his fathers there on the flowers of the meadow the warriors lay and above them silent with folded arms stood hobomok friend of the white man smiling at length he exclaimed to the stalwart captain of plymouth pecksuot bragged very loud of his courage his strength and his stature mocked the great captain and called him a little man but i see now big enough have you been to lay him speechless before you thus the first battle was fought and won by the stalwart miles standish when the tidings thereof were brought to the village of plymouth and as a trophy of war the head of the brave wattawamat scowled from the roof of the fort which at once was a church and a fortress all who beheld it rejoiced and praised the lord and took courage only priscilla averted her face from this spectre of terror thanking god in her heart that she had not married miles standish shrinking fearing almost lest coming home from his battles he should lay claim to her hand as the prize and reward of his valor viii the spinningwheel month after month passed away and in autumn the ships of the merchants came with kindred and friends with cattle and corn for the pilgrims all in the village was peace the men were intent on their labors busy with hewing and building with gardenplot and with merestead busy with breaking the glebe and mowing the grass in the meadows searching the sea for its fish and hunting the deer in the forest all in the village was peace but at times the rumor of warfare filled the air with alarm and the apprehension of danger bravely the stalwart miles standish was scouring the land with his forces waxing valiant in fight and defeating the alien armies till his name had become a sound of fear to the nations anger was still in his heart but at times the remorse and contrition which in all noble natures succeed the passionate outbreak came like a rising tide that encounters the rush of a river staying its current awhile but making it bitter and brackish meanwhile alden at home had built him a new habitation solid substantial of timber roughhewn from the firs of the forest woodenbarred was the door and the roof was covered with rushes latticed the windows were and the windowpanes were of paper oiled to admit the light while wind and rain were excluded there too he dug a well and around it planted an orchard still may be seen to this day some trace of the well and the orchard close to the house was the stall where safe and secure from annoyance raghorn the snowwhite steer that had fallen to aldens allotment in the division of cattle might ruminate in the nighttime over the pastures he cropped made fragrant by sweet pennyroyal oft when his labor was finished with eager feet would the dreamer follow the pathway that ran through the woods to the house of priscilla led by illusions romantic and subtile deceptions of fancy pleasure disguised as duty and love in the semblance of friendship ever of her he thought when he fashioned the walls of his dwelling ever of her he thought when he delved in the soil of his garden ever of her he thought when he read in his bible on sunday praise of the virtuous woman as she is described in the proverbs how the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her always how all the days of her life she will do him good and not evil how she seeketh the wool and the flax and worketh with gladness how she layeth her hand to the spindle and holdeth the distaff how she is not afraid of the snow for herself or her household knowing her household are clothed with the scarlet cloth of her weaving so as she sat at her wheel one afternoon in the autumn alden who opposite sat and was watching her dexterous fingers as if the thread she was spinning were that of his life and his fortune after a pause in their talk thus spake to the sound of the spindle truly priscilla he said when i see you spinning and spinning never idle a moment but thrifty and thoughtful of others suddenly you are transformed are visibly changed in a moment you are no longer priscilla but bertha the beautiful spinner here the light foot on the treadle grew swifter and swifter the spindle uttered an angry snarl and the thread snapped short in her fingers while the impetuous speaker not heeding the mischief continued you are the beautiful bertha the spinner the queen of helvetia she whose story i read at a stall in the streets of southampton who as she rode on her palfrey oer valley and meadow and mountain ever was spinning her thread from a distaff fixed to her saddle she was so thrifty and good that her name passed into a proverb so shall it be with your own when the spinningwheel shall no longer hum in the house of the farmer and fill its chambers with music then shall the mothers reproving relate how it was in their childhood praising the good old times and the days of priscilla the spinner straight uprose from her wheel the beautiful puritan maiden pleased with the praise of her thrift from him whose praise was the sweetest drew from the reel on the table a snowy skein of her spinning thus making answer meanwhile to the flattering phrases of alden come you must not be idle if i am a pattern for housewives show yourself equally worthy of being the model of husbands hold this skein on your hands while i wind it ready for knitting then who knows but hereafter when fashions have changed and the manners fathers may talk to their sons of the good old times of john alden thus with a jest and a laugh the skein on his hands she adjusted he sitting awkwardly there with his arms extended before him she standing graceful erect and winding the thread from his fingers sometimes chiding a little his clumsy manner of holding sometimes touching his hands as she disentangled expertly twist or knot in the yarn unawares for how could she help it sending electrical thrills through every nerve in his body lo in the midst of this scene a breathless messenger entered bringing in hurry and heat the terrible news from the village yes miles standish was dead an indian had brought them the tidings slain by a poisoned arrow shot down in the front of the battle into an ambush beguiled cut off with the whole of his forces all the town would be burned and all the people be murdered such were the tidings of evil that burst on the hearts of the hearers silent and statuelike stood priscilla her face looking backward still at the face of the speaker her arms uplifted in horror but john alden upstarting as if the barb of the arrow piercing the heart of his friend had struck his own and had sundered once and for ever the bonds that held him bound as a captive wild with excess of sensation the awful delight of his freedom mingled with pain and regret unconscious of what he was doing clasped almost with a groan the motionless form of priscilla pressing her close to his heart as for ever his own and exclaiming those whom the lord hath united let no man put them asunder even as rivulets twain from distant and separate sources seeing each other afar as they leap from the rocks and pursuing each one its devious path but drawing nearer and nearer rush together at last at their trystingplace in the forest so these lives that had run thus far in separate channels coming in sight of each other then swerving and flowing asunder parted by barriers strong but drawing nearer and nearer rushed together at last and one was lost in the other ix the weddingday forth from the curtain of clouds from the tent of purple and scarlet issued the sun the great highpriest in his garments resplendent holiness unto the lord in letters of light on his forehead round the hem of his robe the golden bells and pomegranates blessing the world he came and the bars of vapor beneath him gleamed like a grate of brass and the sea at his feet was a laver this was the wedding morn of priscilla the puritan maiden friends were assembled together the elder and magistrate also graced the scene with their presence and stood like the law and the gospel one with the sanction of earth and one with the blessing of heaven simple and brief was the wedding as that of ruth and of boaz softly the youth and the maiden repeated the words of betrothal taking each other for husband and wife in the magistrates presence after the puritan way and the laudable custom of holland fervently then and devoutly the excellent elder of plymouth prayed for the hearth and the home that were founded that day in affection speaking of life and of death and imploring divine benedictions lo when the service was ended a form appeared on the threshold clad in armor of steel a sombre and sorrowful figure why does the bridegroom start and stare at the strange apparition why does the bride turn pale and hide her face on his shoulder is it a phantom of air a bodiless spectral illusion is it a ghost from the grave that has come to forbid the betrothal long had it stood there unseen a guest uninvited unwelcomed over its clouded eyes there had passed at times an expression softening the gloom and revealing the warm heart hidden beneath them as when across the sky the driving rack of the raincloud grows for a moment thin and betrays the sun by its brightness once it had lifted its hand and moved its lips but was silent as if an iron will had mastered the fleeting intention but when were ended the troth and the prayer and the last benediction into the room it strode and the people beheld with amazement bodily there in his armor miles standish the captain of plymouth grasping the bridegrooms hand he said with emotion forgive me i have been angry and hurt too long have i cherished the feeling i have been cruel and hard but now thank god it is ended mine is the same hot blood that leaped in the veins of hugh standish sensitive swift to resent but as swift in atoning for error never so much as now was miles standish the friend of john alden thereupon answered the bridegroom let all be forgotten between us all save the dear old friendship and that shall grow older and dearer then the captain advanced and bowing saluted priscilla gravely and after the manner of oldfashioned gentry in england something of camp and of court of town and of country commingled wishing her joy of her wedding and loudly lauding her husband then he said with a smile i should have remembered the adage if you would be well served you must serve yourself and moreover no man can gather cherries in kent at the season of christmas great was the peoples amazement and greater yet their rejoicing thus to behold once more the sunburnt face of their captain whom they had mourned as dead and they gathered and crowded about him eager to see him and hear him forgetful of bride and of bridegroom questioning answering laughing and each interrupting the other till the good captain declared being quite overpowered and bewildered he had rather by far break into an indian encampment than come again to a wedding to which he had not been invited meanwhile the bridegroom went forth and stood with the bride at the doorway breathing the perfumed air of that warm and beautiful morning touched with autumnal tints but lonely and sad in the sunshine lay extended before them the land of toil and privation there were the graves of the dead and the barren waste of the seashore there the familiar fields the groves of pine and the meadows but to their eyes transfigured it seemed as the garden of eden filled with the presence of god whose voice was the sound of the ocean soon was their vision disturbed by the noise and stir of departure friends coming forth from the house and impatient of longer delaying each with his plan for the day and the work that was left uncompleted then from a stall near at hand amid exclamations of wonder alden the thoughtful the careful so happy so proud of priscilla brought out his snowwhite steer obeying the hand of its master led by a cord that was tied to an iron ring in its nostrils covered with crimson cloth and a cushion placed for a saddle she should not walk he said through the dust and heat of the noonday nay she should ride like a queen not plod along like a peasant somewhat alarmed at first but reassured by the others placing her hand on the cushion her foot in the hand of her husband gayly with joyous laugh priscilla mounted her palfrey nothing is wanting now he said with a smile but the distaff then you would be in truth my queen my beautiful bertha onward the bridal procession now moved to their new habitation happy husband and wife and friends conversing together pleasantly murmured the brook as they crossed the ford in the forest pleased with the image that passed like a dream of love through its bosom tremulous floating in air oer the depths of the azure abysses down through the golden leaves the sun was pouring his splendors gleaming on purple grapes that from branches above them suspended mingled their odorous breath with the balm of the pine and the firtree wild and sweet as the clusters that grew in the valley of eshcol like a picture it seemed of the primitive pastoral ages fresh with the youth of the world and recalling rebecca and isaac old and yet ever new and simple and beautiful always love immortal and young in the endless succession of lovers so through the plymouth woods passed onward the bridal procession birds of passage flight the first come i gru van cantando lor lai facendo in aer di se lunga riga dante birds of passage black shadows fall from the lindens tall that lift aloft their massive wall against the southern sky and from the realms of the shadowy elms a tidelike darkness overwhelms the fields that round us lie but the night is fair and everywhere a warm soft vapor fills the air and distant sounds seem near and above in the light of the starlit night swift birds of passage wing their flight through the dewy atmosphere i hear the beat of their pinions fleet as from the land of snow and sleet they seek a southern lea i hear the cry of their voices high falling dreamily through the sky but their forms i cannot see o say not so those sounds that flow in murmurs of delight and woe come not from wings of birds they are the throngs of the poets songs murmurs of pleasures and pains and wrongs the sound of winged words this is the cry of souls that high on toiling beating pinions fly seeking a warmer clime from their distant flight through realms of light it falls into our world of night with the murmuring sound of rhyme prometheus or the poets forethought of prometheus how undaunted on olympus shining bastions his audacious foot he planted myths are told and songs are chanted full of promptings and suggestions beautiful is the tradition of that flight through heavenly portals the old classic superstition of the theft and the transmission of the fire of the immortals first the deed

glories so transcendent that around their memories cluster and on all their steps attendant make their darkened lives resplendent with such gleams of inward lustre all the melodies mysterious through

graces though the fields around us wither there are ampler realms and spaces where no foot has left its traces let us turn and wander thither the ladder of st augustine saint augustine well hast thou said that of our vices we can frame a ladder if we will but tread beneath our feet each deed of shame all common things each days events that with the hour begin and end our pleasures and our discontents are rounds by which we may ascend the low desire the base design that makes anothers virtues less the revel of the ruddy wine and all occasions of excess the longing for ignoble things the strife for triumph more than truth the hardening of the heart that brings irreverence for the dreams of youth all thoughts of ill all evil deeds that have their root in thoughts of ill whatever hinders or impedes the action of the nobler will all these must first be trampled down beneath our feet if we would gain in the bright fields of fair renown the right of eminent domain we have not wings we cannot soar but we have feet to scale and climb by slow degrees by more and more the cloudy summits of our time the mighty pyramids of stone that wedgelike cleave the desert airs when nearer seen and better known are but gigantic flights of stairs the distant mountains that uprear their solid bastions to the skies are crossed by pathways that appear as we to higher levels rise the heights by great men reached and kept were not attained by sudden flight but they while their companions slept were toiling upward in the night standing on what too long we bore with shoulders bent and downcast eyes we may discern unseen before a path to higher destinies nor deem the irrevocable past as wholly wasted wholly vain if rising on its wrecks at last to something nobler we attain the phantom ship in mathers magnalia christi of the old colonial time may be found in prose the legend that is here set down in rhyme a ship sailed from new haven and the keen and frosty airs that filled her sails at parting were heavy with good mens prayers o lord if it be thy pleasure thus prayed the old divine to bury our friends in the ocean take them for they are thine but master lamberton muttered and under his breath said he this ship is so crank and walty i fear our grave she will be and the ships that came from england when the winter months were gone brought no tidings of this vessel nor of master lamberton this put the people to praying that the lord would let them hear what in his greater wisdom he had done with friends so dear and at last their prayers were answered it was in the month of june an hour before the sunset of a windy afternoon when steadily steering landward a ship was seen below and they knew it was lamberton master who sailed so long ago on she came with a cloud of canvas right against the wind that blew until the eye could distinguish the faces of the crew then fell her straining topmasts hanging tangled in the shrouds and her sails were loosened and lifted and blown away like clouds and the masts with all their rigging fell slowly one by one and the hulk dilated and vanished as a seamist in the sun and the people who saw this marvel each said unto his friend that this was the mould of their vessel and thus her tragic end and the pastor of the village gave thanks to god in prayer that to quiet their troubled spirits he had sent this ship of air the warden of the cinque ports a mist was driving down the british channel the day was just begun and through the windowpanes on floor and panel streamed the red autumn sun it glanced on flowing flag and rippling pennon and the white sails of ships and from the frowning rampart the black cannon hailed it with feverish lips sandwich and romney hastings hithe and dover were all alert that day to see the french warsteamers speeding over when the fog cleared away sullen and silent and like couchant lions their cannon through the night holding their breath had watched in grim defiance the seacoast opposite and now they roared at drumbeat from their stations on every citadel each answering each with morning salutations that all was well and down the coast all taking up the burden replied the distant forts as if to summon from his sleep the warden and lord of the cinque ports him shall no sunshine from the fields of azure no drumbeat from the wall no morning gun from the black forts embrasure awaken with its call no more surveying with an eye impartial the long line of the coast shall the gaunt figure of the old field marshal be seen upon his post for in the night unseen a single warrior in sombre harness mailed dreaded of man and surnamed the destroyer the rampart wall has scaled he passed into the chamber of the sleeper the dark and silent room and as he entered darker grew and deeper the silence and the gloom he did not pause to parley or dissemble but smote the warden hoar ah what a blow that made all england tremble and groan from shore to shore meanwhile without the surly cannon waited the sun rose bright oerhead nothing in natures aspect intimated that a great man was dead haunted houses all houses wherein men have lived and died are haunted houses through the open doors the harmless phantoms on their errands glide with feet that make no sound upon the floors we meet them at the doorway on the stair along the passages they come and go impalpable impressions on the air a sense of something moving to and fro there are more guests at table than the hosts invited the illuminated hall is thronged with quiet inoffensive ghosts as silent as the pictures on the wall the stranger at my fireside cannot see the forms i see nor hear the sounds i hear he but perceives what is while unto me all that has been is visible and clear we have no titledeeds to house or lands owners and occupants of earlier dates from graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands and hold in mortmain still their old estates the spiritworld around this world of sense floats like an atmosphere and everywhere wafts through these earthly mists and vapors dense a vital breath of more ethereal air our little lives are kept in equipoise by opposite attractions and desires the struggle of the instinct that enjoys and the more noble instinct that aspires these perturbations this perpetual jar of earthly wants and aspirations high come from the influence of an unseen star an undiscovered planet in our sky and as the moon from some dark gate of cloud throws oer the sea a floating bridge of light across whose trembling planks our fancies crowd into the realm of mystery and night so from the world of spirits there descends a bridge of light connecting it with this oer whose unsteady floor that sways and bends wander our thoughts above the dark abyss in the churchyard at cambridge in the village churchyard she lies dust is in her beautiful eyes no more she breathes nor feels nor stirs at her feet and at her head lies a slave to attend the dead but their dust is white as hers was she a lady of high degree so much in love with the vanity and foolish pomp of this world of ours or was it christian charity and lowliness and humility the richest and rarest of all dowers who shall tell us no one speaks no color shoots into those cheeks either of anger or of pride at the rude question we have asked nor will the mystery be unmasked by those who are sleeping at her side hereafter and do you think to look on the terrible pages of that book to find her failings faults and errors ah you will then have other cares in your own shortcomings and despairs in your own secret sins and terrors the emperors birdsnest once the emperor charles of spain with his swarthy grave commanders i forget in what campaign long besieged in mud and rain some old frontier town of flanders up and down the dreary camp in great boots of spanish leather striding with a measured tramp these hidalgos dull and damp cursed the frenchmen cursed the weather thus as to and fro they went over upland and through hollow giving their impatience vent perched upon the emperors tent in her nest they spied a swallow yes it was a swallows nest built of clay and hair of horses mane or tail or dragoons crest found on hedgerows east and west after skirmish of the forces then an old hidalgo said as he twirled his gray mustachio sure this swallow overhead thinks the emperors tent a shed and the emperor but a macho hearing his imperial name coupled with those words of malice half in anger half in shame forth the great campaigner came slowly from his canvas palace let no hand the bird molest said he solemnly nor hurt her adding then by way of jest golondrina is my guest tis the wife of some deserter swift as bowstring speeds a shaft through the camp was spread the rumor and the soldiers as they quaffed flemish beer at dinner laughed at the emperors pleasant humor so unharmed and unafraid sat the swallow still and brooded till the constant cannonade through the walls a breach had made and the siege was thus concluded then the army elsewhere bent struck its tents as if disbanding only not the emperors tent for he ordered ere he went very curtly leave it standing so it stood there all alone loosely flapping torn and tattered till the brood was fledged and flown singing oer those walls of stone which the cannonshot had shattered the two angels two angels one of life and one of death passed oer our village as the morning broke the dawn was on their faces and beneath the sombre houses hearsed with plumes of smoke their attitude and aspect were the same alike their features and their robes of white but one was crowned with amaranth as with flame and one with asphodels like flakes of light i saw them pause on their celestial way then said i with deep fear and doubt oppressed beat not so loud my heart lest thou betray the place where thy beloved are at rest and he who wore the crown of asphodels descending at my door began to knock and my soul sank within me as in wells the waters sink before an earthquakes shock i recognized the nameless agony the terror and the tremor and the pain that oft before had filled or haunted me and now returned with threefold strength again the door i opened to my heavenly guest and listened for i thought i heard gods voice and knowing whatsoeer he sent was best dared neither to lament nor to rejoice then with a smile that filled the house with light my errand is not death but life he said and ere i answered passing out of sight on his celestial embassy he sped t was at thy door o friend and not at mine the angel with the amaranthine wreath pausing descended and with voice divine whispered a word that had a sound like death then fell upon the house a sudden gloom a shadow on those features fair and thin and softly from that hushed and darkened room two angels issued where but one went in all is of god if he but wave his hand the mists collect the rain falls thick and loud till with a smile of light on sea and land lo he looks back from the departing cloud angels of life and death alike are his without his leave they pass no threshold oer who then would wish or dare believing this against his messengers to shut the door daylight and moonlight in broad daylight and at noon yesterday i saw the moon sailing high but faint and white as a schoolboys paper kite in broad daylight yesterday i read a poets mystic lay and it seemed to me at most as a phantom or a ghost but at length the feverish day like a passion died away and the night serene and still fell on village vale and hill then the moon in all her pride like a spirit glorified filled and overflowed the night with revelations of her light and the poets song again passed like music through my brain night interpreted to me all its grace and mystery the jewish cemetery at newport how strange it seems these hebrews in their graves close by the street of this fair seaport town silent beside the neversilent waves at rest in all this moving up and down the trees are white with dust that oer their sleep wave their broad curtains in the southwinds breath while underneath such leafy tents they keep the long mysterious exodus of death and these sepulchral stones so old and brown that pave with level flags their burialplace seem like the tablets of the law thrown down and broken by moses at the mountains base the very names recorded here are strange of foreign accent and of different climes alvares and rivera interchange with abraham and jacob of old times blessed be god for he created death the mourners said and death is rest and peace then added in the certainty of faith and giveth life that never more shall cease closed are the portals of their synagogue no psalms of david now the silence break no rabbi reads the ancient decalogue in the grand dialect the prophets spake gone are the living but the dead remain and not neglected for a hand unseen scattering its bounty like a summer rain still keeps their graves and their remembrance green how came they here what burst of christian hate what persecution merciless and blind drove oer the sea that desert desolate these ishmaels and hagars of mankind they lived in narrow streets and lanes obscure ghetto and judenstrass in mirk and mire taught in the school of patience to endure the life of anguish and the death of fire all their lives long with the unleavened bread and bitter herbs of exile and its fears the wasting famine of the heart they fed and slaked its thirst with marah of their tears anathema maranatha was the cry that rang from town to town from street to street at every gate the accursed mordecai was mocked and jeered and spurned by christian feet pride and humiliation hand in hand walked with them through the world whereer they went trampled and beaten were they as the sand and yet unshaken as the continent for in the background figures vague and vast of patriarchs and of prophets rose sublime and all the great traditions of the past they saw reflected in the coming time and thus for ever with reverted look the mystic volume of the world they read spelling it backward like a hebrew book till life became a legend of the dead but ah what once has been shall be no more the groaning earth in travail and in pain brings forth its races but does not restore and the dead nations never rise again oliver basselin in the valley of the vire still is seen an ancient mill with its gables quaint and queer and beneath the windowsill on the stone these words alone oliver basselin lived here far above it on the steep ruined stands the old chateau nothing but the donjonkeep left for shelter or for show its vacant eyes stare at the skies stare at the valley green and deep once a convent old and brown looked but ah it looks no more from the neighboring hillside down on the rushing and the roar of the stream whose sunny gleam cheers the little norman town in that darksome mill of stone to the waters dash and din careless humble and unknown sang the poet basselin songs that fill that ancient mill with a splendor of its own never feeling of unrest broke the pleasant dream he dreamed only made to be his nest all the lovely valley seemed no desire of soaring higher stirred or fluttered in his breast true his songs were not divine were not songs of that high art which as winds do in the pine find an answer in each heart but the mirth of this green earth laughed and revelled in his line from the alehouse and the inn opening on the narrow street came the loud convivial din singing and applause of feet the laughing lays that in those days sang the poet basselin in the castle cased in steel knights who fought at agincourt watched and waited spur on heel but the poet sang for sport songs that rang another clang songs that lowlier hearts could feel in the convent clad in gray sat the monks in lonely cells paced the cloisters knelt to pray and the poet heard their bells but his rhymes found other chimes nearer to the earth than they gone are all the barons bold gone are all the knights and squires gone the abbot stern and cold and the brotherhood of friars not a name remains to fame from those mouldering days of old but the poets memory here of the landscape makes a part like the river swift and clear flows his song through many a heart haunting still that ancient mill in the valley of the vire victor galbraith under the walls of monterey at daybreak the bugles began to play victor galbraith in the mist of the morning damp and gray these were the words they seemed to say come forth to thy death victor galbraith forth he came with a martial tread firm was his step erect his head victor galbraith he who so well the bugle played could not mistake the words it said come forth to thy death victor galbraith he looked at the earth he looked at the sky he looked at the files of musketry victor galbraith and he said with a steady voice and eye take good aim i am ready to die thus challenges death victor galbraith twelve fiery tongues flashed straight and red six leaden balls on their errand sped victor galbraith falls to the ground but he is not dead his name was not stamped on those balls of lead and they only scath victor galbraith three balls are in his breast and brain but he rises out of the dust again victor galbraith the water he drinks has a bloody stain o kill me and put me out of my pain in his agony prayeth victor galbraith forth dart once more those tongues of flame and the bugler has died a death of shame victor galbraith his soul has gone back to whence it came and no one answers to the name when the sergeant saith victor galbraith under the walls of monterey by night a bugle is heard to play victor galbraith through the mist of the valley damp and gray the sentinels hear the sound and say that is the wraith of victor galbraith my lost youth often i think of the beautiful town that is seated by the sea often in thought go up and down the pleasant streets of that dear old town and my youth comes back to me and a verse of a lapland song is haunting my memory still a boys will is the winds will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts i can see the shadowy lines of its trees and catch in sudden gleams the sheen of the farsurrounding seas and islands that were the hersperides of all my boyish dreams and the burden of that old song it murmurs and whispers still a boys will is the winds will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts i remember the black wharves and the slips and the seatides tossing free and spanish sailors with bearded lips and the beauty and mystery of the ships and the magic of the sea and the voice of that wayward song is singing and saying still a boys will is the winds will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts i remember the bulwarks by the shore and the fort upon the hill the sunrise gun with its hollow roar the drumbeat repeated oer and oer and the bugle wild and shrill and the music of that old song throbs in my memory still a boys will is the winds will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts i remember the seafight far away how it thundered oer the tide and the dead captains as they lay in their graves oerlooking the tranquil bay where they in battle died and the sound of that mournful song goes through me with a thrill a boys will is the winds will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts i can see the breezy dome of groves the shadows of deerings woods and the friendships old and the early loves come back with a sabbath sound as of doves in quiet neighborhoods and the verse of that sweet old song it flutters and murmurs still a boys will is the winds will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts i remember the gleams and glooms that dart across the schoolboys brain the song and the silence in the heart that in part are prophecies and in part are longings wild and vain and the voice of that fitful song sings on and is never still a boys will is the winds will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts there are things of which i may not speak there are dreams that cannot die there are thoughts that make the strong heart weak and bring a pallor into the cheek and a mist before the eye and the words of that fatal song come over me like a chill a boys will is the winds will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts strange to me now are the forms i meet when i visit the dear old town but the native air is pure and sweet and the trees that oershadow each wellknown street as they balance up and down are singing the beautiful song are sighing and whispering still a boys will is the winds will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts and deerings woods are fresh and fair and with joy that is almost pain my heart goes back to wander there and among the dreams of the days that were i find my lost youth again and the strange and beautiful song the groves are repeating it still a boys will is the winds will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts the ropewalk in that building long and low with its windows all arow like the portholes of a hulk human spiders spin and spin backward down their threads so thin dropping each a hempen bulk at the end an open door squares of sunshine on the floor light the long and dusky lane and the whirring of a wheel dull and drowsy makes me feel all its spokes are in my brain as the spinners to the end downward go and reascend gleam the long threads in the sun while within this brain of mine cobwebs brighter and more fine by the busy wheel are spun two fair maidens in a swing like white doves upon the wing first before my vision pass laughing as their gentle hands closely clasp the twisted strands at their shadow on the grass then a booth of mountebanks with its smell of tan and planks and a girl poised high in air on a cord in spangled dress with a faded loveliness and a weary look of care then a homestead among farms and a woman with bare arms drawing water from a well as the bucket mounts apace with it mounts her own fair face as at some magicians spell then an old man in a tower ringing loud the noontide hour while the rope coils round and round like a serpent at his feet and again in swift retreat nearly lifts him from the ground then within a prisonyard faces fixed and stern and hard laughter and indecent mirth ah it is the gallowstree breath of christian charity blow and sweep it from the earth then a schoolboy with his kite gleaming in a sky of light and an eager upward look steeds pursued through lane and field fowlers with their snares concealed and an angler by a brook ships rejoicing in the breeze wrecks that float oer unknown seas anchors dragged through faithless sand seafog drifting overhead and with lessening line and lead sailors feeling for the land all these scenes do i behold these and many left untold in that building long and low while the wheel goes round and round with a drowsy dreamy sound and the spinners backward go the golden milestone leafless are the trees their purple branches spread themselves abroad like reefs of coral rising silent in the red sea of the winter sunset from the hundred chimneys of the village like the afreet in the arabian story smoky columns tower aloft into the air of amber at the window winks the flickering firelight here and there the lamps of evening glimmer social watchfires answering one another through the darkness on the hearth the lighted logs are glowing and like ariel in the cloven pinetree for its freedom groans and sighs the air imprisoned in them by the fireside there are old men seated seeing ruined cities in the ashes asking sadly of the past what it can neer restore them by the fireside there are youthful dreamers building castles fair with stately stairways asking blindly of the future what it cannot give them by the fireside tragedies are acted in whose scenes appear two actors only wife and husband and above them god the sole spectator by the fireside there are peace and comfort wives and children with fair thoughtful faces waiting watching for a wellknown footstep in the passage each mans chimney is his golden milestone is the central point from which he measures every distance through the gateways of the world around him in his farthest wanderings still he sees it hears the talking flame the answering nightwind as he heard them when he sat with those who were but are not happy he whom neither wealth nor fashion nor the march of the encroaching city drives an exile from the hearth of his ancestral homestead we may build more splendid habitations fill our rooms with paintings and with sculptures but we cannot buy with gold the old associations catawba wine this song of mine is a song of the vine to be sung by the glowing embers of wayside inns when the rain begins to darken the drear novembers it is not a song of the scuppernong from warm carolinian valleys nor the isabel and the muscadel that bask in our garden alleys nor the red mustang whose clusters hang oer the waves of the colorado and the fiery flood of whose purple blood has a dash of spanish bravado for richest and best is the wine of the west that grows by the beautiful river whose sweet perfume fills all the room with a benison on the giver and as hollow trees are the haunts of bees for ever going and coming so this crystal hive is all alive with a swarming and buzzing and humming very good in its way is the verzenay or the sillery soft and creamy but catawba wine has a taste more divine more dulcet delicious and dreamy there grows no vine by the haunted rhine by danube or guadalquivir nor on island or cape that bears such a grape as grows by the beautiful river drugged is their juice for foreign use when shipped oer the reeling atlantic to rack our brains with the fever pains that have driven the old world frantic to the sewers and sinks with all such drinks and after them tumble the mixer for a poison malign is such borgia wine or at best but a devils elixir while pure as a spring is the wine i sing and to praise it one needs but name it for catawba wine has need of no sign no tavernbush to proclaim it and this song of the vine this greeting of mine the winds and the birds shall deliver to the queen of the west in her garlands dressed on the banks of the beautiful river santa filomena wheneer a noble deed is wrought wheneer is spoken a noble thought our hearts in glad surprise to higher levels rise the tidal wave of deeper souls into our inmost being rolls and lifts us unawares out of all meaner cares honor to those whose words or deeds thus help us in our daily needs and by their overflow raise us from what is low thus thought i as by night i read of the great army of the dead the trenches cold and damp the starved and frozen camp the wounded from the battleplain in dreary hospitals of pain the cheerless corridors the cold and stony floors lo in that house of misery a lady with a lamp i see pass through the glimmering gloom and flit from room to room and slow as in a dream of bliss the speechless sufferer turns to kiss her shadow as it falls upon the darkening walls as if a door in heaven should be opened and then closed suddenly the vision came and went the light shone and was spent on englands annals through the long hereafter of her speech and song that light its rays shall cast from portals of the past a lady with a lamp shall stand in the great history of the land a noble type of good heroic womanhood nor even shall be wanting here the palm the lily and the spear the symbols that of yore saint filomena bore the discoverer of the north cape a leaf from king alfreds orosius othere the old seacaptain who dwelt in helgoland to king alfred the lover of truth brought a snowwhite walrustooth which he held in his brown right hand his figure was tall and stately like a boys his eye appeared his hair was yellow as hay but threads of a silvery gray gleamed in his tawny beard hearty and hale was othere his cheek had the color of oak with a kind of laugh in his speech like the seatide on a beach as unto the king he spoke and alfred king of the saxons had a book upon his knees and wrote down the wondrous tale of him who was first to sail into the arctic seas so far i live to the northward no man lives north of me to the east are wild mountainchains and beyond them meres and plains to the westward all is sea so far i live to the northward from the harbor of skeringeshale if you only sailed by day with a fair wind all the way more than a month would you sail i own six hundred reindeer with sheep and swine beside i have tribute from the finns whalebone and reindeerskins and ropes of walrushide i ploughed the land with horses but my heart was ill at ease for the old seafaring men came to me now and then with their sagas of the seas of iceland and of greenland and the stormy hebrides and the undiscovered deep i could not eat nor sleep for thinking of those seas to the northward stretched the desert how far i fain would know so at last i sallied forth and three days sailed due north as far as the whaleships go to the west of me was the ocean to the right the desolate shore but i did not slacken sail for the walrus or the whale till after three days more the days grew longer and longer till they became as one and southward through the haze i saw the sullen blaze of the red midnight sun and then uprose before me upon the waters edge the huge and haggard shape of that unknown north cape whose form is like a wedge the sea was rough and stormy the tempest howled and wailed and the seafog like a ghost haunted that dreary coast but onward still i sailed four days i steered to eastward four days without a night round in a fiery ring went the great sun o king with red and lurid light here alfred king of the saxons ceased writing for a while and raised his eyes from his book with a strange and puzzled look and an incredulous smile but othere the old seacaptain he neither paused nor stirred till the king listened and then once more took up his pen and wrote down every word and now the land said othere bent southward suddenly and i followed the curving shore and ever southward bore into a nameless sea and there we hunted the walrus the narwhale and the seal ha t was a noble game and like the lightnings flame flew our harpoons of steel there were six of us all together norsemen of helgoland in two days and no more we killed of them threescore and dragged them to the strand here alfred the truthteller suddenly closed his book and lifted his blue eyes with doubt and strange surmise depicted in their look and othere the old seacaptain stared at him wild and weird then smiled till his shining teeth gleamed white from underneath his tawny quivering beard and to the king of the saxons in witness of the truth raising his noble head he stretched his brown hand and said behold this walrustooth daybreak a wind came up out of the sea and said o mists make room for me it hailed the ships and cried sail on ye mariners the night is gone and hurried landward far away crying awake it is the day it said unto the forest shout hang all your leafy banners out it touched the woodbirds folded wing and said o bird awake and sing and oer the farms o chanticleer your clarion blow the day is near it whispered to the fields of corn bow down and hail the coming morn it shouted through the belfrytower awake o bell proclaim the hour it crossed the churchyard with a sigh and said not yet in quiet lie the fiftieth birthday of agassiz may it was fifty years ago in the pleasant month of may in the beautiful pays de vaud a child in its cradle lay and nature the old nurse took the child upon her knee saying here is a storybook thy father has written for thee come wander with me she said into regions yet untrod and read what is still unread in the manuscripts of god and he wandered away and away with nature the dear old nurse who sang to him night and day the rhymes of the universe and whenever the way seemed long or his heart began to fail she would sing a more wonderful song or tell a more marvellous tale so she keeps him still a child and will not let him go though at times his heart beats wild for the beautiful pays de vaud though at times he hears in his dreams the ranz des vaches of old and the rush of mountain streams from glaciers clear and cold and the mother at home says hark for his voice i listen and yearn it is growing late and dark and my boy does not return children come to me o ye children for i hear you at your play and the questions that perplexed me have vanished quite away ye open the eastern windows that look towards the sun where thoughts are singing swallows and the brooks of morning run in your hearts are the birds and the sunshine in your thoughts the brooklets flow but in mine is the wind of autumn and the first fall of the snow ah what would the world be to us if the children were no more we should dread the desert behind us worse than the dark before what the leaves are to the forest with light and air for food ere their sweet and tender juices have been hardened into wood that to the world are children through them it feels the glow of a brighter and sunnier climate than reaches the trunks below come to me o ye children and whisper in my ear what the birds and the winds are singing in your sunny atmosphere for what are all our contrivings and the wisdom of our books when compared with your caresses and the gladness of your looks ye are better than all the ballads that ever were sung or said for ye are living poems and all the rest are dead sandalphon have you read in the talmud of old in the legends the rabbins have told of the limitless realms of the air have you read it the marvellous story of sandalphon the angel of glory sandalphon the angel of prayer how erect at the outermost gates of the city celestial he waits with his feet on the ladder of light that crowded with angels unnumbered by jacob was seen as he slumbered alone in the desert at night the angels of wind and of fire chant only one hymn and expire with the songs irresistible stress expire in their rapture and wonder as harpstrings are broken asunder by music they throb to express but serene in the rapturous throng unmoved by the rush of the song with eyes unimpassioned and slow among the dead angels the deathless sandalphon stands listening breathless to sounds that ascend from below from the spirits on earth that adore from the souls that entreat and implore in the fervor and passion of prayer from the hearts that are broken with losses and weary with dragging the crosses too heavy for mortals to bear and he gathers the prayers as he stands and they change into flowers in his hands into garlands of purple and red and beneath the great arch of the portal through the streets of the city immortal is wafted the fragrance they shed it is but a legend i know a fable a phantom a show of the ancient rabbinical lore yet the old mediaeval tradition the beautiful strange superstition but haunts me and holds me the more when i look from my window at night and the welkin above is all white all throbbing and panting with stars among them majestic is standing sandalphon the angel expanding his pinions in nebulous bars and the legend i feel is a part of the hunger and thirst of the heart the frenzy and fire of the brain that grasps at the fruitage forbidden the golden pomegranates of eden to quiet its fever and pain flight the second the childrens hour between the dark and the daylight when the night is beginning to lower comes a pause in the days occupations that is known as the childrens hour i hear in the chamber above me the patter of little feet the sound of a door that is opened and voices soft and sweet from my study i see in the lamplight descending the broad hall stair grave alice and laughing allegra and edith with golden hair a whisper and then a silence yet i know by their merry eyes they are plotting and planning together to take me by surprise a sudden rush from the stairway a sudden raid from the hall by three doors left unguarded they enter my castle wall they climb up into my turret oer the arms and back of my chair if i try to escape they surround me they seem to be everywhere they almost devour me with kisses their arms about me entwine till i think of the bishop of bingen in his mousetower on the rhine do you think o blueeyed banditti because you have scaled the wall such an old mustache as i am is not a match for you all i have you fast in my fortress and will not let you depart but put you down into the dungeon in the roundtower of my heart and there will i keep you forever yes forever and a day till the walls shall crumble to ruin and moulder in dust away enceladus under mount etna he lies it is slumber it is not death for he struggles at times to arise and above him the lurid skies are hot with his fiery breath the crags are piled on his breast the earth is heaped on his head but the groans of his wild unrest though smothered and half suppressed are heard and he is not dead and the nations far away are watching with eager eyes they talk together and say tomorrow perhaps today euceladus will arise and the old gods the austere oppressors in their strength stand aghast and white with fear at the ominous sounds they hear and tremble and mutter at length ah me for the land that is sown with the harvest of despair where the burning cinders blown from the lips of the overthrown enceladus fill the air where ashes are heaped in drifts over vineyard and field and town whenever he starts and lifts his head through the blackened rifts of the crags that keep him down see see the red light shines t is the glare of his awful eyes and the stormwind shouts through the pines of alps and of apennines enceladus arise the cumberland at anchor in hampton roads we lay on board of the cumberland sloopofwar and at times from the fortress across the bay the alarum of drums swept past or a bugle blast from the camp on the shore then far away to the south uprose a little feather of snowwhite smoke and we knew that the iron ship of our foes was steadily steering its course to try the force of our ribs of oak down upon us heavily runs silent and sullen the floating fort then comes a puff of smoke from her guns and leaps the terrible death with fiery breath from each open port we are not idle but send her straight defiance back in a full broadside as hail rebounds from a roof of slate rebounds our heavier hail from each iron scale of the monsters hide strike your flag the rebel cries in his arrogant old plantation strain never our gallant morris replies it is better to sink than to yield and the whole air pealed with the cheers of our men then like a kraken huge and black she crushed our ribs in her iron grasp down went the cumberland all a wrack with a sudden shudder of death and the cannons breath for her dying gasp next morn as the sun rose over the bay still floated our flag at the mainmast head lord how beautiful was thy day every waft of the air was a whisper of prayer or a dirge for the dead ho brave hearts that went down in the seas ye are at peace in the troubled stream ho brave land with hearts like these thy flag that is rent in twain shall be one again and without a seam snowflakes out of the bosom of the air out of the cloudfolds of her garments shaken over the woodlands brown and bare over the harvestfields forsaken silent and soft and slow descends the snow even as our cloudy fancies take suddenly shape in some divine expression even as the troubled heart doth make in the white countenance confession the troubled sky reveals the grief it feels this is the poem of the air slowly in silent syllables recorded this is the secret of despair long in its cloudy bosom hoarded now whispered and revealed to wood and field a day of sunshine o gift of god o perfect day whereon shall no man work but play whereon it is enough for me not to be doing but to be through every fibre of my brain through every nerve through every vein i feel the electric thrill the touch of life that seems almost too much i hear the wind among the trees playing celestial symphonies i see the branches downward bent like keys of some great instrument and over me unrolls on high the splendid scenery of the sky where though a sapphire sea the sun sails like a golden galleon towards yonder cloudland in the west towards yonder islands of the blest whose steep sierra far uplifts its craggy summits white with drifts blow winds and waft through all the rooms the snowflakes of the cherryblooms blow winds and bend within my reach the fiery blossoms of the peach o life and love o happy throng of thoughts whose only speech is song o heart of man canst thou not be blithe as the air is and as free something left undone labor with what zeal we will something still remains undone something uncompleted still waits the rising of the sun by the bedside on the stair at the threshold near the gates with its menace or its prayer like a mendicant it waits waits and will not go away waits and will not be gainsaid by the cares of yesterday each today is heavier made till at length the burden seems greater than our strength can bear heavy as the weight of dreams pressing on us everywhere and we stand from day to day like the dwarfs of times gone by who as northern legends say on their shoulders held the sky weariness o little feet that such long years must wander on through hopes and fears must ache and bleed beneath your load i nearer to the wayside inn where toil shall cease and rest begin am weary thinking of your road o little hands that weak or strong have still to serve or rule so long have still so long to give or ask i who so much with book and pen have toiled among my fellowmen am weary thinking of your task o little hearts that throb and beat with such impatient feverish heat such limitless and strong desires mine that so long has glowed and burned with passions into ashes turned now covers and conceals its fires o little souls as pure and white and crystalline as rays of light direct from heaven their source divine refracted through the mist of years how red my setting sun appears how lurid looks this soul of mine tales of a wayside inn part first prelude the wayside inn one autumn night in sudbury town across the meadows bare and brown the windows of the wayside inn gleamed red with firelight through the leaves of woodbine hanging from the eaves their crimson curtains rent and thin as ancient is this hostelry as any in the land may be built in the old colonial day when men lived in a grander way with ampler hospitality a kind of old hobgoblin hall now somewhat fallen to decay with weatherstains upon the wall and stairways worn and crazy doors and creaking and uneven floors and chimneys huge and tiled and tall a region of repose it seems a place of slumber and of dreams remote among the wooded hills for there no noisy railway speeds its torchrace scattering smoke and gleeds but noon and night the panting teams stop under the great oaks that throw tangles of light and shade below on roofs and doors and windowsills across the road the barns display their lines of stalls their mows of hay through the wide doors the breezes blow the wattled cocks strut to and fro and half effaced by rain and shine the red horse prances on the sign round this oldfashioned quaint abode deep silence reigned save when a gust went rushing down the county road and skeletons of leaves and dust a moment quickened by its breath shuddered and danced their dance of death and through the ancient oaks oerhead mysterious voices moaned and fled but from the parlor of the inn a pleasant murmur smote the ear like water rushing through a weir oft interrupted by the din of laughter and of loud applause and in each intervening pause the music of a violin the firelight shedding over all the splendor of its ruddy glow filled the whole parlor large and low it gleamed on wainscot and on wall it touched with more than wonted grace fair princess marys pictured face it bronzed the rafters overhead on the old spinets ivory keys it played inaudible melodies it crowned the sombre clock with flame the hands the hours the makers name and painted with a livelier red the landlords coatofarms again and flashing on the windowpane emblazoned with its light and shade the jovial rhymes that still remain writ near a century ago by the great major molineaux whom hawthorne has immortal made before the blazing fire of wood erect the rapt musician stood and ever and anon he bent his head upon his instrument and seemed to listen till he caught confessions of its secret thought the joy the triumph the lament the exultation and the pain then by the magic of his art he soothed the throbbings of its heart and lulled it into peace again around the fireside at their ease there sat a group of friends entranced with the delicious melodies who from the faroff noisy town had to the wayside inn come down to rest beneath its old oaktrees the firelight on their faces glanced their shadows on the wainscot danced and though of different lands and speech each had his tale to tell and each was anxious to be pleased and please and while the sweet musician plays let me in outline sketch them all perchance uncouthly as the blaze with its uncertain touch portrays their shadowy semblance on the wall but first the landlord will i trace grave in his aspect and attire a man of ancient pedigree a justice of the peace was he known in all sudbury as the squire proud was he of his name and race of old sir william and sir hugh and in the parlor full in view his coatofarms well framed and glazed upon the wall in colors blazed he beareth gules upon his shield a chevron argent in the field with three wolfs heads and for the crest a wyvern partperpale addressed upon a helmet barred below the scroll reads by the name of howe and over this no longer bright though glimmering with a latent light was hung the sword his grandsire bore in the rebellious days of yore down there at concord in the fight a youth was there of quiet ways a student of old books and days to whom all tongues and lands were known and yet a lover of his own with many a social virtue graced and yet a friend of solitude a man of such a genial mood the heart of all things he embraced and yet of such fastidious taste he never found the best too good books were his passion and delight and in his upper room at home stood many a rare and sumptuous tome in vellum bound with gold bedight great volumes garmented in white recalling florence pisa rome he loved the twilight that surrounds the borderland of old romance where glitter hauberk helm and lance and banner waves and trumpet sounds and ladies ride with hawk on wrist and mighty warriors sweep along magnified by the purple mist the dusk of centuries and of song the chronicles of charlemagne of merlin and the mort darthure mingled together in his brain with tales of flores and blanchefleur sir ferumbras sir eglamour sir launcelot sir morgadour sir guy sir bevis sir gawain a young sicilian too was there in sight of etna born and bred some breath of its volcanic air was glowing in his heart and brain and being rebellious to his liege after palermos fatal siege across the western seas he fled in good king bombas happy reign his face was like a summer night all flooded with a dusky light his hands were small his teeth shone white as seashells when he smiled or spoke his sinews supple and strong as oak clean shaven was he as a priest who at the mass on sunday sings save that upon his upper lip his beard a good palms length least level and pointed at the tip shot sideways like a swallows wings the poets read he oer and oer and most of all the immortal four of italy and next to those the storytelling bard of prose who wrote the joyous tuscan tales of the decameron that make fiesoles green hills and vales remembered for boccaccios sake much too of music was his thought the melodies and measures fraught with sunshine and the open air of vineyards and the singing sea of his beloved sicily and much it pleased him to peruse the songs of the sicilian muse bucolic songs by meli sung in the familiar peasant tongue that made men say behold once more the pitying gods to earth restore theocritus of syracuse a spanish jew from alicant with aspect grand and grave was there vender of silks and fabrics rare and attar of rose from the levant like an old patriarch he appeared abraham or isaac or at least some later prophet or highpriest with lustrous eyes and olive skin and wildly tossed from cheeks and chin the tumbling cataract of his beard his garments breathed a spicy scent of cinnamon and sandal blent like the soft aromatic gales that meet the mariner who sails through the moluccas and the seas that wash the shores of celebes all stories that recorded are by pierre alphonse he knew by heart and it was rumored he could say the parables of sandabar and all the fables of pilpay or if not all the greater part well versed was he in hebrew books talmud and targum and the lore of kabala and evermore there was a mystery in his looks his eyes seemed gazing far away as if in vision or in trance he heard the solemn sackbut play and saw the jewish maidens dance a theologian from the school of cambridge on the charles was there skilful alike with tongue and pen he preached to all men everywhere the gospel of the golden rule the new commandment given to men thinking the deed and not the creed would help us in our utmost need with reverent feet the earth he trod nor banished nature from his plan but studied still with deep research to build the universal church lofty as in the love of god and ample as the wants of man a poet too was there whose verse was tender musical and terse the inspiration the delight the gleam the glory the swift flight of thoughts so sudden that they seem the revelations of a dream all these were his but with them came no envy of anothers fame he did not find his sleep less sweet for music in some neighboring street nor rustling hear in every breeze the laurels of miltiades honor and blessings on his head while living good report when dead who not too eager for renown accepts but does not clutch the crown last the musician as he stood illumined by that fire of wood fairhaired blueeyed his aspect blithe his figure tall and straight and lithe and every feature of his face revealing his norwegian race a radiance streaming from within around his eyes and forehead beamed the angel with the violin painted by raphael he seemed he lived in that ideal world whose language is not speech but song around him evermore the throng of elves and sprites their dances whirled the stromkarl sang the cataract hurled its headlong waters from the height and mingled in the wild delight the scream of seabirds in their flight the rumor of the forest trees the plunge of the implacable seas the tumult of the wind at night voices of eld like trumpets blowing old ballads and wild melodies through mist and darkness pouring forth like elivagars river flowing out of the glaciers of the north the instrument on which he played was in cremonas workshops made by a great master of the past ere yet was lost the art divine fashioned of maple and of pine that in tyrolian forests vast had rocked and wrestled with the blast exquisite was it in design perfect in each minutest part a marvel of the lutists art and in its hollow chamber thus the maker from whose hands it came had written his unrivalled name antonius stradivarius and when he played the atmosphere was filled with magic and the ear caught echoes of that harp of gold whose music had so weird a sound the hunted stag forgot to bound the leaping rivulet backward rolled the birds came down from bush and tree the dead came from beneath the sea the maiden to the harpers knee the music ceased the applause was loud the pleased musician smiled and bowed the woodfire clapped its hands of flame the shadows on the wainscot stirred and from the harpsichord there came a ghostly murmur of acclaim a sound like that sent down at night by birds of passage in their flight from the remotest distance heard then silence followed then began a clamor for the landlords tale the story promised them of old they said but always left untold and he although a bashful man and all his courage seemed to fail finding excuse of no avail yielded and thus the story ran the landlords tale paul reveres ride listen my children and you shall hear of the midnight ride of paul revere on the eighteenth of april in seventyfive hardly a man is now alive who remembers that famous day and year he said to his friend if the british march by land or sea from the town tonight hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch of the north church tower as a signal light one if by land and two if by sea and i on the opposite shore will be ready to ride and spread the alarm through every middlesex village and farm for the country folk to be up and to arm then he said good night and with muffled oar silently rowed to the charlestown shore just as the moon rose over the bay where swinging wide at her moorings lay the somerset british manofwar a phantom ship with each mast and spar across the moon like a prison bar and a huge black hulk that was magnified by its own reflection in the tide meanwhile his friend through alley and street wanders and watches with eager ears till in the silence around him he hears the muster of men at the barrack door the sound of arms and the tramp of feet and the measured tread of the grenadiers marching down to their boats on the shore then he climbed the tower of the old north church by the wooden stairs with stealthy tread to the belfrychamber overhead and startled the pigeons from their perch on the sombre rafters that round him made masses and moving shapes of shade by the trembling ladder steep and tall to the highest window in the wall where he paused to listen and look down a moment on the roofs of the town and the moonlight flowing over all beneath in the churchyard lay the dead in their nightencampment on the hill wrapped in silence so deep and still that he could hear like a sentinels tread the watchful nightwind as it went creeping along from tent to tent and seeming to whisper all is well a moment only he feels the spell of the place and the hour and the secret dread of the lonely belfry and the dead for suddenly all his thoughts are bent on a shadowy something far away where the river widens to meet the bay a line of black that bends and floats on the rising tide like a bridge of boats meanwhile impatient to mount and ride booted and spurred with a heavy stride on the opposite shore walked paul revere now he patted his horses side now gazed at the landscape far and near then impetuous stamped the earth and turned and tightened his saddlegirth but mostly he watched with eager search the belfrytower of the old north church as it rose above the graves on the hill lonely and spectral and sombre and still and lo as he looks on the belfrys height a glimmer and then a gleam of light he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns but lingers and gazes till full on his sight a second lamp in the belfry burns a hurry of hoofs in a village street a shape in the moonlight a bulk in the dark and beneath from the pebbles in passing a spark struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet that was all and yet through the gloom and the light the fate of a nation was riding that night and the spark struck out by that steed in his flight kindled the land into flame with its heat he has left the village and mounted the steep and beneath him tranquil and broad and deep is the mystic meeting the ocean tides and under the alders that skirt its edge now soft on the sand now loud on the ledge is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides it was twelve by the village clock when he crossed the bridge into medford town he heard the crowing of the cock and the barking of the farmers dog and felt the damp of the river fog that rises after the sun goes down it was one by the village clock when he galloped into lexington he saw the gilded weathercock swim in the moonlight as he passed and the meetinghouse windows blank and bare gaze at him with a spectral glare as if they already stood aghast at the bloody work they would look upon it was two by the village clock when he came to the bridge in concord town he heard the bleating of the flock and the twitter of birds among the trees and felt the breath of the morning breeze blowing over the meadows brown and one was safe and asleep in his bed who at the bridge would be first to fall who that day would be lying dead pierced by a british musketball you know the rest in the books you have read how the british regulars fired and fled how the farmers gave them ball for ball from behind each fence and farmyard wall chasing the redcoats down the lane then crossing the fields to emerge again under the trees at the turn of the road and only pausing to fire and load so through the night rode paul revere and so through the night went his cry of alarm to every middlesex village and farm a cry of defiance and not of fear a voice in the darkness a knock at the door and a word that shall echo forevermore for borne on the nightwind of the past through all our history to the last in the hour of darkness and peril and need the people will waken and listen to hear the hurrying hoofbeats of that steed and the midnight message of paul revere interlude the landlord ended thus his tale then rising took down from its nail the sword that hung there dim with dust and cleaving to its sheath with rust and said this sword was in the fight the poet seized it and exclaimed it is the sword of a good knight though homespun was his coatofmail what matter if it be not named joyeuse colada durindale excalibar or aroundight or other name the books record your ancestor who bore this sword as colonel of the volunteers mounted upon his old gray mare seen here and there and everywhere to me a grander shape appears than old sir william or what not clinking about in foreign lands with iron gauntlets on his hands and on his head an iron pot all laughed the landlords face grew red as his escutcheon on the wall he could not comprehend at all the drift of what the poet said for those who had been longest dead were always greatest in his eyes and be was speechless with surprise to see sir williams plumed head brought to a level with the rest and made the subject of a jest and this perceiving to appease the landlords wrath the others fears the student said with careless ease the ladies and the cavaliers the arms the loves the courtesies the deeds of high emprise i sing thus ariosto says in words that have the stately stride and ring of armed knights and clashing swords now listen to the tale i bring listen though not to me belong the flowing draperies of his song the words that rouse the voice that charms the landlords tale was one of arms only a tale of love is mine blending the human and divine a tale of the decameron told in palmieris garden old by fiametta laurelcrowned while her companions lay around and heard the intermingled sound of airs that on their errands sped and wild birds gossiping overhead and lisp of leaves and fountains fall and her own voice more sweet than all telling the tale which wanting these perchance may lose its power to please the students tale the falcon of ser federigo one summer morning when the sun was hot weary with labor in his gardenplot on a rude bench beneath his cottage eaves ser federigo sat among the leaves of a huge vine that with its arms outspread hung its delicious clusters overhead below him through the lovely valley flowed the river arno like a winding road and from its banks were lifted high in air the spires and roofs of florence called the fair to him a marble tomb that rose above his wasted fortunes and his buried love for there in banquet and in tournament his wealth had lavished been his substance spent to woo and lose since ill his wooing sped monna giovanna who his rival wed yet ever in his fancy reigned supreme the ideal woman of a young mans dream then he withdrew in poverty and pain to this small farm the last of his domain his only comfort and his only care to prune his vines and plant the fig and pear his only forester and only guest his falcon faithful to him when the rest whose willing hands had found so light of yore the brazen knocker of his palace door had now no strength to lift the wooden latch that entrance gave beneath a roof of thatch companion of his solitary ways purveyor of his feasts on holidays on him this melancholy man bestowed the love with which his nature overflowed and so the emptyhanded years went round vacant though voiceful with prophetic sound and so that summer morn he sat and mused with folded patient hands as he was used and dreamily before his halfclosed sight floated the vision of his lost delight beside him motionless the drowsy bird dreamed of the chase and in his slumber heard the sudden scythelike sweep of wings that dare the headlong plunge thro eddying gulfs of air then starting broad awake upon his perch tinkled his bells like massbells in a church and looking at his master seemed to say ser federigo shall we hunt today ser federigo thought not of the chase the tender vision of her lovely face i will not say he seems to see he sees in the leafshadows of the trellises herself yet not herself a lovely child with flowing tresses and eyes wide and wild coming undaunted up the garden walk and looking not at him but at the hawk beautiful falcon said he would that i might hold thee on my wrist or see thee fly the voice was hers and made strange echoes start through all the haunted chambers of his heart as an aeolian harp through gusty doors of some old ruin its wild music pours who is thy mother my fair boy he said his hand laid softly on that shining head monna giovanna will you let me stay a little while and with your falcon play we live there just beyond your garden wall in the great house behind the poplars tall so he spake on and federigo heard as from afar each softly uttered word and drifted onward through the golden gleams and shadows of the misty sea of dreams as mariners becalmed through vapors drift and feel the sea beneath them sink and lift and hear far off the mournful breakers roar and voices calling faintly from the shore then waking from his pleasant reveries he took the little boy upon his knees and told him stories of his gallant bird till in their friendship he became a third monna giovanna widowed in her prime had come with friends to pass the summer time in her grand villa halfway up the hill oerlooking florence but retired and still with iron gates that opened through long lines of sacred ilex and centennial pines and terraced gardens and broad steps of stone and sylvan deities with moss oergrown and fountains palpitating in the heat and all val darno stretched beneath its feet here in seclusion as a widow may the lovely lady whiled the hours away pacing in sable robes the statued hall herself the stateliest statue among all and seeing more and more with secret joy her husband risen and living in her boy till the lost sense of life returned again not as delight but as relief from pain meanwhile the boy rejoicing in his strength stormed down the terraces from length to length the screaming peacock chased in hot pursuit and climbed the garden trellises for fruit but his chief pastime was to watch the flight of a gerfalcon soaring into sight beyond the trees that fringed the garden wall then downward stooping at some distant call and as he gazed full often wondered he who might the master of the falcon be until that happy morning when he found master and falcon in the cottage ground and now a shadow and a terror fell on the great house as if a passingbell tolled from the tower and filled each spacious room with secret awe and preternatural gloom the petted boy grew ill and day by day pined with mysterious malady away the mothers heart would not be comforted her darling seemed to her already dead and often sitting by the sufferers side what can i do to comfort thee she cried at first the silent lips made no reply but moved at length by her importunate cry give me he answered with imploring tone ser federigos falcon for my own no answer could the astonished mother make how could she ask een for her darlings sake such favor at a luckless lovers hand well knowing that to ask was to command well knowing what all falconers confessed in all the land that falcon was the best the masters pride and passion and delight and the sole pursuivant of this poor knight but yet for her childs sake she could no less than give assent to soothe his restlessness so promised and then promising to keep her promise sacred saw him fall asleep the morrow was a bright september morn the earth was beautiful as if newborn there was that nameless splendor everywhere that wild exhilaration in the air which makes the passers in the city street congratulate each other as they meet two lovely ladies clothed in cloak and hood passed through the garden gate into the wood under the lustrous leaves and through the sheen of dewy sunshine showering down between the one closehooded had the attractive grace which sorrow sometimes lends a womans face her dark eyes moistened with the mists that roll from the gulfstream of passion in the soul the other with her hood thrown back her hair making a golden glory in the air her cheeks suffused with an auroral blush her young heart singing louder than the thrush so walked that morn through mingled light and shade each by the others presence lovelier made monna giovanna and her bosom friend intent upon their errand and its end they found ser federigo at his toil like banished adam delving in the soil and when he looked and these fair women spied the garden suddenly was glorified his longlost eden was restored again and the strange river winding through the plain no longer was the arno to his eyes but the euphrates watering paradise monna giovanna raised her stately head and with fair words of salutation said ser federigo we come here as friends hoping in this to make some poor amends for past unkindness i who neer before would even cross the threshold of your door i who in happier days such pride maintained refused your banquets and your gifts disdained this morning come a selfinvited guest to put your generous nature to the test and breakfast with you under your own vine to which he answered poor desert of mine not your unkindness call it for if aught is good in me of feeling or of thought from you it comes and this last grace outweighs all sorrows all regrets of other days and after further compliment and talk among the asters in the garden walk he left his guests and to his cottage turned and as he entered for a moment yearned for the lost splendors of the days of old the ruby glass the silver and the gold and felt how piercing is the sting of pride by want embittered and intensified he looked about him for some means or way to keep this unexpected holiday searched every cupboard and then searched again summoned the maid who came but came in vain the signor did not hunt today she said theres nothing in the house but wine and bread then suddenly the drowsy falcon shook his little bells with that sagacious look which said as plain as language to the ear if anything is wanting i am here yes everything is wanting gallant bird the master seized thee without further word like thine own lure he whirled thee round ah me the pomp and flutter of brave falconry the bells the jesses the bright scarlet hood the flight and the pursuit oer field and wood all these forevermore are ended now no longer victor but the victim thou then on the board a snowwhite cloth he spread laid on its wooden dish the loaf of bread brought purple grapes with autumn sunshine hot the fragrant peach the juicy bergamot then in the midst a flask of wine he placed and with autumnal flowers the banquet graced ser federigo would not these suffice without thy falcon stuffed with cloves and spice when all was ready and the courtly dame with her companion to the cottage came upon ser federigos brain there fell the wild enchantment of a magic spell the room they entered mean and low and small was changed into a sumptuous banquethall with fanfares by aerial trumpets blown the rustic chair she sat on was a throne he ate celestial food and a divine flavor was given to his country wine and the poor falcon fragrant with his spice a peacock was or bird of paradise when the repast was ended they arose and passed again into the gardenclose then said the lady far too well i know remembering still the days of long ago though you betray it not with what surprise you see me here in this familiar wise you have no children and you cannot guess what anguish what unspeakable distress a mother feels whose child is lying ill nor how her heart anticipates his will and yet for this you see me lay aside all womanly reserve and check of pride and ask the thing most precious in your sight your falcon your sole comfort and delight which if you find it in your heart to give my poor unhappy boy perchance may live ser federigo listens and replies with tears of love and pity in his eyes alas dear lady there can be no task so sweet to me as giving when you ask one little hour ago if i had known this wish of yours it would have been my own but thinking in what manner i could best do honor to the presence of my guest i deemed that nothing worthier could be than what most dear and precious was to me and so my gallant falcon breathed his last to furnish forth this morning our repast in mute contrition mingled with dismay the gentle lady tuned her eyes away grieving that he such sacrifice should make and kill his falcon for a womans sake yet feeling in her heart a womans pride that nothing she could ask for was denied then took her leave and passed out at the gate with footstep slow and soul disconsolate three days went by and lo a passingbell tolled from the little chapel in the dell ten strokes ser federigo heard and said breathing a prayer alas her child is dead three months went by and lo a merrier chime rang from the chapel bells at christmas time the cottage was deserted and no more ser federigo sat beside its door but now with servitors to do his will in the grand villa halfway up the hill sat at the christmas feast and at his side monna giovanna his beloved bride never so beautiful so kind so fair enthroned once more in the old rustic chair highperched upon the back of which there stood the image of a falcon carved in wood and underneath the inscription with date all things come round to him who will but wait interlude soon as the story reached its end one over eager to commend crowned it with injudicious praise and then the voice of blame found vent and fanned the embers of dissent into a somewhat lively blaze the theologian shook his head these old italian tales he said from the muchpraised decameron down through all the rabble of the rest are either trifling dull or lewd the gossip of a neighborhood in some remote provincial town a scandalous chronicle at best they seem to me a stagnant fen grown rank with rushes and with reeds where a white lily now and then blooms in the midst of noxious weeds and deadly nightshade on its banks to this the student straight replied for the white lily many thanks one should not say with too much pride fountain i will not drink of thee nor were it grateful to forget that from these reservoirs and tanks even imperial shakespeare drew his moor of venice and the jew and romeo and juliet and many a famous comedy then a long pause till some one said an angel is flying overhead at these words spake the spanish jew and murmured with an inward breath god grant if what you say be true it may not be the angel of death and then another pause and then stroking his beard he said again this brings back to my memory a story in the talmud told that book of gems that book of gold of wonders many and manifold a tale that often comes to me and fills my heart and haunts my brain and never wearies nor grows old the spanish jews tale the legend of rabbi ben levi rabbi ben levi on the sabbath read a volume of the law in which it said no man shall look upon my face and live and as he read he prayed that god would give his faithful servant grace with mortal eye to look upon his face and yet not die then fell a sudden shadow on the page and lifting up his eyes grown dim with age he saw the angel of death before him stand holding a naked sword in his right hand rabbi ben levi was a righteous man yet through his veins a chill of terror ran with trembling voice he said what wilt thou here the angel answered lo the time draws near when thou must die yet first by gods decree whateer thou askest shall be granted thee replied the rabbi let these living eyes first look upon my place in paradise then said the angel come with me and look rabbi ben levi closed the sacred book and rising and uplifting his gray head give me thy sword he to the angel said lest thou shouldst fall upon me by the way the angel smiled and hastened to obey then led him forth to the celestial town and set him on the wall whence gazing down rabbi ben levi with his living eyes might look upon his place in paradise then straight into the city of the lord the rabbi leaped with the deathangels sword and through the streets there swept a sudden breath of something there unknown which men call death meanwhile the angel stayed without and cried come back to which the rabbis voice replied no in the name of god whom i adore i swear that hence i will depart no more then all the angels cried o holy one see what the son of levi here hath done the kingdom of heaven he takes by violence and in thy name refuses to go hence the lord replied my angels be not wroth did eer the son of levi break his oath let him remain for he with mortal eye shall look upon my face and yet not die beyond the outer wall the angel of death heard the great voice and said with panting breath give back the sword and let me go my way whereat the rabbi paused and answered nay anguish enough already hath it caused among the sons of men and while he paused he heard the awful mandate of the lord resounding through the air give back the sword the rabbi bowed his head in silent prayer then said he to the dreadful angel swear no human eye shall look on it again but when thou takest away the souls of men thyself unseen and with an unseen sword thou wilt perform the bidding of the lord the angel took the sword again and swore and walks on earth unseen forevermore interlude he ended and a kind of spell upon the silent listeners fell his solemn manner and his words had touched the deep mysterious chords that vibrate in each human breast alike but not alike confessed the spiritual world seemed near and close above them full of fear its awful adumbration passed a luminous shadow vague and vast they almost feared to look lest there embodied from the impalpable air they might behold the angel stand holding the sword in his right hand at last but in a voice subdued not to disturb their dreamy mood said the sicilian while you spoke telling your legend marvellous suddenly in my memory woke the thought of one now gone from us an old abate meek and mild my friend and teacher when a child who sometimes in those days of old the legend of an angel told which ran as i remember thus the sicilians tale king robert of sicily robert of sicily brother of pope urbane and valmond emperor of allemaine apparelled in magnificent attire with retinue of many a knight and squire on st johns eve at vespers proudly sat and heard the priests chant the magnificat and as he listened oer and oer again repeated like a burden or refrain he caught the words deposuit potentes de sede et exaltavit humiles and slowly lifting up his kingly head he to a learned clerk beside him said what mean these words the clerk made answer meet he has put down the mighty from their seat and has exalted them of low degree thereat king robert muttered scornfully t is well that such seditious words are sung only by priests and in the latin tongue for unto priests and people be it known there is no power can push me from my throne and leaning back he yawned and fell asleep lulled by the chant monotonous and deep when he awoke it was already night the church was empty and there was no light save where the lamps that glimmered few and faint lighted a little space before some saint he started from his seat and gazed around but saw no living thing and heard no sound he groped towards the door but it was locked he cried aloud and listened and then knocked and uttered awful threatenings and complaints and imprecations upon men and saints the sounds reechoed from the roof and walls as if dead priests were laughing in their stalls at length the sexton hearing from without the tumult of the knocking and the shout and thinking thieves were in the house of prayer came with his lantern asking who is there half choked with rage king robert fiercely said open tis i the king art thou afraid the frightened sexton muttering with a curse this is some drunken vagabond or worse turned the great key and flung the portal wide a man rushed by him at a single stride haggard half naked without hat or cloak who neither turned nor looked at him nor spoke but leaped into the blackness of the night and vanished like a spectre from his sight robert of sicily brother of pope urbane and valmond emperor of allemaine despoiled of his magnificent attire bareheaded breathless and besprent with mire with sense of wrong and outrage desperate strode on and thundered at the palace gate rushed through the courtyard thrusting in his rage to right and left each seneschal and page and hurried up the broad and sounding stair his white face ghastly in the torches glare from hall to hall he passed with breathless speed voices and cries he heard but did not heed until at last he reached the banquetroom blazing with light and breathing with perfume there on the dais sat another king wearing his robes his crown his signetring king roberts self in features form and height but all transfigured with angelic light it was an angel and his presence there with a divine effulgence filled the air an exaltation piercing the disguise though none the hidden angel recognize a moment speechless motionless amazed the throneless monarch on the angel gazed who met his look of anger and surprise with the divine compassion of his eyes then said who art thou and why comst thou here to which king robert answered with a sneer i am the king and come to claim my own from an impostor who usurps my throne and suddenly at these audacious words up sprang the angry guests and drew their swords the angel answered with unruffled brow nay not the king but the kings jester thou henceforth shall wear the bells and scalloped cape and for thy counsellor shalt lead an ape thou shalt obey my servants when they call and wait upon my henchmen in the hall deaf to king roberts threats and cries and prayers they thrust him from the hall and down the stairs a group of tittering pages ran before and as they opened wide the folding door his heart failed for he heard with strange alarms the boisterous laughter of the menatarms and all the vaulted chamber roar and ring with the mock plaudits of long live the king next morning waking with the days first beam he said within himself it was a dream but the straw rustled as he turned his head there were the cap and bells beside his bed around him rose the bare discolored walls close by the steeds were champing in their stalls and in the corner a revolting shape shivering and chattering sat the wretched ape it was no dream the world he loved so much had turned to dust and ashes at his touch days came and went and now returned again to sicily the old saturnian reign under the angels governance benign the happy island danced with corn and wine and deep within the mountains burning breast enceladus the giant was at rest meanwhile king robert yielded to his fate sullen and silent and disconsolate dressed in the motley garb that jesters wear with look bewildered and a vacant stare close shaven above the ears as monks are shorn by courtiers mocked by pages laughed to scorn his only friend the ape his only food what others left he still was unsubdued and when the angel met him on his way and half in earnest half in jest would say sternly though tenderly that he might feel the velvet scabbard held a sword of steel art thou the king the passion of his woe burst from him in resistless overflow and lifting high his forehead he would fling the haughty answer back i am i am the king almost three years were ended when there came ambassadors of great repute and name from valmond emperor of allemaine unto king robert saying that pope urbane by letter summoned them forthwith to come on holy thursday to his city of rome the angel with great joy received his guests and gave them presents of embroidered vests and velvet mantles with rich ermine lined and rings and jewels of the rarest kind then he departed with them oer the sea into the lovely land of italy whose loveliness was more resplendent made by the mere passing of that cavalcade with plumes and cloaks and housings and the stir of jewelled bridle and of golden spur and lo among the menials in mock state upon a piebald steed with shambling gait his cloak of foxtails flapping in the wind the solemn ape demurely perched behind king robert rode making huge merriment in all the country towns through which they went the pope received them with great pomp and blare of bannered trumpets on saint peters square giving his benediction and embrace fervent and full of apostolic grace while with congratulations and with prayers he entertained the angel unawares robert the jester bursting through the crowd into their presence rushed and cried aloud i am the king look and behold in me robert your brother king of sicily this man who wears my semblance to your eyes is an impostor in a kings disguise do you not know me does no voice within answer my cry and say we are akin the pope in silence but with troubled mien gazed at the angels countenance serene the emperor laughing said it is strange sport to keep a mad man for thy fool at court and the poor baffled jester in disgrace was hustled back among the populace in solemn state the holy week went by and easter sunday gleamed upon the sky the presence of the angel with its light before the sun rose made the city bright and with new fervor filled the hearts of men who felt that christ indeed had risen again even the jester on his bed of straw with haggard eyes the unwonted splendor saw he felt within a power unfelt before and kneeling humbly on his chamber floor he heard the rushing garments of the lord sweep through the silent air ascending heavenward and now the visit ending and once more valmond returning to the danubes shore homeward the angel journeyed and again the land was made resplendent with his train flashing along the towns of italy unto salerno and from thence by sea and when once more within palermos wall and seated on the throne in his great hall he heard the angelus from convent towers as if the better world conversed with ours he beckoned to king robert to draw nigher and with a gesture bade the rest retire and when they were alone the angel said art thou the king then bowing down his head king robert crossed both hands upon his breast and meekly answered him thou knowest best my sins as scarlet are let me go hence and in some cloisters school of penitence across those stones that pave the way to heaven walk barefoot till my guilty soul be shriven the angel smiled and from his radiant face a holy light illumined all the place and through the open window loud and clear they heard the monks chant in the chapel near above the stir and tumult of the street he has put down the mighty from their seat and has exalted them of low degree and through the chant a second melody rose like the throbbing of a single string i am an angel and thou art the king king robert who was standing near the throne lifted his eyes and lo he was alone but all apparelled as in days of old with ermined mantle and with cloth of gold and when his courtiers came they found him there kneeling upon the floor absorbed in silent prayer interlude and then the blueeyed norseman told a saga of the days of old there is said he a wondrous book of legends in the old norse tongue of the dead kings of norroway legends that once were told or sung in many a smoky fireside nook of iceland in the ancient day by wandering sagaman or scald heimskringla is the volume called and he who looks may find therein the story that i now begin and in each pause the story made upon his violin he played as an appropriate interlude fragments of old norwegian tunes that bound in one the separate runes and held the mind in perfect mood entwining and encircling all the strange and antiquated rhymes with melodies of olden times as over some halfruined wall disjointed and about to fall fresh woodbines climb and interlace and keep the loosened stones in place the musicians tale the saga of king olaf i the challenge of thor i am the god thor i am the war god i am the thunderer here in my northland my fastness and fortress reign i forever here amid icebergs rule i the nations this is my hammer miolner the mighty giants and sorcerers cannot withstand it these are the gauntlets wherewith i wield it and hurl it afar off this is my girdle whenever i brace it strength is redoubled the light thou beholdest stream through the heavens in flashes of crimson is but my red beard blown by the nightwind affrighting the nations jove is my brother mine eyes are the lightning the wheels of my chariot roll in the thunder the blows of my hammer ring in the earthquake force rules the world still has ruled it shall rule it meekness is weakness strength is triumphant over the whole earth still is it thorsday thou art a god too o galilean and thus singlehanded unto the combat gauntlet or gospel here i defy thee ii king olafs return and king olaf heard the cry saw the red light in the sky laid his hand upon his sword as he leaned upon the railing and his ships went sailing sailing northward into drontheim fiord there he stood as one who dreamed and the red light glanced and gleamed on the armor that he wore and he shouted as the rifled streamers oer him shook and shifted i accept thy challenge thor to avenge his father slain and reconquer realm and reign came the youthful olaf home through the midnight sailing sailing listening to the wild winds wailing and the dashing of the foam to his thoughts the sacred name of his mother astrid came and the tale she oft had told of her flight by secret passes through the mountains and morasses to the home of hakon old then strange memories crowded back of queen gunhilds wrath and wrack and a hurried flight by sea of grim vikings and the rapture of the seafight and the capture and the life of slavery how a stranger watched his face in the esthonian marketplace scanned his features one by one saying we should know each other i am sigurd astrids brother thou art olaf astrids son then as queen allogias page old in honors young in age chief of all her menatarms till vague whispers and mysterious reached king valdemar the imperious filling him with strange alarms then his cruisings oer the seas westward to the hebrides and to scillys rocky shore and the hermits cavern dismal christs great name and rites baptismal in the oceans rush and roar all these thoughts of love and strife glimmered through his lurid life as the stars intenser light through the red flames oer him trailing as his ships went sailing sailing northward in the summer night trained for either camp or court skilful in each manly sport young and beautiful and tall art of warfare craft of chases swimming skating snowshoe races excellent alike in all when at sea with all his rowers he along the bending oars outside of his ship could run he the smalsor horn ascended and his shining shield suspended on its summit like a sun on the shiprails he could stand wield his sword with either hand and at once two javelins throw at all feasts where ale was strongest sat the merry monarch longest first to come and last to go norway never yet had seen one so beautiful of mien one so royal in attire when in arms completely furnished harness goldinlaid and burnished mantle like a flame of fire thus came olaf to his own when upon the nightwind blown passed that cry along the shore and he answered while the rifted streamers oer him shook and shifted i accept thy challenge thor iii thora of rimol thora of rimol hide me hide me danger and shame and death betide me for olaf the king is hunting me down through field and forest through thorp and town thus cried jarl hakon to thora the fairest of women hakon jarl for the love i bear thee neither shall shame nor death come near thee but the hidingplace wherein thou must lie is the cave underneath the swine in the sty thus to jarl hakon said thora the fairest of women so hakon jarl and his base thrall karker crouched in the cave than a dungeon darker as olaf came riding with men in mail through the forest roads into orkadale demanding jarl hakon of thorn the fairest of women rich and honored shall be whoever the head of hakon jarl shall dissever hakon heard him and karker the slave through the breathingholes of the darksome cave alone in her chamber wept thora the fairest of women said karker the crafty i will not slay thee for all the kings gold i will never betray thee then why dost thou turn so pale o churl and then again black as the earth said the earl more pale and more faithful was thora the fairest of women from a dream in the night the thrall started saying round my neck a gold ring king olaf was laying and hakon answered beware of the king he will lay round thy neck a bloodred ring at the ring on her finger gazed thorn the fairest of women at daybreak slept hakon with sorrows encumbered but screamed and drew up his feet as he slumbered the thrall in the darkness plunged with his knife and the earl awakened no more in this life but wakeful and weeping sat thorn the fairest of women at nidarholm the priests are all singing two ghastly heads on the gibbet are swinging one is jarl hakons and one is his thralls and the people are shouting from windows and walls while alone in her chamber swoons thorn the fairest of women iv queen sigrid the haughty queen sigrid the haughty sat proud and aloft in her chamber that looked over meadow and croft hearts dearest why dost thou sorrow so the floor with tassels of fir was besprent filling the room with their fragrant scent she heard the birds sing she saw the sun shine the air of summer was sweeter than wine like a sword without scabbard the bright river lay between her own kingdom and norroway but olaf the king had sued for her hand the sword would be sheathed the river be spanned her maidens were seated around her knee working bright figures in tapestry and one was singing the ancient rune of brynhildas love and the wrath of gudrun and through it and round it and over it all sounded incessant the waterfall the queen in her hand held a ring of gold from the door of lades temple old king olaf had sent her this wedding gift but her thoughts as arrows were keen and swift she had given the ring to her goldsmiths twain who smiled as they handed it back again and sigrid the queen in her haughty way said why do you smile my goldsmiths say and they answered o queen if the truth must be told the ring is of copper and not of gold the lightning flashed oer her forehead and cheek she only murmured she did not speak if in his gifts he can faithless be there will be no gold in his love to me a footstep was heard on the outer stair and in strode king olaf with royal air he kissed the queens hand and he whispered of love and swore to be true as the stars are above but she smiled with contempt as she answered o king will you swear it as odin once swore on the ring and the king o speak not of odin to me the wife of king olaf a christian must be looking straight at the king with her level brows she said i keep true to my faith and my vows then the face of king olaf was darkened with gloom he rose in his anger and strode through the room why then should i care to have thee he said a faded old woman a heathenish jade his zeal was stronger than fear or love and he struck the queen in the face with his glove then forth from the chamber in anger he fled and the wooden stairway shook with his tread queen sigrid the haughty said under her breath this insult king olaf shall be thy death hearts dearest why dost thou sorrow so v the skerry of shrieks now from all king olafs farms his menatarms gathered on the eve of easter to his house at angvaldsness fast they press drinking with the royal feaster loudly through the wideflung door came the roar of the sea upon the skerry and its thunder loud and near reached the ear mingling with their voices merry hark said olaf to his scald halfred the bald listen to that song and learn it half my kingdom would i give as i live if by such songs you would earn it for of all the runes and rhymes of all times best i like the oceans dirges when the old harper heaves and rocks his hoary locks flowing and flashing in the surges halfred answered i am called the unappalled nothing hinders me or daunts me hearken to me then o king while i sing the great ocean song that haunts me i will hear your song sublime some other time says the drowsy monarch yawning and retires each laughing guest applauds the jest then they sleep till day is dawning facing up and down the yard king olafs guard saw the seamist slowly creeping oer the sands and up the hill gathering still round the house where they were sleeping it was not the fog he saw nor misty flaw that above the landscape brooded it was eyvind kalldas crew of warlocks blue with their caps of darkness hooded round and round the house they go weaving slow magic circles to encumber and imprison in their ring olaf the king as he helpless lies in slumber then athwart the vapors dun the easter sun streamed with one broad track of splendor in their real forms appeared the warlocks weird awful as the witch of endor blinded by the light that glared they groped and stared round about with steps unsteady from his window olaf gazed and amazed who are these strange people said he eyvind kallda and his men answered then from the yard a sturdy farmer while the menatarms apace filled the place busily buckling on their armor from the gates they sallied forth south and north scoured the island coast around them seizing all the warlock band foot and hand on the skerrys rocks they bound them and at eve the king again called his train and with all the candles burning silent sat and heard once more the sullen roar of the ocean tides returning shrieks and cries of wild despair filled the air growing fainter as they listened then the bursting surge alone sounded on thus the sorcerers were christened sing o scald your song sublime your oceanrhyme cried king olaf it will cheer me said the scald with pallid cheeks the skerry of shrieks sings too loud for you to hear me vi the wraith of odin the guests were loud the ale was strong king olaf feasted late and long the hoary scalds together sang oerhead the smoky rafters rang dead rides sir morten of fogelsang the door swung wide with creak and din a blast of cold nightair came in and on the threshold shivering stood a oneeyed guest with cloak and hood dead rides sir morten of fogelsang the king exclaimed o graybeard pale come warm thee with this cup of ale the foaming draught the old man quaffed the noisy guests looked on and laughed dead rides sir morten of fogelsang then spake the king be not afraid sit here by me the guest obeyed and seated at the table told tales of the sea and sagas old dead rides sir morten of fogelsang and ever when the tale was oer the king demanded yet one more till sigurd the bishop smiling said t is late o king and time for bed dead rides sir morten of fogelsang the king retired the stranger guest followed and entered with the rest the lights were out the pages gone but still the garrulous guest spake on dead rides sir morten of fogelsang as one who from a volume reads he spake of heroes and their deeds of lands and cities he had seen and stormy gulfs that tossed between dead rides sir morten of fogelsang then from his lips in music rolled the havamal of odin old with sounds mysterious as the roar of billows on a distant shore dead rides sir morten of fogelsang do we not learn from runes and rhymes made by the gods in elder times and do not still the great scalds teach that silence better is than speech dead rides sir morten of fogelsang smiling at this the king replied thy lore is by thy tongue belied for never was i so enthralled either by sagaman or scald dead rides sir morten of fogelsang the bishop said late hours we keep night wanes o king t is tune or sleep then slept the king and when he woke the guest was gone the morning broke dead rides sir morten of fogelsang they found the doors securely barred they found the watchdog in the yard there was no footprint in the grass and none had seen the stranger pass dead rides sir morten of fogelsang king olaf crossed himself and said i know that odin the great is dead sure is the triumph of our faith the oneeyed stranger was his wraith dead rides sir morten of fogelsang vii ironbeard olaf the king one summer morn blew a blast on his buglehorn sending his signal through the land of drontheim and to the husting held at mere gathered the farmers far and near with their war weapons ready to confront him ploughing under the morning star old ironbeard in yriar heard the summons chuckling with a low laugh he wiped the sweatdrops from his brow unharnessed his horses from the plough and clattering came on horseback to king olaf he was the churliest of the churls little he cared for king or earls bitter as homebrewed ale were his foaming passions hoddengray was the garb he wore and by the hammer of thor he swore he hated the narrow town and all its fashions but he loved the freedom of his farm his ale at night by the fireside warm gudrun his daughter with her flaxen tresses he loved his horses and his herds the smell of the earth and the song of birds his wellfilled barns his brook with its watercresses huge and cumbersome was his frame his beard from which he took his name frosty and fierce like that of hymer the giant so at the husting he appeared the farmer of yriar ironbeard on horseback in an attitude defiant and to king olaf he cried aloud out of the middle of the crowd that tossed about him like a stormy ocean such sacrifices shalt thou bring to odin and to thor o king as other kings have done in their devotion king olaf answered i command this land to be a christian land here is my bishop who the folk baptizes but if you ask me to restore your sacrifices stained with gore then will i offer human sacrifices not slaves and peasants shall they be but men of note and high degree such men as orm of lyra and kar of gryting then to their temple strode he in and loud behind him heard the din of his menatarms and the peasants fiercely fighting there in the temple carved in wood the image of great odin stood and other gods with thor supreme among them king olaf smote them with the blade of his huge waraxe gold inlaid and downward shattered to the pavement flung them at the same moment rose without from the contending crowd a shout a mingled sound of triumph and of wailing and there upon the trampled plain the farmer ironbeard lay slain midway between the assailed and the assailing king olaf from the doorway spoke choose ye between two things my folk to be baptized or given up to slaughter and seeing their leader stark and dead the people with a murmur said o king baptize us with thy holy water so all the drontheim land became a christian land in name and fame in the old gods no more believing and trusting and as a bloodatonement soon king olaf wed the fair gudrun and thus in peace ended the drontheim husting viii gudrun on king olafs bridal night shines the moon with tender light and across the chamber streams its tide of dreams at the fatal midnight hour when all evil things have power in the glimmer of the moon stands gudrun close against her heaving breast something in her hand is pressed like an icicle its sheen is cold and keen on the cairn are fixed her eyes where her murdered father lies and a voice remote and drear she seems to hear what a bridal night is this cold will be the daggers kiss laden with the chill of death is its breath like the drifting snow she sweeps to the couch where olaf sleeps suddenly he wakes and stirs his eyes meet hers what is that king olaf said gleams so bright above thy head wherefore standest thou so white in pale moonlight t is the bodkin that i wear when at night i bind my hair it woke me falling on the floor t is nothing more forests have ears and fields have eyes often treachery lurking lies underneath the fairest hair gudrun beware ere the earliest peep of morn blew king olafs buglehorn and forever sundered ride bridegroom and bride ix thangbrand the priest short of stature large of limb burly face and russet beard all the women stared at him when in iceland he appeared look they said with nodding head there goes thangbrand olafs priest all the prayers he knew by rote he could preach like chrysostome from the fathers he could quote he had even been at rome a learned clerk a man of mark was this thangbrand olafs priest he was quarrelsome and loud and impatient of control boisterous in the market crowd boisterous at the wassailbowl everywhere would drink and swear swaggering thangbrand olafs priest in his house this malcontent could the king no longer bear so to iceland he was sent to convert the heathen there and away one summer day sailed this thangbrand olafs priest there in iceland oer their books pored the people day and night but he did not like their looks nor the songs they used to write all this rhyme is waste of time grumbled thangbrand olafs priest to the alehouse where he sat came the scalds and sagamen is it to be wondered at that they quarrelled now and then when oer his beer began to leer drunken thangbrand olafs priest all the folk in altafiord boasted of their island grand saying in a single word iceland is the finest land that the sun doth shine upon loud laughed thangbrand olafs priest and he answered whats the use of this bragging up and down when three women and one goose make a market in your town every scald satires scrawled on poor thangbrand olafs priest something worse they did than that and what vexed him most of all was a figure in shovel hat drawn in charcoal on the wall with words that go sprawling below this is thangbrand olafs priest hardly knowing what he did then he smote them might and main thorvald veile and veterlid lay there in the alehouse slain today we are gold tomorrow

olafs priest x raud the strong all the old gods are dead all the wild warlocks fled but the white christ lives and reigns and throughout my wide domains his gospel shall be spread on the evangelists thus swore king olaf but still in dreams of the night beheld he the crimson light and heard the voice that defied him who was crucified and challenged him to the fight to sigurd the bishop king olaf confessed it and sigurd the bishop said the old gods are not dead for the great thor still reigns and among the jarls and thanes the old witchcraft still is spread thus to king olaf said sigurd the bishop far north in the salten fiord by rapine fire and sword lives the viking raud the strong all the godoe isles belong to him and his heathen horde thus went on speaking sigurd the bishop a warlock a wizard is he and lord of the wind and the sea and whichever way he sails he has ever favoring gales by his craft in sorcery here the sign of the cross made devoutly king olaf with rites that we both abhor he worships odin and thor so it cannot yet be said that all the old gods are dead and the warlocks are no more flushing with anger said sigurd the bishop then king olaf cried aloud i will talk with this mighty raud and along the salten fiord preach the gospel with my sword or be brought back in my shroud so northward from drontheim sailed king olaf xi bishop sigurd at salten fiord loud the anngy wind was wailing as king olafs ships came sailing northward out of drontheim haven to the mouth of salten fiord though the flying seaspray drenches fore and aft the rowers benches not a single heart is craven of the champions there on board all without the fiord was quiet but within it storm and riot such as on his viking cruises raud the strong was wont to ride and the sea through all its tideways swept the reeling vessels sideways as the leaves are swept through sluices when the floodgates open wide t is the warlock t is the demon raud cried sigurd to the seamen but the lord is not affrighted by the witchcraft of his foes to the ships bow he ascended by his choristers attended round him were the tapers lighted and the sacred incense rose on the bow stood bishop sigurd in his robes as one transfigured and the crucifix he planted high amid the rain and mist then with holy water sprinkled all the ship the massbells tinkled loud the monks around him chanted loud he read the evangelist as into the fiord they darted on each side the water parted down a path like silver molten steadily rowed king olafs ships steadily burned all night the tapers and the white christ through the vapors gleamed across the fiord of salten as through johns apocalypse till at last they reached rauds dwelling on the little isle of gelling not a guard was at the doorway not a glimmer of light was seen but at anchor carved and gilded lay the dragonship he builded t was the grandest ship in norway with its crest and scales of green up the stairway softly creeping to the loft where raud was sleeping with their fists they burst asunder bolt and bar that held the door drunken with sleep and ale they found him dragged him from his bed and bound him while he stared with stupid wonder at the look and garb they wore then king olaf said o seaking little time have we for speaking choose between the good and evil be baptized or thou shalt die but in scorn the heathen scoffer answered i disdain thine offer neither fear i god nor devil thee and thy gospel i defy then between his jaws distended when his frantic struggles ended through king olafs horn an adder touched by fire they forced to glide sharp his tooth was as an arrow as he gnawed through bone and marrow but without a groan or shudder raud the strong blaspheming died then baptized they all that region swarthy lap and fair norwegian far as swims the salmon leaping up the streams of salten fiord in their temples thor and odin lay in dust and ashes trodden as king olaf onward sweeping preached the gospel with his sword then he took the carved and gilded dragonship that raud had builded and the tiller singlehanded grasping steered into the main southward sailed the seagulls oer him southward sailed the ship that bore him till at drontheim haven landed olaf and his crew again xii king olafs christmas at drontheim olaf the king heard the bells of yuletide ring as he sat in his banquethall drinking the nutbrown ale with his bearded berserks hale and tall three days his yuletide feasts he held with bishops and priests and his horn filled up to the brim but the ale was never too strong nor the sagamans tale too long for him oer his drinkinghorn the sign he made of the cross divine as he drank and muttered his prayers but the berserks evermore made the sign of the hammer of thor over theirs the gleams of the firelight dance upon helmet and hauberk and lance and laugh in the eyes of the king and he cries to halfred the scald graybearded wrinkled and bald sing sing me a song divine with a sword in every line and this shall be thy reward and he loosened the belt at his waist and in front of the singer placed his sword quernbiter of hakon the good wherewith at a stroke he hewed the millstone through and through and footbreadth of thoralf the strong were neither so broad nor so long nor so true then the scald took his harp and sang and loud though the music rang the sound of that shining word and the harpstrings a clangor made as if they were struck with the blade of a sword and the berserks round about broke forth into a shout that made the rafters ring they smote with their fists on the board and shouted long live the sword and the king but the king said o my son i miss the bright word in one of thy measures and thy rhymes and halfred the scald replied in another t was multiplied three times then king olaf raised the hilt of iron crossshaped and gilt and said do not refuse count well the gain and the loss thors hammer or christs cross choose and halfred the scald said this in the name of the lord i kiss who on it was crucified and a shout went round the board in the name of christ the lord who died then over the waste of snows the noonday sun uprose through the driving mists revealed like the lifting of the host by incenseclouds almost concealed on the shining wall a vast and shadowy cross was cast from the hilt of the lifted sword and in foaming cups of ale the berserks drank washael to the lord xiii the building of the long serpent thorberg skafting masterbuilder in his shipyard by the sea whistling said it would bewilder any man but thorberg skafting any man but me near him lay the dragon stranded built of old by raud the strong and king olaf had commanded he should build another dragon twice as large and long therefore whistled thorberg skafting as he sat with halfclosed eyes and his head turned sideways drafting that new vessel for king olaf twice the dragons size round him busily hewed and hammered mallet huge and heavy axe workmen laughed and sang and clamored whirred the wheels that into rigging spun the shining flax all this tumult heard the master it was music to his ear fancy whispered all the faster men shall hear of thorberg skafting for a hundred year workmen sweating at the forges fashioned iron bolt and bar like a warlocks midnight orgies smoked and bubbled the black caldron with the boiling tar did the warlocks mingle in it thorberg skafting any curse could you not be gone a minute but some mischief must be doing turning bad to worse t was an ill wind that came wafting from his homestead words of woe to his farm went thorberg skafting oft repeating to his workmen build ye thus and so after long delays returning came the master back by night to his shipyard longing yearning hurried he and did not leave it till the mornings light come and see my ship my darling on the morrow said the king finished now from keel to carling never yet was seen in norway such a wondrous thing in the shipyard idly talking at the ship the workmen stared some one all their labor balking down her sides had cut deep gashes not a plank was spared death be to the evildoer with an oath king olaf spoke but rewards to his pursuer and with wrath his face grew redder than his scarlet cloak straight the masterbuilder smiling answered thus the angry king cease blaspheming and reviling olaf it was thorberg skafting who has done this thing then he chipped and smoothed the planking till the king delighted swore with much lauding and much thanking handsomer is now my dragon than she was before seventy ells and four extended on the grass the vessels keel high above it gilt and splendid rose the figurehead ferocious with its crest of steel then they launched her from the tressels in the shipyard by the sea she was the grandest of all vessels never ship was built in norway half so fine as she the long serpent was she christened mid the roar of cheer on cheer they who to the saga listened heard the name of thorberg skafting for a hundred year xiv the crew of the long serpent safe at anchor in drontheim bay king olafs fleet assembled lay and striped with white and blue downward fluttered sail and banner as alights the screaming lanner lustily cheered in their wild manner the long serpents crew her forecastle man was ulf the red like a wolfs was his shaggy head his teeth as large and white his beard of gray and russet blended round as a swallows nest descended as standardbearer he defended olafs flag in the fight near him kolbiorn had his place like the king in garb and face so gallant and so hale every cabinboy and varlet wondered at his cloak of scarlet like a river frozen and starlit gleamed his coat of mail by the bulkhead tall and dark stood thrand rame of thelemark a figure gaunt and grand on his hairy arm imprinted was an anchor azuretinted like thors hammer huge and dinted was his brawny hand einar tamberskelver bare to the winds his golden hair by the mainmast stood graceful was his form and slender and his eyes were deep and tender as a womans in the splendor of her maidenhood in the forehold biorn and bork watched the sailors at their work heavens how they swore thirty men they each commanded ironsinewed hornyhanded shoulders broad and chests expanded tugging at the oar these and many more like these with king olaf sailed the seas till the waters vast filled them with a vague devotion with the freedom and the motion with the roll and roar of ocean and the sounding blast when they landed from the fleet how they roared through drontheims street boisterous as the gale how they laughed and stamped and pounded till the tavern roof resounded and the host looked on astounded as they drank the ale never saw the wild north sea such a gallant company sail its billows blue never while they cruised and quarrelled old king gorm or bluetooth harald owned a ship so well apparelled boasted such a crew xv a little bird in the air a little bird in the air is singing of thyri the fair the sister of svend the dane and the song of the garrulous bird in the streets of the town is heard and repeated again and again hoist up your sails of silk and flee away from each other to king burislaf it is said was the beautiful thyri wed and a sorrowful bride went she and after a week and a day she has fled away and away from his town by the stormy sea hoist up your sails

to king olafs court and the town is all in dismay hoist up your sails of silk and flee away from each other it is whispered king olaf has seen has talked with the beautiful queen and they wonder how it will end for surely if here she remain it is war with king svend the dane and king burislaf the vend hoist up your sails of silk and flee away from each other o greatest wonder of all it is published in hamlet and hall it roars like a flame that is fanned the king yes olaf the king has wedded her with his ring and thyri is queen in the land hoist up your sails of silk and flee away from each other xvi queen thyri and the angelica stalks northward over drontheim flew the clamorous seagulls sang the lark and linnet from the meadows green weeping in her chamber lonely and unhappy sat the drottning thyri sat king olafs queen in at all the windows streamed the pleasant sunshine on the roof above her softly cooed the dove but the sound she heard not nor the sunshine heeded for the thoughts of thyri were not thoughts of love then king olaf entered beautiful as morning like the sun at easter shone his happy face in his hand he carried angelicas uprooted with delicious fragrance filling all the place like a rainy midnight sat the drottning thyri even the smile of olaf could not cheer her gloom nor the stalks he gave her with a gracious gesture and with words as pleasant as their own perfume in her hands he placed them and her jewelled fingers through the green leaves glistened like the dews of morn but she cast them from her haughty and indignant on the floor she threw them with a look of scorn richer presents said she gave king harald gormson to the queen my mother than such worthless weeds when he ravaged norway laying waste the kingdom seizing scatt and treasure for her royal needs but thou darest not venture through the sound to vendland my domains to rescue from king burislaf lest king svend of denmark forked beard my brother scatter all thy vessels as the wind the chaff then up sprang king olaf like a reindeer bounding with an oath he answered thus the luckless queen never yet did olaf fear king svend of denmark this right hand shall hale him by his forked chin then he left the chamber thundering through the doorway loud his steps resounded down the outer stair smarting with the insult through the streets of drontheim strode he red and wrathful with his stately air all his ships he gathered summoned all his forces making his war levy in the region round down the coast of norway like a flock of seagulls sailed the fleet of olaf through the danish sound with his own hand fearless steered he the long serpent strained the creaking cordage bent each boom and gaff till in venland landing the domains of thyri he redeemed and rescued from king burislaf then said olaf laughing not ten yoke of oxen have the power to draw us like a womans hair now will i confess it better things are jewels than angelica stalks are for a queen to wear xvii king svend of the forked bear loudly the sailors cheered svend of the forked beard as with his fleet he steered southward to vendland where with their courses hauled all were together called under the isle of svald near to the mainland after queen gunhilds death so the old saga saith plighted king svend his faith to sigrid the haughty and to avenge his bride soothing her wounded pride over the waters wide king olaf sought he still on her scornful face blushing with deep disgrace bore she the crimson trace of olafs gauntlet like a malignant star blazing in heaven afar red shone the angry scar under her frontlet oft to king svend she spake for thine own honors sake shalt thou swift vengeance take on the vile coward until the king at last gusty and overcast like a tempestuous blast threatened and lowered soon as the spring appeared svend of the forked beard high his red standard reared eager for battle while every warlike dane seizing his arms again left all unsown the grain unhoused the cattle likewise the swedish king summoned in haste a thing weapons and men to bring in aid of denmark erie the norseman too as the wartidings flew sailed with a chosen crew from lapland and finmark so upon easter day sailed the three kings away out of the sheltered bay in the bright season with them earl sigvald came eager for spoil and fame pity that such a name stooped to such treason safe under svald at last now were their anchors cast safe from the sea and blast plotted the three kings while with a base intent southward earl sigvald went on a foul errand bent unto the seakings thence to hold on his course unto king olafs force lying within the hoarse mouths of stethaven him to ensnare and bring unto the danish king who his dead corse would fling forth to the raven xviii king olaf and earl sigvald on the gray seasands king olaf stands northward and seaward he points with his hands with eddy and whirl the seatides curl washing the sandals of sigvald the earl the mariners shout the ships swing about the yards are all hoisted the sails flutter out the warhorns are played the anchors are weighed like moths in the distance the sails flit and fade the sea is like lead the harbor lies dead as a corse on the seashore whose spirit has fled on that fatal day the histories say seventy vessels sailed out of the bay but soon scattered wide oer the billows they ride while sigvald and olaf sail side by side cried the earl follow me i your pilot will be for i know all the channels where flows the deep sea so into the strait where his foes lie in wait gallant king olaf sails to his fate then the seafog veils the ships and their sails queen sigrid the haughty thy vengeance prevails xix king olafs warhorns strike the sails king olaf said never shall men of mine take flight never away from battle i fled never away from my foes let god dispose of my life in the fight sound the horns said olaf the king and suddenly through the drifting brume the blare of the horns began to ring like the terrible trumpet shock of regnarock on the day of doom louder and louder the warhorns sang over the level floor of the flood all the sails came down with a clang and there in the mist overhead the sun hung red as a drop of blood drifting down on the danish fleet three together the ships were lashed so that neither should turn and retreat in the midst but in front of the rest the burnished crest of the serpent flashed king olaf stood on the quarterdeck with bow of ash and arrows of oak his gilded shield was without a fleck his helmet inlaid with gold and in many a fold hung his crimson cloak on the forecastle ulf the red watched the lashing of the ships if the serpent lie so far ahead we shall have hard work of it here said he with a sneer on his bearded lips king olaf laid an arrow on string have i a coward on board said he shoot it another way o king sullenly answered ulf the old seawolf you have need of me in front came svend the king of the danes sweeping down with his fifty rowers to the right the swedish king with his thanes and on board of the iron beard earl eric steered to the left with his oars these soft danes and swedes said the king at home with their wives had better stay than come within reach of my serpents sting but where eric the norseman leads heroic deeds will be done today then as together the vessels crashed eric severed the cables of hide with which king olafs ships were lashed and left them to drive and drift with the currents swift of the outward tide louder the warhorns growl and snarl sharper the dragons bite and sting eric the son of hakon jarl a deathdrink salt as the sea pledges to thee olaf the king xx einar tamberskelver it was einar tamberskelver stood beside the mast from his yewbow tipped with silver flew the arrows fast aimed at eric unavailing as he sat concealed half behind the quarterrailing half behind his shield first an arrow struck the tiller just above his head sing o eyvind skaldaspiller then earl eric said sing the song of hakon dying sing his funeral wail and another arrow flying grazed his coat of mail turning to a lapland yeoman as the arrow passed said earl eric shoot that bowman standing by the mast sooner than the word was spoken flew the yeomans shaft einars bow in twain was broken einar only laughed what was that said olaf standing on the quarterdeck something heard i like the stranding of a shattered wreck einar then the arrow taking from the loosened string answered that was norway breaking from thy hand o king thou art but a poor diviner straightway olaf said take my bow and swifter einar let thy shafts be sped of his bows the fairest choosing reached he from above einar saw the blooddrops oozing through his iron glove but the bow was thin and narrow at the first assay oer its head he drew the arrow flung the bow away said with hot and angry temper flushing in his cheek olaf for so great a kamper are thy bows too weak then with smile of joy defiant on his beardless lip scaled he light and selfreliant erics dragonship loose his golden locks were flowing bright his armor gleamed like saint michael overthrowing lucifer he seemed xxi king olafs deathdrink all day has the battle raged all day have the ships engaged but not yet is assuaged the vengeance of eric the earl the decks with blood are red the arrows of death are sped the ships are filled with the dead and the spears the champions hurl they drift as wrecks on the tide the grapplingirons are plied the boarders climb up the side the shouts are feeble and few ah never shall norway again see her sailors come back oer the main they all lie wounded or slain or asleep in the billows blue on the deck stands olaf the king around him whistle and sing the spears that the foemen fling and the stones they hurl with their hands in the midst of the stones and the spears kolbiorn the marshal appears his shield in the air he uprears by the side of king olaf he stands over the slippery wreck of the long serpents deck sweeps eric with hardly a check his lips with anger are pale he hews with his axe at the mast till it falls with the sails overcast like a snowcovered pine in the vast dim forests of orkadale seeking king olaf then he rushes aft with his men as a hunter into the den of the bear when he stands at bay remember jarl hakon he cries when lo on his wondering eyes two kingly figures arise two olafs in warlike array then kolbiorn speaks in the ear of king olaf a word of cheer in a whisper that none may hear with a smile on his tremulous lip two shields raised high in the air two flashes of golden hair two scarlet meteors glare and both have leaped from the ship earl erics men in the boats seize kolbiorns shield as it floats and cry from their hairy throats see it is olaf the king while far on the opposite side floats another shield on the tide like a jewel set in the wide seacurrents eddying ring there is told a wonderful tale how the king stripped off his mail like leaves of the brown seakale as he swam beneath the main but the young grew old and gray and never by night or by day in his kingdom of norroway was king olaf seen again xxii the nun of nidaros in the convent of drontheim alone in her chamber knelt astrid the abbess at midnight adoring beseeching entreating the virgin and mother she heard in the silence the voice of one speaking without in the darkness in gusts of the nightwind now louder now nearer now lost in the distance the voice of a stranger it seemed as she listened of some one who answered beseeching imploring a cry from afar off she could not distinguish the voice of saint john the beloved disciple who wandered and waited the masters appearance alone in the darkness unsheltered and friendless it is accepted the angry defiance the challenge of battle it is accepted but not with the weapons of war that thou wieldest cross against corselet love against hatred peacecry for warcry patience is powerful he that oercometh hath power oer the nations as torrents in summer half dried in their channels suddenly rise though the sky is still cloudless for rain has been falling far off at their fountains so hearts that are fainting grow full to oertlowing and they that behold it marvel and know not that god at their fountains far off has been raining stronger than steel is the sword of the spirit swifter than arrows the light of the truth is greater than anger is love and subdueth thou art a phantom a shape of the seamist a shape of the brumal rain and the darkness fearful and formless day dawns and thou art not the dawn is not distant nor is the night starless love is eternal god is still god and his faith shall not fail us christ is eternal interlude a strain of music closed the tale a low monotonous funeral wail that with its cadence wild and sweet made the long saga more complete thank god the theologian said the reign of violence is dead or dying surely from the world while love triumphant reigns instead and in a brighter sky oerhead his blessed banners are unfurled and most of all thank god for this the war and waste of clashing creeds now end in words and not in deeds and no one suffers loss or bleeds for thoughts that men call heresies i stand without here in the porch i hear the bells melodious din i hear the organ peal within i hear the prayer with words that scorch like sparks from an inverted torch i hear the sermon upon sin with threatenings of the last account and all translated in the air reach me but as our dear lords prayer and as the sermon on the mount must it be calvin and not christ must it be athanasian creeds or holy water books and beads must struggling souls remain content with councils and decrees of trend and can it be enough for these the christian church the year embalms with evergreens and boughs of palms and fills the air with litanies i know that yonder pharisee thanks god that he is not like me in my humiliation dressed i only stand and beat my breast and pray for human charity not to one church alone but seven the voice prophetic spake from heaven and unto each the promise came diversified but still the same for him that overcometh are the new name written on the stone the raiment white the crown the throne and i will give him the morning star ah to how many faith has been no evidence of things unseen but a dim shadow that recasts the creed of the phantasiasts for whom no man of sorrows died for whom the tragedy divine was but a symbol and a sign and christ a phantom crucified for others a diviner creed is living in the life they lead the passing of their beautiful feet blesses the pavement of the street and all their looks and words repeat old fullers saying wise and sweet not as a vulture but a dove the holy ghost came from above and this brings back to me a tale so sad the hearer well may quail and question if such things can be yet in the chronicles of spain down the dark pages runs this stain and naught can wash them white again so fearful is the tragedy the theologians tale torquemada in the heroic days when ferdinand and isabella ruled the spanish land and torquemada with his subtle brain ruled them as grand inquisitor of spain in a great castle near valladolid moated and high and by fair woodlands hid there dwelt as from the chronicles we learn an old hidalgo proud and taciturn whose name has perished with his towers of stone and all his actions save this one alone this one so terrible perhaps t were best if it too were forgotten with the rest unless perchance our eyes can see therein the martyrdom triumphant oer the sin a double picture with its gloom and glow the splendor overhead the death below this sombre man counted each day as lost on which his feet no sacred threshold crossed and when he chanced the passing host to meet he knelt and prayed devoutly in the street oft he confessed and with each mutinous thought as with wild beasts at ephesus he fought in deep contrition scourged himself in lent walked in processions with his head down bent at plays of corpus christi oft was seen and on palm sunday bore his bough of green his sole diversion was to hunt the boar through tangled thickets of the forest hoar or with his jingling mules to hurry down to some grand bullfight in the neighboring town or in the crowd with lighted taper stand when jews were burned or banished from the land then stirred within him a tumultuous joy the demon whose delight is to destroy shook him and shouted with a trumpet tone kill kill and let the lord find out his own and now in that old castle in the wood his daughters in the dawn of womanhood returning from their convent school had made resplendent with their bloom the forest shade reminding him of their dead mothers face when first she came into that gloomy place a memory in his heart as dim and sweet as moonlight in a solitary street where the same rays that lift the sea are thrown lovely but powerless upon walls of stone these two fair daughters of a mother dead were all the dream had left him as it fled a joy at first and then a growing care as if a voice within him cried beware a vague presentiment of impending doom like ghostly footsteps in a vacant room haunted him day and night a formless fear that death to some one of his house was near with dark surmises of a hidden crime made life itself a death before its time jealous suspicious with no sense of shame a spy upon his daughters he became with velvet slippers noiseless on the floors he glided softly through halfopen doors now in the room and now upon the stair he stood beside them ere they were aware he listened in the passage when they talked he watched them from the casement when they walked he saw the gypsy haunt the rivers side he saw the monk among the corktrees glide and tortured by the mystery and the doubt of some dark secret past his finding out baffled he paused then reassured again pursued the flying phantom of his brain he watched them even when they knelt in church and then descending lower in his search questioned the servants and with eager eyes listened incredulous to their replies the gypsy none had seen her in the wood the monk a mendicant in search of food at length the awful revelation came crushing at once his pride of birth and name the hopes his yearning bosom forward cast and the ancestral glories of the vast all fell together crumbling in disgrace a turret rent from battlement to base his daughters talking in the dead of night in their own chamber and without a light listening as he was wont he overheard and learned the dreadful secret word by word and hurrying from his castle with a cry he raised his hands to the unpitying sky repeating one dread word till bush and tree caught it and shuddering answered heresy wrapped in his cloak his hat drawn oer his face now hurrying forward now with lingering pace he walked all night the alleys of his park with one unseen companion in the dark the demon who within him lay in wait and by his presence turned his love to hate forever muttering in an undertone kill kill and let the lord find out his own upon the morrow after early mass while yet the dew was glistening on the grass and all the woods were musical with birds the old hidalgo uttering fearful words walked homeward with the priest and in his room summoned his trembling daughters to their doom when questioned with brief answers they replied nor when accused evaded or denied expostulations passionate appeals all that the human heart most fears or feels in vain the priest with earnest voice essayed in vain the father threatened wept and prayed until at last he said with haughty mien the holy office then must intervene and now the grand inquisitor of spain with all the fifty horsemen of his train his awful name resounding like the blast of funeral trumpets as he onward passed came to valladolid and there began to harry the rich jews with fire and ban to him the hidalgo went and at the gate demanded audience on affairs of state and in a secret chamber stood before a venerable graybeard of fourscore dressed in the hood and habit of a friar out of his eyes flashed a consuming fire and in his hand the mystic horn he held which poison and all noxious charms dispelled he heard in silence the hidalgos tale then answered in a voice that made him quail son of the church when abraham of old to sacrifice his only son was told he did not pause to parley nor protest but hastened to obey the lords behest in him it was accounted righteousness the holy church expects of thee no less a sacred frenzy seized the fathers brain and mercy from that hour implored in vain ah who will eer believe the words i say his daughters he accused and the same day they both were cast into the dungeons gloom that dismal antechamber of the tomb arraigned condemned and sentenced to the flame the secret torture and the public shame then to the grand inquisitor once more the hidalgo went more eager than before and said when abraham offered up his son he clave the wood wherewith it might be done by his example taught let me too bring wood from the forest for my offering and the deep voice without a pause replied son of the church by faith now justified complete thy sacrifice even as thou wilt the church absolves thy conscience from all guilt then this most wretched father went his way into the woods that round his castle lay where once his daughters in their childhood played with their young mother in the sun and shade now all the leaves had fallen the branches bare made a perpetual moaning in the air and screaming from their eyries overhead the ravens sailed athwart the sky of lead with his own hands he lopped the boughs and bound fagots that crackled with foreboding sound and on his mules caparisoned and gay with bells and tassels sent them on their way then with his mind on one dark purpose bent again to the inquisitor he went and said behold the fagots i have brought and now lest my atonement be as naught grant me one more request one last desire with my own hand to light the funeral fire and torquemada answered from his seat son of the church thine offering is complete her servants through all ages shall not cease to magnify thy deed depart in peace upon the marketplace builded of stone the scaffold rose whereon death claimed his own at the four corners in stern attitude four statues of the hebrew prophets stood gazing with calm indifference in their eyes upon this place of human sacrifice round which was gathering fast the eager crowd with clamor of voices dissonant and loud and every roof and window was alive with restless gazers swarming like a hive the churchbells tolled the chant of monks drew near loud trumpets stammered forth their notes of fear a line of torches smoked along the street there was a stir a rush a tramp of feet and with its banners floating in the air slowly the long procession crossed the square and to the statues of the prophets bound the victims stood with fagots piled around then all the air a blast of trumpets shook and louder sang the monks with bell and book and the hidalgo lofty stern and proud lifted his torch and bursting through the crowd lighted in haste the fagots and then fled lest those imploring eyes should strike him dead o pitiless skies why did your clouds retain for peasants fields their floods of hoarded rain o pitiless earth why open no abyss to bury in its chasm a crime like this that night a mingled column of fire and smoke prom the dark thickets of the forest broke and glaring oer the landscape leagues away made all the fields and hamlets bright as day wrapped in a sheet of flame the castle blazed and as the villagers in terror gazed they saw the figure of that cruel knight lean from a window in the turrets height his ghastly face illumined with the glare his hands upraised above his head in prayer till the floor sank beneath him and he fell down the black hollow of that burning well three centuries and more above his bones have piled the oblivious years like funeral stones his name has perished with him and no trace remains on earth of his afflicted race but torquemadas name with clouds oercast looms in the distant landscape of the past like a burnt tower upon a blackened heath lit by the fires of burning woods beneath interlude thus closed the tale of guilt and gloom that cast upon each listeners face its shadow and for some brief space unbroken silence filled the room the jew was thoughtful and distressed upon his memory thronged and pressed the persecution of his race their wrongs and sufferings and disgrace his head was sunk upon his breast and from his eyes alternate came flashes of wrath and tears of shame the student first the silence broke as one who long has lain in wait with purpose to retaliate and thus he dealt the avenging stroke in such a company as this a tale so tragic seems amiss that by its terrible control oermasters and drags down the soul into a fathomless abyss the italian tales that you disdain some merry night of straparole or machiavellis belphagor would cheer us and delight us more give greater pleasure and less pain than your grim tragedies of spain and here the poet raised his hand with such entreaty and command it stopped discussion at its birth and said the story i shall tell has meaning in it if not mirth listen and hear what once befell the merry birds of killingworth the poets tale the birds of killingworth it was the season when through all the land the merle and mavis build and building sing those lovely lyrics written by his hand whom saxon caedmon calls the blitheheart king when on the boughs the purple buds expand the banners of the vanguard of the spring and rivulets rejoicing rush and leap and wave their fluttering signals from the steep the robin and the bluebird piping loud filled all the blossoming orchards with their glee the sparrows chirped as if they still were proud their race in holy writ should mentioned be and hungry crows assembled in a crowd clamored their piteous prayer incessantly knowing who hears the ravens cry and said give us o lord this day our daily bread across the sound the birds of passage sailed speaking some unknown language strange and sweet of tropic isle remote and passing hailed the village with the cheers of all their fleet or quarrelling together laughed and railed like foreign sailors landed in the street of seaport town and with outlandish noise of oaths and gibberish frightening girls and boys thus came the jocund spring in killingworth in fabulous day some hundred years ago and thrifty farmers as they tilled the earth heard with alarm the cawing of the crow that mingled with the universal mirth cassandralike prognosticating woe they shook their heads and doomed with dreadful words to swift destruction the whole race of birds and a townmeeting was convened straightway to set a price upon the guilty heads of these marauders who in lieu of pay levied blackmail upon the garden beds and cornfields and beheld without dismay the awful scarecrow with his fluttering shreds the skeleton that waited at their feast whereby their sinful pleasure was increased then from his house a temple painted white with fluted columns and a roof of red the squire came forth august and splendid sight slowly descending with majestic tread three flights of steps nor looking left nor right down the long street he walked as one who said a town that boasts inhabitants like me can have no lack of good society the parson too appeared a man austere the instinct of whose nature was to kill the wrath of god he preached from year to year and read with fervor edwards on the will his favorite pastime was to slay the deer in summer on some adirondac hill een now while walking down the rural lane he lopped the wayside lilies with his cane from the academy whose belfry crowned the hill of science with its vane of brass came the preceptor gazing idly round now at the clouds and now at the green grass and all absorbed in reveries profound of fair almira in the upper class who was as in a sonnet he had said as pure as water and as good as bread and next the deacon issued from his door in his voluminous neckcloth white as snow a suit of sable bombazine he wore his form was ponderous and his step was slow there never was so wise a man before he seemed the incarnate well i told you so and to perpetuate his great renown there was a street named after him in town these came together in the new townhall with sundry farmers from the region round the squirt presided dignified and tall his air impressive and his reasoning sound ill fared it with the birds both great and small hardly a friend in all that crowd they found but enemies enough who every one charged them with all the crimes beneath the sun when they had ended from his place apart rose the preceptor to redress the wrong and trembling like a steed before the start looked round bewildered on the expectant throng then thought of fair almira and took heart to speak out what was in him clear and strong alike regardless of their smile or frown and quite determined not to be laughed down plato anticipating the reviewers from his republic banished without pity the poets in this little town of yours you put to death by means of a committee the balladsingers and the troubadours the streetmusicians of the heavenly city the birds who make sweet music for us all in our dark hours as david did for saul the thrush that carols at the dawn of day from the green steeples of the piny wood the oriole in the elm the noisy jay jargoning like a foreigner at his food the bluebird balanced on some topmost spray flooding with melody the neighborhood linnet and meadowlark and all the throng that dwell in nests and have the gift of song you slay them all and wherefore for the gain of a scant handful more or less of wheat or rye or barley or some other grain scratched up at random by industrious feet searching for worm or weevil after rain or a few cherries that are not so sweet as are the songs these uninvited guests sing at their feast with comfortable breasts do you neer think what wondrous beings these do you neer think who made them and who taught the dialect they speak where melodies alone are the interpreters of thought whose household words are songs in many keys sweeter than instrument of man eer caught whose habitations in the treetops even are halfway houses on the road to heaven think every morning when the sun peeps through the dim leaflatticed windows of the grove how jubilant the happy birds renew their old melodious madrigals of love and when you think of this remember too t is always morning somewhere and above the awakening continent from shore to shore somewhere the birds are singing evermore think of your woods and orchards without birds of empty nests that cling to boughs and beams as in an idiots brain remembered words hang empty mid the cobwebs of his dreams will bleat of flocks or bellowing of herds make up for the lost music when your teams drag home the stingy harvest and no more the feathered gleaners follow to your door what would you rather see the incessant stir of insects in the windrows of the hay and hear the locust and the grasshopper their melancholy hurdygurdies play is this more pleasant to you than the whir of meadowlark and her sweet roundelay or twitter of little fieldfares as you take your nooning in the shade of bush and brake you call them thieves and pillagers but know they are the winged wardens of your farms who from the cornfields drive the insidious foe and from your harvests keep a hundred harms even the blackest of them all the crow renders good service as your manatarms crushing the beetle in his coat of mail and crying havoc on the slug and snail how can i teach your children gentleness and mercy to the weak and reverence for life which in its weakness or excess is still a gleam of gods omnipotence or death which seeming darkness is no less the selfsame light although averted hence when by your laws your actions and your speech you contradict the very things i teach with this he closed and through the audience went a murmur like the rustle of dead leaves the farmers laughed and nodded and some bent their yellow heads together like their sheaves men have no faith in finespun sentiment who put their trust in bullocks and in beeves the birds were doomed and as the record shows a bounty offered for the heads of crows there was another audience out of reach who had no voice nor vote in making laws but in the papers read his little speech and crowned his modest temples with applause they made him conscious each one more than each he still was victor vanquished in their cause sweetest of all the applause he won from thee o fair almira at the academy and so the dreadful massacre began oer fields and orchards and oer woodland crests the ceaseless fusillade of terror ran dead fell the birds with bloodstains on their breasts or wounded crept away from sight of man while the young died of famine in their nests a slaughter to be told in groans not words the very st bartholomew of birds the summer came and all the birds were dead the days were like hot coals the very ground was burned to ashes in the orchards fed myriads of caterpillars and around the cultivated fields and garden beds hosts of devouring insects crawled and found no foe to check their march till they had made the land a desert without leaf or shade devoured by worms like herod was the town because like herod it had ruthlessly slaughtered the innocents from the trees spun down the cankerworms upon the passersby upon each womans bonnet shawl and gown who shook them off with just a little cry they were the terror of each favorite walk the endless theme of all the village talk the farmers grew impatient but a few confessed their error and would not complain for after all the best thing one can do when it is raining is to let it rain then they repealed the law although they knew it would not call the dead to life again as schoolboys finding their mistake too late draw a wet sponge across the accusing slate that year in killingworth the autumn came without the light of his majestic look the wonder of the falling tongues of flame the illumined pages of his doomsday book a few lost leaves blushed crimson with their shame and drowned themselves despairing in the brook while the wild wind went moaning everywhere lamenting the dead children of the air but the next spring a stranger sight was seen a sight that never yet by bard was sung as great a wonder as it would have been if some dumb animal had found a tongue a wagon overarched with evergreen upon whose boughs were wicker cages hung all full of singing birds came down the street filling the air with music wild and sweet from all the country round these birds were brought by order of the town with anxious quest and loosened from their wicker prisons sought in woods and fields the places they loved best singing loud canticles which many thought were satires to the authorities addressed while others listening in green lanes averred such lovely music never had been heard but blither still and louder carolled they upon the morrow for they seemed to know it was the fair almiras weddingday and everywhere around above below when the preceptor bore his bride away their songs burst forth in joyous overflow and a new heaven bent over a new earth amid the sunny farms of killingworth finale the hour was late the fire burned low the landlords eyes were closed in sleep and near the storys end a deep sonorous sound at times was heard as when the distant bagpipes blow at this all laughed the landlord stirred as one awaking from a swound and gazing anxiously around protested that he had not slept but only shut his eyes and kept his ears attentive to each word then all arose and said good night alone remained the drowsy squire to rake the embers of the fire and quench the waning parlor light while from the windows here and there the scattered lamps a moment gleamed and the illumined hostel seemed the constellation of the bear downward athwart the misty air sinking and setting toward the sun far off the village clock struck one part second prelude a cold uninterrupted rain that washed each southern windowpane and made a river of the road a sea of mist that overflowed the house the barns the gilded vane and drowned the upland and the plain through which the oaktrees broad and high like phantom ships went drifting by and hidden behind a watery screen the sun unseen or only seen as a faint pallor in the sky thus cold and colorless and gray the morn of that autumnal day as if reluctant to begin dawned on the silent sudbury inn and all the guests that in it lay full late they slept they did not hear the challenge of sir chanticleer who on the empty threshingfloor disdainful of the rain outside was strutting with a martial stride as if upon his thigh he wore the famous broadsword of the squire and said behold me and admire only the poet seemed to hear in drowse or dream more near and near across the borderland of sleep the blowing of a blithesome horn that laughed the dismal day to scorn a splash of hoofs and rush of wheels through sand and mire like stranding keels as from the road with sudden sweep the mail drove up the little steep and stopped beside the tavern door a moment stopped and then again with crack of whip and bark of dog plunged forward through the sea of fog and all was silent as before all silent save the dripping rain then one by one the guests came down and greeted with a smile the squire who sat before the parlor fire reading the paper fresh from town first the sicilian like a bird before his form appeared was heard whistling and singing down the stair then came the student with a look as placid as a meadowbrook the theologian still perplexed with thoughts of this world and the next the poet then as one who seems walking in visions and in dreams then the musician like a fair hyperion from whose golden hair the radiance of the morning streams and last the aromatic jew of alicant who as he threw the door wide open on the air breathed round about him a perfume of damask roses in full bloom making a garden of the room the breakfast ended each pursued the promptings of his various mood beside the fire in silence smoked the taciturn impassive jew lost in a pleasant revery while by his gravity provoked his portrait the sicilian drew and wrote beneath it edrehi at the red horse in sudbury by far the busiest of them all the theologian in the hall was feeding robins in a cage two corpulent and lazy birds vagrants and pilferers at best if one might trust the hostlers words chief instrument of their arrest two poets of the golden age heirs of a boundless heritage of fields and orchards east and west and sunshine of long summer days though outlawed now and dispossessed such was the theologians phrase meanwhile the student held discourse with the musician on the source of all the legendary lore among the nations scattered wide like silt and seaweed by the force and fluctuation of the tide the tale repeated oer and oer with change of place and change of name disguised transformed and yet the same weve heard a hundred times before the poet at the window mused and saw as in a dream confused the countenance of the sun discrowned and haggard with a pale despair and saw the cloudrack trail and drift before it and the trees uplift their leafless branches and the air filled with the arrows of the rain and heard amid the mist below like voices of distress and pain that haunt the thoughts of men insane the fateful cawings of the crow then down the road with mud besprent and drenched with rain from head to hoof the raindrops dripping from his mane and tail as from a penthouse roof a jaded horse his head down bent passed slowly limping as he went the young sicilian who had grown impatient longer to abide a prisoner greatly mortified to see completely overthrown his plans for angling in the brook and leaning oer the bridge of stone to watch the speckled trout glide by and float through the inverted sky still round and round the baited hook now paced the room with rapid stride and pausing at the poets side looked forth and saw the wretched steed and said alas for human greed that with cold hand and stony eye thus turns an old friend out to die or beg his food from gate to gate this brings a tale into my mind which if you are not disinclined to listen i will now relate all gave assent all wished to hear not without many a jest and jeer the story of a spavined steed and even the student with the rest put in his pleasant little jest out of malherbe that pegasus is but a horse that with all speed bears poets to the hospital while the sicilian selfpossessed after a moments interval began his simple story thus the sicilians tale the bell of atri at atri in abruzzo a small town of ancient roman date but scant renown one of those little places that have run half up the hill beneath a blazing sun and then sat down to rest as if to say i climb no farther upward come what may the re giovanni now unknown to fame so many monarchs since have borne the name had a great bell hung in the marketplace beneath a roof projecting some small space by way of shelter from the sun and rain then rode he through the streets with all his train and with the blast of trumpets loud and long made proclamation that whenever wrong was done to any man he should but ring the great bell in the square and he the king would cause the syndic to decide thereon such was the proclamation of king john how swift the happy days in atri sped what wrongs were righted need not here be said suffice it that as all things must decay the hempen rope at length was worn away unravelled at the end and strand by strand loosened and wasted in the ringers hand till one who noted this in passing by mended the rope with braids of briony so that the leaves and tendrils of the vine hung like a votive garland at a shrine by chance it happened that in atri dwelt a knight with spur on heel and sword in belt who loved to hunt the wildboar in the woods who loved his falcons with their crimson hoods who loved his hounds and horses and all sports and prodigalities of camps and courts loved or had loved them for at last grown old his only passion was the love of gold he sold his horses sold his hawks and hounds rented his vineyards and his gardengrounds kept but one steed his favorite steed of all to starve and shiver in a naked stall and day by day sat brooding in his chair devising plans how best to hoard and spare at length he said what is the use or need to keep at my own cost this lazy steed eating his head off in my stables here when rents are low and provender is dear let him go feed upon the public ways i want him only for the holidays so the old steed was turned into the heat of the long lonely silent shadeless street and wandered in suburban lanes forlorn barked at by dogs and torn by brier and thorn one afternoon as in that sultry clime it is the custom in the summer time with bolted doors and windowshutters closed the inhabitants of atri slept or dozed when suddenly upon their senses fell the loud alarum of the accusing bell the syndic started from his deep repose turned on his couch and listened and then rose and donned his robes and with reluctant pace went panting forth into the marketplace where the great bell upon its crossbeam swung reiterating with persistent tongue in halfarticulate jargon the old song some one hath done a wrong hath done a wrong but ere he reached the belfrys light arcade he saw or thought he saw beneath its shade no shape of human form of woman born but a poor steed dejected and forlorn who with uplifted head and eager eye was tugging at the vines of briony domeneddio cried the syndie straight this is the knight of atris steed of state he calls for justice being sore distressed and pleads his cause as loudly as the best meanwhile from street and lane a noisy crowd had rolled together like a summer cloud and told the story of the wretched beast in fiveandtwenty different ways at least with much gesticulation and appeal to heathen gods in their excessive zeal the knight was called and questioned in reply did not confess the fact did not deny treated the matter as a pleasant jest and set at naught the syndic and the rest maintaining in an angry undertone that he should do what pleased him with his own and thereupon the syndic gravely read the proclamation of the king then said pride goeth forth on horseback grand and gay but cometh back on foot and begs its way fame is the fragrance of heroic deeds of flowers of chivalry and not of weeds these are familiar proverbs but i fear they never yet have reached your knightly ear what fair renown what honor what repute can come to you from starving this poor brute he who serves well and speaks not merits more than they who clamor loudest at the door therefore the law decrees that as this steed served you in youth henceforth you shall take heed to comfort his old age and to provide shelter in stall an food and field beside the knight withdrew abashed the people all led home the steed in triumph to his stall the king heard and approved and laughed in glee and cried aloud right well it pleaseth me churchbells at best but ring us to the door but go not in to mass my bell doth more it cometh into court and pleads the cause of creatures dumb and unknown to the laws and this shall make in every christian clime the bell of atri famous for all time interlude yes well your story pleads the cause of those dumb mouths that have no speech only a cry from each to each in its own kind with its own laws something that is beyond the reach of human power to learn or teach an inarticulate moan of pain like the immeasurable main breaking upon an unknown beach thus spake the poet with a sigh then added with impassioned cry as one who feels the words he speaks the color flushing in his cheeks the fervor burning in his eye among the noblest in the land though he may count himself the least that man i honor and revere who without favor without fear in the great city dares to stand the friend of every friendless beast and tames with his unflinching hand the brutes that wear our form and face the werewolves of the human race then paused and waited with a frown like some old champion of romance who having thrown his gauntlet down expectant leans upon his lance but neither knight nor squire is found to raise the gauntlet from the ground and try with him the battles chance wake from your dreams o edrehi or dreaming speak to us and make a feint of being half awake and tell us what your dreams may be out of the hazy atmosphere of cloudland deign to reappear among us in this wayside inn tell us what visions and what scenes illuminate the dark ravines in which you grope your way begin thus the sicilian spake the jew made no reply but only smiled as men unto a wayward child not knowing what to answer do as from a caverns mouth oergrown with moss and intertangled vines a streamlet leaps into the light and murmurs over root and stone in a melodious undertone or as amid the noonday night of sombre and windhaunted pines there runs a sound as of the sea so from his bearded lips there came a melody without a name a song a tale a history or whatsoever it may be writ and recorded in these lines the spanish jews tale kambalu into the city of kambalu by the road that leadeth to ispahan at the head of his dusty caravan laden with treasure from realms afar baldacca and kelat and kandahar rode the great captain alau the khan from his palacewindow gazed and saw in the thronging street beneath in the light of the setting sun that blazed through the clouds of dust by the caravan raised the flash of harness and jewelled sheath and the shining scymitars of the guard and the weary camels that bared their teeth as they passed and passed through the gates unbarred into the shade of the palaceyard thus into the city of kambalu rode the great captain alau and he stood before the khan and said the enemies of my lord are dead all the kalifs of all the west bow and obey thy least behest the plains are dark with the mulberrytrees the weavers are busy in samarcand the miners are sifting the golden sand the divers plunging for pearls in the seas and peace and plenty are in the land baldaccas kalif and he alone rose in revolt against thy throne his treasures are at thy palacedoor with the swords and the shawls and the jewels he wore his body is dust oer the desert blown a mile outside of baldaccas gate i left my forces to lie in wait concealed by forests and hillocks of sand and forward dashed with a handful of men to lure the old tiger from his den into the ambush i had planned ere we reached the town the alarm was spread for we heard the sound of gongs from within and with clash of cymbals and warlike din the gates swung wide and we turned and fled and the garrison sallied forth and pursued with the gray old kalif at their head and above them the banner of mohammed so we snared them all and the town was subdued as in at the gate we rode behold a tower that is called the tower of gold for there the kalif had hidden his wealth heaped and hoarded and piled on high like sacks of wheat in a granary and thither the miser crept by stealth to feel of the gold that gave him health and to gaze and gloat with his hungry eye on jewels that gleamed like a glowworms spark or the eyes of a panther in the dark i said to the kalif thou art old thou hast no need of so much gold thou shouldst not have heaped and hidden it here till the breath of battle was hot and near but have sown through the land these useless hoards to spring into shining blades of swords and keep thine honor sweet and clear these grains of gold are not grains of wheat these bars of silver thou canst not eat these jewels and pearls and precious stones cannot cure the aches in thy bones nor keep the feet of death one hour from climbing the stairways of thy tower then into his dungeon i locked the drone and left him to feed there all alone in the honeycells of his golden hive never a prayer nor a cry nor a groan was heard from those massive walls of stone nor again was the kalif seen alive when at last we unlocked the door we found him dead upon the floor the rings had dropped from his withered hands his teeth were like bones in the desert sands still clutching his treasure he had died and as he lay there he appeared a statue of gold with a silver beard his arms outstretched as if crucified this is the story strange and true that the great captain alau told to his brother the tartar khan when he rode that day into kambalu by the road that leadeth to ispahan interlude i thought before your tale began the student murmured we should have some legend written by judah rav in his gemara of babylon or something from the gulistan the tale of the cazy of hamadan or of that king of khorasan who saw in dreams the eyes of one that had a hundred years been dead still moving restless in his head undimmed and gleaming with the lust of power though all the rest was dust but lo your glittering caravan on the road that leadeth to ispahan hath led us farther to the east into the regions of cathay spite of your kalif and his gold pleasant has been the tale you told and full of color that at least no one will question or gainsay and yet on such a dismal day we need a merrier tale to clear the dark and heavy atmosphere so listen lordlings while i tell without a preface what befell a simple cobbler in the year no matter it was long ago and that is all we need to know the students tale the cobbler of hagenau i trust that somewhere and somehow you all have heard of hagenau a quiet quaint and ancient town among the green alsatian hills a place of valleys streams and mills where barbarossas castle brown with rust of centuries still looks down on the broad drowsy land below on shadowy forests filled with game and the blue river winding slow through meadows where the hedges grow that give this little town its name it happened in the good old times while yet the mastersingers filled the noisy workshop and the guild with various melodies and rhymes that here in hagenau there dwelt a cobbler one who loved debate and arguing from a postulate would say what others only felt a man of forecast and of thrift and of a shrewd and careful mind in this worlds business but inclined somewhat to let the next world drift hans sachs with vast delight he read and regenbogens rhymes of love for their poetic fame had spread even to the town of hagenau and some quick melody of the plough or double harmony of the dove was always running in his head he kept moreover at his side among his leathers and his tools reynard the fox the ship of fools or eulenspiegel open wide with these he was much edified he thought them wiser than the schools his good wife full of godly fear liked not these worldly themes to hear the psalter was her book of songs the only music to her ear was that which to the church belongs when the loud choir on sunday chanted and the two angels carved in wood that by the windy organ stood blew on their trumpets loud and clear and all the echoes far and near gibbered as if the church were haunted outside his door one afternoon this humble votary of the muse sat in the narrow strip of shade by a projecting cornice made mending the burgomasters shoes and singing a familiar tune our ingress into the world was naked and bare our progress through the world is trouble and care our egress from the world will be nobody knows where but if we do well here we shall do well there and i could tell you no more should i preach a whole year thus sang the cobbler at his work and with his gestures marked the time closing together with a jerk of his waxed thread the stitch and rhyme meanwhile his quiet little dame was leaning oer the windowsill eager excited but mousestill gazing impatiently to see what the great throng of folk might be that onward in procession came along the unfrequented street with horns that blew and drums that beat and banners flying and the flame of tapers and at times the sweet voices of nuns and as they sang suddenly all the churchbells rang in a gay coach above the crowd there sat a monk in ample hood who with his right hand held aloft a red and ponderous cross of wood to which at times he meekly bowed in front three horsemen rode and oft with voice and air importunate a boisterous herald cried aloud the grace of god is at your gate so onward to the church they passed the cobbler slowly tuned his last and wagging his sagacious head unto his kneeling housewife said tis the monk tetzel i have heard the cawings of that reverend bird dont let him cheat you of your gold indulgence is not bought and sold the church of hagenau that night was full of people full of light an odor of incense filled the air the priest intoned the organ groaned its inarticulate despair the candles on the altar blazed and full in front of it upraised the red cross stood against the glare below upon the altarrail indulgences were set to sale like ballads at a country fair a heavy strongbox ironbound and carved with many a quaint device received with a melodious sound the coin that purchased paradise then from the pulpit overhead tetzel the monk with fiery glow thundered upon the crowd below good people all draw near he said purchase these letters signed and sealed by which all sins though unrevealed and unrepented are forgiven count but the gain count not the loss your gold and silver are but dross and yet they pave the way to heaven i hear your mothers and your sires cry from their purgatorial fires and will ye not their ransom pay o senseless people when the gate of heaven is open will ye wait will ye not enter in today tomorrow it will be too late i shall be gone upon my way make haste bring money while ye may the women shuddered and turned pale allured by hope or driven by fear with many a sob and many a tear all crowded to the altarrail pieces of silver and of gold into the tinkling strongbox fell like pebbles dropped into a well and soon the ballads were all sold the cobblers wife among the rest slipped into the capacious chest a golden florin then withdrew hiding the paper in her breast and homeward through the darkness went comforted quieted content she did not walk she rather flew a dove that settles to her nest when some appalling bird of prey that scared her has been driven away the days went by the monk was gone the summer passed the winter came though seasons changed yet still the same the daily round of life went on the daily round of household care the narrow life of toil and prayer but in her heart the cobblers dame had now a treasure beyond price a secret joy without a name the certainty of paradise alas alas dust unto dust before the winter wore away her body in the churchyard lay her patient soul was with the just after her death among the things that even the poor preserve with care some little trinkets and cheap rings a locket with her mothers hair her wedding gown the faded flowers she wore upon her wedding day among these memories of past hours that so much of the heart reveal carefully kept and put away the letter of indulgence lay folded with signature and seal meanwhile the priest aggrieved and pained waited and wondered that no word of mass or requiem he heard as by the holy church ordained then to the magistrate complained that as this woman had been dead a week or more and no mass said it was rank heresy or at least contempt of church thus said the priest and straight the cobbler was arraigned he came confiding in his cause but rather doubtful of the laws the justice from his elbowchair gave him a look that seemed to say thou standest before a magistrate therefore do not prevaricate then asked him in a business way kindly but cold is thy wife dead the cobbler meekly bowed his head she is came struggling from his throat scarce audibly the justice wrote the words down in a book and then continued as he raised his pen she is and hath a mass been said for the salvation of her soul come speak the truth confess the whole the cobbler without pause replied of mass or prayer there was no need for at the moment when she died her soul was with the glorified and from his pocket with all speed he drew the priestly titledeed and prayed the justice he would read the justice read amused amazed and as he read his mirth increased at times his shaggy brows he raised now wondering at the cobbler gazed now archly at the angry priest from all excesses sins and crimes thou hast committed in past times thee i absolve and furthermore purified from all earthly taints to the communion of the saints and to the sacraments restore all stains of weakness and all trace of shame and censure i efface remit the pains thou shouldst endure and make thee innocent and pure so that in dying unto thee the gates of heaven shall open be though long thou livest yet this grace until the moment of thy death unchangeable continueth then said he to the priest i find this document is duly signed brother john tetzel his own hand at all tribunals in the land in evidence it may be used therefore acquitted is the accused then to the cobbler turned my friend pray tell me didst thou ever read reynard the fox o yes indeed i thought so dont forget the end interlude what was the end i am ashamed not to remember reynards fate i have not read the book of late was he not hanged the poet said the student gravely shook his head and answered you exaggerate there was a tournament proclaimed and reynard fought with isegrim the wolf and having vanquished him rose to high honor in the state and keeper of the seals was named at this the gay sicilian laughed fight fire with fire and craft with craft successful cunning seems to be the moral of your tale said he mine had a better and the jews had none at all that i could see his aim was only to amuse meanwhile from out its ebon case his violin the minstrel drew and having tuned its strings anew now held it close in his embrace and poising in his outstretched hand the bow like a magicians wand he paused and said with beaming face last night my story was too long today i give you but a song an old tradition of the north but first to put you in the mood i will a little while prelude and from this instrument draw forth something by way of overture he played at first the tones were pure and tender as a summer night the full moon climbing to her height the sob and ripple of the seas the flapping of an idle sail and then by sudden and sharp degrees the multiplied wild harmonies freshened and burst into a gale a tempest howling through the dark a crash as of some shipwrecked bark a loud and melancholy wail such was the prelude to the tale told by the minstrel and at times he paused amid its varying rhymes and at each pause again broke in the music of his violin with tones of sweetness or of fear movements of trouble or of calm creating their own atmosphere as sitting in a church we hear between the verses of the psalm the organ playing soft and clear or thundering on the startled ear the musicians tale the ballad of carmilhan i at stralsund by the baltic sea within the sandy bar at sunset of a summers day ready for sea at anchor lay the good ship valdemar the sunbeams danced upon the waves and played along her side and through the cabin windows streamed in ripples of golden light that seemed the ripple of the tide there sat the captain with his friends old skippers brown and hale who smoked and grumbled oer their grog and talked of iceberg and of fog of calm and storm and gale and one was spinning a sailors yarn about klaboterman the kobold of the sea a spright invisible to mortal sight who oer the rigging ran sometimes he hammered in the hold sometimes upon the mast sometimes abeam sometimes abaft or at the bows he sang and laughed and made all tight and fast he helped the sailors at their work and toiled with jovial din he helped them hoist and reef the sails he helped them stow the casks and bales and heave the anchor in but woe unto the lazy louts the idlers of the crew them to torment was his delight and worry them by day and night and pinch them black and blue and woe to him whose mortal eyes klaboterman behold it is a certain sign of death the cabinboy here held his breath he felt his blood run cold ii the jolly skipper paused awhile and then again began there is a spectre ship quoth he a ship of the dead that sails the sea and is called the carmilhan a ghostly ship with a ghostly crew in tempests she appears and before the gale or against the gale she sails without a rag of sail without a helmsman steers she haunts the atlantic north and south but mostly the midsea where three great rocks rise bleak and bare like furnacechimneys in the air and are called the chimneys three and ill betide the luckless ship that meets the carmilhan over her decks the seas will leap she must go down into the deep and perish mouse and man the captain of the valdemar laughed loud with merry heart i should like to see this ship said he i should like to find these chimneys three that are marked down in the chart i have sailed right over the spot he said with a good stiff breeze behind when the sea was blue and the sky was clear you can follow my course by these pinholes here and never a rock could find and then he swore a dreadful oath he swore by the kingdoms three that should he meet the carmilhan he would run her down although he ran right into eternity all this while passing to and fro the cabinboy had heard he lingered at the door to hear and drank in all with greedy ear and pondered every word he was a simple country lad but of a roving mind o it must be like heaven thought he those faroff foreign lands to see and fortune seek and find but in the focastle when he heard the mariners blaspheme he thought of home he thought of god and his mother under the churchyard sod and wished it were a dream one friend on board that ship had he t was the klaboterman who saw the bible in his chest and made a sign upon his breast all evil things to ban iii the cabin windows have grown blank as eyeballs of the dead no more the glancing sunbeams burn on the gilt letters of the stern but on the figurehead on valdemar victorious who looketh with disdain to see his image in the tide dismembered float from side to side and reunite again it is the wind those skippers said that swings the vessel so it is the wind it freshens fast t is time to say farewell at last t is time for us to go they shook the captain by the hand goodluck goodluck they cried each face was like the setting sun as broad and red they one by one went oer the vessels side the sun went down the full moon rose serene oer field and flood and all the winding creeks and bays and broad seameadows seemed ablaze the sky was red as blood the southwest wind blew fresh and fair as fair as wind could be bound for odessa oer the bar with all sail set the valdemar went proudly out to sea the lovely moon climbs up the sky as one who walks in dreams a tower of marble in her light a wall of black a wall of white the stately vessel seems low down upon the sandy coast the lights begin to burn and now uplifted high in air they kindle with a fiercer glare and now drop far astern the dawn appears the land is gone the sea is all around then on each hand low hills of sand emerge and form another land she steereth through the sound through kattegat and skagerrack she flitteth like a ghost by day and night by night and day she bounds she flies upon her way along the english coast cape finisterre is drawing near cape finisterre is past into the open ocean stream she floats the vision of a dream too beautiful to last suns rise and set and rise and yet there is no land in sight the liquid planets overhead burn brighter now the moon is dead and longer stays the night iv and now along the horizons edge mountains of cloud uprose black as with forests underneath above their sharp and jagged teeth were white as drifted snows unseen behind them sank the sun but flushed each snowy peak a little while with rosy light that faded slowly from the sight as blushes from the cheek black grew the sky all black all black the clouds were everywhere there was a feeling of suspense in nature a mysterious sense of terror in the air and all on board the valdemar was still as still could be save when the dismal shipbell tolled as ever and anon she rolled and lurched into the sea the captain up and down the deck went striding to and fro now watched the compass at the wheel now lifted up his hand to feel which way the wind might blow and now he looked up at the sails and now upon the deep in every fibre of his frame he felt the storm before it came he had no thought of sleep eight bells and suddenly abaft with a great rush of rain making the ocean white with spume in darkness like the day of doom on came the hurricane the lightning flashed from cloud to cloud and rent the sky in two a jagged flame a single jet of white fire like a bayonet that pierced the eyeballs through then all around was dark again and blacker than before but in that single flash of light he had beheld a fearful sight and thought of the oath he swore for right ahead lay the ship of the dead the ghostly carmilhan her masts were stripped her yards were bare and on her bowsprit poised in air sat the klaboterman her crew of ghosts was all on deck or clambering up the shrouds the boatswains whistle the captains hail were like the piping of the gale and thunder in the clouds and close behind the carmilhan there rose up from the sea as from a foundered ship of stone three bare and splintered masts alone they were the chimneys three and onward dashed the valdemar and leaped into the dark a denser mist a colder blast a little shudder and she had passed right through the phantom bark she cleft in twain the shadowy hulk but cleft it unaware as when careering to her nest the seagull severs with her breast the unresisting air again the lightning flashed again they saw the carmilhan whole as before in hull and spar but now on board of the valdemar stood the klaboterman and they all knew their doom was sealed they knew that death was near some prayed who never prayed before and some they wept and some they swore and some were mute with fear then suddenly there came a shock and louder than wind or sea a cry burst from the crew on deck as she dashed and crashed a hopeless wreck upon the chimneys three the storm and night were passed the light to streak the east began the cabinboy picked up at sea survived the wreck and only he to tell of the carmilhan interlude when the long murmur of applause that greeted the musicians lay had slowly buzzed itself away and the long talk of spectre ships that followed died upon their lips and came unto a natural pause these tales you tell are one and all of the old world the poet said flowers gathered from a crumbling wall dead leaves that rustle as they fall let me present you in their stead something of our new england earth a tale which though of no great worth has still this merit that it yields a certain freshness of the fields a sweetness as of homemade bread the student answered be discreet for if the flour be fresh and sound and if the bread be light and sweet who careth in what mill t was ground or of what oven felt the heat unless as old cervantes said you are looking after better bread than any that is made of wheat you know that people nowadays to what is old give little praise all must be new in prose and verse they want hot bread or something worse fresh every morning and half baked the wholesome bread of yesterday too stale for them is thrown away nor is their thirst with water slaked as oft we see the sky in may threaten to rain and yet not rain the poets face before so gay was clouded with a look of pain but suddenly brightened up again and without further let or stay he told his tale of yesterday the poets tale lady wentworth one hundred years ago and something more in queen street portsmouth at her tavern door neat as a pin and blooming as a rose stood mistress stavers in her furbelows just as her cuckooclock was striking nine above her head resplendent on the sign the portrait of the earl of halifax in scarlet coat and periwig of flax surveyed at leisure all her varied charms her cap her bodice her white folded arms and half resolved though he was past his prime and rather damaged by the lapse of time to fall down at her feet and to declare the passion that had driven him to despair for from his lofty station he had seen stavers her husband dressed in bottlegreen drive his new flying stagecoach four in hand down the long lane and out into the land and knew that he was far upon the way to ipswich and to boston on the bay just then the meditations of the earl were interrupted by a little girl barefooted ragged with neglected hair eyes full of laughter neck and shoulders bare a thin slip of a girl like a new moon sure to he rounded into beauty soon a creature men would worship and adore though now in mean habiliments she bore a pail of water dripping through the street and bathing as she went her naked feet it was a pretty picture full of grace the slender form the delicate thin face the swaying motion as she hurried by the shining feet the laughter in her eye that oer her face in ripples gleamed and glanced as in her pail the shifting sunbeam danced and with uncommon feelings of delight the earl of halifax beheld the sight not so dame stavers for he heard her say these words or thought he did as plain as day o martha hilton fie how dare you go about the town half dressed and looking so at which the gypsy laughed and straight replied no matter how i look i yet shall ride in my own chariot maam and on the child the earl of halifax benignly smiled as with her heavy burden she passed on looked back then turned the corner and was gone what next upon that memorable day arrested his attention was a gay and brilliant equipage that flashed and spun the silver harness glittering in the sun outriders with red jackets lithe and lank pounding the saddles as they rose and sank while all alone within the chariot sat a portly person with threecornered hat a crimson velvet coat head high in air goldheaded cane and nicely powdered hair and diamond buckles sparkling at his knees dignified stately florid much at ease onward the pageant swept and as it passed fair mistress stavers courtesied low and fast for this was governor wentworth driving down to little harbor just beyond the town where his great house stood looking out to sea a goodly place where it was good to be it was a pleasant mansion an abode near and yet hidden from the great highroad sequestered among trees a noble pile baronial and colonial in its style gables and dormerwindows everywhere and stacks of chimneys rising high in air pandaean pipes on which all winds that blew made mournful music the whole winter through within unwonted splendors met the eye panels and floors of oak and tapestry carved chimneypieces where on brazen dogs revelled and roared the christmas fires of logs doors opening into darkness unawares mysterious passages and flights of stairs and on the walls in heavy gilded frames the ancestral wentworths with oldscripture names such was the mansion where the great man dwelt a widower and childless and he felt the loneliness the uncongenial gloom that like a presence haunted ever room for though not given to weakness he could feel the pain of wounds that ache because they heal the years came and the years went seven in all and passed in cloud and sunshine oer the hall the dawns their splendor through its chambers shed the sunsets flushed its western windows red the snow was on its roofs the wind the rain its woodlands were in leaf and bare again moons waxed and waned the lilacs bloomed and died in the broad river ebbed and flowed the tide ships went to sea and ships came home from sea and the slow years sailed by and ceased to be and all these years had martha hilton served in the great house not wholly unobserved by day by night the silver crescent grew though hidden by clouds her light still shining through a maid of all work whether coarse or fine a servant who made service seem divine through her each room was fair to look upon the mirrors glistened and the brasses shone the very knocker on the outer door if she but passed was brighter than before and now the ceaseless turning of the mill of time that never for an hour stands still ground out the governors sixtieth birthday and powdered his brown hair with silvergray the robin the forerunner of the spring the bluebird with his jocund carolling the restless swallows building in the eaves the golden buttercups the grass the leaves the lilacs tossing in the winds of may all welcomed this majestic holiday he gave a splendid banquet served on plate such as became the governor of the state who represented england and the king and was magnificent in everything he had invited all his friends and peers the pepperels the langdons and the lears the sparhawks the penhallows and the rest for why repeat the name of every guest but i must mention one in bands and gown the rector there the reverend arthur brown of the established church with smiling face he sat beside the governor and said grace and then the feast went on as others do but ended as none other i eer knew when they had drunk the king with many a cheer the governor whispered in a servants ear who disappeared and presently there stood within the room in perfect womanhood a maiden modest and yet selfpossessed youthful and beautiful and simply dressed can this be martha hilton it must be yes martha hilton and no other she dowered with the beauty of her twenty years how ladylike how qneenlike she appears the pale thin crescent of the days gone by is dian now in all her majesty yet scarce a guest perceived that she was there until the governor rising from his chair played slightly with his ruffles then looked down and said unto the reverend arthur brown this is my birthday it shall likewise be my weddingday and you shall marry me the listening guests were greatly mystified none more so than the rector who replied marry you yes that were a pleasant task your excellency but to whom i ask the governor answered to this lady here and beckoned martha hilton to draw near she came and stood all blushes at his side the rector paused the impatient governor cried this is the lady do you hesitate then i command you as chief magistrate the rector read the service loud and clear dearly beloved we are gathered here and so on to the end at his command on the fourth finger of her fair left hand the governor placed the ring and that was all martha was lady wentworth of the hall interlude well pleased the audience heard the tale the theologian said indeed to praise you there is little need one almost hears the farmers flail thresh out your wheat nor does there fail a certain freshness as you said and sweetness as of homemade bread but not less sweet and not less fresh are many legends that i know writ by the monks of longago who loved to mortify the flesh so that the soul might purer grow and rise to a diviner state and one of these perhaps of all most beautiful i now recall and with permission will narrate hoping thereby to make amends for that grim tragedy of mine as strong and black as spanish wine i told last night and wish almost it had remained untold my friends for torquemadas awful ghost came to me in the dreams i dreamed and in the darkness glared and gleamed like a great lighthouse on the coast the student laughing said far more like to some dismal fire of bale flaring portentous on a hill or torches lighted on a shore by wreckers in a midnight gale no matter be it as you will only go forward with your tale the theologians tale the legend beautiful hadst thou stayed i must have fled that is what the vision said in his chamber all alone kneeling on the floor of stone prayed the monk in deep contrition for his sins of indecision prayed for greater selfdenial in temptation and in trial it was noonday by the dial and the monk was all alone suddenly as if it lightened an unwonted splendor brightened all within him and without him in that narrow cell of stone and he saw the blessed vision of our lord with light elysian like a vesture wrapped about him like a garment round him thrown not as crucified and slain not in agonies of pain not with bleeding hands and feet did the monk his master see but as in the village street in the house or harvestfield halt and lame and blind he healed when he walked in galilee in an attitude imploring hands upon his bosom crossed wondering worshipping adoring knelt the monk in rapture lost lord he thought in heaven that reignest who am i that thus thou deignest to reveal thyself to me who am i that from the centre of thy glory thou shouldst enter this poor cell my guest to be then amid his exaltation loud the convent bell appalling from its belfry calling calling rang through court and corridor with persistent iteration he had never heard before it was now the appointed hour when alike in shine or shower winters cold or summers heat to the convent portals came all the blind and halt and lame all the beggars of the street for their daily dole of food dealt them by the brotherhood and their almoner was he who upon his bended knee rapt in silent ecstasy of divinest selfsurrender saw the vision and the splendor deep distress and hesitation mingled with his adoration should he go or should he stay should he leave the poor to wait hungry at the convent gate till the vision passed away should he slight his radiant guest slight this visitant celestial for a crowd of ragged bestial beggars at the convent gate would the vision there remain would the vision come again then a voice within his breast whispered audible and clear as if to the outward ear do thy duty that is best leave unto thy lord the rest straightway to his feet he started and with longing look intent on the blessed vision bent slowly from his cell departed slowly on his errand went at the gate the poor were waiting looking through the iron grating with that terror in the eye that is only seen in those who amid their wants and woes hear the sound of doors that close and of feet that pass them by grown familiar with disfavor grown familiar with the savor of the bread by which men die but today they knew not why like the gate of paradise seemed the convent sate to rise like a sacrament divine seemed to them the bread and wine in his heart the monk was praying thinking of the homeless poor what they suffer and endure what we see not what we see and the inward voice was saying whatsoever thing thou doest to the least of mine and lowest that thou doest unto me unto me but had the vision come to him in beggars clothing come a mendicant imploring would he then have knelt adoring or have listened with derision and have turned away with loathing thus his conscience put the question full of troublesome suggestion as at length with hurried pace towards his cell he turned his face and beheld the convent bright with a supernatural light like a luminous cloud expanding over floor and wall and ceiling but he paused with awestruck feeling at the threshold of his door for the vision still was standing as he left it there before when the convent bell appalling from its belfry calling calling summoned him to feed the poor through the long hour intervening it had waited his return and he felt his bosom burn comprehending all the meaning when the blessed vision said hadst thou stayed i must have fled interlude all praised the legend more or less some liked the moral some the verse some thought it better and some worse than other legends of the past until with illconcealed distress at all their cavilling at last the theologian gravely said the spanish proverb then is right consult your friends on what you do and one will say that it is white and others say that it is red and amen quoth the spanish jew six stories told we must have seven a cluster like the pleiades and lo it happens as with these that one is missing from our heaven where is the landlord bring him here let the lost pleiad reappear thus the sicilian cried and went forthwith to seek his missing star but did not find him in the bar a place that landlords most frequent nor yet beside the kitchen fire nor up the stairs nor in the hall it was in vain to ask or call there were no tidings of the squire so he came back with downcast head exclaiming well our bashful host hath surely given up the ghost another proverb says the dead can tell no tales and that is true it follows then that one of you must tell a story in his stead you must he to the student said who know so many of the best and tell them better than the rest straight by these flattering words beguiled the student happy as a child when he is called a little man assumed the double task imposed and without more ado unclosed his smiling lips and thus began the students second tale the baron of st castine baron castine of st castine has left his chateau in the pyrenees and sailed across the western seas when he went away from his fair demesne the birds were building the woods were green and now the winds of winter blow round the turrets of the old chateau the birds are silent and unseen the leaves lie dead in the ravine and the pyrenees are white with snow his father lonely old and gray sits by the fireside day by day thinking ever one thought of care through the southern windows narrow and tall the sun shines into the ancient hall and makes a glory round his hair the housedog stretched beneath his chair groans in his sleep as if in pain then wakes and yawns and sleeps again so silent is it everywhere so silent you can hear the mouse run and rummage along the beams behind the wainscot of the wall and the old man rouses from his dreams and wanders restless through the house as if he heard strange voices call his footsteps echo along the floor of a distant passage and pause awhile he is standing by an open door looking long with a sad sweet smile into the room of his absent son there is the bed on which he lay there are the pictures bright and gay horses and hounds and sunlit seas there are his powderflask and gun and his huntingknives in shape of a fan the chair by the window where he sat with the clouded tigerskin for a mat looking out on the pyrenees looking out on mount marbore and the seven valleys of lavedan ah me he turns away and sighs there is a mist before his eyes at night whatever the weather be wind or rain or starry heaven just as the clock is striking seven those who look from the windows see the village curate with lantern and maid come through the gateway from the park and cross the courtyard damp and dark a ring of light in a ring of shade and now at the old mans side he stands his voice is cheery his heart expands he gossips pleasantly by the blaze of the fire of fagots about old days and cardinal mazarin and the fronde and the cardinals nieces fair and fond and what they did and what they said when they heard his eminence was dead and after a pause the old man says his mind still coming back again to the one sad thought that haunts his brain are there any tidings from over sea ah why has that wild boy gone from me and the curate answers looking down harmless and docile as a lamb young blood young blood it must so be and draws from the pocket of his gown a handkerchief like an oriflamb and wipes his spectacles and they play their little game of lansquenet in silence for an hour or so till the clock at nine strikes loud and clear from the village lying asleep below and across the courtyard into the dark of the winding pathway in the park curate and lantern disappear and darkness reigns in the old chateau the ship has come back from over sea she has been signalled from below and into the harbor of bordeaux she sails with her gallant company but among them is nowhere seen the brave young baron of st castine he hath tarried behind i ween in the beautiful land of acadie and the father paces to and fro through the chambers of the old chateau waiting waiting to hear the hum of wheels on the road that runs below of servants hurrying here and there the voice in the courtyard the step on the stair waiting for some one who doth not come but letters there are which the old man reads to the curate when he comes at night word by word as an acolyte repeats his prayers and tells his beads letters full of the rolling sea full of a young mans joy to be abroad in the world alone and free full of adventures and wonderful scenes of hunting the deer through forests vast in the royal grant of pierre du gast of nights in the tents of the tarratines of madocawando the indian chief and his daughters glorious as queens and beautiful beyond belief and so soft the tones of their native tongue the words are not spoken they are sung and the curate listens and smiling says ah yes dear friend in our young days we should have liked to hunt the deer all day amid those forest scenes and to sleep in the tents of the tarratines but now it is better sitting here within four walls and without the fear of losing our hearts to indian queens for man is fire and woman is tow and the somebody comes and begins to blow then a gleam of distrust and vague surmise shines in the fathers gentle eyes as firelight on a windowpane glimmers and vanishes again but naught he answers he only sighs and for a moment bows his head then as their custom is they play their little gain of lansquenet and another day is with the dead another day and many a day and many a week and month depart when a fatal letter wings its way across the sea like a bird of prey and strikes and tears the old mans heart lo the young baron of st castine swift as the wind is and as wild has married a dusky tarratine has married madocawandos child the letter drops from the fathers hand though the sinews of his heart are wrung he utters no cry he breathes no prayer no malediction falls from his tongue but his stately figure erect and grand bends and sinks like a column of sand in the whirlwind of his great despair dying yes dying his latest breath of parley at the door of death is a blessing on his wayward son lower and lower on his breast sinks his gray head he is at rest no longer he waits for any one for many a year the old chateau lies tenantless and desolate rank grasses in the courtyard grow about its gables caws the crow only the porter at the gate is left to guard it and to wait the coming of the rightful heir no other life or sound is there no more the curate comes at night no more is seen the unsteady light threading the alleys of the park the windows of the hall are dark the chambers dreary cold and bare at length at last when the winter is past and birds are building and woods are green with flying skirts is the curate seen speeding along the woodland way humming gayly no day is so long but it comes at last to vespersong he stops at the porters lodge to say that at last the baron of st castine is coming home with his indian queen is coming without a weeks delay and all the house must be swept and clean and all things set in good array and the solemn porter shakes his head and the answer he makes is lackaday we will see as the blind man said alert since first the day began the cock upon the village church looks northward from his airy perch as if beyond the ken of man to see the ships come sailing on and pass the isle of oleron and pass the tower of cordouan in the church below is cold in clay the heart that would have leaped for joy o tender heart of truth and trust to see the coming of that day in the church below the lips are dust dust are the hands and dust the feet that would have been so swift to meet the coming of that wayward boy at night the front of the old chateau is a blaze of light above and below theres a sound of wheels and hoofs in the street a cracking of whips and scamper of feet bells are ringing and horns are blown and the baron hath come again to his own the curate is waiting in the hall most eager and alive of all to welcome the baron and baroness but his mind is full of vague distress for he hath read in jesuit books of those children of the wilderness and now good simple man he looks to see a painted savage stride into the room with shoulders bare and eagle feathers in her hair and around her a robe of panthers hide instead he beholds with secret shame a form of beauty undefined a loveliness with out a name not of degree but more of kind nor bold nor shy nor short nor tall but a new mingling of them all yes beautiful beyond belief transfigured and transfused he sees the lady of the pyrenees the daughter of the indian chief beneath the shadow of her hair the goldbronze color of the skin seems lighted by a fire within as when a burst of sunlight shines beneath a sombre grove of pines a dusky splendor in the air the two small hands that now are pressed in his seem made to be caressed they lie so warm and soft and still like birds half hidden in a nest trustful and innocent of ill and ah he cannot believe his ears when her melodious voice he hears speaking his native gascon tongue the words she utters seem to be part of some poem of goudouli they are not spoken they are sung and the baron smiles and says you see i told you but the simple truth ah you may trust the eyes of youth down in the village day by day the people gossip in their way and stare to see the baroness pass on sunday morning to early mass and when she kneeleth down to pray they wonder and whisper together and say surely this is no heathen lass and in course of time they learn to bless the baron and the baroness and in course of time the curate learns a secret so dreadful that by turns he is ice and fire he freezes and burns the baron at confession hath said that though this woman be his wife he bath wed her as the indians wed he hath bought her for a gun and a knife and the curate replies o profligate o prodigal son return once more to the open arms and the open door of the church or ever it be too late thank god thy father did not live to see what he could not forgive on thee so reckless and perverse he left his blessing not his curse but the nearer the dawn the darker the night and by going wrong all things come right things have been mended that were worse and the worse the nearer they are to mend for the sake of the living and the dead thou shalt be wed as christians wed and all things come to a happy end o sun that followest the night in yon blue sky serene and pure and pourest thine impartial light alike on mountain and on moor pause for a moment in thy course and bless the bridegroom and the bride o gave that from thy hidden source in you mysterious mountainside pursuest thy wandering way alone and leaping down its steps of stone along the meadowlands demure stealest away to the adour pause for a moment in thy course to bless the bridegroom and the bride the choir is singing the matin song the doors of the church are opened wide the people crowd and press and throng to see the bridegroom and the bride they enter and pass along the nave they stand upon the fathers grave the bells are ringing soft and slow the living above and the dead below give their blessing on one and twain the warm wind blows from the hills of spain the birds are building the leaves are green and baron castine of st castine hath come at last to his own again finale nunc plaudite the student cried when he had finished now applaud as roman actors used to say at the conclusion of a play and rose and spread his hands abroad and smiling bowed from side to side as one who bears the palm away and generous was the applause and loud but less for him than for the sun that even as the tale was done burst from its canopy of cloud and lit the landscape with the blaze of afternoon on autumn days and filled the room with light and made the fire of logs a painted shade a sudden wind from out the west blew all its trumpets loud and shrill the windows rattled with the blast the oaktrees shouted as it passed and straight as if by fear possessed the cloud encampment on the hill broke up and fluttering flag and tent vanished into the firmament and down the valley fled amain the rear of the retreating rain only far up in the blue sky a mass of clouds like drifted snow suffused with a faint alpine glow was heaped together vast and high on which a shattered rainbow hung not rising like the ruined arch of some aerial aqueduct but like a roseate garland plucked from an olympian god and flung aside in his triumphal march like prisoners from their dungeon gloom like birds escaping from a snare like schoolboys at the hour of play all left at once the pentup room and rushed into the open air and no more tales were told that day part third prelude the evening came the golden vane a moment in the sunset glanced then darkened and then gleamed again as from the east the moon advanced and touched it with a softer light while underneath with flowing mane upon the sign the red horse pranced and galloped forth into the night but brighter than the afternoon that followed the dark day of rain and brighter than the golden vane that glistened in the rising moon within the ruddy firelight gleamed and every separate windowpane backed by the outer darkness showed a mirror where the flamelets gleamed and flickered to and fro and seemed a bonfire lighted in the road amid the hospitable glow like an old actor on the stage with the uncertain voice of age the singing chimney chanted low the homely songs of long ago the voice that ossian heard of yore when midnight winds were in his hall a ghostly and appealing call a sound of days that are no more and dark as ossian sat the jew and listened to the sound and knew the passing of the airy hosts the gray and misty cloud of ghosts in their interminable flight and listening muttered in his beard with accent indistinct and weird who are ye children of the night beholding his mysterious face tell me the gay sicilian said why was it that in breaking bread at supper you bent down your head and musing paused a little space as one who says a silent grace the jew replied with solemn air i said the manichaeans prayer it was his faith perhaps is mine that life in all its forms is one and that its secret conduits run unseen but in unbroken line from the great fountainhead divine through man and beast through grain and grass howeer we struggle strive and cry from death there can be no escape and no escape from life alas because we cannot die but pass from one into another shape it is but into life we die therefore the manichaean said this simple prayer on breaking bread lest he with hasty hand or knife might wound the incarcerated life the soul in things that we call dead i did not reap thee did not bind thee i did not thrash thee did not grind thee nor did i in the oven bake thee it was not i it was another did these things unto thee o brother i only have thee hold thee break thee that birds have souls i can concede the poet cried with glowing cheeks the flocks that from their beds of reed uprising north or southward fly and flying write upon the sky the biforked letter of the greeks as hath been said by rucellai all birds that sing or chirp or cry even those migratory bands the minor poets of the air the plover peep and sanderling that hardly can be said to sing but pipe along the barren sands all these have souls akin to ours so hath the lovely race of flowers thus much i grant but nothing more the rusty hinges of a door are not alive because they creak this chimney with its dreary roar these rattling windows do not speak to me they speak the jew replied and in the sounds that sink and soar i hear the voices of a tide that breaks upon an unknown shore here the sicilian interfered that was your dream then as you dozed a moment since with eyes halfclosed and murmured something in your beard the hebrew smiled and answered nay not that but something very near like and yet not the same may seem the vision of my waking dream before it wholly dies away listen to me and you shall hear the spanish jews tale azrael king solomon before his palace gate at evening on the pavement tessellate was walking with a stranger from the east arrayed in rich attire as for a feast the mighty runjeetsing a learned man and rajah of the realms of hindostan and as they walked the guest became aware of a white figure in the twilight air gazing intent as one who with surprise his form and features seemed to recognize and in a whisper to the king he said what is yon shape that pallid as the dead is watching me as if he sought to trace in the dim light the features of my face the king looked and replied i know him well it is the angel men call azrael t is the death angel what hast thou to fear and the guest answered lest he should come near and speak to me and take away my breath save me from azrael save me from death o king that hast dominion oer the wind bid it arise and bear me hence to ind the king gazed upward at the cloudless sky whispered a word and raised his hand on high and lo the signetring of chrysoprase on his uplifted finger seemed to blaze with hidden fire and rushing from the west there came a mighty wind and seized the guest and lifted him from earth and on they passed his shining garments streaming in the blast a silken banner oer the walls upreared a purple cloud that gleamed and disappeared then said the angel smiling if this man be rajah runjeetsing of hindostan thou hast done well in listening to his prayer i was upon my way to seek him there interlude o edrehi forbear tonight your ghostly legends of affright and let the talmud rest in peace spare us your dismal tales of death that almost take away ones breath so doing may your tribe increase thus the sicilian said then went and on the spinets rattling keys played marianina like a breeze from naples and the southern seas that brings us the delicious scent of citron and of orange trees and memories of soft days of ease at capri and amalfi spent not so the eager poet said at least not so before i tell the story of my azrael an angel mortal as ourselves which in an ancient tome i found upon a convents dusty shelves chained with an iron chain and bound in parchment and with clasps of brass lest from its prison some dark day it might be stolen or steal away while the good friars were singing mass it is a tale of charlemagne when like a thundercloud that lowers and sweeps from mountaincrest to coast with lightning flaming through its showers he swept across the lombard plain beleaguering with his warlike train pavia the countrys pride and boast the city of the hundred towers thus heralded the tale began and thus in sober measure ran the poets tale charlemagne olger the dane and desiderio king of the lombards on a lofty tower stood gazing northward oer the rolling plains league after league of harvests to the foot of the snowcrested alps and saw approach a mighty army thronging all the roads that led into the city and the king said unto olger who had passed his youth as hostage at the court of france and knew the emperors form and face is charlemagne among that host and olger answered no and still the innumerable multitude flowed onward and increased until the king cried in amazement surely charlemagne is coming in the midst of all these knights and olger answered slowly no not yet he will not come so soon then much disturbed king desiderio asked what shall we do if he approach with a still greater army and olger answered when he shall appear you will behold what manner of man he is but what will then befall us i know not then came the guard that never knew repose the paladins of france and at the sight the lombard king oercome with terror cried this must be charlemagne and as before did olger answer no not yet not yet and then appeared in panoply complete the bishops and the abbots and the priests of the imperial chapel and the counts and desiderio could no more endure the light of day nor yet encounter death but sobbed aloud and said let us go down and hide us in the bosom of the earth far from the sight and anger of a foe so terrible as this and olger said when you behold the harvests in the fields shaking with fear the po and the ticino lashing the city walls with iron waves then may you know that charlemagne is come and even as he spake in the northwest lo there uprose a black and threatening cloud out of whose bosom flashed the light of arms upon the people pent up in the city a light more terrible than any darkness and charlemagne appeared a man of iron his helmet was of iron and his gloves of iron and his breastplate and his greaves and tassets were of iron and his shield in his left hand he held an iron spear in his right hand his sword invincible the horse he rode on had the strength of iron and color of iron all who went before him beside him and behind him his whole host were armed with iron and their hearts within them were stronger than the armor that they wore the fields and all the roads were filled with iron and points of iron glistened in the sun and shed a terror through the city streets this at a single glance olger the dane saw from the tower and turning to the king exclaimed in haste behold this is the man you looked for with such eagerness and then fell as one dead at desiderios feet interlude well pleased all listened to the tale that drew the student said its pith and marrow from the ancient myth of some one with an iron flail or that portentous man of brass hephaestus made in days of yore who stalked about the cretan shore and saw the ships appear and pass and threw stones at the argonauts being filled with indiscriminate ire that tangled and perplexed his thoughts but like a hospitable host when strangers landed on the coast heated himself redhot with fire and hugged them in his arms and pressed their bodies to his burning breast the poet answered no not thus the legend rose it sprang at first out of the hunger and the thirst in all men for the marvellous and thus it filled and satisfied the imagination of mankind and this ideal to the mind was truer than historic fact fancy enlarged and multiplied the tenors of the awful name of charlemagne till he became armipotent in every act and clothed in mystery appeared not what men saw but what they feared besides unless my memory fail your some one with an iron flail is not an ancient myth at all but comes much later on the scene as talus in the faerie queene the iron groom of artegall who threshed out falsehood and deceit and truth upheld and righted wrong as was as is the swallow fleet and as the lion is was strong the theologian said perchance your chronicler in writing this had in his mind the anabasis where xenophon describes the advance of artaxerxes to the fight at first the low gray cloud of dust and then a blackness oer the fields as of a passing thundergust then flash of brazen armor bright and ranks of men and spears upthrust bowmen and troops with wicker shields and cavalry equipped in white and chariots ranged in front of these with scythes upon their axletrees to this the student answered well i also have a tale to tell of charlemagne a tale that throws a softer light more tinged with rose than your grim apparition cast upon the darkness of the past listen and hear in english rhyme what the good monk of lauresheim gives as the gossip of his time in mediaeval latin prose the students tale emma and eginhard when alcuin taught the sons of charlemagne in the free schools of aix how kings should reign and with them taught the children of the poor how subjects should be patient and endure he touched the lips of some as best befit with honey from the hives of holy writ others intoxicated with the wine of ancient history sweet but less divine some with the wholesome fruits of grammar fed others with mysteries of the stars oerhead that hang suspended in the vaulted sky like lamps in some fair palace vast and high in sooth it was a pleasant sight to see that saxon monk with hood and rosary with inkhorn at his belt and pen and book and mingled lore and reverence in his look or hear the cloister and the court repeat the measured footfalls of his sandaled feet or watch him with the pupils of his school gentle of speech but absolute of rule among them always earliest in his place was eginhard a youth of frankish race whose face was bright with flashes that forerun the splendors of a yet unrisen sun to him all things were possible and seemed not what he had accomplished but had dreamed and what were tasks to others were his play the pastime of an idle holiday smaragdo abbot of st michaels said with many a shrug and shaking of the head surely some demon must possess the lad who showed more wit than ever schoolboy had and learned his trivium thus without the rod but alcuin said it was the grace of god thus he grew up in logic pointdevice perfect in grammar and in rhetoric nice science of numbers geometric art and lore of stars and music knew by heart a minnesinger long before the times of those who sang their love in suabian rhymes the emperor when he heard this good report of eginhard much buzzed about the court said to bimself this stripling seems to be purposely sent into the world for me he shall become my scribe and shall be schooled in all the arts whereby the world is ruled thus did the gentle eginhard attain to honor in the court of charlemagne became the sovereigns favorite his right hand so that his fame was great in all the land and all men loved him for his modest grace and comeliness of figure and of face an inmate of the palace yet recluse a man of books yet sacred from abuse among the armed knights with spur on heel the tramp of horses and the clang of steel and as the emperor promised he was schooled in all the arts by which the world is ruled but the one art supreme whose law is fate the emperor never dreamed of till too late home from her convent to the palace came the lovely princess emma whose sweet name whispered by seneschal or sung by bard had often touched the soul of eginhard he saw her from his window as in state she came by knights attended through the gate he saw her at the banquet of that day fresh as the morn and beautiful as may he saw her in the garden as she strayed among the flowers of summer with her maid and said to him o eginhard disclose the meaning and the mystery of the rose and trembling he made answer in good sooth its mystery is love its meaning youth how can i tell the signals and the signs by which one heart another heart divines how can i tell the many thousand ways by which it keeps the secret it betrays o mystery of love o strange romance among the peers and paladins of france shining in steel and prancing on gay steeds noble by birth yet nobler by great deeds the princess emma had no words nor looks but for this clerk this man of thought and books the summer passed the autumn came the stalks of lilies blackened in the garden walks the leaves fell russetgolden and bloodred loveletters thought the poet fancyled or jove descending in a shower of gold into the lap of danae of old for poets cherish many a strange conceit and love transmutes all nature by its heat no more the garden lessons nor the dark and hurried meetings in the twilight park but now the studious lamp and the delights of firesides in the silent winter nights and watching from his window hour by hour the light that burned in princess emmas tower at length one night while musing by the fire oercome at last by his insane desire for what will reckless love not do and dare he crossed the court and climbed the winding stair with some feigned message in the emperors name but when he to the ladys presence came he knelt down at her feet until she laid her hand upon him like a naked blade and whispered in his ear arise sir knight to my hearts level o my hearts delight and there he lingered till the crowing cock the alectryon of the farmyard and the flock sang his aubade with lusty voice and clear to tell the sleeping world that dawn was near and then they parted but at parting lo they saw the palace courtyard white with snow and placid as a nun the moon on high gazing from cloudy cloisters of the sky alas he said how hide the fatal line of footprints leading from thy door to mine and none returning ah he little knew what womans wit when put to proof can do that night the emperor sleepless with the cares and troubles that attend on state affairs had risen before the dawn and musing gazed into the silent night as one amazed to see the calm that reigned oer all supreme when his own reign was but a troubled dream the moon lit up the gables capped with snow and the white roofs and half the court below and he beheld a form that seemed to cower beneath a burden come from emmas tower a woman who upon her shoulders bore clerk eginhard to his own private door and then returned in haste but still essayed to tread the footprints she herself had made and as she passed across the lighted space the emperor saw his daughter emmas face he started not he did not speak or moan but seemed as one who hath been turned to stone and stood there like a statue nor awoke out of his trance of pain till morning broke till the stars faded and the moon went down and oer the towers and steeples of the town came the gray daylight then the sun who took the empire of the world with sovereign look suffusing with a soft and golden glow all the dead landscape in its shroud of snow touching with flame the tapering chapel spires windows and roofs and smoke of household fires and kindling park and palace as he came the storks nest on the chimney seemed in flame and thus he stood till eginhard appeared demure and modest with his comely beard and flowing flaxen tresses come to ask as was his wont the days appointed task the emperor looked upon him with a smile and gently said my son wait yet awhile this hour my council meets upon some great and very urgent business of the state come back within the hour on thy return the work appointed for thee shalt thou learn having dismissed this gallant troubadour he summoned straight his council and secure and steadfast in his purpose from the throne all the adventure of the night made known then asked for sentence and with eager breath some answered banishment and others death then spake the king your sentence is not mine life is the gift of god and is divine nor from these palace walls shall one depart who carries such a secret in his heart my better judgment points another way good alcuin i remember how one day when my pepino asked you what are men you wrote upon his tablets with your pen guests of the grave and travellers that pass this being true of all men we alas being all fashioned of the selfsame dust let us be merciful as well as just this passing traveller who hath stolen away the brightest jewel of my crown today shall of himself the precious gem restore by giving it i make it mine once more over those fatal footprints i will throw my ermine mantle like another snow then eginhard was summoned to the hall and entered and in presence of them all the emperor said my son for thou to me hast been a son and evermore shalt be long hast thou served thy sovereign and thy zeal pleads to me with importunate appeal while i have been forgetful to requite thy service and affection as was right but now the hour is come when i thy lord will crown thy love with such supreme reward a gift so precious kings have striven in vain to win it from the hands of charlemagne then sprang the portals of the chamber wide and princess emma entered in the pride of birth and beauty that in part oercame the conscious terror and the blush of shame and the good emperor rose up from his throne and taking her white hand within his own placed it in eginhards and said my son this is the gift thy constant zeal hath won thus i repay the royal debt i owe and cover up the footprints in the snow interlude tnus ran the students pleasant rhyme of eginhard and love and youth some doubted its historic truth but while they doubted neertheless saw in it gleams of truthfulness and thanked the monk of lauresheim this they discussed in various mood then in the silence that ensued was heard a sharp and sudden sound as of a bowstring snapped in air and the musician with a bound sprang up in terror from his chair and for a moment listening stood then strode across the room and found his dear his darling violin still lying safe asleep within its little cradle like a child that gives a sudden cry of pain and wakes to fall asleep again and as he looked at it and smiled by the uncertain light beguiled despair two strings were broken in twain while all lamented and made moan with many a sympathetic word as if the loss had been their own deeming the tones they might have heard sweeter than they had heard before they saw the landlord at the door the missing man the portly squire he had not entered but he stood with both arms full of seasoned wood to feed the muchdevouring fire that like a lion in a cage lashed its long tail and roared with rage the missing man ah yes they said missing but whither had he fled where had he hidden himself away no farther than the barn or shed he had not hidden himself nor fled how should he pass the rainy day but in his barn with hens and hay or mending harness cart or sled now having come he needs must stay and tell his tale as well as they the landlord answered only these are logs from the dead appletrees of the old orchard planted here by the first howe of sudbury nor oak nor maple has so clear a flame or burns so quietly or leaves an ash so clean and white thinking by this to put aside the impending tale that terrified when suddenly to his delight the theologian interposed saying that when the door was closed and they had stopped that draft of cold unpleasant night air he proposed to tell a tale worldwide apart from that the student had just told worldwide apart and yet akin as showing that the human heart beats on forever as of old as well beneath the snowwhite fold of quaker kerchief as within sendal or silk or cloth of gold and without preface would begin and then the clamorous clock struck eight deliberate with sonorous chime slow measuring out the march of time like some grave consul of old rome in jupiters temple driving home the nails that marked the year and date thus interrupted in his rhyme the theologian needs must wait but quoted horace where he sings the dire necessity of things that drives into the roofs sublime of newbuilt houses of the great the adamantine nails of fate when ceased the little carillon to herald from its wooden tower the important transit of the hour the theologian hastened on content to be all owed at last to sing his idyl of the past the theologians tale elizabeth i ah how short are the days how soon the night overtakes us in the old country the twilight is longer but here in the forest suddenly comes the dark with hardly a pause in its coming hardly a moment between the two lights the day and the lamplight yet how grand is the winter how spotless the snow is and perfect thus spake elizabeth haddon at nightfall to hannah the housemaid as in the farmhouse kitchen that served for kitchen and parlor by the window she sat with her work and looked on a landscape white as the great white sheet that peter saw in his vision by the four corners let down and descending out of the heavens covered with snow were the forests of pine and the fields and the meadows nothing was dark but the sky and the distant delaware flowing down from its native hills a peaceful and bountiful river then with a smile on her lips made answer hannah the housemaid beautiful winter yea the winter is beautiful surely if one could only walk like a fly with ones feet on the ceiling but the great delaware river is not like the thames as we saw it out of our upper windows in rotherhithe street in the borough crowded with masts and sails of vessels coming and going here there is nothing but pines with patches of snow on their branches there is snow in the air and see it is falling already all the roads will be blocked and i pity joseph tomorrow breaking his way through the drifts with his sled and oxen and then too how in all the world shall we get to meeting on firstday but elizabeth checked her and answered mildly reproving surely the lord will provide for unto the snow he sayeth be thou on the earth the good lord sayeth he is it giveth snow like wool like ashes scatters the hoarfrost so she folded her work and laid it away in her basket meanwhile hannah the housemaid had closed and fastened the shutters spread the cloth and lighted the lamp on the table and placed there plates and cups from the dresser the brown rye loaf and the butter fresh from the dairy and then protecting her hand with a holder took from the crane in the chimney the steaming and simmering kettle poised it aloft in the air and filled up the earthen teapot made in delft and adorned with quaint and wonderful figures then elizabeth said lo joseph is long on his errand i have sent him away with a hamper of food and of clothing for the poor in the village a good lad and cheerful is joseph in the right place is his heart and his hand is ready and willing thus in praise of her servant she spake and hannah the housemaid laughed with her eyes as she listened but governed her tongue and was silent while her mistress went on the house is far from the village we should be lonely here were it not for friends that in passing sometimes tarry oernight and make us glad by their coming thereupon answered hannah the housemaid the thrifty the frugal yea they come and they tarry as if thy house were a tavern open to all are its doors and they come and go like the pigeons in and out of the holes of the pigeonhouse over the hayloft cooing and smoothing their feathers and basking themselves in the sunshine but in meekness of spirit and calmly elizabeth answered all i have is the lords not mine to give or withhold it i but distribute his gifts to the poor and to those of his people who in journeyings often surrender their lives to his service his not mine are the gifts and only so far can i make them mine as in giving i add my heart to whatever is given therefore my excellent father first built this house in the clearing though he came not himself i came for the lord was my guidance leading me here for this service we must not grudge then to others ever the cup of cold water or crumbs that fall from our table thus rebuked for a season was silent the penitent housemaid and elizabeth said in tones even sweeter and softer dost thou remember hannah the great maymeeting in london when i was still a child how we sat in the silent assembly waiting upon the lord in patient and passive submission no one spake till at length a young man a stranger john estaugh moved by the spirit rose as if he were john the apostle speaking such words of power that they bowed our hearts as a strong wind bends the grass of the fields or grain that is ripe for the sickle thoughts of him today have been oft borne inward upon me wherefore i do not know but strong is the feeling within me that once more i shall see a face i have never forgotten ii een as she spake they heard the musical jangle of sleighbells first far off with a dreamy sound and faint in the distance then growing nearer and louder and turning into the farmyard till it stopped at the door with sudden creaking of runners then there were voices heard as of two men talking together and to herself as she listened upbraiding said hannah the housemaid it is joseph come back and i wonder what stranger is with him down from its nail she took and lighted the great tin lantern pierced with holes and round and roofed like the top of a lighthouse and went forth to receive the coming guest at the doorway casting into the dark a network of glimmer and shadow over the falling snow the yellow sleigh and the horses and the forms of men snowcovered looming gigantic then giving joseph the lantern she entered the house with the stranger youthful he was and tall and his cheeks aglow with the night air and as he entered elizabeth rose and going to meet him as if an unseen power had announced and preceded his presence and he had come as one whose coming had long been expected quietly gave him her hand and said thou art welcome john estaugh and the stranger replied with staid and quiet behavior dost thou remember me still elizabeth after so many years have passed it seemeth a wonderful thing that i find thee surely the hand of the lord conducted me here to thy threshold for as i journeyed along and pondered alone and in silence on his ways that are past finding out i saw in the snowmist seemingly weary with travel a wayfarer who by the wayside paused and waited forthwith i remembered queen candaces eunuch how on the way that goes down from jerusalem unto gaza reading esaias the prophet he journeyed and spake unto philip praying him to come up and sit in his chariot with him so i greeted the man and he mounted the sledge beside me and as we talked on the way he told me of thee and thy homestead how being led by the light of the spirit that never deceiveth full of zeal for the work of the lord thou hadst come to this country and i remembered thy name and thy father and mother in england and on my journey have stopped to see thee elizabeth haddon wishing to strengthen thy hand in the labors of love thou art doing and elizabeth answered with confident voice and serenely looking into his face with her innocent eyes as she answered surely the hand of the lord is in it his spirit hath led thee out of the darkness and storm to the light and peace of my fireside then with stamping of feet the door was opened and joseph entered bearing the lantern and carefully blowing the light out rung it up on its nail and all sat down to their supper for underneath that roof was no distinction of persons but one family only one heart one hearth and one household when the supper was ended they drew their chairs to the fireplace spacious openhearted profuse of flame and of firewood lord of forests unfelled and not a gleaner of fagots spreading its arms to embrace with inexhaustible bounty all who fled from the cold exultant laughing at winter only hannah the housemaid was busy in clearing the table coming and going and hustling about in closet and chamber then elizabeth told her story again to john estaugh going far back to the past to the early days of her childhood how she had waited and watched in all her doubts and besetments comforted with the extendings and holy sweet inflowings of the spirit of love till the voice imperative sounded and she obeyed the voice and cast in her lot with her people here in the desert land and god would provide for the issue meanwhile joseph sat with folded hands and demurely listened or seemed to listen and in the silence that followed nothing was heard for a while but the step of hannah the housemaid walking the floor overhead and setting the chambers in order and elizabeth said with a smile of compassion the maiden hath a light heart in her breast but her feet are heavy and awkward inwardly joseph laughed but governed his tongue and was silent then came the hour of sleep deaths counterfeit nightly rehearsal of the great silent assembly the meeting of shadows where no man speaketh but all are still and the peace and rest are unbroken silently over that house the blessing of slumber descended but when the morning dawned and the sun uprose in his splendor breaking his way through clouds that encumbered his path in the heavens joseph was seen with his sled and oxen breaking a pathway through the drifts of snow the horses already were harnessed and john estaugh was standing and taking leave at the threshold saying that he should return at the meeting in may while above them hannah the housemaid the homely was looking out of the attic laughing aloud at joseph then suddenly closing the casement as the bird in a cuckooclock peeps out of its window then disappears again and closes the shutter behind it iii now was the winter gone and the snow and robin the redbreast boasted on bush and tree it was he it was he and no other that had covered with leaves the babes in the wood and blithely all the birds sang with him and little cared for his boasting or for his babes in the wood or the cruel uncle and only sang for the mates they had chosen and cared for the nests they were building with them but more sedately and meekly elizabeth haddon sang in her inmost heart but her lips were silent and songless thus came the lovely spring with a rush of blossoms and music flooding the earth with flowers and the air with melodies vernal then it came to pass one pleasant morning that slowly up the road there came a cavalcade as of pilgrims men and women wending their way to the quarterly meeting in the neighboring town and with them came riding john estaugh at elizabeths door they stopped to rest and alighting tasted the currant wine and the bread of rye and the honey brought from the hives that stood by the sunny wall of the garden then remounted their horses refreshed and continued their journey and elizabeth with them and joseph and hannah the housemaid but as they started elizabeth lingered a little and leaning over her horses neck in a whisper said to john estaugh tarry awhile behind for i have something to tell thee not to be spoken lightly nor in the presence of others them it concerneth not only thee and me it concerneth and they rode slowly along through the woods conversing together it was a pleasure to breathe the fragrant air of the forest it was a pleasure to live on that bright and happy may morning then elizabeth said though still with a certain reluctance as if impelled to reveal a secret she fain would have guarded i will no longer conceal what is laid upon me to tell thee i have received from the lord a charge to love thee john estaugh and john estaugh made answer surprised by the words she had spoken pleasant to me are thy converse thy ways thy meekness of spirit pleasant thy frankness of speech and thy souls immaculate whiteness love without dissimulation a holy and inward adorning but i have yet no light to lead me no voice to direct me when the lords work is done and the toil and the labor completed he hath appointed to me i will gather into the stillness of my own heart awhile and listen and wait for his guidance then elizabeth said not troubled nor wounded in spirit so is it best john estaugh we will not speak of it further it hath been laid upon me to tell thee this for tomorrow thou art going away across the sea and i know not when i shall see thee more but if the lord hath decreed it thou wilt return again to seek me here and to find me and they rode onward in silence and entered the town with the others iv ships that pass in the night and speak each other in passing only a signal shown and a distant voice in the darkness so on the ocean of life we pass and speak one another only a look and a voice then darkness again and a silence now went on as of old the quiet life of the homestead patient and unrepining elizabeth labored in all things mindful not of herself but bearing the burdens of others always thoughtful and kind and untroubled and hannah the housemaid diligent early and late and rosy with washing and scouring still as of old disparaged the eminent merits of joseph and was at times reproved for her light and frothy behavior for her shy looks and her careless words and her evil surmisings being pressed down somewhat like a cart with sheaves overladen as she would sometimes say to joseph quoting the scriptures meanwhile john estaugh departed across the sea and departing carried hid in his heart a secret sacred and precious filling its chambers with fragrance and seeming to him in its sweetness marys ointment of spikenard that filled all the house with its odor o lost days of delight that are wasted in doubting and waiting o lost hours and days in which we might have been happy but the light shone at last and guided his wavering footsteps and at last came the voice imperative questionless certain then john estaugh came back oer the sea for the gift that was offered better than houses and lands the gift of a womans affection and on the firstday that followed he rose in the silent assembly holding in his strong hand a hand that trembled a little promising to be kind and true and faithful in all things such were the marriagerites of john and elizabeth estaugh and not otherwise joseph the honest the diligent servant sped in his bashful wooing with homely hannah the housemaid for when he asked her the question she answered nay and then added but thee may make believe and see what will come of it joseph interlude a pleasant and a winsome tale the student said though somewhat pale and quiet in its coloring as if it caught its tone and air from the gray suits that quakers wear yet worthy of some german bard hebel or voss or eberhard who love of humble themes to sing in humble verse but no more true than was the tale i told to you the theologian made reply and with some warmth that i deny t is no invention of my own but something well and widely known to readers of a riper age writ by the skilful hand that wrote the indian tale of hobomok and philotheas classic page i found it like a waif afloat or dulse uprooted from its rock on the swift tides that ebb and flow in daily papers and at flood bear freighted vessels to and fro but later when the ebb is low leave a long waste of sand and mud it matters little quoth the jew the cloak of truth is lined with lies sayeth some proverb old and wise and love is master of all arts and puts it into human hearts the strangest things to say and do and here the controversy closed abruptly ere t was well begun for the sicilian interposed with lordlings listen every one that listen may unto a tale that s merrier than the nightingale a tale that cannot boast forsooth a single rag or shred of truth that does not leave the mind in doubt as to the with it or without a naked falsehood and absurd as mortal ever told or heard therefore i tell it or maybe simply because it pleases me the sicilians tale the monk of casalmaggiore once on a time some centuries ago in the hot sunshine two franciscan friars wended their weary way with footsteps slow back to their convent whose white walls and spires gleamed on the hillside like a patch of snow covered with dust they were and torn by briers and bore like sumptermules upon their backs the badge of poverty their beggars sacks the first was brother anthony a spare and silent man with pallid cheeks and thin much given to vigils penance fasting prayer solemn and gray and worn with discipline as if his body but white ashes were heaped on the living coals that glowed within a simple monk like many of his day whose instinct was to listen and obey a different man was brother timothy of larger mould and of a coarser paste a rubicund and stalwart monk was he broad in the shoulders broader in the waist who often filled the dull refectory with noise by which the convent was disgraced but to the massbook gave but little heed by reason he had never learned to read now as they passed the outskirts of a wood they saw with mingled pleasure and surprise fast tethered to a tree an ass that stood lazily winking his large limpid eyes the farmer gilbert of that neighborhood his owner was who looking for supplies of fagots deeper in the wood had strayed leaving his beast to ponder in the shade as soon as brother timothy espied the patient animal he said goodlack thus for our needs doth providence provide well lay our wallets on the creatures back this being done he leisurely untied from head and neck the halter of the jack and put it round his own and to the tree stood tethered fast as if the ass were he and bursting forth into a merry laugh he cried to brother anthony away and drive the ass before you with your staff and when you reach the convent you may say you left me at a farm half tired and half ill with a fever for a night and day and that the farmer lent this ass to bear our wallets that are heavy with good fare now brother anthony who knew the pranks of brother timothy would not persuade or reason with him on his quirks and cranks but being obedient silently obeyed and smiting with his staff the asss flanks drove him before him over hill and glade safe with his provend to the convent gate leaving poor brother timothy to his fate then gilbert laden with fagots for his fire forth issued from the wood and stood aghast to see the ponderous body of the friar standing where he had left his donkey last trembling he stood and dared not venture nigher but stared and gaped and crossed himself full fast for being credulous and of little wit he thought it was some demon from the pit while speechless and bewildered thus he gazed and dropped his load of fagots on the ground quoth brother timothy be not amazed that where you left a donkey should be found a poor franciscan friar halfstarved and crazed standing demure and with a halter bound but set me free and hear the piteous story of brother timothy of casalmaggiore i am a sinful man although you see i wear the consecrated cowl and cape you never owned an ass but you owned me changed and transformed from my own natural shape all for the deadly sin of gluttony from which i could not otherwise escape than by this penance dieting on grass and being worked and beaten as an ass think of the ignominy i endured think of the miserable life i led the toil and blows to which i was inured my wretched lodging in a windy shed my scanty fare so grudgingly procured the damp and musty straw that formed my bed but having done this penance for my sins my life as man and monk again begins the simple gilbert hearing words like these was consciencestricken and fell down apace before the friar upon his bended knees and with a suppliant voice implored his grace and the good monk now very much at ease granted him pardon with a smiling face nor could refuse to be that night his guest it being late and he in need of rest upon a hillside where the olive thrives with figures painted on its whitewashed walls the cottage stood and near the humming hives made murmurs as of faroff waterfalls a place where those who love secluded lives might live content and free from noise and brawls like claudians old man of verona here measure by fruits the slowrevolving year and coming to this cottage of content they found his children and the buxom wench his wife dame cicely and his father bent with years and labor seated on a bench repeating over some obscure event in the old wars of milanese and french all welcomed the franciscan with a sense of sacred awe and humble reverence when gilbert told them what had come to pass how beyond question cavil or surmise good brother timothy had been their ass you should have seen the wonder in their eyes you should have heard them cry alas alas have heard their lamentations and their sighs for all believed the story and began to see a saint in this afflicted man forthwith there was prepared a grand repast to satisfy the craving of the friar after so rigid and prolonged a fast the bustling housewife stirred the kitchen fire then her two barnyard fowls her best and last were put to death at her express desire and served up with a salad in a bowl and flasks of country wine to crown the whole it would not be believed should i repeat how hungry brother timothy appeared it was a pleasure but to see him eat his white teeth flashing through his russet beard his face aglow and flushed with wine and meat his roguish eyes that rolled and laughed and leered lord how he drank the bloodred country wine as if the village vintage were divine and all the while he talked without surcease and told his merry tales with jovial glee that never flagged but rather did increase and laughed aloud as if insane were he and wagged his red beard matted like a fleece and cast such glances at dame cicely that gilbert now grew angry with his guest and thus in words his rising wrath expressed good father said he easily we see how needful in some persons and how right mortification of the flesh may be the indulgence you have given it tonight after long penance clearly proves to me your strength against temptation is but slight and shows the dreadful peril you are in of a relapse into your deadly sin tomorrow morning with the rising sun go back unto your convent nor refrain from fasting and from scourging for you run great danger to become an ass again since monkish flesh and asinine are one therefore be wise nor longer here remain unless you wish the scourge should be applied by other hands that will not spare your hide when this the monk had heard his color fled and then returned like lightning in the air till he was all one blush from foot to head and even the bald spot in his russet hair turned from its usual pallor to bright red the old man was asleep upon his chair then all retired and sank into the deep and helpless imbecility of sleep they slept until the dawn of day drew near till the cock should have crowed but did not crow for they had slain the shining chanticleer and eaten him for supper as you know the monk was up betimes and of good cheer and having breakfasted made haste to go as if he heard the distant matin bell and had but little time to say farewell fresh was the morning as the breath of kine odors of herbs commingled with the sweet balsamic exhalations of the pine a haze was in the air presaging heat uprose the sun above the apennine and all the misty valleys at its feet were full of the delirious song of birds voices of men and bells and low of herds all this to brother timothy was naught he did not care for scenery nor here his busy fancy found the thing it sought but when he saw the convent walls appear and smoke from kitchen chimneys upward caught and whirled aloft into the atmosphere he quickened his slow footsteps like a beast that scents the stable a league off at least and as he entered though the convent gate he saw there in the court the ass who stood twirling his ears about and seemed to wait just as he found him waiting in the wood and told the prior that to alleviate the daily labors of the brotherhood the owner being a man of means and thrift bestowed him on the convent as a gift and thereupon the prior for many days revolved this serious matter in his mind and turned it over many different ways hoping that some safe issue he might find but stood in fear of what the world would say if he accepted presents of this kind employing beasts of burden for the packs that lazy monks should carry on their backs then to avoid all scandal of the sort and stop the mouth of cavil he decreed that he would cut the tedious matter short and sell the ass with all convenient speed thus saving the expense of his support and hoarding something for a time of need so he despatched him to the neighboring fair and freed himself from cumber and from care it happened now by chance as some might say others perhaps would call it destiny gilbert was at the fair and heard a bray and nearer came and saw that it was he and whispered in his ear ah lackaday good father the rebellious flesh i see has changed you back into an ass again and all my admonitions were in vain the ass who felt this breathing in his ear did not turn round to look but shook his head as if he were not pleased these words to hear and contradicted all that had been said and this made gilbert cry in voice more clear i know you well your hair is russetred do not deny it for you are the same franciscan friar and timothy by name the ass though now the secret had come out was obstinate and shook his head again until a crowd was gathered round about to hear this dialogue between the twain and raised their voices in a noisy shout when gilbert tried to make the matter plain and flouted him and mocked him all day long with laughter and with jibes and scraps of song if this be brother timothy they cried buy him and feed him on the tenderest grass thou canst not do too much for one so tried as to be twice transformed into an ass so simple gilbert bought him and untied his halter and oer mountain and morass he led him homeward talking as he went of good behavior and a mind content the children saw them coming and advanced shouting with joy and hung about his neck not gilberts but the asss round him danced and wove green garlands wherewithal to deck his sacred person for again it chanced their childish feelings without rein or check could not discriminate in any way a donkey from a friar of orders gray o brother timothy the children said you have come back to us just as before we were afraid and thought that you were dead and we should never see you any more and then they kissed the white star on his head that like a birthmark or a badge he wore and patted him upon the neck and face and said a thousand things with childish grace thenceforward and forever he was known as brother timothy and led alway a life of luxury till he had grown ungrateful being stuffed with corn and hay and very vicious then in angry tone rousing himself poor gilbert said one day when simple kindness is misunderstood a little flagellation may do good his many vices need not here be told among them was a habit that he had of flinging up his heels at young and old breaking his halter running off like mad oer pasturelands and meadow wood and wold and other misdemeanors quite as bad but worst of all was breaking from his shed at night and ravaging the cabbagebed so brother timothy went back once more to his old life of labor and distress was beaten worse than he had been before and now instead of comfort and caress came labors manifold and trials sore and as his toils increased his food grew less until at last the great consoler death ended his many sufferings with his breath great was the lamentation when he died and mainly that he died impenitent dame cicely bewailed the children cried the old man still remembered the event in the french war and gilbert magnified his many virtues as he came and went and said heaven pardon brother timothy and keep us from the sin of gluttony interlude signor luigi said the jew when the sicilians tale was told the werewolf is a legend old but the wereass is something new and yet for one i think it true the days of wonder have not ceased if there are beasts in forms of men as sure it happens now and then why may not man become a beast in way of punishment at least but this i will not now discuss i leave the theme that we may thus remain within the realm of song the story that i told before though not acceptable to all at least you did not find too long i beg you let me try again with something in a different vein before you bid the curtain fall meanwhile keep watch upon the door nor let the landlord leave his chair lest he should vanish into air and thus elude our search once more thus saying from his lips he blew a little cloud of perfumed breath and then as if it were a clew to lead his footsteps safely through began his tale as followeth the spanish jews second tale scanderbeg the battle is fought and won by king ladislaus the hun in fire of hell and deaths frost on the day of pentecost and in rout before his path from the field of battle red flee all that are not dead of the army of amurath in the darkness of the night iskander the pride and boast of that mighty othman host with his routed turks takes flight from the battle fought and lost on the day of pentecost leaving behind him dead the army of amurath the vanguard as it led the rearguard as it fled mown down in the bloody swath of the battles aftermath but he cared not for hospodars nor for baron or voivode as on through the night he rode and gazed at the fateful stars that were shining overhead but smote his steed with his staff and smiled to himself and said this is the time to laugh in the middle of the night in a halt of the hurrying flight there came a scribe of the king wearing his signet ring and said in a voice severe this is the first dark blot on thy name george castriot alas why art thou here and the army of amurath slain and left on the battle plain and iskander answered and said they lie on the bloody sod by the hoofs of horses trod but this was the decree of the watchers overhead for the war belongeth to god and in battle who are we who are we that shall withstand the wind of his lifted hand then he bade them bind with chains this man of books and brains and the scribe said what misdeed have i done that without need thou doest to me this thing and iskander answering said unto him not one misdeed to me hast thou done but for fear that thou shouldst run and hide thyself from me have i done this unto thee now write me a writing o scribe and a blessing be on thy tribe a writing sealed with thy ring to king amuraths pasha in the city of croia the city moated and walled that he surrender the same in the name of my master the king for what is writ in his name can never be recalled and the scribe bowed low in dread and unto iskander said allah is great and just but we are as ashes and dust how shall i do this thing when i know that my guilty head will be forfeit to the king then swift as a shooting star the curved and shining blade of iskanders scimetar from its sheath with jewels bright shot as he thundered write and the trembling scribe obeyed and wrote in the fitful glare of the bivouac fire apart with the chill of the midnight air on his forehead white and bare and the chill of death in his heart then again iskander cried now follow whither i ride for here thou must not stay thou shalt be as my dearest friend and honors without end shall surround thee on every side and attend thee night and day but the sullen scribe replied our pathways here divide mine leadeth not thy way and even as he spoke fell a sudden scimetarstroke when no one else was near and the scribe sank to the ground as a stone pushed from the brink of a black pool might sink with a sob and disappear and no one saw the deed and in the stillness around no sound was heard but the sound of the hoofs of iskanders steed as forward he sprang with a bound then onward he rode and afar with scarce three hundred men through river and forest and fen oer the mountains of argentar and his heart was merry within when he crossed the river drin and saw in the gleam of the morn the white castle akhissar the city croia called the city moated and walled the city where he was born and above it the morning star then his trumpeters in the van on their silver bugles blew and in crowds about him ran albanian and turkoman that the sound together drew and he feasted with his friends and when they were warm with wine he said o friends of mine behold what fortune sends and what the fates design king amurath commands that my fathers wide domain this city and all its lands shall be given to me again then to the castle white he rode in regal state and entered in at the gate in all his arms bedight and gave to the pasha who ruled in croia the writing of the king sealed with his signet ring and the pasha bowed his head and after a silence said allah is just and great i yield to the will divine the city and lands are thine who shall contend with fate anon from the castle walls the crescent banner falls and the crowd beholds instead like a portent in the sky iskanders banner fly the black eagle with double head and a shout ascends on high for mens souls are tired of the turks and their wicked ways and works that have made of akhissar a city of the plague and the loud exultant cry that echoes wide and far is long live scanderbeg it was thus iskander came once more unto his own and the tidings like the flame of a conflagration blown by the winds of summer ran till the land was in a blaze and the cities far and near sayeth ben joshua ben meir in his book of the words of the days were taken as a man would take the tip of his ear interlude now that is after my own heart the poet cried one understands your swarthy hero scanderbeg gauntlet on hand and boot on leg and skilled in every warlike art riding through his albanian lands and following the auspicious star that shone for him oer akhissar the theologian added here his word of praise not less sincere although he ended with a jibe the hero of romance and song was born he said to right the wrong and i approve but all the same that bit of treason with the scribe adds nothing to your heros fame the student praised the good old times and liked the canter of the rhymes that had a hoofbeat in their sound but longed some further word to hear of the old chronicler ben meir and where his volume might he found the tall musician walked the room with folded arms and gleaming eyes as if he saw the vikings rise gigantic shadows in the gloom and much he talked of their emprise and meteors seen in northern skies and heimdals horn and day of doom but the sicilian laughed again this is the time to laugh he said for the whole story he well knew was an invention of the jew spun from the cobwebs in his brain and of the same bright scarlet thread as was the tale of kambalu only the landlord spake no word t was doubtful whether he had heard the tale at all so full of care was he of his impending fate that like the sword of damocles above his head hung blank and bare suspended by a single hair so that he could not sit at ease but sighed and looked disconsolate and shifted restless in his chair revolving how he might evade the blow of the descending blade the student came to his relief by saying in his easy way to the musician calm your grief my fair apollo of the north balder the beautiful and so forth although your magic lyre or lute with broken strings is lying mute still you can tell some doleful tale of shipwreck in a midnight gale or something of the kind to suit the mood that we are in tonight for what is marvellous and strange so give your nimble fancy range and we will follow in its flight but the musician shook his head no tale i tell tonight he said while my poor instrument lies there even as a child with vacant stare lies in its little coffin dead yet being urged he said at last there comes to me out of the past a voice whose tones are sweet and wild singing a song almost divine and with a tear in every line an ancient ballad that my nurse sang to me when i was a child in accents tender as the verse and sometimes wept and sometimes smiled while singing it to see arise the look of wonder in my eyes and feel my heart with tenor beat this simple ballad i retain clearly imprinted on my brain and as a tale will now repeat the musicians tale the mothers ghost svend dyring he rideth adown the glade i myself was young there he hath wooed him so winsome a maid fair words gladden so many a heart together were they for seven years and together children six were theirs then came death abroad through the land and blighted the beautiful lilywand svend dyring he rideth adown the glade and again hath he wooed him another maid he hath wooed him a maid and brought home a bride but she was bitter and full of pride when she came driving into the yard there stood the six children weeping so hard there stood the small children with sorrowful heart from before her feet she thrust them apart she gave to them neither ale nor bread ye shall suffer hunger and hate she said she took from them their quilts of blue and said ye shall lie on the straw we strew she took from them the great waxlight now ye shall lie in the dark at night in the evening late they cried with cold the mother heard it under the mould the woman heard it the earth below to my little children i must go she standeth before the lord of all and may i go to my children small she prayed him so long and would not cease until he bade her depart in peace at cockcrow thou shalt return again longer thou shalt not there remain she girded up her sorrowful bones and rifted the walls and the marble stones as through the village she flitted by the watchdogs howled aloud to the sky when she came to the castle gate there stood her eldest daughter in wait why standest thou here dear daughter mine how fares it with brothers and sisters thine never art thou mother of mine for my mother was both fair and fine my mother was white with cheeks of red but thou art pale and like to the dead how should i be fair and fine i have been dead pale cheeks are mine how should i be white and red so long so long have i been dead when she came in at the chamber door there stood the small children weeping sore one she braided another she brushed the third she lifted the fourth she hushed the fifth she took on her lap and pressed as if she would suckle it at her breast then to her eldest daughter said she do thou bid svend dyring come hither to me into the chamber when he came she spake to him in anger and shame i left behind me both ale and bread my children hunger and are not fed i left behind me quilts of blue my children lie on the straw ye strew i left behind me the great waxlight my children lie in the dark at night if i come again unto your hall as cruel a fate shall you befall now crows the cock with feathers red back to the earth must all the dead now crows the cock with feathers swart the gates of heaven fly wide apart now crows the cock with feathers white i can abide no longer tonight whenever they heard the watchdogs wail they gave the children bread and ale whenever they heard the watchdogs bay they feared lest the dead were on their way whenever they heard the watchdogs bark i myself was young they feared the dead out there in the dark fair words gladden so many a heart interlude touched by the pathos of these rhymes the theologian said all praise be to the ballads of old times and to the bards of simple ways who walked with nature hand in hand whose country was their holy land whose singing robes were homespun brown from looms of their own native town which they were not ashamed to wear and not of silk or sendal gay nor decked with fanciful array of cockleshells from outremer to whom the student answered yes all praise and honor i confess that bread and ale homebaked homebrewed are wholesome and nutritious food but not enough for all our needs poets the best of them are birds of passage where their instinct leads they range abroad for thoughts and words and from all climes bring home the seeds that germinate in flowers or weeds they are not fowls in barnyards born to cackle oer a grain of corn and if you shut the horizon down to the small limits of their town what do you but degrade your bard till he at last becomes as one who thinks the allencircling sun rises and sets in his back yard the theologian said again it may be so yet i maintain that what is native still is best and little care i for the rest t is a long story time would fail to tell it and the hour is late we will not waste it in debate but listen to our landlords tale and thus the sword of damocles descending not by slow degrees but suddenly on the landlord fell who blushing and with much demur and many vain apologies plucking up heart began to tell the rhyme of one sir christopher the landlords tale the rhyme of sir christopher it was sir christopher gardiner knight of the holy sepulchre from merry england over the sea who stepped upon this continent as if his august presence lent a glory to the colony you should have seen him in the street of the little boston of winthrops time his rapier dangling at his feet doublet and hose and boots complete prince rupert hat with ostrich plume gloves that exhaled a faint perfume luxuriant curls and air sublime and superior manners now obsolete he had a way of saying things that made one think of courts and kings and lords and ladies of high degree so that not having been at court seemed something very little short of treason or lesemajesty such an accomplished knight was he his dwelling was just beyond the town at what he called his countryseat for careless of fortunes smile or frown and weary grown of the world and its ways he wished to pass the rest of his days in a private life and a calm retreat but a double life was the life he led and while professing to be in search of a godly course and willing he said nay anxious to join the puritan church he made of all this but small account and passed his idle hours instead with roystering morton of merry mount that pettifogger from furnivals inn lord of misrule and riot and sin who looked on the wine when it was red this countryseat was little more than a cabin of logs but in front of the door a modest flowerbed thickly sown with sweet alyssum and columbine made those who saw it at once divine the touch of some other hand than his own and first it was whispered and then it was known that he in secret was harboring there a little lady with golden hair whom he called his cousin but whom he had wed in the italian manner as men said and great was the scandal everywhere but worse than this was the vague surmise though none could vouch for it or aver that the knight of the holy sepulchre was only a papist in disguise and the more to imbitter their bitter lives and the more to trouble the public mind came letters from england from two other wives whom he had carelessly left behind both of them letters of such a kind as made the governor hold his breath the one imploring him straight to send the husband home that he might amend the other asking his instant death as the only way to make an end the wary governor deemed it right when all this wickedness was revealed to send his warrant signed and sealed and take the body of the knight armed with this mighty instrument the marshal mounting his gallant steed rode forth from town at the top of his speed and followed by all his bailiffs bold as if on high achievement bent to storm some castle or stronghold challenge the warders on the wall and seize in his ancestral hall a robberbaron grim and old but when though all the dust and heat he came to sir christophers countryseat no knight he found nor warder there but the little lady with golden hair who was gathering in the bright sunshine the sweet alyssum and columbine while gallant sir christopher all so gay being forewarned through the postern gate of his castle wall had tripped away and was keeping a little holiday in the forests that bounded his estate then as a trusty squire and true the marshal searched the castle through not crediting what the lady said searched from cellar to garret in vain and finding no knight came out again and arrested the golden damsel instead and bore her in triumph into the town while from her eyes the tears rolled down on the sweet alyssum and columbine that she held in her fingers white and fine the governors heart was moved to see so fair a creature caught within the snares of satan and of sin and he read her a little homily on the folly and wickedness of the lives of women half cousins and half wives but seeing that naught his words availed he sent her away in a ship that sailed for merry england over the sea to the other two wives in the old countree to search her further since he had failed to come at the heart of the mystery meanwhile sir christopher wandered away through pathless woods for a month and a day shooting pigeons and sleeping at night with the noble savage who took delight in his feathered hat and his velvet vest his gun and his rapier and the rest but as soon as the noble savage heard that a bounty was offered for this gay bird he wanted to slay him out of hand and bring in his beautiful scalp for a show like the glossy head of a kite or crow until he was made to understand they wanted the bird alive not dead then he followed him whithersoever he fled through forest and field and hunted him down and brought him prisoner into the town alas it was a rueful sight to see this melancholy knight in such a dismal and hapless case his hat deformed by stain and dent his plumage broken his doublet rent his beard and flowing locks forlorn matted dishevelled and unshorn his boots with dust and mire besprent but dignified in his disgrace and wearing an unblushing face and thus before the magistrate he stood to hear the doom of fate in vain he strove with wonted ease to modify and extenuate his evil deeds in church and state for gone was now his power to please and his pompous words had no more weight than feathers flying in the breeze with suavity equal to his own the governor lent a patient ear to the speech evasive and highflown in which he endeavored to make clear that colonial laws were too severe when applied to a gallant cavalier a gentleman born and so well known and accustomed to move in a higher sphere all this the puritan governor heard and deigned in answer never a word but in summary manner shipped away in a vessel that sailed from salem bay this splendid and famous cavalier with his rupert hat and his popery to merry england over the sea as being unmeet to inhabit here thus endeth the rhyme of sir christopher knight of the holy sepulchre the first who furnished this barren land with apples of sodom and ropes of sand finale these are the tales those merry guests told to each other well or ill like summer birds that lift their crests above the borders of their nests and twitter and again are still these are the tales or new or old in idle moments idly told flowers of the field with petals thin lilies that neither toil nor spin and tufts of wayside weeds and gorse hung in the parlor of the inn beneath the sign of the red horse and still reluctant to retire the friends sat talking by the fire and watched the smouldering embers burn to ashes and flash up again into a momentary glow lingering like them when forced to go and going when they would remain for on the morrow they must turn their faces homeward and the pain of parting touched with its unrest a tender nerve in every breast but sleep at last the victory won they must be stirring with the sun and drowsily good night they said and went still gossiping to bed and left the parlor wrapped in gloom the only live thing in the room was the old clock that in its pace kept time with the revolving spheres and constellations in their flight and struck with its uplifted mace the dark unconscious hours of night to senseless and unlistening ears uprose the sun and every guest uprisen was soon equipped and dressed for journeying home and cityward the old stagecoach was at the door with horses harnessed long before the sunshine reached the withered sward beneath the oaks whose branches hoar murmured farewell forevermore farewell the portly landlord cried farewell the parting guests replied but little thought that nevermore their feet would pass that threshold oer that nevermore together there would they assemble free from care to hear the oaks mysterious roar and breathe the wholesome country air where are they now what lands and skies paint pictures in their friendly eyes what hope deludes what promise cheers what pleasant voices fill their ears two are beyond the salt sea waves and three already in their graves perchance the living still may look into the pages of this book and see the days of long ago floating and fleeting to and fro as in the wellremembered brook they saw the inverted landscape gleam and their own faces like a dream look up upon them from below flowerdeluce flowerdeluce beautiful lily dwelling by still rivers or solitary mere or where the sluggish meadowbrook delivers its waters to the weir thou laughest at the mill the whir and worry of spindle and of loom and the great wheel that toils amid the hurry and rushing of the flame born in the purple born to joy and pleasance thou dost not toil nor spin but makest glad and radiant with thy presence the meadow and the lin the wind blows and uplifts thy drooping banner and round thee throng and run the rushes the green yeomen of thy manor the outlaws of the sun the burnished dragonfly is thine attendant and tilts against the field and down the listed sunbeam rides resplendent with steelblue mail and shield thou art the iris fair among the fairest who armed with golden rod and winged with the celestial azure bearest the message of some god thou art the muse who far from crowded cities hauntest the sylvan streams playing on pipes of reed the artless ditties that come to us as dreams o flowerdeluce bloom on and let the river linger to kiss thy feet o flower of song bloom on and make forever the world more fair and sweet palingenesis i lay upon the headlandheight and listened to the incessant sobbing of the sea in caverns under me and watched the waves that tossed and fled and glistened until the rolling meadows of amethyst melted away in mist then suddenly as one from sleep i started for round about me all the sunny capes seemed peopled with the shapes of those whom i had known in days departed apparelled in the loveliness which gleams on faces seen in dreams a moment only and the light and glory faded away and the disconsolate shore stood lonely as before and the wildroses of the promontory around me shuddered in the wind and shed their petals of pale red there was an old belief that in the embers of all things their primordial form exists and cunning alchemists could recreate the rose with all its members from its own ashes but without the bloom without the lost perfume ah me what wonderworking occult science can from the ashes in our hearts once more the rose of youth restore what craft of alchemy can bid defiance to time and change and for a single hour renew this phantomflower o give me back i cried the vanished splendors the breath of morn and the exultant strife when the swift stream of life bounds oer its rocky channel and surrenders the pond with all its lilies for the leap into the unknown deep and the sea answered with a lamentation like some old prophet wailing and it said alas thy youth is dead it breathes no more its heart has no pulsation in the dark places with the dead of old it lies forever cold then said i from its consecrated cerements i will not drag this sacred dust again only to give me pain but still remembering all the lost endearments go on my way like one who looks before and turns to weep no more into what land of harvests what plantations bright with autumnal foliage and the glow of sunsets burning low beneath what midnight skies whose constellations light up the spacious avenues between this world and the unseen amid what friendly greetings and caresses what households though not alien yet not mine what bowers of rest divine to what temptations in lone wildernesses what famine of the heart what pain and loss the bearing of what cross i do not know nor will i vainly question those pages of the mystic book which hold the story still untold but without rash conjecture or suggestion turn its last leaves in reverence and good heed until the end i read the bridge of cloud burn o evening hearth and waken pleasant visions as of old though the house by winds be shaken safe i keep this room of gold ah no longer wizard fancy builds her castles in the air luring me by necromancy up the neverending stair but instead she builds me bridges over many a dark ravine where beneath the gusty ridges cataracts dash and roar unseen and i cross them little heeding blast of wind or torrents roar as i follow the receding footsteps that have gone before naught avails the imploring gesture naught avails the cry of pain when i touch the flying vesture t is the gray robe of the rain baffled i return and leaning oer the parapets of cloud watch the mist that intervening wraps the valley in its shroud and the sounds of life ascending faintly vaguely meet the ear murmur of bells and voices blending with the rush of waters near well i know what there lies hidden every tower and town and farm and again the land forbidden reassumes its vanished charm well i know the secret places and the nests in hedge and tree at what doors are friendly faces in what hearts are thoughts of me through the mist and darkness sinking blown by wind and beaten by shower down i fling the thought im thinking down i toss this alpine flower hawthorne may how beautiful it was that one bright day in the long week of rain though all its splendor could not chase away the omnipresent pain the lovely town was white with appleblooms and the great elms oerhead dark shadows wove on their aerial looms shot through with golden thread across the meadows by the gray old manse the historic river flowed i was as one who wanders in a trance unconscious of his road the faces of familiar friends seemed strange their voices i could hear and yet the words they uttered seemed to change their meaning to my ear for the one face i looked for was not there the one low voice was mute only an unseen presence filled the air and baffled my pursuit now i look back and meadow manse and stream dimly my thought defines i only see a dream within a dream the hilltop hearsed with pines i only hear above his place of rest their tender undertone the infinite longings of a troubled breast the voice so like his own there in seclusion and remote from men the wizard hand lies cold which at its topmost speed let fall the pen and left the tale half told ah who shall lift that wand of magic power and the lost clew regain the unfinished window in aladdins tower unfinished must remain christmas bells i heard the bells on christmas day their old familiar carols play and wild and sweet the words repeat of peace on earth goodwill to men and thought how as the day had come the belfries of all christendom had rolled along the unbroken song of peace on earth goodwill to men till ringing singing on its way the world revolved from night to day a voice a chime a chant sublime of peace on earth goodwill to men then from each black accursed mouth the cannon thundered in the south and with the sound the carols drowned of peace on earth goodwill to men it was as if an earthquake rent the hearthstones of a continent and made forlorn the households born of peace on earth goodwill to men and in despair i bowed my head there is no peace on earth i said for hate is strong and mocks the song of peace on earth goodwill to men then pealed the bells more loud and deep god is not dead nor doth he sleep the wrong shall fail the right prevail with peace on earth goodwill to men the wind over the chimney see the fire is sinking low dusky red the embers glow while above them still i cower while a moment more i linger though the clock with lifted finger points beyond the midnight hour sings the blackened log a tune learned in some forgotten june from a schoolboy at his play when they both were young together heart of youth and summer weather making all their holiday and the nightwind rising hark how above there in the dark in the midnight and the snow ever wilder fiercer grander like the trumpets of iskander all the noisy chimneys blow every quivering tongue of flame seems to murmur some great name seems to say to me aspire but the nightwind answers hollow are the visions that you follow into darkness sinks your fire then the flicker of the blaze gleams on volumes of old days written by masters of the art loud through whose majestic pages rolls the melody of ages throb the harpstrings of the heart and again the tongues of flame start exulting and exclaim these are prophets bards and seers in the horoscope of nations like ascendant constellations they control the coming years but the nightwind cries despair those who walk with feet of air leave no longenduring marks at gods forges incandescent mighty hammers beat incessant these are but the flying sparks dust are all the hands that wrought books are sepulchres of thought the dead laurels of the dead rustle for a moment only like the withered leaves in lonely churchyards at some passing tread suddenly the flame sinks down sink the rumors of renown and alone the nightwind drear clamors louder wilder vaguer t is the brand of meleager dying on the hearthstone here and i answer though it be why should that discomfort me no endeavor is in vain its reward is in the doing and the rapture of pursuing is the prize the vanquished gain the bells of lynn heard at nahant o curfew of the setting sun o bells of lynn o requiem of the dying day o bells of lynn from the dark belfries of yon cloudcathedral wafted your sounds aerial seem to float o bells of lynn borne on the evening wind across the crimson twilight oer land and sea they rise and fall o bells of lynn the fisherman in his boat far out beyond the headland listens and leisurely rows ashore o bells of lynn over the shining sands the wandering cattle homeward follow each other at your call o bells of lynn the distant lighthouse hears and with his flaming signal answers you passing the watchword on o bells of lynn and down the darkening coast run the tumultuous surges and clap their hands and shout to you o bells of lynn till from the shuddering sea with your wild incantations ye summon up the spectral moon o bells of lynn and startled at the sight like the weird woman of endor ye cry aloud and then are still o bells of lynn killed at the ford he is dead the beautiful youth the heart of honor the tongue of truth he the life and light of us all whose voice was blithe as a buglecall whom all eyes followed with one consent the cheer of whose laugh and whose pleasant word hushed all murmurs of discontent only last night as we rode along down the dark of the mountain gap to visit the picketguard at the ford little dreaming of any mishap he was humming the words of some old song two red roses he had on his cap and another he bore at the point of his sword sudden and swift a whistling ball came out of a wood and the voice was still something i heard in the darkness fall and for a moment my blood grew chill i spake in a whisper as he who speaks in a room where some one is lying dead but he made no answer to what i said we lifted him up to his saddle again and through the mire and the mist and the rain carried him back to the silent camp and laid him as if asleep on his bed and i saw by the light of the surgeons lamp two white roses upon his cheeks and one just over his heart bloodred and i saw in a vision how far and fleet that fatal bullet went speeding forth till it reached a town in the distant north till it reached a house in a sunny street till it reached a heart that ceased to beat without a murmur without a cry and a bell was tolled in that faroff town for one who had passed from cross to crown and the neighbors wondered that she should die giottos tower how many lives made beautiful and sweet by selfdevotion and by selfrestraint whose pleasure is to run without complaint on unknown errands of the paraclete wanting the reverence of unshodden feet fail of the nimbus which the artists paint around the shining forehead of the saint and are in their completeness incomplete in the old tuscan town stands giottos tower the lily of florence blossoming in stone a vision a delight and a desire the builders perfect and centennial flower that in the night of ages bloomed alone but wanting still the glory of the spire tomorrow t is late at night and in the realm of sleep my little lambs are folded like the flocks from room to room i hear the wakeful clocks challenge the passing hour like guards that keep their solitary watch on tower and steep far off i hear the crowing of the cocks and through the opening door that time unlocks feel the fresh breathing of tomorrow creep tomorrow the mysterious unknown guest who cries to me remember barmecide and tremble to be happy with the rest and i make answer i am satisfied i dare not ask i know not what is best god hath already said what shall betide divina commedia i oft have i seen at some cathedral door a laborer pausing in the dust and heat lay down his burden and with reverent feet enter and cross himself and on the floor kneel to repeat his paternoster oer far off the noises of the world retreat the loud vociferations of the street become an undistinguishable roar so as i enter here from day to day and leave my burden at this minster gate kneeling in prayer and not ashamed to pray the tumult of the time disconsolate to inarticulate murmurs dies away while the eternal ages watch and wait ii how strange the sculptures that adorn these towers this crowd of statues in whose folded sleeves birds build their nests while canopied with leaves parvis and portal bloom like trellised bowers and the vast minster seems a cross of flowers but fiends and dragons on the gargoyled eaves watch the dead christ between the living thieves and underneath the traitor judas lowers ah from what agonies of heart and brain what exultations trampling on despair what tenderness what tears what hate of wrong what passionate outcry of a soul in pain uprose this poem of the earth and air this medieval miracle of song iii i enter and i see thee in the gloom of the long aisles o poet saturnine and strive to make my steps keep pace with thine the air is filled with some unknown perfume the congregation of the dead make room for thee to pass the votive tapers shine like rooks that haunt ravennas groves of pine the hovering echoes fly from tomb to tomb from the confessionals i hear arise rehearsals of forgotten tragedies and lamentations from the crypts below and then a voice celestial that begins with the pathetic words although your sins as scarlet be and ends with as the snow iv with snowwhite veil and garments as of flame she stands before thee who so long ago filled thy young heart with passion and the woe from which thy song and all its splendors came and while with stern rebuke she speaks thy name the ice about thy heart melts as the snow on mountain height and in swift overflow comes gushing from thy lips in sobs of shame thou makest full confession and a gleam as of the dawn on some dark forest cast seems on thy lifted forehead to increase lethe and eunoe the remembered dream and the forgotten sorrow bring at last that perfect pardon which is perfect peace v i lift mine eyes and all the windows blaze with forms of saints and holy men who died here martyred and hereafter glorified and the great rose upon its leaves displays christs triumph and the angelic roundelays with splendor upon splendor multiplied and beatrice again at dantes side no more rebukes but smiles her words of praise and then the organ sounds and unseen choirs sing the old latin hymns of peace and love and benedictions of the holy ghost and the melodious bells among the spires oer all the housetops and through heaven above proclaim the elevation of the host vi o star of morning and of liberty o bringer of the light whose splendor shines above the darkness of the apennines forerunner of the day that is to be the voices of the city and the sea the voices of the mountains and the pines repeat thy song till the familiar lines are footpaths for the thought of italy thy fame is blown abroad from all the heights through all the nations and a sound is heard as of a mighty wind and men devout strangers of rome and the new proselytes in their own language hear thy wondrous word and many are amazed and many doubt noel envoye a m agassiz la veille de noel avec un panier de vins divers lacademie en

lonely fields and the throng of the crowded thoroughfare i approach and ye vanish away i grasp you and ye are gone but ever by nigh an day the melody soundeth on as the weary traveller sees in desert or prairie vast blue lakes overhung with trees that a pleasant shadow cast fair towns with turrets high and shining roofs of gold that vanish as he draws nigh like mists together rolled so i wander and wander along and forever before me gleams the shining city of song in the beautiful land of dreams but when i would enter the gate of that golden atmosphere it is gone and i wander and wait for the vision to reappear the haunted chamber each heart has its haunted chamber where the silent moonlight falls on the floor are mysterious footsteps there are whispers along the walls and mine at times is haunted by phantoms of the past as motionless as shadows by the silent moonlight cast a form sits by the window that is not seen by day for as soon as the dawn approaches it vanishes away it sits there in the moonlight itself as pale and still and points with its airy finger across the windowsill without before the window there stands a gloomy pine whose boughs wave upward and downward as wave these thoughts of mine and underneath its branches is the grave of a little child who died upon lifes threshold and never wept nor smiled what are ye o pallid phantoms that haunt my troubled brain that vanish when day approaches and at night return again what are ye o pallid phantoms but the statues without breath that stand on the bridge overarching the silent river of death the meeting after so long an absence at last we meet again does the meeting give us pleasure or does it give us pain the tree of life has been shaken and but few of us linger now like the prophets two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough we cordially greet each other in the old familiar tone and we think though we do not say it how old and gray he is grown we speak of a merry christmas and many a happy new year but each in his heart is thinking of those that are not here we speak of friends and their fortunes and of what they did and said till the dead alone seem living and the living alone seem dead and at last we hardly distinguish between the ghosts and the guests and a mist and shadow of sadness steals over our merriest jests vox populi when mazarvan the magician journeyed westward through cathay nothing heard he but the praises of badoura on his way but the lessening rumor ended when he came to khaledan there the folk were talking only of prince camaralzaman so it happens with the poets every province hath its own camaralzaman is famous where badoura is unknown the castlebuilder a gentle boy with soft and silken locks a dreamy boy with brown and tender eyes a castlebuilder with his wooden blocks and towers that touch imaginary skies a fearless rider on his fathers knee an eager listener unto stories told at the round table of the nursery of heroes and adventures manifold there will be other towers for thee to build there will be other steeds for thee to ride there will be other legends and all filled with greater marvels and more glorified build on and make thy castles high and fair rising and reaching upward to the skies listen to voices in the upper air nor lose thy simple faith in mysteries changed from the outskirts of the town where of old the milestone stood now a stranger looking down i behold the shadowy crown of the dark and haunted wood is it changed or am i changed ah the oaks are fresh and green but the friends with whom i ranged through their thickets are estranged by the years that intervene bright as ever flows the sea bright as ever shines the sun but alas they seem to me not the sun that used to be not the tides that used to run the challenge i have a vague remembrance of a story that is told in some ancient spanish legend or chronicle of old it was when brave king sanchez was before zamora slain and his great besieging army lay encamped upon the plain don diego de ordonez sallied forth in front of all and shouted loud his challenge to the warders on the wall all the people of zamora both the born and the unborn as traitors did he challenge with taunting words of scorn the living in their houses and in their graves the dead and the waters of their rivers and their wine and oil and bread there is a greater army that besets us round with strife a starving numberless army at all the gates of life the povertystricken millions who challenge our wine and bread and impeach us all as traitors both the living and the dead and whenever i sit at the banquet where the feast and song are high amid the mirth and the music i can hear that fearful cry and hollow and haggard faces look into the lighted hall and wasted hands are extended to catch the crumbs that fall for within there is light and plenty and odors fill the air but without there is cold and darkness and hunger and despair and there in the camp of famine in wind and cold and rain christ the great lord of the army lies dead upon the plain the brook and the wave the brooklet came from the mountain as sang the bard of old running with feet of silver over the sands of gold far away in the briny ocean there rolled a turbulent wave now singing along the seabeach now howling along the cave and the brooklet has found the billow though they flowed so far apart and has filled with its freshness and sweetness that turbulent bitter heart aftermath when the summer fields are mown when the birds are fledged and flown and the dry leaves strew the path with the falling of the snow with the cawing of the crow once again the fields we mow and gather in the aftermath not the sweet new grass with flowers is this harvesting of ours not the upland clover bloom but the rowen mired with weeds tangled tufts from marsh and meads where the poppy drops its seeds in the silence and the gloom the masque of pandora i the workshop of hephaestus hephaestus standing before the statue of pandora not fashioned out of gold like heras throne nor forged of iron like the thunderbolts of zeus omnipotent or other works wrought by my hands at lemnos or olympus but moulded in soft clay that unresisting yields itself to the touch this lovely form before me stands perfect in every part not aphrodites self appeared more fair when first upwafted by caressing winds she came to high olympus and the gods paid homage to her beauty thus her hair was cinctured thus her floating drapery was like a cloud about her and her face was radiant with the sunshine and the sea the voice of zeus is thy work done hephaestus hephaestus it is finished the voice not finished till i breathe the breath of life into her nostrils and she moves and speaks hephaestus will she become immortal like ourselves the voice the form that thou hast fashioned out of clay is of the earth and mortal but the spirit the life the exhalation of my breath is of diviner essence and immortal the gods shall shower on her their benefactions she shall possess all gifts the gift of song the gift of eloquence the gift of beauty the fascination and the nameless charm that shall lead all men captive hephaestus wherefore wherefore a wind shakes the house i hear the rushing of a mighty wind through all the halls and chambers of my house her parted lips inhale it and her bosom heaves with the inspiration as a reed beside a river in the rippling current bends to and fro she bows or lifts her head she gazes round about as if amazed she is alive she breathes but yet she speaks not pandora descends from the pedestal chorus of the graces aglaia in the workshop of hephaestus what is this i see have the gods to four increased us who were only three beautiful in form and feature lovely as the day can there be so fair a creature formed of common clay thalia o sweet pale face o lovely eyes of azure clear as the waters of a brook that run limpid and laughing in the summer sun o golden hair that like a misers treasure in its abundance overflows the measure o graceful form that cloudlike floatest on with the soft undulating gait of one who moveth as if motion were a pleasure by what name shall i call thee nymph or muse callirrhoe or urania some sweet name whose every syllable is a caress would best befit thee but i cannot choose nor do i care to choose for still the same nameless or named will be thy loveliness euphrosyne dowered with all celestial gifts skilled in every art that ennobles and uplifts and delights the heart fair on earth shall be thy fame as thy face is fair and pandora be the name thou henceforth shalt bear ii olympus hermes putting on his sandals much must he toil who serves the immortal gods and i who am their herald most of all no rest have i nor respite i no sooner unclasp the winged sandals from my feet than i again must clasp them and depart upon some foolish errand but today the errand is not foolish never yet with greater joy did i obey the summons that sends me earthward i will fly so swiftly that my caduceus in the whistling air shall make a sound like the pandaean pipes cheating the shepherds for today i go commissioned by highthundering zeus to lead a maiden to prometheus in his tower and by my cunning arguments persuade him to marry her what mischief lies concealed in this design i know not but i know who thinks of marrying hath already taken one step upon the road to penitence such embassies delight me forth i launch on the sustaining air nor fear to fall like icarus nor swerve aside like him who drove amiss hyperions fiery steeds i sink i fly the yielding element folds itself round about me like an arm and holds me as a mother holds her child iii tower of prometheus on mount caucasus prometheus i hear the trumpet of alectryon proclaim the dawn the stars begin to fade and all the heavens are full of prophecies and evil auguries bloodred last night i saw great kronos rise the crescent moon sank through the mist as if it were the scythe his parricidal hand had flung far down the western steeps o ye immortal gods what evil are ye plotting and contriving hermes and pandora at the threshold pandora i cannot cross the threshold an unseen and icy hand repels me these blank walls oppress me with their weight prometheus powerful ye are but not omnipotent ye cannot fight against necessity the fates control you as they do us and so far we are equals pandora motionless passionless companionless he sits there muttering in his beard his voice is like a river flowing underground hermes prometheus hail prometheus who calls me hermes it is i dost thou not know me prometheus by thy winged cap and winged heels i know thee thou art hermes captain of thieves hast thou again been stealing the heifers of admetus in the sweet meadows of asphodel or heras girdle or the earthshaking trident of poseidon hermes and thou prometheus say hast thou again been stealing fire from helios chariotwheels to light thy furnaces prometheus why comest thou hither so early in the dawn hermes the immortal gods know naught of late or early zeus himself the omnipotent hath sent me prometheus for what purpose hermes to bring this maiden to thee prometheus i mistrust the gods and all their gifts if they have sent her it is for no good purpose hermes what disaster could she bring on thy house who is a woman prometheus the gods are not my friends nor am i theirs whatever comes from them though in a shape as beautiful as this is evil only who art thou pandora one who though to thee unknown yet knoweth thee prometheus how shouldst thou know me woman pandora who knoweth not prometheus the humane prometheus prometheus the unfortunate to whom both gods and men have shown themselves ungrateful when every spark was quenched on every hearth throughout the earth i brought to man the fire and all its ministrations my reward hath been the rock and vulture hermes but the gods at last relent and pardon prometheus they relent not they pardon not they are implacable revengeful unforgiving hermes as a pledge of reconciliation they have sent to thee this divine being to be thy companion and bring into thy melancholy house the sunshine and the fragrance of her youth prometheus i need them not i have within myself all that my heart desires the ideal beauty which the creative faculty of mind fashions and follows in a thousand shapes more lovely than the real my own thoughts are my companions my designs and labors and aspirations are my only friends hermes decide not rashly the decision made can never be recalled the gods implore not plead not solicit not they only offer choice and occasion which once being passed return no more dost thou accept the gift prometheus no gift of theirs in whatsoever shape it comes to me with whatsoever charm to fascinate my sense will i receive leave me pandora let us go hence i will not stay hermes we leave thee to thy vacant dreams and all the silence and the solitude of thought the endless bitterness of unbelief the loneliness of existence without love chorus of the fates clotho how the titan the defiant the selfcentred selfreliant wrapped in visions and illusions robs himself of lifes best gifts till by all the stormwinds shaken by the blast of fate oertaken hopeless helpless and forsaken in the mists of his confusions to the reefs of doom he drifts lachesis sorely tried and sorely tempted from no agonies exempted in the penance of his trial and the discipline of pain often by illusions cheated often baffled and defeated in the tasks to be completed he by toil and selfdenial to the highest shall attain atropos tempt no more the noble schemer bear unto some idle dreamer this new toy and fascination this new dalliance and delight to the garden where reposes epimetheus crowned with roses to the door that never closes upon pleasure and temptation bring this vision of the night iv the air hermes returning to olympus as lonely as the tower that he inhabits as firm and cold as are the crags about him prometheus stands the thunderbolts of zeus alone can move him but the tender heart of epimetheus burning at white heat hammers and flames like all his brothers forges now as an arrow from hyperions bow my errand done i fly i float i soar into the air returning to olympus o joy of motion o delight to cleave the infinite realms of space the liquid ether through the warm sunshine and the cooling cloud myself as light as sunbeam or as cloud with one touch of my swift and winged feet i spurn the solid earth and leave it rocking as rocks the bough from which a bird takes wing v the house of epimetheus epimetheus beautiful apparition go not hence surely thou art a goddess for thy voice is a celestial melody and thy form selfpoised as if it floated on the air pandora no goddess am i nor of heavenly birth but a mere woman fashioned out of clay and mortal as the rest epimetheus thy face is fair there is a wonder in thine azure eyes that fascinates me thy whole presence seems a soft desire a breathing thought of love say would thy star like meropes grow dim if thou shouldst wed beneath thee pandora ask me not i cannot answer thee i only know the gods have sent me hither epimetheus i believe and thus believing am most fortunate it was not hermes led thee here but eros and swifter than his arrows were thine eves in wounding me there was no moments space between my seeing thee and loving thee o what a telltale face thou hast again i see the wonder in thy tender eyes pandora they do but answer to the love in thine yet secretly i wonder thou shouldst love me thou knowest me not epimetheus perhaps i know thee better than had i known thee longer yet it seems that i have always known thee and but now have found thee ah i have been waiting long pandora how beautiful is this house the atmosphere breathes rest and comfort and the many chambers seem full of welcomes epimetheus they not only seem but truly are this dwelling and its master belong to thee pandora here let me stay forever there is a spell upon me epimetheus thou thyself art the enchantress and i feel thy power envelop me and wrap my soul and sense in an elysian dream pandora o let me stay how beautiful are all things round about me multiplied by the mirrors on the walls what treasures hast thou here yon oaken chest carven with figures and embossed with gold is wonderful to look upon what choice and precious things dost thou keep hidden in it epimetheus i know not t is a mystery pandora hast thou never lifted the lid epimetheus the oracle forbids safely concealed there from all mortal eyes forever sleeps the secret of the gods seek not to know what they have hidden from thee till they themselves reveal it pandora as thou wilt epimetheus let us go forth from this mysterious place the garden walks are pleasant at this hour the nightingales among the sheltering boughs of populous and manynested trees shall teach me how to woo thee and shall tell me by what resistless charms or incantations they won their mates pandora thou dost not need a teacher they go out chorus of the eumenides what the immortals confide to thy keeping tell unto no man waking or sleeping closed be thy portals to friend as to foeman silence conceals it the word that is spoken betrays and reveals it by breath or by token the charm may be broken with shafts of their splendors the gods unforgiving pursue the offenders the dead and the living fortune forsakes them nor earth shall abide them nor tartarus hide them swift wrath overtakes them with useless endeavor forever forever is sisyphus rolling his stone up the mountain immersed in the fountain tantalus tastes not the water that wastes not through ages increasing the pangs that afflict him with motion unceasing the wheel of ixion shall torture its victim vi in the garden epimetheus yon snowwhite cloud that sails sublime in ether is but the sovereign zeus who like a swan flies to fairankled leda pandora or perchance ixions cloud the shadowy shape of hera that bore the centaurs epimetheus the divine and human chorus of birds gently swaying to and fro rocked by all the winds that blow bright with sunshine from above dark with shadow from below beak to beak and breast to breast in the cradle of their nest lie the fledglings of our love echo love love epimetheus hark listen hear how sweetly overhead the feathered fluteplayers pipe their songs of love and echo answers love and only love chorus of birds every flutter of the wing every note of song we sing every murmur every tone is of love and love alone echo love alone epimetheus who would not love if loving she might be changed like callisto to a star in heaven pandora ah who would love if loving she might be like semele consumed and burnt to ashes epimetheus whence knowest thou these stories pandora hermes taught me he told me all the history of the gods chorus of reeds evermore a sound shall be in the reeds of arcady evermore a low lament of unrest and discontent as the story is retold of the nymph so coy and cold who with frightened feet outran the pursuing steps of pan epimetheus the pipe of pan out of these reeds is made and when he plays upon it to the shepherds they pity him so mournful is the sound be thou not coy and cold as syrinx was pandora nor thou as pan be rude and mannerless prometheus without ho epimetheus epimetheus t is my brothers voice a sound unwelcome and inopportune as was the braying of silenus ass once heard in cybeles garden pandora let me go i would not be found here i would not see him she escapes among the trees chorus of dryades haste and hide thee ere too late in these thickets intricate lest prometheus see and chide thee lest some hurt or harm betide thee haste and hide thee prometheus entering who was it fled from here i saw a shape flitting among the trees epimetheus it was pandora prometheus o epimetheus is it then in vain that i have warned thee let me now implore thou harborest in thy house a dangerous guest epimetheus whom the gods love they honor with such guests prometheus whom the gods would destroy they first make mad epimetheus shall i refuse the gifts they send to me prometheus reject all gifts that come from higher powers epimetheus such gifts as this are not to be rejected prometheus make not thyself the slave of any woman epimetheus make not thyself the judge of any man prometheus i judge thee not for thou art more than man thou art descended from titanic race and hast a titans strength and faculties that make thee godlike and thou sittest here like heracles spinning omphales flax and beaten with her sandals epimetheus o my brother thou drivest me to madness with thy taunts prometheus and me thou drivest to madness with thy follies come with me to my tower on caucasus see there my forges in the roaring caverns beneficent to man and taste the joy that springs from labor read with me the stars and learn the virtues that lie hidden in plants and all things that are useful epimetheu o my brother i am not as thou art thou dost inherit our fathers strength and i our mothers weakness the softness of the oceanides the yielding nature that cannot resist prometheus because thou wilt not epimetheus nay because i cannot prometheus assert thyself rise up to thy full height shake from thy soul these dreams effeminate these passions born of indolence and ease resolve and thou art free but breathe the air of mountains and their unapproachable summits will lift thee to the level of themselves epimetheus the roar of forests and of waterfalls the rushing of a mighty wind with loud and undistinguishable voices calling are in my ear prometheus o listen and obey epimetheus thou leadest me as a child i follow thee they go out chorus of oreades centuries old are the monntains their foreheads wrinkled and rifted helios crowns by day pallid selene by night from their bosoms uptossed the snows are driven and drifted like tithonus beard streaming dishevelled and white thunder and tempest of wind their trumpets blow in the vastness phantoms of mist and rain cloud and the shadow of cloud pass and repass by the gates of their inaccessible fastness ever unmoved they stand solemn eternal and proud voices of the waters flooded by rain and snow in their inexhaustible sources swollen by affluent streams hurrying onward and hurled headlong over the crags the impetuous watercourses rush and roar and plunge down to the nethermost world say have the solid rocks into streams of silver been melted flowing over the plains spreading to lakes in the fields or have the mountains the giants the icehelmed the forestbelted scattered their arms abroad flung in the meadows their shields voices of the winds high on their turreted cliffs that bolts of thunder have shattered stormwinds muster and blow trumpets of terrible breath then from the gateways rush and before them routed and scattered sullen the cloudrack flies pale with the pallor of death onward the hurricane rides and flee for shelter the shepherds white are the frightened leaves harvests with terror are white panic seizes the herds and even the lions and leopards prowling no longer for prey crouch in their caverns with fright voices of the forest guarding the mountains around majestic the forests are standing bright are their crested helms dark is their armor of leaves filled with the breath of freedom each bosom subsiding expanding now like the ocean sinks now like the ocean upheaves planted firm on the rock with foreheads stern and defiant loud they shout to the winds loud to the tempest they call naught but olympian thunders that blasted titan and giant them can uproot and oerthrow shaking the earth with their fall chorus of oreades these are the voices three of winds and forests and fountains voices of earth and of air murmur and rushing of streams making together one sound the mysterious voice of the mountains waking the sluggard that sleeps waking the dreamer of dreams these are the voices three that speak of endless endeavor speak of endurance and strength triumph and fulness of fame sounding about the world an inspiration forever stirring the hearts of men shaping their end and their aim vii the house of epimetheus pandora left to myself i wander as i will and as my fancy leads me through this house nor could i ask a dwelling more complete were i indeed the goddess that he deems me no mansion of olympus framed to be the habitation of the immortal gods can be more beautiful and this is mine and more than this the love wherewith he crowns me as if impelled by powers invisible and irresistible my steps return unto this spacious hall all corridors and passages lead hither and all doors but open into it yon mysterious chest attracts and fascinates me would i knew what there lies hidden but the oracle forbids ah me the secret then is safe so would it be if it were in my keeping a crowd of shadowy faces from the mirrors that line these walls are watching me i dare not lift up the lid a hundred times the act would be repeated and the secret seen by twice a hundred incorporeal eyes she walks to the other side of the hall my feet are weary wandering to and fro my eyes with seeing and my heart with waiting i will lie here and rest till he returns who is my dawn my day my helios throws herself upon a couch and falls asleep zephyrus come from thy caverns dark and deep o son of erebus and night all sense of hearing and of sight enfold in the serene delight and quietude of sleep set all the silent sentinels to bar and guard the ivory gate and keep the evil dreams of fate and falsehood and infernal hate imprisoned in their cells but open wide the gate of horn whence beautiful as planets rise the dreams of truth with starry eyes and all the wondrous prophecies and visions of the morn chorus of dreams from the ivory gate ye sentinels of sleep it is in vain ye keep your drowsy watch before the ivory gate though closed the portal seems the airy feet of dreams ye cannot thus in walls incarcerate we phantoms are and dreams born by tartarean streams as ministers of the infernal powers o son of erebus and night behold we thus elude your watchful warders on the towers from gloomy tartarus the fates have summoned us to whisper in her ear who lies asleep a tale to fan the fire of her insane desire to know a secret that the gods would keep this passion in their ire the gods themselves inspire to vex mankind with evils manifold so that disease and pain oer the whole earth may reign and nevermore return the age of gold pandora waking a voice said in my sleep do not delay do not delay the golden moments fly the oracle hath forbidden yet not thee doth it forbid but epimetheus only i am alone these faces in the mirrors are but the shadows and phantoms of myself they cannot help nor hinder no one sees me save the allseeing gods who knowing good and knowing evil have created me such as i am and filled me with desire of knowing good and evil like themselves she approaches the chest i hesitate no longer weal or woe or life or death the moment shall decide she lifts the lid a dense mist rises from the chest and fills the room pandora falls senseless on the floor storm without chorus of dreams from the gate of horn yes the moment shall decide it already hath decided and the secret once confided to the keeping of the titan now is flying far and wide whispered told on every side to disquiet and to frighten fever of the heart and brain sorrow pestilence and pain moans of anguish maniac laughter all the evils that hereafter shall afflict and vex mankind all into the air have risen from the chambers of their prison only hope remains behind viii in the garden epimetheus the storm is past but it hath left behind it ruin and desolation all the walks are strewn with shattered boughs the birds are silent the flowers downtrodden by the wind lie dead the swollen rivulet sobs with secret pain the melancholy reeds whisper together as if some dreadful deed had been committed they dare not name and all the air is heavy with an unspoken sorrow premonitions foreshadowings of some terrible disaster oppress my heart ye gods avert the omen pandora coming from the house o epimetheus i no longer dare to lift mine eyes to thine nor hear thy voice being no longer worthy of thy love epimetheus what hast thou done pandora forgive me not but kill me epimetheus what hast thou done pandora i pray for death not pardon epimetheus what hast thou done pandora i dare not speak of it epimetheus thy pallor and thy silence terrify me pandora i have brought wrath and ruin on thy house my heart hath braved the oracle that guarded the fatal secret from us and my hand lifted the lid of the mysterious chest epimetheus then all is lost i am indeed undone pandora i pray for punishment and not for pardon epimetheus mine is the fault not thine on me shall fall the vengeance of the gods for i betrayed their secret when in evil hour i said it was a secret when in evil hour i left thee here alone to this temptation why did i leave thee pandora why didst thou return eternal absence would have been to me the greatest punishment to be left alone and face to face with my own crime had been just retribution upon me ye gods let all your vengeance fall epimetheus on thee and me i do not love thee less for what is done and cannot be undone thy very weakness hath brought thee nearer to me and henceforth my love will have a sense of pity in it making it less a worship than before pandora pity me not pity is degradation love me and kill me epimetheus beautiful pandora thou art a goddess still pandora i am a woman and the insurgent demon in my nature that made me brave the oracle revolts at pity and compassion let me die what else remains for me epimetheus youth hope and love to build a new life on a ruined life to make the future fairer than the past and make the past appear a troubled dream even now in passing through the garden walks upon the ground i saw a fallen nest ruined and full of rain and over me beheld the uncomplaining birds already busy in building a new habitation pandora auspicious omen epimetheus may the eumenides put out their torches and behold us not and fling away their whips of scorpions and touch us not pandora me let them punish only through punishment of our evil deeds only through suffering are we reconciled to the immortal gods and to ourselves chorus of the eumenides never shall souls like these escape the eumenides the daughters dark of acheron and night unquenched our torches glare our scourges in the air send forth prophetic sounds before they smite never by lapse of time the soul defaced by crime into its former self returns again for every guilty deed holds in itself the seed of retribution and undying pain never shall be the loss restored till helios hath purified them with his heavenly fires then what was lost is won and the new life begun kindled with nobler passions and desires the hanging of the crane i the lights are out and gone are all the guests that thronging came with merriment and jests to celebrate the hanging of the crane in the new house into the night are gone but still the fire upon the hearth burns on and i alone remain o fortunate o happy day when a new household finds its place among the myriad homes of earth like a new star just sprung to birth and rolled on its harmonious way into the boundless realms of space so said the guests in speech and song as in the chimney burning bright we hung the iron crane tonight and merry was the feast and long ii and now i sit and muse on what may be and in my vision see or seem to see through floating vapors interfused with light shapes indeterminate that gleam and fade as shadows passing into deeper shade sink and elude the sight for two alone there in the hall as spread the table round and small upon the polished silver shine the evening lamps but more divine the light of love shines over all of love that says not mine and thine but ours for ours is thine and mine they want no guests to come between their tender glances like a screen and tell them tales of land and sea and whatsoever may betide the great forgotten world outside they want no guests they needs must be each others own best company iii the picture fades as at a village fair a showmans views dissolving into air again appear transfigured on the screen so in my fancy this and now once more in part transfigured through the open door appears the selfsame scene seated i see the two again but not alone they entertain a little angel unaware with face as round as is the moon a royal guest with flaxen hair who throned upon his lofty chair drums on the table with his spoon then drops it careless on the floor to grasp at things unseen before are these celestial manners these the ways that win the arts that please ah yes consider well the guest and whatsoeer he does seems best he ruleth by the right divine of helplessness so lately born in purple chambers of the morn as sovereign over thee and thine he speaketh not and yet there lies a conversation in his eyes the golden silence of the greek the gravest wisdom of the wise not spoken in language but in looks more legible than printed books as if he could but would not speak and now o monarch absolute thy power is put to proof for lo resistless fathomless and slow the nurse comes rustling like the sea and pushes back thy chair and thee and so good night to king canute iv as one who walking in a forest sees a lovely landscape through the parted frees then sees it not for boughs that intervene or as we see the moon sometimes revealed through drifting clouds and then again concealed so i behold the scene there are two guests at table now the king deposed and older grown no longer occupies the throne the crown is on his sisters brow a princess from the fairy isles the very pattern girl of girls all covered and embowered in curls rosetinted from the isle of flowers and sailing with soft silken sails from faroff dreamland into ours above their bowls with rims of blue four azure eyes of deeper hue are looking dreamy with delight limpid as planets that emerge above the oceans rounded verge softshining through the summer night steadfast they gaze yet nothing see beyond the horizon of their bowls nor care they for the world that rolls with all its freight of troubled souls into the days that are to be v again the tossing boughs shut out the scene again the drifting vapors intervene and the moons pallid disk is hidden quite and now i see the table wider grown as round a pebble into water thrown dilates a ring of light i see the table wider grown i see it garlanded with guests as if fair ariadnes crown out of the sky had fallen down maidens within whose tender breasts a thousand restless hopes and fears forth reaching to the coming years flutter awhile then quiet lie like timid birds that fain would fly but do not dare to leave their nests and youths who in their strength elate challenge the van and front of fate eager as champions to be in the divine knighterrantry of youth that travels sea and land seeking adventures or pursues through cities and through solitudes frequented by the lyric muse the phantom with the beckoning hand that still allures and still eludes o sweet illusions of the brain o sudden thrills of fire and frost the world is bright while ye remain and dark and dead when ye are lost vi the meadowbrook that seemeth to stand still quickens its current as it nears the mill and so the stream of time that lingereth in level places and so dull appears runs with a swifter current as it nears the gloomy mills of death and now like the magicians scroll that in the owners keeping shrinks with every wish he speaks or thinks till the last wish consumes the whole the table dwindles and again i see the two alone remain the crown of stars is broken in parts its jewels brighter than the day have one by one been stolen away to shine in other homes and hearts one is a wanderer now afar in ceylon or in zanzibar or sunny regions of cathay and one is in the boisterous camp mid clink of arms and horses tramp and battles terrible array i see the patient mother read with aching heart of wrecks that float disabled on those seas remote or of some great heroic deed on battlefieds where thousands bleed to lift one hero into fame anxious she bends her graceful head above these chronicles of pain and trembles with a secret dread lest there among the drowned or slain she find the one beloved name vii after a day of cloud and wind and rain sometimes the setting sun breaks out again and touching all the darksome woods with light smiles on the fields until they laugh and sing then like a ruby from the horizons ring drops down into the night what see i now the night is fair the storm of grief the clouds of care the wind the rain have passed away the lamps are lit the fires burn bright the house is full of life and light it is the golden wedding day the guests come thronging in once more quick footsteps sound along the floor the trooping children crowd the stair and in and out and everywhere flashes along the corridor the sunshine of their golden hair on the round table in the hall another ariadnes crown out of the sky hath fallen down more than one monarch of the moon is drumming with his silver spoon the light of love shines over all o fortunate o happy day the people sing the people say the ancient bridegroom and the bride smiling contented and serene upon the blithe bewildering scene behold well pleased on every side their forms and features multiplied as the reflection of a light between two burnished mirrors gleams or lamps upon a bridge at night stretch on and on before the sight till the long vista

vi o caesar we who are about to die salute you was the gladiators cry in the arena standing face to face with death and with the roman populace o ye familiar scenes ye groves of pine that once were mine and are no longer mine thou river widening through the meadows green to the vast sea so near and yet unseen ye halls in whose seclusion and repose phantoms of fame like exhalations rose and vanished we who are about to die salute you earth and air and sea and sky and the imperial sun that scatters down his sovereign splendors upon grove and town ye do not answer us ye do not hear we are forgotten and in your austere and calm indifference ye little care whether we come or go or whence or where what passing generations fill these halls what passing voices echo front these walls ye heed not we are only as the blast a moment heard and then forever past not so the teachers who in earlier days led our bewildered feet through learnings maze they answer us alas what have i said what greetings come there from the voiceless dead what salutation welcome or reply what pressure from the hands that lifeless lie they are no longer here they all are gone into the land of shadows all save one honor and reverence and the good repute that follows faithful service as its fruit be unto him whom living we salute the great italian poet when he made his dreadful journey to the realms of shade met there the old instructor of his youth and cried in tones of pity and of ruth o never from the memory of my heart your dear paternal image shall depart who while on earth ere yet by death surprised taught me how mortals are immortalized how grateful am i for that patient care all my life long my language shall declare today we make the poets words our own and utter them in plaintive undertone nor to the living only be they said but to the other living called the dead whose dear paternal images appear not wrapped in gloom but robed in sunshine here whose simple lives complete and without flaw were part and parcel of great natures law who said not to their lord as if afraid here is thy talent in a napkin laid but labored in their sphere as men who live in the delight that work alone can give peace be to them eternal peace and rest and the fulfilment of the great behest ye have been faithful over a few things over ten cities shall ye reign as kings and ye who fill the places we once filled and follow in the furrows that we tilled young men whose generous hearts are beating high we who are old and are about to die salute you hail you take your hands in ours and crown you with our welcome as with flowers how beautiful is youth how bright it gleams with its illusions aspirations dreams book of beginnings story without end each maid a heroine and each man a friend aladdins

and weak to fight chirping like grasshoppers in their delight to see the embattled hosts with spear and shield of trojans and achaians in the field so from the snowy summits of our years we see you in the plain as each appears and question of you asking who is he that towers above the others which may be atreides menelaus odysseus ajax the great or bold idomeneus let him not boast who puts his

the halfcentury with a solemn chime and summons us together once again the joy of meeting not unmixed with pain where are the others voices from the deep caverns of darkness answer me they sleep i name no names instinctively i feel each at some wellremembered grave will kneel and from the inscription wipe the weeds and moss for every heart best knoweth its own loss i see their scattered gravestones gleaming white through the pale dusk of the impending night oer all alike the impartial sunset throws its golden lilies mingled with the rose we give to each a tender thought and pass out of the graveyards with their tangled grass unto these scenes frequented by our feet when we were young and life was fresh and sweet what shall i say to you what can i say better than silence is when i survey this throng of faces turned to meet my own friendly and fair and yet to me unknown transformed the very landscape seems to be it is the same yet not the same to me so many memories crowd upon my brain so many ghosts are in the wooded plain i fain would steal away with noiseless tread as from a house where some one lieth dead i cannot go i pause i hesitate my feet reluctant linger at the gate as one who struggles in a troubled dream to speak and cannot to myself i seem vanish the dream vanish the idle fears vanish the rolling mists of fifty years whatever time or space may intervene i will not be a stranger in this scene here every doubt all indecision ends hail my companions comrades classmates friends ah me the fifty years since last we met seem to me fifty folios bound and set by time the great transcriber on his shelves wherein are written the histories of ourselves what tragedies what comedies are there what joy and grief what rapture and despair what chronicles of triumph and defeat of struggle and temptation and retreat what records of regrets and doubts and fears what pages blotted blistered by our tears what lovely landscapes on the margin shine what sweet angelic faces what divine and holy images of love and trust undimmed by age unsoiled by damp or dust whose hand shall dare to open and explore these volumes closed and clasped forevermore not mine with reverential feet i pass i hear a voice that cries alas alas whatever hath been written shall remain nor be erased nor written oer again the unwritten only still belongs to thee take heed and ponder well what that shall be as children frightened by a thundercloud are reassured if some one reads aloud a tale of wonder with enchantment fraught or wild adventure that diverts their thought let me endeavor with a tale to chase the gathering shadows of the time and place and banish what we all too deeply feel wholly to say or wholly to conceal in mediaeval rome i know not where there stood an image with its arm in air and on its lifted finger shining clear a golden ring with the device strike here greatly the people wondered though none guessed the meaning that these words but half expressed until a learned clerk who at noonday with downcast eyes was passing on his way paused and observed the spot and marked it well whereon the shadow of the finger fell and coming back at midnight delved and found a secret stairway leading under ground down this he passed into a spacious hall lit by a flaming jewel on the wall and opposite in threatening attitude with bow and shaft a brazen statue stood upon its forehead like a coronet were these mysterious words of menace set that which i am i am my fatal aim none can escape not even yon luminous flame midway the hall was a fair table placed with cloth of gold and golden cups enchased with rubies and the plates and knives were gold and gold the bread and viands manifold around it silent motionless and sad were seated gallant knights in armor clad and ladies beautiful with plume and zone but they were stone their hearts within were stone and the vast hall was filled in every part with silent crowds stony in face and heart long at the scene bewildered and amazed the trembling clerk in speechless wonder gazed then from the table by his greed made bold he seized a goblet and a knife of gold and suddenly from their seats the guests upsprang the vaulted ceiling with loud clamors rang the archer sped his arrow at their call shattering the lambent jewel on the wall and all was dark around and overhead stark on the door the luckless clerk lay dead the writer of this legend then records its ghostly application in these words the image is the adversary old whose beckoning finger points to realms of gold our lusts and passions are the downward stair that leads the soul from a diviner air the archer death the flaming jewel life terrestrial goods the goblet and the knife the knights and ladies all whose flesh and bone by avarice have been hardened into stone the clerk the scholar whom the love of pelf tempts from his books and from his nobler self the scholar and the world the endless strife the discord in the harmonies of life the love of learning the sequestered nooks and all the sweet serenity of books the marketplace the eager love of gain whose aim is vanity and whose end is pain but why you ask me should this tale be told to men grown old or who are growing old it is too late ah nothing is too late till the tired heart shall cease to palpitate cato learned greek at eighty sophocles wrote his

show how far the gulfstream of our youth may flow into the arctic regions of our lives where little else than life itself survives as the barometer foretells the storm while still the skies are clear the weather warm so something in us as old age draws near betrays the pressure of the atmosphere the nimble mercury ere we are aware descends the elastic ladder of the air the telltale blood in artery and vein sinks from its higher levels in the brain whatever poet orator or sage may say of it old age is still old age it is the waning not the crescent moon the dusk of evening not the blaze of noon it is not strength but weakness not desire but its surcease not the fierce heat of fire the burning and consuming element but that of ashes and of embers spent in which some living sparks we still discern enough to warm but not enough to burn what then shall we sit idly down and say the night hath come it is no longer day the night hath not yet come we are not quite cut off from labor by the failing light something remains for us to do or dare even the oldest tree some fruit may bear not oedipus coloneus or greek ode or tales of pilgrims that one morning rode out of the gateway of the tabard inn but other something would we but begin for age is opportunity no less than youth itself though in another dress and as the evening twilight fades away the sky is filled with stars invisible

hands to clasp their hands i cannot find them nothing now is left but a majestic memory they meanwhile wander together in elysian lands perchance remembering me who am bereft of their dear presence

ocean floor the willows in the meadow and the free wild winds of the atlantic welcome me then why shouldst thou be dead and come no more ah why shouldst thou be dead when common men are busy with their trivial affairs having and holding why when thou hadst read natures mysterious manuscript and then wast ready to reveal the truth it bears why art thou silent why shouldst thou be dead iv river

the dark of painted glass in leaden lattice bound he listeneth and he laugheth at the sound then writeth in a book like any clerk he is the poet of the dawn who wrote the canterbury tales and his old age made beautiful with song and as i read i hear the crowing cock i hear the note of lark and linnet and from every page rise odors of ploughed field or flowery mead shakespeare a vision as of crowded city streets with human life in endless overflow thunder of thoroughfares trumpets that blow to battle clamor in obscure retreats of sailors landed from their anchored fleets tolling of bells in turrets and below voices of children and bright flowers that throw oer gardenwalls their intermingled sweets this vision comes to me when i unfold the volume of the poet paramount whom all the muses loved not one alone into his hands they put the lyre of gold and crowned with sacred laurel at their fount placed him as musagetes on their throne milton i pace the sounding seabeach and behold

his hot coursers trod but the white drift of worlds oer chasms of sable the stardust that is whirled aloft and flies from the invisible chariotwheels of god the sound of the sea the sea awoke at midnight from its sleep and round the pebbly beaches far and wide i heard the first wave of the rising tide rush onward with uninterrupted sweep a voice out of the silence of the deep a sound mysteriously multiplied as of a cataract from the mountains side or roar of winds upon a wooded steep so comes to us at times from the unknown and inaccessible solitudes of being the rushing of the seatides of the soul and inspirations that we deem our own are some divine foreshadowing and foreseeing of things beyond our reason or control a summer day by the sea the sun is set and in his latest beams yon little cloud of ashen gray and gold slowly upon the amber air unrolled the falling mantle of the prophet seems from the dim headlands many a lighthouse gleams the streetlamps of the ocean

pain forever and forever shalt thou be to some the gravestone of a dead delight to some the landmark of a new domain the tides i saw the long line of the vacant shore the seaweed and the shells upon

would be their fate who now are looking up to me for help and furtherance their lives i said would be a volume wherein i have read but the first chapters and no longer see to read the rest of their dear history so full of beauty and so full of dread be comforted the world is very old and generations pass as they have passed a troop of shadows moving with the sun thousands of times has the old tale been told the world belongs to those who come the last they will find hope and strength as we have done a nameless grave a soldier of the union mustered out is the inscription on an unknown grave

brave and doomed battalions storming the redoubt thou unknown hero sleeping by the sea in thy forgotten grave with secret shame i feel my pulses beat my forehead burn when i remember thou hast given

hundred wakeful eyes of thought as hermes with his lyre in sleep profound the hundred wakeful eyes of argus bound for i am weary and am overwrought with too much toil with too much care distraught and

sheaves to the river rhone thou royal river born of sun and shower in chambers purple with the alpine glow wrapped in the spotless ermine of the snow and rocked by tempests at the appointed hour forth

say these three and greatest of the three is love holidays the holiest of all holidays are those kept by ourselves in silence and apart the secret anniversaries of the heart when the full river of feeling overflows the happy days unclouded to their close the sudden joys that out of darkness start as flames from ashes swift desires that dart like swallows singing down each wind that blows white as the gleam of a receding sail white as a cloud that floats and fades in air white as the whitest lily on a stream these tender memories are a fairy tale of some enchanted land we know not where but lovely as a landscape in a dream wapentake to alfred tennyson poet i come to touch thy lance with mine not as a knight who on the listed field of tourney touched his adversarys shield in token of defiance but in sign of homage to the mastery which is thine in english song nor will i keep concealed and voiceless as a rivulet frostcongealed my admiration for thy verse divine not of the howling dervishes of song who craze the brain with their delirious dance art thou o sweet historian of the heart therefore to thee the laurelleaves belong to thee our love and our allegiance for thy allegiance to the poets art the broken oar once upon icelands solitary strand a poet wandered with his book and pen seeking some final word some sweet amen wherewith to close the volume in his hand the billows rolled and plunged upon the sand the circling seagulls swept beyond his ken and from the parting cloudrack now and then flashed the red sunset over sea and land then by the billows at his feet was tossed a broken oar and carved thereon he read oft was i weary when i toiled at thee and like a man who findeth what was lost he wrote the words then lifted up his head and flung his useless pen into the sea the cross of snow in the long sleepless watches of the night a gentle face the face of one long dead looks at me from the wall where round its head the nightlamp casts a halo of pale light here in this room she died and soul more white never through martyrdom of fire was led to its repose nor can in books be read the legend of a life more benedight there is a mountain in the distant west that sundefying in its deep ravines displays a cross of snow upon its side such is the cross i wear upon my breast these eighteen years through all the changing scenes and seasons changeless since the day she died birds of passage flight the fourth charles sumner garlands upon his grave and flowers upon his hearse and to the tender heart and brave the tribute of this verse his was the troubled life the conflict and the pain the grief the bitterness of strife the honor without stain like winkelried he took into his manly breast the sheaf of hostile spears and broke a path for the oppressed then from the fatal field upon a nations heart borne like a warrior on his shield so should the brave depart death takes us by surprise and stays our hurrying feet the great design unfinished lies our lives are incomplete but in the dark unknown perfect their circles seem even as a bridges arch of stone is rounded in the stream alike are life and death when life in death survives and the uninterrupted breath inspires a thousand lives were a star quenched on high for ages would its light still travelling downward from the sky shine on our mortal sight so when a great man dies for years beyond our ken the light he leaves behind him lies upon the paths of men travels by the fireside the ceaseless rain is falling fast and yonder gilded vane immovable for three days past points to the misty main it drives me in upon myself and to the fireside gleams to pleasant books that crowd my shelf and still more pleasant dreams i read whatever bards have sung of lands beyond the sea and the bright days when i was young come thronging back to me in fancy i can hear again the alpine torrents roar the mulebells on the hills of spain the sea at elsinore i see the convents gleaming wall rise from its groves of pine and towers of old cathedrals tall and castles by the rhine i journey on by park and spire beneath centennial trees through fields with poppies all on fire and gleams of distant seas i fear no more the dust and heat no more i feel fatigue while journeying with anothers feet oer many a lengthening league let others traverse sea and land and toil through various climes i turn the world round with my hand reading these poets rhymes from them i learn whatever lies beneath each changing zone and see when looking with their eyes better than with mine own cadenabbia lake of como no sound of wheels or hoofbeat breaks the silence of the summer day as by the loveliest of all lakes i while the idle hours away i pace the leafy colonnade where level branches of the plane above me weave a roof of shade impervious to the sun and rain at times a sudden rush of air flutters the lazy leaves oerhead and gleams of sunshine toss and flare like torches down the path i tread by somarivas garden gate i make the marble stairs my seat and hear the water as i wait lapping the steps beneath my feet the undulation sinks and swells along the stony parapets and far away the floating bells tinkle upon the fishers nets silent and slow by tower and town the freighted barges come and go their pendent shadows gliding down by town and tower submerged below the hills sweep upward from the shore with villas scattered one by one upon their wooded spurs and lower bellaggio blazing in the sun and dimly seen a tangled mass of walls and woods of light and shade stands beckoning up the stelvio pass varenna with its white cascade i ask myself is this a dream will it all vanish into air is there a land of such supreme and perfect beauty anywhere sweet vision do not fade away linger until my heart shall take into itself the summer day and all the beauty of the lake linger until upon my brain is stamped an image of the scene then fade into the air again and be as if thou hadst not been monte cassino terra di lavoro beautiful valley through whose verdant meads unheard the garigliano glides along the liris nurse of rushes and of reeds the river taciturn of classic song the land of labor and the land of rest where mediaeval towns are white on all the hillsides and where every mountains crest is an etrurian or a roman wall there is alagna where pope boniface was dragged with contumely from his throne sciarra colonna was that days disgrace the pontiffs only or in part thine own there is ceprano where a renegade was each apulian as great dante saith when manfred by his menatarms betrayed spurred on to benevento and to death there is aquinum the old volscian town where juvenal was born whose lurid light still hovers oer his birthplace like the crown of splendor seen oer cities in the night doubled the splendor is that in its streets the angelic doctor as a schoolboy played and dreamed perhaps the dreams that he repeats in ponderous folios for scholastics made and there uplifted like a passing cloud that pauses on a mountain summit high monte cassinos convent rears its proud and venerable walls against the sky well i remember how on foot i climbed the stony pathway leading to its gate above the convent bells for vespers chimed below the darkening town grew desolate well i remember the low arch and dark the courtyard with its well the terrace wide from which far down the valley like a park veiled in the evening mists was dim descried the day was dying and with feeble hands caressed the mountaintops the vales between darkened the river in the meadowlands sheathed itself as a sword and was not seen the silence of the place was like a sleep so full of rest it seemed each passing tread was a reverberation from the deep recesses of the ages that are dead for more than thirteen centuries ago benedict fleeing from the gates of rome a youth disgusted with its vice and woe sought in these mountain solitudes a home he founded here his convent and his rule of prayer and work and counted work as prayer the pen became a clarion and his school flamed like a beacon in the midnight air what though boccaccio in his reckless way mocking the lazy brotherhood deplores the illuminated manuscripts that lay torn and neglected on the dusty floors boccaccio was a novelist a child of fancy and of fiction at the best this the urbane librarian said and smiled incredulous as at some idle jest upon such themes as these with one young friar i sat conversing late into the night till in its cavernous chimney the woodfire had burnt its heart out like an anchorite and then translated in my convent cell myself yet not myself in dreams i lay and as a monk who hears the matin bell started from sleep already it was day from the high window i beheld the scene on which saint benedict so oft had gazed the mountains and the valley in the sheen of the bright sun and stood as one amazed gray mists were rolling rising vanishing the woodlands glistened with their jewelled crowns far off the mellow bells began to ring for matins in the halfawakened towns the conflict of the present and the past the ideal and the actual in our life as on a field of battle held me fast where this world and the next world were at strife for as the valley from its sleep awoke i saw the iron horses of the steam toss to the morning air their plumes of smoke and woke as one awaketh from a dream amalfi sweet the memory is to me of a land beyond the sea where the waves and mountains meet where amid her mulberrytrees sits amalfi in the heat bathing ever her white feet in the tideless summer seas in the middle of the town from its fountains in the hills tumbling through the narrow gorge the canneto rushes down turns the great wheels of the mills lifts the hammers of the forge t is a stairway not a street that ascends the deep ravine where the torrent leaps between rocky walls that almost meet toiling up from stair to stair peasant girls their burdens bear sunburnt daughters of the soil stately figures tall and straight what inexorable fate dooms them to this life of toil lord of vineyards and of lands far above the convent stands on its terraced walk aloof leans a monk with folded hands placid satisfied serene looking down upon the scene over wall and redtiled roof wondering unto what good end all this toil and traffic tend and why all men cannot be free from care and free from pain and the sordid love of gain and as indolent as he where are now the freighted barks from the marts of east and west where the knights in iron sarks journeying to the holy land glove of steel upon the hand cross of crimson on the breast where the pomp of camp and court where the pilgrims with their prayers where the merchants with their wares and their gallant brigantines sailing safely into port chased by corsair algerines vanished like a fleet of cloud like a passing trumpetblast are those splendors of the past and the commerce and the crowd fathoms deep beneath the seas lie the ancient wharves and quays swallowed by the engulfing waves silent streets and vacant halls ruined roofs and towers and walls hidden from all mortal eyes deep the sunken city lies even cities have their graves this is an enchanted land round the headlands far away sweeps the blue salernian bay with its sickle of white sand further still and furthermost on the dim discovered coast paestum with its ruins lies and its roses all in bloom seem to tinge the fatal skies of that lonely land of doom on his terrace high in air nothing doth the good monk care for such worldly themes as these from the garden just below little puffs of perfume blow and a sound is in his ears of the murmur of the bees in the shining chestnuttrees nothing else he heeds or hears all the landscape seems to swoon in the happy afternoon slowly oer his senses creep the encroaching waves of sleep and he sinks as sank the town unresisting fathoms down into caverns cool and deep walled about with drifts of snow hearing the fierce northwind blow seeing all the landscape white and the river cased in ice comes this memory of delight comes this vision unto me of a longlost paradise in the land beyond the sea the sermon of st francis up soared the lark into the air a shaft of song a winged prayer as if a soul released from pain were flying back to heaven again st francis heard it was to him an emblem of the seraphim the upward motion of the fire the light the heat the hearts desire around assisis convent gate the birds gods poor who cannot wait from moor and mere and darksome wood came flocking for their dole of food o brother birds st francis said ye come to me and ask for bread but not with bread alone today shall ye be fed and sent away ye shall be fed ye happy birds with manna of celestial words not mine though mine they seem to be not mine though they be spoken through me o doubly are ye bound to praise the great creator in your lays he giveth you your plumes of down your crimson hoods your cloaks of brown he giveth you your wings to fly and breathe a purer air on high and careth for you everywhere who for yourselves so little care with flutter of swift wings and songs together rose the feathered throngs and singing scattered far apart deep peace was in st francis heart he knew not if the brotherhood his homily had understood he only knew that to one ear the meaning of his words was clear belisarius i am poor and old and blind the sun burns me and the wind blows through the city gate and covers me with dust from the wheels of the august justinian the great it was for him i chased the persians oer wild and waste as general of the east night after night i lay in their camps of yesterday their forage was my feast for him with sails of red and torches at masthead piloting the great fleet i swept the afric coasts and scattered the vandal hosts like dust in a windy street for him i won again the ausonian realm and reign rome and parthenope and all the land was mine from the summits of apennine to the shores of either sea for him in my feeble age i dared the battles rage to save byzantiums state when the tents of zabergan like snowdrifts overran the road to the golden gate and for this for this behold infirm and blind and old with gray uncovered head beneath the very arch of my triumphal march i stand and beg my bread methinks i still can hear sounding distinct and near the vandal monarchs cry as captive and disgraced with majestic step he paced all all is vanity ah vainest of all things is the gratitude of kings the plaudits of the crowd are but the clatter of feet at midnight in the street hollow and restless and loud but the bitterest disgrace is to see forever the face of the monk of ephesus the unconquerable will this too can bear i still am belisarius songo river nowhere such a devious stream save in fancy or in dream winding slow through bush and brake links together lake and lake walled with woods or sandy shelf ever doubling on itself flows the stream so still and slow that it hardly seems to flow never errant knight of old lost in woodland or on wold such a winding path pursued through the sylvan solitude never schoolboy in his quest after hazelnut or nest through the forest in and out wandered loitering thus about in the mirror of its tide tangled thickets on each side hang inverted and between floating cloud or sky serene swift or swallow on the wing seems the only living thing or the loon that laughs and flies down to those reflected skies silent stream thy indian name unfamiliar is to fame for thou hidest here alone well content to be unknown but thy tranquil waters teach wisdom deep as human speech moving without haste or noise in unbroken equipoise though thou turnest no busy mill and art ever calm and still even thy silence seems to say to the traveller on his way traveller hurrying from the heat of the city stay thy feet rest awhile nor longer waste life with inconsiderate haste be not like a stream that brawls loud with shallow waterfalls but in quiet selfcontrol link together soul and soul keramos turn turn my wheel turn round and round without a pause without a sound so spins the flying world away this clay well mixed with marl and sand follows the motion of my hand far some must follow and some command though all are made of clay thus sang the potter at his task beneath the blossoming hawthorntree while oer his features like a mask the quilted sunshine and leafshade moved as the boughs above him swayed and clothed him till he seemed to be a figure woven in tapestry so sumptuously was he arrayed in that magnificent attire of sable tissue flaked with fire like a magician he appeared a conjurer without book or beard and while he plied his magic art for it was magical to me i stood in silence and apart and wondered more and more to see that shapeless lifeless mass of clay rise up to meet the masters hand and now contract and now expand and even his slightest touch obey while ever in a thoughtful mood he sang his ditty and at times whistled a tune between the rhymes as a melodious interlude turn turn my wheel all things must change to something new to something strange nothing that is can pause or stay the moon will wax the moon will wane the mist and cloud will turn to rain the rain to mist and cloud again tomorrow be today thus still the potter sang and still by some unconscious act of will the melody and even the words were intermingled with my thought as bits of colored thread are caught and woven into nests of birds and thus to regions far remote beyond the oceans vast expanse this wizard in the motley coat transported me on wings of song and by the northern shores of france bore me with restless speed along what land is this that seems to be a mingling of the land and sea this land of sluices dikes and dunes this waternet that tessellates the landscape this unending maze of gardens through whose latticed gates the imprisoned pinks and tulips gaze where in long summer afternoons the sunshine softened by the haze comes streaming down as through a screen where over fields and pastures green the painted ships float high in air and over all and everywhere the sails of windmills sink and soar like wings of seagulls on the shore what land is this yon pretty town is delft with all its wares displayed the pride the marketplace the crown and centre of the potters trade see every house and room is bright with glimmers of reflected light from plates that on the dresser shine flagons to foam with flemish beer or sparkle with the rhenish wine and pilgrim flasks with fleursdelis and ships upon a rolling sea and tankards pewter topped and queer with comic mask and musketeer each hospitable chimney smiles a welcome from its painted tiles the parlor walls the chamber floors the stairways and the corridors the borders of the garden walks are beautiful with fadeless flowers that never droop in winds or showers and never wither on their stalks turn turn my wheel all life is brief what now is bud wilt soon be leaf what now is leaf will soon decay the wind blows east the wind blows west the blue eyes in the robins nest will soon have wings and beak and breast and flutter and fly away now southward through the air i glide the song my only pursuivant and see across the landscape wide the blue charente upon whose tide the belfries and the spires of saintes ripple and rock from side to side as when an earthquake rends its walls a crumbling city reels and falls who is it in the suburbs here this potter working with such cheer in this mean house this mean attire his manly features bronzed with fire whose figulines and rustic wares scarce find him bread from day to day this madman as the people say who breaks his tables and his chairs to feed his furnace fires nor cares who goes unfed if they are fed nor who may live if they are dead this alchemist with hollow cheeks and sunken searching eyes who seeks by mingled earths and ores combined with potency of fire to find some new enamel hard and bright his dream his passion his delight o palissy within thy breast burned the hot fever of unrest thine was the prophets vision thine the exultation the divine insanity of noble minds that never falters nor abates but labors and endures and waits till all that it foresees it finds or what it cannot find creates turn turn my wheel this earthen jar a touch can make a touch can mar and shall it to the potter say what makest thou thou hast no hand as men who think to understand a world by their creator planned who wiser is than they still guided by the dreamy song as in a trance i float along above the pyrenean chain above the fields and farms of spain above the bright majorcan isle that lends its softened name to art a spot a dot upon the chart whose little towns redroofed with tile are rubylustred with the light of blazing furnaces by night and crowned by day with wreaths of smoke then eastward wafted in my flight on my enchanters magic cloak i sail across the tyrrhene sea into the land of italy and oer the windy apennines mantled and musical with pines the

these choristers with lips of stone whose music is not heard but seen still chant as from their organscreen their makers praise nor these alone but the more fragile forms of clay hardly less beautiful than they these saints and angels that adorn the walls of hospitals and tell the story of good deeds so well that poverty seems less forlorn and life more like a holiday here in this old neglected church that long eludes the travellers search lies the dead bishop on his tomb earth upon earth he slumbering lies lifelike and deathlike in the gloom garlands of fruit and flowers in bloom and foliage deck his resting place a shadow in the sightless eyes a pallor on the patient face made perfect by the furnace heat all earthly passions and desires burnt out by purgatorial fires seeming to say our years are fleet and to the weary death is sweet but the most wonderful of all the ornaments on tomb or wall that grace the fair ausonian shores are those the faithful earth restores near some apulian town concealed in vineyard or in harvest field vases and urns and basreliefs memorials of forgotten griefs or records of heroic deeds of demigods and mighty chiefs figures that almost move and speak and buried amid mould and weeds still in their attitudes attest the presence of the graceful greek achilles in his armor dressed alcides with the cretan bull and aphrodite with her boy or lovely

of the libyan nile flooding and feeding the parched land with annual ebb and overflow a fallen palm whose branches lie beneath the abyssinian sky whose roots are in egyptian sands on either bank huge waterwheels belted with jars and dripping weeds send forth their melancholy moans as if in their gray mantles hid dead anchorites of the thebaid knelt on the shore and told their beads beating their breasts with loud appeals and penitential tears and groans this city walled and thickly set with glittering mosque and minaret is cairo in whose gay bazaars the dreaming traveller first inhales the perfume of arabian gales and sees the fabulous earthen jars huge as were those wherein the maid morgiana found the forty thieves concealed in midnight ambuscade and seeing more than half believes the fascinating tales that run through all the thousand nights and one told by the fair scheherezade more strange and wonderful than these are the egyptian deities ammonn and emeth and the grand osiris

with smoke uprising gyre on gyre and painted by the lurid glare of jets and flashes of red fire as leaves that in the autumn fall spotted and veined with various hues are swept along the avenues and lie in heaps by hedge and wall so from this grove of chimneys whirled to all the markets of the world these porcelain leaves are wafted on light yellow leaves with spots and stains of violet and of crimson dye or tender azure of a sky just washed by gentle april rains and beautiful with celadon nor less the coarser household wares the willow pattern that we knew in childhood with its bridge of blue leading to unknown thoroughfares the solitary man who stares at the white river flowing through its arches the fantastic trees and wild perspective of the view and intermingled among these the tiles that in our nurseries filled us with wonder and delight or haunted us in dreams at night and yonder by nankin behold the tower of porcelain strange and old uplifting to the astonished skies its ninefold painted balconies with balustrades of twining leaves and roofs of tile beneath whose eaves hang porcelain bells that all the time ring with a soft melodious chime while the whole fabric is ablaze with varied tints all fused in one great mass of color like a maze of flowers illumined by the sun turn turn my wheel what is begun at daybreak must at dark be done tomorrow will be another day tomorrow the hot furnace flame will search the heart and try the frame and stamp with honor or with shame these vessels made of clay cradled and rocked in eastern seas the islands of the japanese beneath me lie oer lake and plain the stork the heron and the crane through the clear realms of azure drift and on the hillside i can see the villages of imari whose thronged and flaming workshops lift their twisted columns of smoke on high cloud cloisters that in ruins lie with sunshine streaming through each rift and broken arches of blue sky all the bright flowers that fill the land ripple of waves on rock or sand the snow on fusiyamas cone the midnight heaven so thickly sown with constellations of bright stars the leaves that rustle the reeds that make a whisper by each stream and lake

nature reproduced in art art is the child of nature yes her darling child in whom we trace the features of the mothers face her aspect and her attitude all her majestic loveliness chastened and softened and subdued into a more attractive grace and with a human sense imbued he is the greatest artist then whether of pencil or of pen who follows nature never man as artist or as artisan pursuing his own fantasies can touch the human heart or please or satisfy our nobler needs as he who sets his willing feet in natures footprints light and fleet and follows fearless where she leads thus mused i on that morn in may wrapped in my visions like the seer whose eyes behold not what is near but only what is far away when suddenly sounding peal on peal the churchbell from the neighboring town proclaimed the welcome hour of noon the potter heard and stopped his wheel his apron on the grass threw down whistled his quiet little tune not overloud nor overlong and ended thus his simple song stop stop my wheel too soon too soon the noon will be the afternoon too soon today be yesterday behind us in our path we cast the broken potsherds of the past and all are ground to dust a last and trodden into clay birds of passage flight the fifth the herons of elmwood warm and still is the summer night as here by the rivers brink i wander white overhead are the stars and white the glimmering lamps on the hillside yonder silent are all the sounds of day nothing i hear but the chirp of crickets and the cry of the herons winging their way oer the poets house in the elmwood thickets call to him herons as slowly you pass to your roosts in the haunts of the exiled thrushes sing him the song of the green morass and the tides that water the reeds and rushes sing him the mystical song of the hern and the secret that baffles our utmost seeking for only a sound of lament we discern and cannot interpret the words you are speaking sing of the air and the wild delight of wings that uplift and winds that uphold you the joy of freedom the rapture of flight through the drift of the floating mists that infold you of the landscape lying so far below with its towns and rivers and desert places and the splendor of light above and the glow of the limitless blue ethereal spaces ask him if songs of the troubadours or of minnesingers in old blackletter sound in his ears more sweet than yours and if yours are not sweeter and wilder and better sing to him say to him here at his gate where the boughs of the stately elms are meeting some one hath lingered to meditate and send him unseen this friendly greeting that many another hath done the same though not by a sound was the silence broken the surest pledge of a deathless name is the silent homage of thoughts unspoken a dutch picture simon danz has come home again from cruising about with his buccaneers he has singed the beard of the king of spain and carried away the dean of jaen and sold him in algiers in his house by the maese with its roof of tiles and weathercocks flying aloft in air there are silver tankards of antique styles plunder of convent and castle and piles of carpets rich and rare in his tulipgarden there by the town overlooking the sluggish stream with his moorish cap and dressinggown the old seacaptain hale and brown walks in a waking dream a smile in his gray mustachio lurks whenever he thinks of the king of spain and the listed tulips look like turks and the silent gardener as he works is changed to the dean of jaen the windmills on the outermost verge of the landscape in the haze to him are towers on the spanish coast with whiskered sentinels at their post though this is the river maese but when the winter rains begin he sits and smokes by the blazing brands and old seafaring men come in goatbearded gray and with double chin and rings upon their hands they sit there in the shadow and shine of the flickering fire of the winter night figures in color and design like those by rembrandt of the rhine half darkness and half light and they talk of ventures lost or won and their talk is ever and ever the same while they drink the red wine of tarragon from the cellars of some spanish don or convent set on flame restless at times with heavy strides he paces his parlor to and fro he is like a ship that at anchor rides and swings with the rising and falling tides and tugs at her anchortow voices mysterious far and near sound of the wind and sound of the sea are calling and whispering in his ear simon danz why stayest thou here come forth and follow me so he thinks he shall take to the sea again for one more cruise with his buccaneers to singe the beard of the king of spain and capture another dean of jaen and sell him in algiers castles in spain how much of my young heart o spain went out to thee in days of yore what dreams romantic filled my brain and summoned back to life again the paladins of charlemagne the cid campeador and shapes more shadowy than these in the dim twilight half revealed phoenician galleys on the seas the roman camps like hives of bees the goth uplifting from his knees pelayo on his shield it was these memories perchance from annals of remotest eld that lent the colors of romance to every trivial circumstance and changed the form and countenance of all that i beheld old towns whose history lies hid in monkish chronicle or rhyme burgos the birthplace of the cid zamora and valladolid toledo built and walled amid the wars of wambas time the long straight line of the highway the distant town that seems so near the peasants in the fields that stay their toil to cross themselves and pray when from the belfry at midday the angelus they hear white crosses in the mountain pass mules gay with tassels the loud din of muleteers the tethered ass that crops the dusty wayside grass and cavaliers with spurs of brass alighting at the inn white hamlets hidden in fields of wheat white cities slumbering by the sea white sunshine flooding square and street dark mountainranges at whose feet the riverbeds are dry with heat all was a dream to me yet something sombre and severe oer the enchanted landscape reigned a terror in the atmosphere as if king philip listened near or torquemada the austere his ghostly sway maintained the softer andalusian skies dispelled the sadness and the gloom there cadiz by the seaside lies and sevilles orangeorchards rise making the land a paradise of beauty and of bloom there cordova is hidden among the palm the olive and the vine gem of the south by poets sung and in whose mosque ahmanzor hung as lamps the bells that once had rung at compostellas shrine but over all the rest supreme the star of stars the cynosure the artists and the poets theme the young mans vision the old mans dream

ode upon his death which gained her the title of divine once more once more inarime i see thy purple hills once more i hear the billows of the bay wash the white pebbles on thy shore high oer the

it is she who lived and loved so long ago pescaras beautiful young wife the type of perfect womanhood whose life was love the life of life that time and change and death withstood for death that breaks the marriage band in others only closer pressed the weddingring upon her hand and closer locked and barred her breast she knew the lifelong martyrdom the weariness the endless pain of waiting for some one to come who nevermore would come again the shadows of the chestnuttrees the odor of the orange blooms the song of birds and more than these the silence of deserted rooms the respiration of the sea the soft caresses of the air all things in nature seemed to be but ministers of her despair till the oerburdened heart so long imprisoned in itself found vent and voice in one impassioned song of inconsolable lament then as the sun though hidden from sight transmutes to gold the leaden mist her life was interfused with light from realms that though unseen exist inarime inarime thy

caves savage unmerciful into the fatal snare the white chief with yellow hair and his three hundred men dashed headlong sword in hand but of that gallant band not one returned again the sudden darkness of death overwhelmed them like the breath and smoke of a furnace fire by the rivers bank and between the rocks of the ravine they lay in their bloody attire but the foemen fled in the night

october mr thomas prince loquitur a fleet with flags arrayed sailed from the port of brest and the admirals ship displayed the signal steer southwest for this admiral danville had sworn by cross and crown to ravage with fire and steel our helpless boston town there were rumors in the street in the houses there was fear of the coming of the fleet and the danger hovering near and while from mouth to mouth spread the tidings of dismay i stood in the old south saying humbly let us pray o lord we would not advise but if in thy providence a tempest should arise to drive the french fleet hence and scatter it far and wide or sink it in the sea we should be satisfied and thine the glory be this was the prayer i made for my soul was all on flame and even as i prayed the answering tempest came it came with a mighty power shaking the windows and walls and tolling the bell in the tower as it tolls at funerals the lightning suddenly unsheathed its flaming sword and i cried stand still and see the salvation of the lord the heavens were black with cloud the sea was white with hail and ever more fierce and loud blew the october gale the fleet it overtook and the broad sails in the van like the tents of cushan shook or the curtains of midian down on the reeling decks crashed the oerwhelming seas ah never were there wrecks so pitiful as these like a potters vessel broke the great ships of the line they were carried away as a smoke or sank like lead in the brine o lord before thy path they vanished and ceased to be when thou didst walk in wrath with thine horses through the sea the leap of

the rest of those who once the world possessed theyre gone with all their pomp and show theyre gone the way that thou shalt go o thou who choosest for thy share the world and what the world calls fair take all that it can give or lend but know that death is at the end haroun al raschid bowed his head tears fell upon the page he read king trisanku viswamitra the magician by his spells and

of inchkenneth he would wall himself round with a fort the three kings three kings came riding from far away melchior and gaspar and baltasar three wise men out of the east were they and they travelled by night and they slept by day for their guide was a beautiful wonderful star the star was so beautiful large and clear that all the other stars of the sky became a white mist in the atmosphere and by this they knew that the coming was near of the prince foretold in the prophecy three caskets they bore on their saddlebows three caskets of gold with golden keys their robes were of crimson silk with rows of bells and pomegranates and furbelows their turbans like blossoming almondtrees and so the three kings rode into the west through the dusk of night over hill and dell and sometimes they nodded with beard on breast and sometimes talked as they paused to rest with the people they met at some wayside well of the child that is born said baltasar good people i pray you tell us the news for we in the east have seen his star and have ridden fast and have ridden far to find and worship the king of the jews and the people answered you ask in vain we know of no king but herod the great they thought the wise men were men insane as they spurred their horses across the plain like riders in haste and who cannot wait and when they came to jerusalem herod the great who had heard this thing sent for the wise men and questioned them and said go down unto bethlehem and bring me tidings of this new king so they rode away and the star stood still the only one in the gray of morn yes it stopped it stood still of its own free will right over bethlehem on the hill the city of david where christ was born and the three kings rode through the gate and the guard through the silent street till their horses turned and neighed as they entered the great innyard but the windows were closed and the doors were barred and only a light in the stable burned and cradled there in the scented hay in the air made sweet by the breath of kine the little child in the manger lay the child that would be king one day of a kingdom not human but divine his mother mary of nazareth sat watching beside his place of rest watching the even flow of his breath for the joy of life and the terror of death were mingled together in her breast they laid their offerings at his feet the gold was their tribute to a king the frankincense with its odor sweet was for the priest the paraclete the myrrh for the bodys burying and the mother wondered and bowed her head and sat as still as a statue of stone her heart was troubled yet comforted remembering what the angel had said of an endless reign and of davids throne then the kings rode out of the city gate with a clatter of hoofs in proud array but they went not back to herod the great for they knew his malice and feared his hate and returned to their homes by another way song stay stay at home my heart and rest homekeeping

see in the chamber over the gate that old man desolate weeping and wailing sore for his son who is no more o absalom my son is it so long ago that cry of human woe from the walled city came calling on his dear name that it has died away in the distance of today o absalom my son there is no far or near there is neither there nor here there is neither soon nor late in that chamber over the gate nor any long ago to that cry of human woe o absalom my son from the ages that are past the voice sounds like a blast over seas that wreck and drown over tumult of traffic and town and from ages yet to be come the echoes back to me o absalom my son somewhere at every hour the watchman on the tower looks forth and sees the fleet approach of the hurrying feet of messengers that bear the tidings of despair o absalom my son he goes forth from the door who shall return no more with him our joy departs the light goes out in our hearts in the chamber over the gate we sit disconsolate o absalom my

armchair to the children of cambridge who presented to me on my seventysecond birthday february this chair made from the wood of the village blacksmiths chestnut tree am i a king that i should call my own this splendid ebon throne or by what reason or what right divine can i proclaim it mine only perhaps by right divine of song it may to me belong only because the spreading chestnut tree of old was sung by me well i remember it in all its prime when in the summertime the affluent foliage of its branches made a cavern of cool shade there by the blacksmiths forge beside the street its blossoms white and sweet enticed the bees until it seemed alive and murmured like a hive and when the winds of autumn with a shout tossed its great arms about the shining chestnuts bursting from the sheath dropped to the ground beneath and now some fragments of its branches bare shaped as a stately chair have by my hearthstone found a home at last and whisper of the past the danish king could not in all his pride repel the ocean tide but seated in this chair i can in rhyme roll back the tide of time i see again as one in vision sees the blossoms and the bees and hear the childrens voices shout and call and the brown chestnuts fall i see the smithy with its fires aglow i hear the bellows blow and the shrill hammers on the anvil beat the iron white with heat and thus dear children have ye made for me this day a jubilee and to my more than threescore years and ten brought back my youth again the heart hath its own memory like the mind and in it are enshrined the precious keepsakes into which is wrought the givers loving thought only your love and your remembrance could give life to this dead wood and make these branches leafless now so long blossom again in song jugurtha how cold are thy baths apollo cried the african monarch the splendid as down to his death in the hollow dark dungeons of rome he descended uncrowned unthroned unattended how cold are thy baths apollo how cold are thy baths apollo cried the poet unknown unbefriended as the vision that lured him to follow with the mist and the darkness blended and the dream of his life was ended how cold are thy baths apollo the iron pen made from a fetter of bonnivard the prisoner of chillon the handle of wood from the frigate constitution and bound with a circlet of gold inset with three precious stones from siberia ceylon and maine i thought this pen would arise from the casket where it lies of itself would arise and write my thanks and my surprise when you gave it me under the pines i dreamed these gems from the mines of siberia ceylon and maine would glimmer as thoughts in the lines that this iron link from the chain of bonnivard might retain some verse of the poet who sang of the prisoner and his pain that this wood from the frigates mast might write me a rhyme at last as it used to write on the sky the song of the sea and the blast but motionless as i wait like a bishop lying in state lies the pen with its mitre of gold and its jewels inviolate then must i speak and say that the light of that summer day in the garden under the pines shall not fade and pass away i shall see you standing there caressed by the fragrant air with the shadow on your face and the sunshine on your hair i shall hear the sweet low tone of a voice before unknown saying this is from me to you from me and to you alone and in words not idle and vain i shall answer and thank you again for the gift and the grace of the gift o beautiful helen of maine and forever this gift will be as a blessing from you to me as a drop of the dew of your youth on the leaves of an aged tree robert burns i see amid the fields of ayr a ploughman who in foul and fair sings at his task so clear we know not if it is the laverocks song we hear or his nor care to ask for him the ploughing of those fields a more ethereal harvest yields than sheaves of grain songs flush with purple bloom the rye the plovers call the curlews cry sing in his brain touched by his hand the wayside weed becomes a flower the lowliest reed beside the stream is clothed with beauty gorse and grass and heather where his footsteps pass the brighter seem he sings of love whose flame illumes the darkness of lone cottage rooms he feels the force the treacherous undertow and stress of wayward passions and no less the keen remorse at moments wrestling with his fate his voice is harsh but not with hate the brushwood hung above the tavern door lets fall its bitter leaf its drop of gall upon his tongue but still the music of his song rises oer all elate and strong its masterchords are manhood freedom brotherhood its discords but an interlude between the words and then to die so young and leave unfinished what he might achieve yet better sure is this than wandering up and down an old man in a country town infirm and poor for now he haunts his native land as an immortal youth his hand guides every plough he sits beside each inglenook his voice is in each rushing brook each rustling bough his presence haunts this room tonight a form of mingled mist and light from that far coast welcome beneath this roof of mine welcome this vacant chair is thine dear guest and ghost helen of tyre what phantom is this that appears through the purple mist of the years itself but a mist like these a woman of cloud and of fire it is she it is helen of tyre the town in the midst of the seas o tyre in thy crowded streets the phantom appears and retreats and the israelites that sell thy lilies and lions of brass look up as they see her pass and murmur jezebel then another phantom is seen at her side in a gray gabardine with beard that floats to his waist it is simon magus the seer he speaks and she pauses to hear the words he utters in haste he says from this evil fame from this life of sorrow and shame i will lift thee and make thee mine thou hast been queen candace and helen of troy and shalt be the intelligence divine oh sweet as the breath of morn to the fallen and forlorn are whispered words of praise for the famished heart believes the falsehood that tempts and deceives and the promise that betrays so she follows from land to land the wizards beckoning hand as a leaf is blown by the gust till she vanishes into night o reader stoop down and write with thy finger in the dust o town in the midst of the seas with thy rafts of cedar trees thy merchandise and thy ships thou too art become as naught a phantom a shadow a thought a name upon mens lips elegiac dark is the morning with mist in the narrow mouth of the harbor motionless lies the sea under its curtain of cloud dreamily glimmer the sails of ships on the distant horizon like to the towers of a town built on the verge of the sea slowly and stately and still they sail forth into the ocean with them sail my thoughts over the limitless deep farther and farther away borne on by unsatisfied longings unto hesperian isles unto ausonian shores now they have vanished away have disappeared in the ocean sunk are the towers of the town into the depths of the sea au have vanished but those that moored in the neighboring roadstead sailless at anchor ride looming so large in the mist vanished too are the thoughts the dim unsatisfied longings sunk are the turrets of cloud into the ocean of dreams while in a haven of rest my heart is riding at anchor held by the chains of love held by the anchors of trust old st davids at radnor what an image of peace and rest is this little church among its graves all is so quiet the troubled breast the wounded spirit the heart oppressed here may find the repose it craves see how the ivy climbs and expands over this humble hermitage and seems to caress with its little hands the rough gray stones as a child that stands caressing the wrinkled cheeks of age you cross the threshold and dim and small is the space that serves for the shepherds fold the narrow aisle the bare white wall the pews and the pulpit quaint and tall whisper and say alas we are old herberts chapel at bemerton hardly more spacious is than this but poet and pastor blent in one clothed with a splendor as of the sun that lowly and holy edifice it is not the wall of stone without that makes the building small or great but the souls light shining round about and the faith that overcometh doubt and the love that stronger is than hate were i a pilgrim in search of peace were i a pastor of holy church more than a bishops diocese should i prize this place of rest and release from farther longing and farther search here would i stay and let the world with its distant thunder roar and roll storms do not rend the sail that is furled nor like a dead leaf tossed and whirled in an eddy of wind is the anchored soul folk songs the sifting of peter in st lukes gospel we are told how peter in the days of old was sifted and now though ages intervene sin is the same while time and scene are shifted satan desires us great and small as wheat to sift us and we all are tempted not one however rich or great is by his station or estate exempted no house so safely guarded is but he by some device of his can enter no heart hath armor so complete but he can pierce with arrows fleet its centre for all at last the cock will crow who hear the warning voice but go unheeding till thrice and more they have denied the man of sorrows crucified and bleeding one look of that pale suffering face will make us feel the deep disgrace of weakness we shall be sifted till the strength of selfconceit be changed at length to meekness wounds of the soul though healed will ache the reddening scars remain and make confession lost innocence returns no more we are not what we were before transgression but noble souls through dust and heat rise from disaster and defeat the stronger and conscious still of the divine within them lie on earth supine no longer maiden and weathercock maiden o weathercock on the village spire with your golden feathers all on fire tell me what can you see from your perch above there over the tower of the church weathercock i can see the roofs and the streets below and the people moving to and fro and beyond without either roof or street the great salt sea and the fishermans fleet i can see a ship come sailing in beyond the headlands and harbor of lynn and a young man standing on the deck with a silken kerchief round his neck now he is pressing it to his lips and now he is kissing his fingertips and now he is lifting and waving his hand and blowing the kisses toward the land maiden ah that is the ship from over the sea that is bringing my lover back to me bringing my lover so fond and true who does not change with the wind like you weathercock if i change with all the winds that blow it is only because they made me so and people would think it wondrous strange if i a weathercock should not change o pretty maiden so fine and fair with your dreamy eyes and your golden hair when you and your lover meet today you will thank me for looking some other way the windmill behold a giant am i aloft here in my tower with my granite jaws i devour the maize and the wheat and the rye and grind them into flour i look down over the farms in the fields of grain i see the harvest that is to be and i fling to the air my arms for i know it is all for me i hear the sound of flails far off from the threshingfloors in barns with their open doors and the wind the wind in my sails louder and louder roars i stand here in my place with my foot on the rock below and whichever way it may blow i meet it face to face as a brave man meets his foe and while we wrestle and strive my master the miller stands and feeds me with his hands for he knows who makes him thrive who makes him lord of lands on sundays i take my rest churchgoing bells begin their low melodious din i cross my arms on my breast and all is peace within the tide rises the tide falls the tide rises the tide falls the twilight darkens the curlew calls along the seasands damp and brown the traveller hastens toward the town and the tide rises the tide falls darkness settles on roofs and walls but the sea in the darkness calls and calls the little waves with their soft white hands efface the footprints in the sands and the tide rises the tide falls the morning breaks the steeds in their stalls stamp and neigh as the hostler calls the day returns but nevermore returns the traveller to the shore and the tide rises the tide falls sonnets my cathedral like two cathedral towers these stately pines uplift their fretted summits tipped with cones the arch beneath them is not built with stones not art but nature traced these lovely lines and carved this graceful arabesque of vines no organ but the wind here sighs and moans no sepulchre conceals a martyrs bones no marble bishop on his tomb reclines enter the pavement carpeted with leaves gives back a softened echo to thy tread listen the choir is singing all the birds in leafy galleries beneath the eaves are singing listen ere the sound be fled and learn there may be worship with out words the burial of the poet richard henry dana in the old churchyard of his native town and in the ancestral tomb beside the wall we laid him in the sleep that comes to all and left him to his rest and his renown the snow was falling as if heaven dropped down white flowers of paradise to strew his pall the dead around him seemed to wake and call his name as worthy of so white a crown and now the moon is shining on the scene and the broad sheet of snow is written oer with shadows cruciform of leafless trees as once the windingsheet of saladin with chapters of the koran but ah more mysterious and triumphant signs are these night into the darkness and the hush of night slowly the landscape sinks and fades away and with it fade the phantoms of the day the ghosts of men and things that haunt the light the crowd the clamor the pursuit the flight the unprofitable splendor and display the agitations and the cares that prey upon our hearts all vanish out of sight the better life begins the world no more molests us all its records we erase from the dull commonplace book of our lives that like a palimpsest is written oer with trivial incidents of time and place and lo the ideal hidden beneath revives lenvoi the poet and his songs as the birds come in the spring we know not from where as the stars come at evening from depths of the air as the rain comes from the cloud and the brook from the ground as suddenly low or loud out of silence a sound as the grape comes to the vine the fruit to the tree as the wind comes to the pine and the tide to the sea as come the white sails of ships oer the oceans verge as comes the smile to the lips the foam to the surge so come to the poet his songs all hitherward blown from the misty realm that belongs to the vast unknown his and not his are the lays he sings and their fame is his and not his and the praise and the pride of a name for voices pursue him by day and haunt him by night and he listens and needs must obey when the angel says write in the harbor becalmed becalmed upon the sea of thought still unattained the land it sought my mind with looselyhanging sails lies waiting the auspicious gales on either side behind before the ocean stretches like a floor a level floor of amethyst crowned by a golden dome of mist blow breath of inspiration blow shake and uplift this golden glow and fill the canvas of the mind with wafts of thy celestial wind blow breath of song until i feel the straining sail the lifting keel the life of the awakening sea its motion and its mystery the poets calendar january janus am i oldest of potentates forward i look and backward and below i count as god of avenues and gates the years that through my portals come and go i block the roads and drift the fields with snow i chase the wildfowl from the frozen fen my frosts congeal the rivers in their flow my fires light up the hearths and hearts of men february i am lustration and the sea is mine i wash the sands and headlands with my tide my brow is crowned with branches of the pine before my chariotwheels the fishes glide by me all things unclean are purified by me the souls of men washed white again een the unlovely tombs of those who died without a dirge i cleanse from every stain march i martius am once first and now the third to lead the year was my appointed place a mortal dispossessed me by a word and set there janus with the double face hence i make war on all the human race i shake the cities with my hurricanes i flood the rivers and their banks efface and drown the farms and hamlets with my rains april i open wide the portals of the spring to welcome the procession of the flowers with their gay banners and the birds that sing their song of songs from their aerial towers i soften with my sunshine and my showers the heart of earth with thoughts of love i glide into the hearts of men and with the hours upon the bull with wreathed horns i ride may hark the seafaring wildfowl loud proclaim my coming and the swarming of the bees these are my heralds and behold my name is written in blossoms on the hawthorntrees i tell the mariner when to sail the seas i waft oer all the land from far away the breath and bloom of the hesperides my birthplace i am maia i am may june mine is the month of roses yes and mine the month of marriages all pleasant sights and scents the fragrance of the blossoming vine the foliage of the valleys and the heights mine are the longest days the loveliest nights the mowers scythe makes music to my ear i am the mother of all dear delights i am the fairest daughter of the year july my emblem is the lion and i breathe the breath of libyan deserts oer the land my sickle as a sabre i unsheathe and bent before me the pale harvests stand the lakes and rivers shrink at my command and there is thirst and fever in the air the sky is changed to brass the earth to sand i am the emperor whose name i bear august the emperor octavian called the august i being his favorite bestowed his name upon me and i hold it still in trust in memory of him and of his fame i am the virgin and my vestal flame burns less intensely than the lions rage sheaves are my only garlands and i claim the golden harvests as my heritage september i bear the scales where hang in equipoise the night and day and when unto my lips i put my trumpet with its stress and noise fly the white clouds like tattered sails of ships the treetops lash the air with sounding whips southward the clamorous seafowl wing their flight the hedges are all red with haws and hips the hunters moon reigns empress of the night october my ornaments are fruits my garments leaves woven like cloth of gold and crimson dyed i do not boast the harvesting of sheaves oer orchards and oer vineyards i preside though on the frigid scorpion i ride the dreamy air is full and overflows with tender memories of the summertide and mingled voices of the doves and crows november the centaur sagittarius am i born of ixions and the clouds embrace with sounding hoofs across the earth i fly a steed thessalian with a human face sharp winds the arrows are with which i chase the leaves half dead already with affright i shroud myself in gloom and to the race of mortals bring nor comfort nor delight december riding upon the goat with snowwhite hair i come the last of all this crown of mine is of the holly in my hand i bear the thyrsus tipped with fragrant cones of pine i celebrate the birth of the divine and the return of the saturnian reign my songs are carols sung at every shrine proclaiming peace on earth good will to men autumn within it is autumn not without but within me is the cold youth and spring are all about it is i that have grown old birds are darting through the air singing building without rest life is stirring everywhere save within my lonely breast there is silence the dead leaves fall and rustle and are still beats no flail upon the sheaves comes no murmur from the mill the four lakes of madison four limpid lakes four naiades or sylvan deities are these in flowing robes of azure dressed four lovely handmaids that uphold their shining mirrors rimmed with gold to the fair city in the west by day the coursers of the sun drink of these waters as they run their swift diurnal round on high by night the constellations glow far down the hollow deeps below and glimmer in another sky fair lakes serene and full of light fair town arrayed in robes of white how visionary ye appear all like a floating landscape seems in cloudland or the land of dreams bathed in a golden atmosphere victor and vanquished as one who long hath fled with panting breath before his foe bleeding and near to fall i turn and set my back against the wall and look thee in the face triumphant death i call for aid and no one answereth i am alone with thee who conquerest all yet me thy threatening form doth not appall for thou art but a phantom and a wraith wounded and weak sword broken at the hilt with armor shattered and without a shield i stand unmoved do with me what thou wilt i can resist no more but will not yield this is no tournament where cowards tilt the vanquished here is victor of the field moonlight as a pale phantom with a lamp ascends some ruins haunted stair so glides the moon along the damp mysterious chambers of the air now hidden in cloud and now revealed as if this phantom full of pain were by the crumbling walls concealed and at the windows seen again until at last serene and proud in all the splendor of her light she walks the terraces of cloud supreme as empress of the night i look but recognize no more objects familiar to my view the very pathway to my door is an enchanted avenue all things are changed one mass of shade the elmtrees drop their curtains down by palace park and colonnade i walk as in a foreign town the very ground beneath my feet is clothed with a diviner air white marble paves the silent street and glimmers in the empty square illusion underneath there lies the common life of every day only the spirit glorifies with its own tints the sober gray in vain we look in vain uplift our eyes to heaven if we are blind we see but what we have the gift of seeing what we bring we find the childrens crusade a fragment i what is this i read in history full of marvel full of mystery difficult to understand is it fiction is it truth children in the flower of youth heart in heart and hand in hand ignorant of what helps or harms without armor without arms journeying to the holy land who shall answer or divine never since the world was made such a wonderful crusade started forth for palestine never while the world shall last will it reproduce the past never will it see again such an army such a band over mountain over main journeying to the holy land like a shower of blossoms blown from the parent trees were they like a flock of birds that fly through the unfrequented sky holding nothing as their own passed they into lands unknown passed to suffer and to die o the simple childlike trust o the faith that could believe what the harnessed ironmailed knights of christendom had failed by their prowess to achieve they the children could and must little thought the hermit preaching holy wars to knight and baron that the words dropped in his teaching his entreaty his beseeching would by childrens hands be gleaned and the staff on which he leaned blossom like the rod of aaron as a summer wind upheaves the innumerable leaves in the bosom of a wood not as separate leaves but massed all together by the blast so for evil or for good his resistless breath upheaved all at once the manyleaved manythoughted multitude in the tumult of the air rock the boughs with all the nests cradled on their tossing crests by the fervor of his prayer troubled hearts were everywhere rocked and tossed in human breasts for a century at least his prophetic voice had ceased but the air was heated still by his lurid words and will as from fires in faroff woods in the autumn of the year an unwonted fever broods in the sultry atmosphere ii in cologne the bells were ringing in cologne the nuns were singing hymns and canticles divine loud the monks sang in their stalls and the thronging streets were loud with the voices of the crowd underneath the city walls silent flowed the river rhine from the gates that summer day clad in robes of hodden gray with the red cross on the breast azureeyed and goldenhaired forth the young crusaders fared while above the band devoted consecrated banners floated fluttered many a flag and streamer and the cross oer all the rest singing lowly meekly slowly give us give us back the holy sepulchre of the redeemer on the vast procession pressed youths and maidens iii ah what master hand shall paint how they journeyed on their way how the days grew long and dreary how their little feet grew weary how their little hearts grew faint ever swifter day by day flowed the homeward river ever more and more its whitening current broke and scattered into spray till the calmlyflowing river changed into a mountain torrent rushing from its glacier green down through chasm and black ravine like a phoenix in its nest burned the red sun in the west sinking in an ashen cloud in the east above the crest of the sealike mountain chain like a phoenix from its shroud came the red sun back again now around them white with snow closed the mountain peaks below headlong from the precipice down into the dark abyss plunged the cataract white with foam and it said or seemed to say oh return while yet you may foolish children to your home there the holy city is but the dauntless leader said faint

mountains southern slope lies jerusalem the holy as a white rose in its pride by the wind in summertide tossed and loosened from the branch showers its petals oer the ground from the distant mountains side scattering all its snows around with mysterious muffled sound loosened fell the avalanche voices echoes far and near roar of winds and waters blending mists uprising clouds impending filled them with a sense of fear formless nameless never ending sundown the summer sun is sinking low only the treetops redden and glow only the weathercock on the spire of the neighboring church is a flame of fire all is in shadow below o beautiful awful summer day what hast thou given what taken away life and death and love and hate homes made happy or desolate hearts made sad or gay on the road of life one milestone more in the book of life one leaf turned oer like a red seal is the setting sun on the good and the evil men have done naught can today restore chimes sweet chimes that in the loneliness of night salute the passing hour and in the dark and silent chambers of the household mark the movements of the myriad orbs of light through my closed eyelids by the inner sight i see the constellations in the arc of their great circles moving on and hark i almost hear them singing in their flight better than sleep it is to lie awake oercanopied by the vast starry dome of the immeasurable sky to feel the slumbering world sink under us and make hardly an eddy a mere rush of foam on the great sea beneath a sinking keel four by the clock nahant september four oclock in the morning four by the clock and yet not day but the great world rolls and wheels away with its cities on land and its ships at sea into the dawn that is to be only the lamp in the anchored bark sends its glimmer across the dark and the heavy breathing of the sea is the only sound that comes to me auf wiedersehen in memory of jtf until we meet again that is the meaning of the familiar words that men repeat at parting in the street ah yes till then but when death intervening rends us asunder with what ceaseless pain we wait for the again the friends who leave us do not feel the sorrow of parting as we feel it who must stay lamenting day by day and knowing when we wake upon the morrow we shall not find in its accustomed place the one beloved face it were a double grief if the departed being released from earth should still retain a sense of earthly pain it were a double grief if the truehearted who loved us here should on the farther shore remember us no more believing in the midst of our afflictions that death is a beginning not an end we cry to them and send farewells that better might be called predictions being foreshadowings of the future thrown into the vast unknown faith overleaps the confines of our reason and if by faith as in old times was said women received their dead raised up to life then only for a season our partings are nor shall we wait in vain until we meet again elegiac verse i peradventure of old some bard in ionian islands walking alone by the sea hearing the wash of the waves learned the secret from them of the beautiful verse elegiac breathing into his song motion and sound of the sea for as the wave of the sea upheaving in long undulations plunges loud on the sands pauses and turns and retreats so the hexameter rising and singing with cadence sonorous falls and in refluent rhythm back the pentameter flows ii not in his youth alone but in age may the heart of the poet bloom into song as the gorse blossoms in autumn and spring iii

dreams are and sudden as sleep lifegiving deathgiving which will it be o breath of the merciful merciless sea memories oft i remember those whom i have known in other days to whom my heart was led as by a magnet and who are not dead but absent and their memories overgrown with other thoughts and troubles of my own as graves with grasses are and at their head the stone with moss and lichens so oerspread nothing is legible but the name alone and is it so with them after long years do they remember me in the same way and is the memory pleasant as to me i fear to ask yet wherefore are my fears pleasures like flowers may wither and decay and yet the root perennial may be hermes trismegistus as seleucus narrates hermes describes the principles that rank as wholes in two myriads of books or as we are informed by manetho he perfectly unfolded these principles in three myriads six thousand five hundred and twentyfive volumes our ancestors dedicated the inventions of their wisdom to this deity inscribing all their own writings with the name of hermes iamblicus still through egypts desert places flows the lordly nile from its banks the great stone faces gaze with patient smile still the pyramids imperious pierce the cloudless skies and the sphinx stares with mysterious solemn stony eyes but where are the old egyptian demigods and kings nothing left but an inscription graven on stones and rings where are helios and hephaestus gods of eldest eld where is hermes trismegistus who their secrets held where are now the many hundred thousand books he wrote by the thaumaturgists plundered lost in lands remote in oblivion sunk forever as when oer the land blows a stormwind in the river sinks the scattered sand something unsubstantial ghostly seems this theurgist in deep meditation mostly wrapped as in a mist vague phantasmal and unreal to our thought he seems walking in a world ideal in a land of dreams was he one or many merging name and fame in one like a stream to which converging many streamlets run till with gathered power proceeding ampler sweep it takes downward the sweet waters leading from unnumbered lakes by the nile i see him wandering pausing now and then on the mystic union pondering between gods and men half believing wholly feeling with supreme delight how the gods themselves concealing lift men to their height or in thebes the hundredgated in the thoroughfare breathing as if consecrated a diviner air and amid discordant noises in the jostling throng hearing far celestial voices of olympian song who shall call his dreams fallacious who has searched or sought all the unexplored and spacious universe of thought who in his own skill confiding shall with rule and line mark the borderland dividing human and divine trismegistus three times

egypt lately found i in the vast weedencumbered sombre stately graveyard of the past and a presence moved before me on that gloomy shore as a waft of wind that oer me breathed and was no more to the avon flow on sweet river like his verse who lies beneath this sculptured hearse nor wait beside the churchyard wall for him who cannot hear thy call thy playmate once i see him now a boy with sunshine on his brow and hear in stratfords quiet street the patter of his little feet i see him by thy shallow edge wading kneedeep amid the sedge and lost in thought as if thy stream were the swift river of a dream he wonders whitherward it flows and fain would follow where it goes to the wide world that shall erelong be filled with his melodious song flow on fair stream that dream is oer he stands upon another shore a vaster river near him flows and still he follows where it goes president garfield e venni dal martirio a questa pace these words the poet heard in paradise uttered by one who bravely dying here in the true faith was living in that sphere where the celestial cross of sacrifice spread its protecting arms athwart the skies and set thereon like jewels crystal clear the souls magnanimous that knew not fear flashed their effulgence on his dazzled eyes ah me how dark the discipline of pain were not the suffering followed by the sense of infinite rest and infinite release this is our consolation and again a great soul cries to us in our suspense i came from martyrdom unto this peace my books sadly as some old mediaeval knight gazed at the arms he could no longer wield the sword twohanded and the shining shield suspended in the hall and full in sight while secret longings for the lost delight of tourney or adventure in the field came over him and tears but half concealed trembled and fell upon his beard of white so i behold these books upon their shelf my ornaments and arms of other days not wholly useless though no longer used for they remind me of my other self younger and stronger and the pleasant ways in which i walked now clouded and confused mad river in the white mountains traveller why dost thou wildly rush and roar mad river o mad river wilt thou not pause and cease to pour thy hurrying headlong waters oer this rocky shelf forever what secret trouble stirs thy breast why all this fret and flurry dost thou not know that what is best in this too restless world is rest from overwork and worry the river what wouldst thou in these mountains seek o stranger from the city is it perhaps some foolish freak of thine to put the words i speak into a plaintive ditty traveller yes i would learn of thee thy song with all its flowing number and in a voice as fresh and strong as thine is sing it all day long and hear it in my slumbers the river a brooklet nameless and unknown was i at first resembling a little child that all alone comes venturing down the stairs of stone irresolute and trembling later by wayward fancies led for the wide world i panted out of the forest dark and dread across the open fields i fled like one pursued and haunted i tossed my arms i sang aloud my voice exultant blending with thunder from the passing cloud the wind the forest bent and bowed the rush of rain descending i heard the distant ocean call imploring and entreating drawn onward oer this rocky wall i plunged and the loud waterfall made answer to the greeting and now beset with many ills a toilsome life i follow compelled to carry from the hills these logs to the impatient mills below there in the hollow yet something ever cheers and charms the rudeness of my labors daily i water with these arms the cattle of a hundred farms and have the birds for neighbors men call me mad and well they may when full of rage and trouble i burst my banks of sand and clay and sweep their wooden bridge away like withered reeds or stubble now go and write thy little rhyme as of thine own creating thou seest the day is past its prime i can no longer waste my time the mills are tired of waiting possibilities where are the poets unto whom belong the olympian heights whose singing shafts were sent straight to the mark and not from bows half bent but with the utmost tension of the thong where are the stately argosies of song whose rushing keels made music as they went sailing in search of some new continent with all sail set and steady winds and strong

have slept on the ground before and started to your feet at the cannons sudden roar or the drums redoubling beat but in this camp of death no sound your slumber breaks here is no fevered breath no wound that bleeds and aches all is repose and peace untrampled lies the sod the shouts of battle cease it is the truce of god rest comrades rest and sleep the thoughts of men shall be as sentinels to

knocking at thy door they are in haste and cannot wait and once departed come no more awake arise the athletes arm loses its strength by too much rest the fallow land the untilled farm produces only weeds at best loss and gain when i compare what i have lost with what i have gained what i have missed with what attained little room do i find for pride i am aware how many days have been idly spent

tide inscription on the shanklin fountain o traveller stay thy weary feet drink of this fountain pure and sweet it flows for rich and poor the same then go thy way remembering still the wayside well beneath the hill the cup of water in his name the bells of san blas what say the bells of san blas to the ships that southward pass from the harbor of mazatlan to them it is nothing more than the sound of surf on the shore nothing more to master or man but to me a dreamer of dreams to whom what is and what seems are often one and the same the bells of san blas to me have a strange wild melody and are something more than a name for bells are the voice of the church they have tones that touch and search the hearts of young and old one sound to all yet each lends a meaning to their speech and the meaning is manifold they are a voice of the past of an age that is fading fast of a power austere and grand when the flag of spain unfurled its folds oer this western world and the priest was lord of the land the chapel that once looked down on the little seaport town has crumbled into the dust and on oaken beams below the bells swing to and fro and are green with mould and rust is then the old faith dead they say and in its stead is some new faith proclaimed that we are forced to remain naked to sun and rain unsheltered and ashamed once in our tower aloof we rang over wall and roof our warnings and our complaints and round about us there the white doves filled the air like the white souls of the saints the saints ah have they grown forgetful of their own are they asleep or dead that open to the sky their ruined missions lie no longer tenanted oh bring us back once more the vanished days of yore when the world with faith was filled bring back the fervid zeal the hearts of fire and steel the hands that believe and build then from our tower again we will send over land and main our voices of command like exiled kings who return to their thrones and the people learn that the priest is lord of the land o bells of san blas in vain ye call back the past again the past is deaf to your prayer out of the shadows of night the world rolls into light it is daybreak everywhere fragments october neglected record of a mind neglected unto what lets and stops art thou subjected the day with all its toils and occupations the night with its reflections and sensations the future and the present and the past all i remember feel and hope at last all shapes of joy and sorrow as they pass find but a dusty image in this glass august o faithful indefatigable tides that evermore upon gods errands go now seaward bearing tidings of the land now landward bearing tidings of the sea and filling every frith and estuary each arm of the great sea each little creek each thread and filament of watercourses full with your ministration of delight under the rafters of this wooden bridge i see you come and go sometimes in haste to reach your journeys end which being done with feet unrested ye return again and recommence the neverending task patient whatever burdens ye may bear and fretted only by the impeding rocks december soft through the silent air descend the feathery snowflakes white are the distant hills white are the neighboring fields only the marshes are brown and the river rolling among them weareth the leaden hue seen in the eyes of the blind august a lovely morning without the glare of the sun the sea in great commotion chafing and foaming so from the bosom of darkness our days come roaring and gleaming chafe and break into foam sink into darkness again but on the shores of time each leaves some trace of its passage though the succeeding wave washes it out from the sand christus a mystery introitus the angel bearing the prophet habakkuk through the air prophet why dost thou bear me aloft o angel of god on thy pinions oer realms and dominions softly i float as a cloud in air for thy right hand upholds me thy garment enfolds me angel lo as i passed on my way in the harvestfield i beheld thee when no man compelled thee bearing with thine own hands this food to the famishing reapers a flock without keepers the fragrant sheaves of the wheat made the air above them sweet sweeter and more divine was the scent of the scattered grain that the reapers hand let fall to be gathered again by the hand of the gleaner sweetest divinest of all was the humble deed of thine and the meekness of thy demeanor prophet angel of light i cannot gainsay thee i can but obey thee angel beautiful was it in the lords sight to behold his prophet feeding those that toil the tillers of the soil but why should the reapers eat of it and not the prophet of zion in the den of the lion the prophet should feed the prophet therefore i thee have uplifted and bear thee aloft by the hair of thy head like a cloud that is drifted through the vast unknown of the air five days hath the prophet been lying in babylon in the den of the lions deathdefying defying hunger and thirst but the worst is the mockery of men alas how full of fear is the fate of prophet and seer forevermore forevermore it shall be as it hath been heretofore the age in which they live will not forgive the splendor of the everlasting light that makes their foreheads bright nor the sublime forerunning of their time prophet oh tell me for thou knowest wherefore and by what grace have i who am least and lowest been chosen to this place to this exalted part angel because thou art the struggler and from thy youth thy humble and patient life hath been a strife and battle for the truth nor hast thou paused nor halted nor ever in thy pride turned from the poor aside but with deed and word and pen hast served thy fellowmen therefore art thou exalted prophet by thine arrows light thou goest onward through the night and by the clear sheen of thy glittering spear when will our journey end angel lo it is ended yon silver gleam is the euphrates stream let us descend into the city splendid into the city of gold prophet behold as if the stars had fallen from their places into the firmament below the streets the gardens and the vacant spaces with light are all aglow and hark as we draw near what sound is it i hear ascending through the dark angel the tumultuous noise of the nations their rejoicings and lamentations the pleadings of their prayer the groans of their despair the cry of their imprecations their wrath their love their hate prophet surely the world doth wait the coming of its redeemer angel awake from thy sleep o dreamer the hour is near though late awake write the vision sublime the vision that is for a time though it tarry wait it is nigh in the end it will speak and not lie part one the divine tragedy the first passover i vox clamantis john the baptist repent

appointed the hour so long foretold by the prophets of old of the coming of the anointed the messiah the paraclete the desire of the nations is nigh he shall not strive nor cry nor his voice be heard in the street nor the bruised reed shall he break nor quench the smoking flax and many of them that sleep in the dust of earth shall awake on that great and terrible day and the wicked shall wail and weep and be blown like a smoke away and be melted away like wax repent repent repent o priest and pharisee who hath warned you to flee from the wrath that is to be from the coming anguish and ire the axe is laid at the root of the trees and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire ye scribes why come ye hither in the hour that is uncertain in the day of anguish and trouble he that stretcheth the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent shall blow upon you and ye shall wither and the whirlwind shall take you away as stubble repent repent

christ john priest of jerusalem in meekness and humbleness i deny not i confess i am not the christ priest what shall we say unto them that sent us here reveal thy name and naught conceal art thou elias john no priest art thou that prophet then of lamentation and woe who as a symbol and sign of impending wrath divine upon unbelieving men shattered the vessel of clay in the valley of slaughter john nay i am not he thou namest priest who art thou and what is the word that here thou proclaimest john i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness alone prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight in the land that is desolate priest if thou be not the christ nor yet elias nor he that in sign of the things to be shattered the vessel of clay in the valley of slaughter then declare unto us and say by what authority now baptizest thou john i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i and higher the latchet of whose shoes i an not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you with fire and with the holy ghost whose fan is in his hand he will purge to the uttermost his floor and garner his wheat but will burn the chaff in the brand and

invisible these boughs asunder and move and murmur as the wind upheaves and whispers in the leaves not as a terror and a desolation not in my natural shape inspiring fear and dread will i appear but in soft tones of sweetness and persuasion a sound as of the fall of mountain streams or voices heard in dreams he sitteth there in silence worn and wasted with famine and uplifts his hollow eyes to the unpitying skies for forty days and nights he hath not tasted of food or drink his parted lips are pale surely his strength must fail wherefore dost thou in penitential fasting waste and consume

by bread alone but by each word that from gods mouth proceedeth ii lucifer too weak alas too weak is the temptation for one whose soul to nobler things aspires than sensual desires ah could i by some sudden aberration lend and delude to suicidal death this christ of nazareth unto the holy temple on moriah with its resplendent domes and manifold bright pinnacles of gold where they await thy coming o messiah lo i have brought thee let thy glory here be manifest and clear reveal thyself by royal act and gesture descending with the bright triumphant host of all the hithermost archangels and about thee as a vesture the shining clouds and all thy splendors show unto the world below cast thyself down it is the hour appointed and god hath given his angels charge and care to keep thee and upbear

have been and shall be no more the things that are and that hereafter shall he the things that might have been and yet were not the fading twilight of great joys departed the daybreak of great truths as yet unrisen the intuition and the expectation of something which when come is not the same but only like its forecast in mens dreams the longing the delay and the delight sweeter for the delay youth hope love death and disappointment which is also death all these make up the sum of human life a dream within a dream a wind at night howling across the desert in despair seeking for something lost it cannot find fate or foreseeing or whatever name men call it matters not what is to be hath been forewritten in the thought divine from the beginning none can hide from it but it will find him out nor run from it but it oertaketh him the lord hath said it the bridegroom to the bride on the balcony when abraham went with sarah into egypt the land was all illumined with her beauty but thou

nathanael can any good come out of nazareth can this be the messiah philip come and see nathanael the summer sun grows hot i am anhungered how cheerily the sabbathbreaking quail pipes in the corn and bids us to his feast of wheat sheaves how the bearded ripening ears toss in the roofless temple of the air as if the unseen hand of some highpriest waved them before mount tabor as an altar it were no harm if we should pluck and eat philip how wonderful it is to walk abroad with the good master since the miracle he wrought at cana at the marriage feast his fame hath gone abroad through all the land and when we come to nazareth thou shalt see how his own people will receive their prophet and hail him as messiah see he turns and looks at thee christus behold an israelite in whom there is no guile nathanael whence knowest thou me christus before that philip called thee when thou wast under the figtree i beheld thee nathanael rabbi thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel christus because i said i saw thee under the figtree before philip called thee believest thou thou shalt see greater things hereafter thou shalt see the heavens unclosed the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man phairisees passing hail rabbi christus hail pharisees behold how thy disciples do a thing which is not lawful on the sabbathday and thou forbiddest them not christus have ye not read what david did when he anhungered was and all they that were with him how he entered into the house of god and ate the shewbread which was not lawful saving for the priests have ye not read how on the sabbathdays the priests profane the sabbath in the temple and yet are blameless but i say to you one in this place is greater than the temple and had ye known the meaning of the words i will have mercy and not sacrifice the guiltless ye would not condemn the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath passes on with the disciples pharisees this is alas some poor demoniac wandering about the fields and uttering his unintelligible blasphemies among the common people who receive as prophecies the words they comprehend not deluded folk the incomprehensible alone excites their wonder there is none so visionary or so void of sense but he will find a crowd to follow him v nazareth christus reading in the synagogue the spirit of the lord god is upon me he hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the poor to heal the brokenhearted to comfort those that mourn and to throw open the prison doors of captives and proclaim the year acceptable of the lord our god he closes the book and sits down a pharisee who is this youth he hath taken the teachers seat will he instruct the elders a priest fifty years have i been priest here in the synagogue and never have i seen so young a man sit in the teachers seat christus behold today this scripture is fulfilled one is appointed and hath been sent to them that mourn in zion to give them beauty for ashes and the oil of joy for mourning they shall build again the old wasteplaces and again raise up the former desolations and repair the cities that are wasted as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments as a bride adorneth herself with jewels so the lord hath clothed me with the robe of righteousness a priest he speaks the prophets words but with an air as if himself had been foreshadowed in them christus for zions sake i will not hold my peace and for jerusalems sake i will not rest until its righteousness be as a brightness and its salvation as a lamp that burneth thou shalt be called no longer the forsaken nor any more thy land the desolate the lord hath sworn by his right hand hath sworn and by his arm of strength i will no more give to thine enemies thy corn as meat the sons of strangers shall not drink thy wine go through go through the gates prepare a way unto the people gather out the stones lift up a standard for the people a priest ah these are seditious words christus and they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of god and thou jerusalem shalt be called sought out a city not forsaken a pharisee is not this the carpenter josephs son is not his mother called mary and his brethren and his sisters are they not with us doth he make himself to be a prophet christus no man is a prophet in his own country and among his kin in his own house no prophet is accepted i say to you in the land of israel were many widows in elijahs day when for three years and more the heavens were shut and a great famine was throughout the land but unto no one was elijah sent save to sarepta to a city of sidon and to a woman there that was a widow and many lepers were then in the land of israel in the time of eliseus the prophet and yet none of them was cleansed save naaman the syrian a priest say no more thou comest here into our synagogue and speakest to the elders and the priests as if the very mantle of elijah had fallen upon thee are thou not ashamed a pharisee we want no prophets here let him be driven from synagogue and city let him go and prophesy to the samaritans an elder the world is changed we elders are as nothing we are but yesterdays that have no part or portion in today dry leaves that rustle that make a little sound and then are dust a pharisee a carpenters apprentice a mechanic whom we have seen at work here in the town day after day a stripling without learning shall he pretend to unfold the word of god to men grown old in study of the law christus is thrust out vi the sea of galilee peter and andrew mending their nets peter never was such a marvellous draught of fishes heard of in galilee the marketplaces both of bethsaida and capernaum are full of them yet we had toiled all night and taken nothing when the master said launch out into the deep and cast your nets and doing this we caught such multitudes our nets like spiders webs were snapped asunder and with the draught we filled two ships so full that they began to sink then i knelt down amazed and said o lord depart from me i am a sinful man and he made answer simon fear not henceforth thou shalt catch men what was the meaning of those words andrew i know not but here is philip come from nazareth he hath been with the master tell us philip what tidings dost thou bring philip most wonderful as we drew near to nain out of the gate upon a bier was carried the dead body of a young man his mothers only son and she a widow who with lamentation bewailed her loss and the much people with her and when the master saw her he was filled with pity and he said to her weep not and came and touched the bier and they that bare it stood still and then he said young man arise and he that had been dead sat up and soon began to speak and he delivered him unto his mother and there came a fear on all the people and they glorified the lord and said rejoicing a great prophet is risen up among us and the lord hath visited his people peter a great prophet ay greater than a prophet greater even than john the baptist philip yet the nazarenes rejected him peter the nazarenes are dogs as natural brute beasts they growl at things they do not understand and they shall perish utterly perish in their own corruption the nazarenes are dogs philip they drave him forth out of their synagogue out of their city and would have cast him down a precipice but passing through the midst of them he vanished out of their hands peter wells are they without water clouds carried with a tempest unto whom the mist of darkness is reserved forever philip behold he cometh there is one man with him i am amazed to see andrew what man is that philip judas iscariot he that cometh last girt with a leathern apron no one knoweth his history but the rumor of him is he had an unclean spirit in his youth it hath not left him yet christus passing come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest come unto me and take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and i am lowly in heart and ye shall all find rest unto your souls philip oh there is something in that voice that reaches the innermost recesses of my spirit i feel that it might say unto the blind receive your sight and straightway they would see i feel that it might say unto the dead arise and they would hear it and obey behold he beckons to us christus to peter and andrew follow me peter master i will leave all and follow thee vii the demoniac of gadara a gadarene he hath escaped hath plucked his chains asunder and broken his fetters always night and day is in the mountains here and in the tombs crying aloud and cutting himself with stones exceeding fierce so that no man can tame him the demoniac from above unseen o aschmedai o aschmedai have pity a gadarene listen it is his voice go warn the people just landing from the lake the demoniac o aschmedai thou angel of the bottomless pit have pity it was enough to hurl king solomon on whom be peace two hundred leagues away into the country and to make him scullion in the kitchen of the king of maschkemen why dost thou hurl me here among these rocks and cut me with these stones a gadarene he raves and mutters he knows not what the demoniac appearing from a tomb among the rocks the wild cock tarnegal singeth to me and bids me to the banquet where all the jews shall come for they have slain behemoth the great ox who daily cropped a thousand hills for food and at a draught drank up the river jordan and have slain the huge leviathan and stretched his skin upon the high walls of jerusalem and made them shine from one end of the world unto the other and the fowl barjuchne whose outspread wings eclipse the sun and make midnight at noon oer all the continents and we shall drink the wine of paradise from adams cellars a gadarene o thou unclean spirit the demoniac hurling down a stone this is the wonderful barjuchnes egg that fell out of her nest and broke to pieces and swept away three hundred cedartrees and threescore villages rabbi eliezer how thou didst sin there in that seaport town when thou hadst carried safe thy chest of silver over the seven rivers for her sake i too have sinned beyond the reach of pardon ye hills and mountains pray for mercy on me ye stars and planets pray for mercy on me ye sun and moon oh pray for mercy on me christus and his disciples pass a gadarene there is a man here of decapolis who hath an unclean spirit so that none can pass this way he lives among the tombs up there upon the cliffs and hurls down stones on those who pass beneath christus come out of him thou unclean spirit the demoniac what have i to do with thee thou son of god do not torment us christus what is thy name the demoniac legion for we are many cain the first murderer and the king belshazzar and evil merodach of babylon and admatha the deathcloud prince of persia and aschmedai the angel of the pit and many other devils we are legion send us not forth beyond decapolis command us not to go into the deep there is a herd of swine here in the pastures let us go into them christus come out of him thou unclean spirit a gadarene see how stupefied how motionless he stands he cries no more he seems bewildered and in silence stares as one who walking in his sleep awakes and knows not where he is and looks about him and at his nakedness and is ashamed the demoniac why am i here alone among the tombs what have they done to me that i am naked ah woe is me christus go home unto thy friends and tell them how great things the lord hath done for thee and how he had compassion on thee a swineherd running the herds the herd o most unlucky day they were all feeding quiet in the sun when suddenly they started and grew savage as the wild boars of tabor and together rushed down a precipice into the sea they are all drowned peter thus righteously are punished the apostate jews that eat the flesh of swine and broth of such abominable things greeks of gadara we sacrifice a sow unto demeter at the beginning of harvest and another to dionysus at the vintagetime therefore we prize our herds of swine and count them not as unclean but as things consecrate to the immortal gods o great magician depart out of our coasts let us alone we are afraid of thee peter let us depart for they that sanctify and purify themselves in gardens eating flesh of swine and the abomination and the mouse shall be consumed together saith the lord viii talitha cumi jairus at the feet of christus o master i entreat thee i implore thee my daughter lieth at the point of death i pray thee come and lay thy hands upon her and she shall live christus who was it touched my garments simon peter thou seest the multitude that throng and press thee and sayest thou who touched me t was not i christus some one hath touched my garments i perceive that virtue is gone out of me a woman o master forgive me for i said within myself if i so much as touch his garments hem i shall be whole christus be of good comfort daughter thy faith hath made thee whole depart in peace a messenger from the house why troublest thou the master hearest thou not the flute players and the voices of the women singing their lamentation she is dead the minstrels and mourners we have girded ourselves with sackcloth we have covered our heads with ashes for our young men die and our maidens swoon in the streets of the city and into their mothers bosom they pour out their souls like water christus going in give place why make ye this ado and weep she is not dead but sleepeth the mother from within cruel death to take away front me this tender blossom to take away my dove my lamb my darling the minstrels and mourners he hath led me and brought into darkness like the dead of old in dark places he hath bent his bow and hath set me apart as a mark for his arrow he hath covered himself with a cloud that our prayer should not pass through and reach him the crowd he stands beside her bed he takes her hand listen he speaks to her christus within maiden arise the crowd see she obeys his voice she stirs she lives her mother holds her folded in her arms o miracle of miracles o marvel ix the tower of magdala mary magdalene companionless unsatisfied forlorn i sit here in this lonely tower and look upon the lake below me and the hills that swoon with heat and see as in a vision all my past life unroll itself before me the princes and the merchants come to me merchants of tyre and princes of damascus and pass and disappear and are no more but leave behind their merchandise and jewels their perfumes and their gold and their disgust i loathe them and the very memory of them is unto me as thought of food to one cloyed with the luscious figs of dalmanutha what if hereafter in the long hereafter of endless joy or pain or joy in pain it were my punishment to be with them grown hideous and decrepit in their sins and hear them say thou that hast brought us here be unto us as thou hast been of old i look upon this raiment that i wear these silks and these embroideries and they seem only as cerements wrapped about my limbs i look upon these rings thick set with pearls and emerald and amethyst and jasper and they are burning coals upon my flesh this serpent on my wrist becomes alive away thou viper and away ye garlands whose odors bring the swift remembrance back of the unhallowed revels in these chambers but yesterday and yet it seems to me something remote like a pathetic song sung long ago by minstrels in the street but yesterday as from this tower i gazed over the olive and the walnut trees upon the lake and the white ships and wondered whither and whence they steered and who was in them a fishers boat drew near the landingplace under the oleanders and the people came up from it and passed beneath the tower close under me in front of them as leader walked one of royal aspect clothed in white who lifted up his eyes and looked at me and all at once the air seemed filled and living with a mysterious power that streamed from him and overflowed me with an atmosphere of light and love as one entranced i stood and when i woke again lo he was gone so that i said perhaps it is a dream but from that very hour the seven demons that had their habitation in this body which men call beautiful departed from me this morning when the first gleam of the dawn made lebanon a glory in the air and all below was darkness i beheld an angel or a spirit glorified with windtossed garments walking on the lake the face i could not see but i distinguished the attitude and gesture and i knew t was he that healed me and the gusty wind brought to mine ears a voice which seemed to say be of good cheer t is i be not afraid and from the darkness scarcely heard the answer if it be thou bid me come unto thee upon the water and the voice said come and then i heard a cry of fear lord save me as of a drowning man and then the voice why didst thou doubt o thou of little faith at this all vanished and the wind was hushed and the great sun came up above the hills and the swiftflying vapors hid themselves in caverns among the rocks oh i must find him and follow him and be with him forever thou box of alabaster in whose walls the souls of flowers lie pent the precious balm and spikenard of arabian farms the spirits of aromatic herbs ethereal natures nursed by the sun and dew not all unworthy to bathe his consecrated feet whose step makes every threshold holy that he crosses let us go forth upon our pilgrimage thou and i only let us search for him until we find him and pour out our souls before his feet till all thats left of us shall be the broken caskets that once held us x the house of simon the pharisee a guest at table are ye deceived have any of the rulers believed on him or do they know indeed this man to be the very christ howbeit we know whence this man is but when the christ shall come none knoweth whence he is christus whereunto shall i liken then the men of this generation and what are they like they are like children sitting in the markets and calling unto one another saying we have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have mourned unto you and ye have not wept this say i unto you for john the baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine ye say he hath a devil the son of man eating and drinking cometh and ye say behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber behold a friend of publicans and sinners a guest aside to simon who is that woman yonder gliding in so silently behind him simon it is mary who dwelleth in the tower of magdala the guest see how she kneels there weeping and her tears fall on his feet and her long golden hair waves to and fro and wipes them dry again and now she kisses them and from a box of alabaster is anointing them with precious ointment filling all the house with its sweet odor simon aside oh this man forsooth were he indeed a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this may be that toucheth him would know she is a sinner christus simon somewhat have i to say to thee simon master say on christus a certain creditor had once two debtors and the one of them owed him five hundred pence the other fifty they having naught to pay withal he frankly forgave them both now tell me which of them will love him most simon he i suppose to whom he most forgave christus yea thou hast rightly judged seest thou this woman when thine house i entered thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath washed them with her tears and wiped them with her own hair thou gavest me no kiss this woman hath not ceased since i came in to kiss my feet my head with oil didst thou anoint not but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment hence i say to thee her sins which have been many are forgiven for she loved much the guests oh who then is this man that pardoneth also sins without atonement christus woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace the second passover i before the gates of machaerus manahem welcome o wilderness and welcome night and solitude and ye swiftflying stars that drift with golden sands the barren heavens welcome once more the angels of the wind hasten across the desert to receive me and sweeter than mens voices are to me the voices of these solitudes the sound of unseen rivulets and the faroff cry of bitterns in the reeds of waterpools and lo above me like the prophets arrow shot from the eastern window high in air the clamorous cranes go singing through the night o ye mysterious pilgrims of the air would i had wings that i might follow you i look forth from these mountains and behold the omnipotent and omnipresent night mysterious as the future and the fate that hangs oer all mens lives i see beneath me the desert stretching to the dead sea shore and westward faint and far away the glimmer of torches on mount olivet announcing the rising of the moon of passover like a great cross it seems on which suspended with head bowed down in agony i see a human figure hide o merciful heaven the awful apparition from my sight and thou machaerus lifting high and black thy dreadful walls against the rising moon haunted by demons and by apparitions lilith and jezerhara and bedargon how grim thou showest in the uncertain light a palace and a prison where king herod feasts with herodias while the baptist john fasts and consumes his unavailing life and in thy courtyard grows the untithed rue huge as the olives of gethsemane and ancient as the terebinth of hebron coeval with the world would that its leaves medicinal could purge thee of the demons that now possess thee and the cunning fox that burrows in thy walls contriving mischief music is heard from within angels of god sandalphon thou that weavest the prayers of men into immortal garlands and thou metatron who dost gather up their songs and bear them to the gates of heaven now gather up together in your hands the prayers that fill this prison and the songs that echo from the ceiling of this palace and lay them side by side before gods feet he enters the castle ii herods banquethall manahem thou hast sent for me o king and i am here herod who art thou manahem manahem the essenian herod i recognize thy features but what mean these torn and faded garments on thy road have demons crowded thee and rubbed against thee and given thee weary knees a cup of wine manahem the essenians drink no wine herod what wilt thou then manahem nothing herod not even a cup of water manahem nothing why hast thou sent for me herod dost thou remember one day when i a schoolboy in the streets of

thou smiling didst smite me with thy hand and saidst again thou shalt be king and let the friendly blows that manahem hath given thee on this day remind thee of the fickleness of fortune manahem what more herod no more manahem yea for i said to thee it shall be well with thee if thou love justice and clemency towards thy fellowmen hast thou done this o king herod go ask my people manahem and then

lawful i should marry my brother philips wife and john the baptist is here in prison in my fathers time matthias margaloth was put to death for tearing the golden eagle from its station above the

oath manahem bid me depart o king herod good manahem give me thy hand i love the essenians hes gone and hears me not the guests are dumb awaiting the pale face the silent witness the lamps flare and the curtains of the doorways wave to and fro as if a ghost were passing strengthen my heart red wine of ascalon iii under the walls of machaerus manahem rushing out away from this palace of sin the demons the terrible powers of the air that haunt its towers and hide in its waterspouts deafen me with the din of their laughter and their shouts for the crimes that are done within sink back into the earth or vanish into the air thou castle of despair let it all be but a dream of the things of monstrous birth of the things that only seem white angel of the moon onafiel be my guide out of this hateful place of sin and death nor hide in you black cloud too soon thy pale and tranquil face a trumpet is blown from the walls hark hark it is the breath of the trump of doom and death from the battlements overhead like a burden of sorrow cast on the midnight and the blast a wailing for the dead that the gusts drop and uplift o herod thy vengeance is swift o herodias thou hast been the demon the evil thing that in place of esther the queen in place of the lawful bride hast lain at night by the side of ahasuerus the king the trumpet again the prophet of god is dead at a drunken monarchs call at a dancingwomans beck they have severed that stubborn neck and into the banquethall are bearing the ghastly head a body is thrown from the tower a torch of red lights the window with its glow and a white mass as of snow is hurled into the abyss of the black precipice that yawns for it below o hand of the most high o hand of adonai bury it hide it away from the birds and beasts of prey and the eyes of the homicide more pitiless than they as thou didst bury of yore the body of him that died on the mountain of peor even now i behold a sign a threatening of wrath divine a watery wandering star through whose streaming hair and the white unfolding garments of light that trail behind it afar the constellations shine and the whiteness and brightness appear like the angel bearing the seer by the hair of his head in the might and rush of his vehement flight and i listen until i hear from fathomless depths of the sky the voice of his prophecy sounding louder and more near malediction malediction may the lightnings of heaven fall on palace and prison wall and their desolation be as the day of fear and affliction as the day of anguish and ire with the burning and fuel of fire in the valley of the sea iv nicodemus at night nicodemus the streets are silent the dark houses seem like sepulchres in which the sleepers lie wrapped in their shrouds and for the moment dead the lamps are all extinguished only one burns steadily and from the door its light lies like a shining gate across the street he waits for me ah should this be at last the longexpected christ i see him there sitting alone deepburied in his thought as if the weight of all the world were resting upon him and thus bowed him down o rabbi we know thou art a teacher come from god for no man can perform the miracles thou dost perform except the lord be with him thou art a prophet sent here to proclaim the kingdom of the lord behold in me a ruler of the jews who long have waited the coming of that kingdom tell me of it christus verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot behold the kingdom of god nicodemus be born again how can a man be born when he is old say can he enter for a second time into his mothers womb and so be born christus verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god for that which of the flesh is born is flesh and that which of the spirit is born is spirit nicodemus we israelites from the primeval man adam ahelion derive our bodies our souls are breathings of the holy ghost no more than this we know or need to know christus then marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born again nicodemus the mystery of birth and death we cannot comprehend christus the wind bloweth where it listeth and we hear the sound thereof but know not whence it cometh nor whither it goeth so is every one born of the spirit nicodemus aside how can these things be he seems to speak of some vague realm of shadows some unsubstantial kingdom of the air it is not this the jews are waiting for nor can this be the christ the son of david who shall deliver us christus art thou a master of israel and knowest not these things we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye will not receive our witness if i tell you earthly things and ye believe not how shall ye believe if i should tell you of things heavenly and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he alone that first came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven nicodemus aside this is a dreamer of dreams a visionary whose brain is overtasked until he deems the unseen world to be a thing substantial and this we live in an unreal vision and yet his presence fascinates and fills me with wonder and i feel myself exalted into a higher region and become myself in part a dreamer of his dreams a seer of his visions christus and as moses uplifted the serpent in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever shall believe in him shall perish not but have eternal life he that believes in him is not condemned he that believes not is condemned already nicodemus aside he speaketh like a prophet of the lord christus this is the condemnation that the light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil nicodemus aside of me he speaketh he reproveth me because i come by night to question him christus for every one that doeth evil deeds hateth the light nor cometh to the light lest he should be reproved nicodemus aside alas how truly he readeth what is passing in my heart christus but he that doeth truth comes to the light so that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god nicodemus alas alas v blind bartimeus bartimeus be not impatient chilion it is pleasant to sit here in the shadow of the walls under the palms and hear the hum of bees and rumor of voices passing to and fro and drowsy bells of caravans on their way to sidon or damascus this is still the city of palms and yet the walls thou seest are not the old walls not the walls where rahab hid the two spies and let them down by cords out of the window when the gates were shut and it was dark those walls were overthrown when joshuas army shouted and the priests blew with their seven trumpets chilion when was that bartimeus o my sweet rose of jericho i know not hundreds of years ago and over there beyond the river the great prophet elijah was taken by a whirlwind up to heaven in chariot of fire with fiery horses that is the plain of moab and beyond it rise the blue summits of mount abarim nebo and pisgah and peor where moses died whom the lord knew face to face and whom he buried in a valley and no man knows of his sepulchre unto this day chilion would thou couldst see these places as i see them bartimeus i have not seen a glimmer of the light since thou wast born i never saw thy face and yet i seem to see it and one day perhaps shall see it for there is a prophet in galilee the messiah the son of david who heals the blind if i could only find him i hear the sound of many feet approaching and voices like the murmur of a crowd what seest thou chilion a young man clad in white is coming through the gateway and a crowd of people follow bartimeus can it be the prophet o neighbors tell me who it is that passes one of the crowd jesus of nazareth bartimeus crying o son of david have mercy on me many op the crowd peace blind bartimeus do not disturb the master bartimeus crying more vehemently son of david have mercy on me one of the crowd see the master stops be of good comfort rise he calleth thee bartimeus casting away his cloak chilion good neighbors lead me on christus what wilt thou that i should do to thee bartimeus good lord my sight that i receive my sight christus receive thy sight thy faith hath made thee whole the crowd he sees again christus passes on the crowd gathers round bartimeus bartimeus i see again but sight bewilders me like a remembered dream familiar things come back to me i see the tender sky above me see the trees the city walls and the old gateway through whose echoing arch i groped so many years and you my neighbors but know you by your friendly voices only how beautiful the world is and how wide oh i am miles away if i but look where art thou chilion chilion father i am here bartimeus oh let me gaze upon thy face dear child for i have only seen thee with my hands how beautiful thou art i should have known thee thou hast her eyes whom we shall see hereafter o god of abraham elion adonai who art thyself a father pardon me if for a moment i have thee postponed to the affections and the thoughts of earth thee and the adoration that i owe thee when by thy power alone these darkened eyes have been unsealed again to see thy light vi jacobs well a samaritan woman the sun is hot and the dry eastwind blowing fills all the air with dust the birds are silent even the little fieldfares in the corn no longer twitter only the grasshoppers sing their incessant song of sun and summer i wonder who those strangers were i met going into the city galileans they seemed to me in speaking when they asked the short way to the marketplace perhaps they are fishermen from the lake or travellers looking to find the inn and here is some one sitting beside the well another stranger a galilean also by his looks what can so many jews be doing here together in samaria are they going up to jerusalem to the passover our passover is better here at sychem for here is ebal here is gerizim the mountain where our father abraham went up to offer isaac here the tomb of joseph for they brought his bones egypt and buried them in this land and it is holy christus give me to drink samaritan woman how can it be that thou being a jew askest to drink of me which am a woman of samaria you jews despise us have no dealings with us make us a byword call us in derision the silly folk of sychar sir how is it thou askest drink of me christus if thou hadst known the gift of god and who it is that sayeth give me to drink thou wouldst have asked of him he would have given thee the living water samaritan woman sir thou hast naught to draw with and the well is deep whence hast thou living water say art thou greater than our father jacob which gave this well to us and drank thereof himself and all his children and his cattle christus ah whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh the water i shall give him shall not thirst forevermore for it shall be within him a well of living water springing up into life everlasting samaritan woman every day i must go to and fro in heat and cold and i am weary give me of this water that i may thirst not nor come here to draw christus go call thy husband woman and come hither samaritan woman i have no husband sir christus thou hast well said i have no husband thou hast had five husbands and he whom now thou hast is not thy husband samaritan woman surely thou art a prophet for thou readest the hidden things of life our fathers worshipped upon this mountain gerizim and ye say the only place in which men ought to worship is at jerusalem christus believe me woman the hour is coming when ye neither shall upon this mount nor at jerusalem worship the father for the hour is coming and is now come when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth the father seeketh such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth samaritan woman master i know that the messiah cometh which is called christ and he will tell us all things christus i that speak unto thee am he the disciples returning behold the master sitting by the well and talking with a samaritan woman with a woman of sychar the silly people always boasting of their mount ebal and mount gerizim their everlasting mountain which they think higher and holier than our mount moriah why once upon the feast of the new moon when our great sanhedrim of jerusalem had all its watchfires kindled on the hills to warn the distant villages these people lighted up others to mislead the jews and make a mockery of their festival see she has left the master and is running back to the city samaritan woman oh come see a man who hath told me all things that i ever did say is

whence are they john moses and elias peter o master it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make three tabernacles for thee one and for moses and elias john behold a bright cloud sailing in the sun it overshadows us a golden mist now hides them from us and envelops us and all the mountains in a luminous shadow i see no more the nearest rocks are hidden voice from the cloud lo this is my beloved son hear him peter it is the voice of god he speaketh to us as from the burning bush he spake to moses john the cloudwreaths roll away the veil is lifted we see again behold he is alone it was a vision that our eyes beheld and it hath vanished into the unseen christus coming down from the mountain i charge ye tell the vision unto no one till the son of man is risen from the dead peter aside

hand and he is healed ah why could we not do it the father my poor child now thou art mine again the unclean spirit shall never more torment thee look at me speak unto me say that thou knowest me disciples to christus departing good master tell us for what reason was it we could not cast him out christus because of your unbelief viii the young ruler christus two men went up into the temple to pray the one was a selfrighteous pharisee the other a publican and the pharisee stood and prayed thus within himself o god i thank thee i am not as other men extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican i fast twice in the week and also i give tithes of all that i possess the publican standing afar off would not lift so much even as his eyes to heaven but smote his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner i tell you that this man went to his house more justified than the other every one that doth exalt himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted

is a marvellous thing ye know not whence he is yet he hath opened mine eyes we know that god heareth not sinners but if any man doeth gods will and is his worshipper him doth he hear oh since the world began it was not heard that any man hath opened the eyes of one that was born blind if he were not of god surely he could do nothing pharisees thou who wast altogether born in sins and in iniquities dost thou teach us away with thee out of the holy places thou reprobate thou beggar thou blasphemer the beggar is cast out xi simon magus and helen of tyre on the housetop at endor night a lighted lantern on a table simon swift are the blessed immortals to the mortal that perseveres so doth it stand recorded in the divine chaldaean oracles of zoroaster once ezekiels slave who in his native east betook himself to lonely meditation and the writing on the dried skins of oxen the twelve books of the avesta and the oracles therefore i persevere and i have brought thee from the great city of tyre where men deride the things they comprehend not to this plain of esdraelon in the hebrew tongue called armageddon and this town of endor where men believe where all the air is full of marvellous traditions and the enchantress that summoned up the ghost of samuel is still remembered thou hast seen the land is it not fair to look on helen it is fair yet not so fair as tyre simon is not mount tabor as beautiful as carmel by the sea helen it is too silent and too solitary i miss the tumult of the street the sounds of traffic and the going to and fro of people in gay attire with cloaks of purple and gold and silver jewelry simon inventions of abriman the spirit of the dark the evil spirit helen i regret the gossip of friends and neighbors at the open door on summer nights simon an idle waste of time helen the singing and the dancing the delight of music and of motion woe is me to give up all these pleasures and to lead the life we lead simon thou canst not raise thyself up to the level of my higher thought and though possessing thee i still remain apart from thee and with thee am alone in my high dreams helen happier was i in tyre oh i remember how the gallant ships came sailing in with ivory gold and silver and apes and peacocks and the singing sailors and the gay captains with their silken dresses smelling of aloes myrrh and cinnamon simon but the dishonor helen let the ships of tarshish howl for that helen and what dishonor remember rahab and how she became the ancestress of the great psalmist david and wherefore should not i helen of tyre attain like honor simon thou art helen of tyre and hast been helen of troy and hast been rahab the queen of sheha and semiramis and sara of seven husbands and jezebel and other women of the like allurements and now thou art minerva the first aeon the mother of angels helen and the concubine of simon the magician is it honor for one who has been all these noble dames to tramp about the dirty villages and cities of samaria with a juggler a charmer of serpents simon he who knows himself knows all things in himself i have charmed thee thou beautiful asp yet am i no magician i am the power of god and the beauty of god i am the paraclete the comforter helen illusions thou deceiver selfdeceived thou dost usurp the titles of another thou art not what thou sayest simon am i not then feel my power helen would i had neer left tyre he looks at her and she sinks into a deep sleep simon go see it in thy dreams fair unbeliever and leave me unto mine if they be dreams that take such shapes before me that i see them these effable and ineffable impressions of the mysterious world that come to me from the elements of fire and earth and water and the allnourishing ether it is written look not on nature for her name is fatal yet there are principles that make apparent the images of unapparent things and the impression of vague characters and visions most divine appear in ether so speak the oracles then wherefore fatal i take this orangebough with its five leaves each equidistant on the upright stem and i project them on a plane below in the circumference of a circle drawn about a centre where the stem is planted and each still equidistant from the other as if a thread of gossamer were drawn down from each leaf and fastened with a pin now if from these five points a line be traced to each alternate point we shall obtain the pentagram or solomons pentangle a charm against all witchcraft and a sign which on the banner of antiochus drove back the fierce barbarians of the north demons esteemed and gave the syrian king the sacred name of soter or of savior thus nature works mysteriously with man and from the eternal one as from a centre all things proceed in fire air earth and water and all are subject to one law which broken even in a single point is broken in all demons rush in and chaos comes again by this will i compel the stubborn spirits that guard the treasures hid in caverns deep on gerizim by uzzi the highpriest the ark and holy vessels to reveal their secret unto me and to restore these precious things to the samaritans a mist is rising from the plain below me and as i look the vapors shape themselves into strange figures as if unawares my lips had breathed the tetragrammaton and from their graves oer all the battlefields of armageddon the longburied captains had started with their thousands and ten thousands and rushed together to renew their wars powerless and weaponless and without a sound wake helen from thy sleep the air grows cold let us go down helen awaking oh would i were at home simon thou sayest that i usurp anothers titles in youth i saw the wise men of the east magalath and pangalath and saracen who followed the bright star but home returned for fear of herod by another way o shining worlds above me in what deep recesses of your realms of mystery lies hidden now that star and where are they that brought the gifts of frankincense and myrrh helen the nazarene still liveth simon we have heard his name in many towns but have not seen him he flits before us tarries not is gone when we approach like something unsubstantial made of the air and fading into air he is at nazareth he is at nain or at the lovely village on the lake or sailing on its waters helen so say those who do not wish to find him simon can this be the king of israel whom the wise men worshipped or does he fear to meet me it would seem so we should soon learn which of us twain usurps the titles of the other as thou sayest they go down the third passover i the entry into jerusalem the syrophoenician woman and her daughter on the housetop at jerusalem the daughter singing blind bartimeus at the gates of jericho in darkness waits he hears the crowd he hears a breath say it is christ of nazareth and calls in tones of agony greek text the thronging multitudes increase blind bartimeus hold thy peace but still above the noisy crowd the beggars cry is shrill and loud until they say he calleth thee greek text then saith the christ as silent stands the crowd what wilt thou at my hands and he replies oh give me light rabbi restore the blind mans sight and jesus answers greek text ye that have eyes yet cannot see in darkness and in misery recall those mighty voices three greek text greek text greek text the mother thy faith hath saved thee ah how true that is for i had faith and when the master came into the coasts of tyre and sidon fleeing from those who sought to slay him i went forth and cried unto him saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david for my daughter is grievously tormented with a devil but he passed on and answered not a word and his disciples said beseeching him send her away she crieth after us and then the master answered them and said i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel then i worshipped him saying lord help me and he answered me it is not meet to take the childrens bread and cast it unto dogs truth lord i said and yet the dogs may eat the crumbs which fall from off their masters table and he turned and answered me and said to me o woman great is thy faith then be it unto thee even as thou wilt and from that very hour thou wast made whole my darling my delight the daughter there came upon my dark and troubled mind a calm as when the tumult of the city suddenly ceases and i lie and hear the silver trumpets of the temple blowing their welcome to the sabbath still i wonder that one who was so far away from me and could not see me by his thought alone had power to heal me oh that i could see him the mother perhaps thou wilt for i have brought thee here to keep the holy passover and lay thine offering of thanksgiving on the altar thou mayst both see and hear him hark voices afar off hosanna the daughter a crowd comes pouring through the city gate o mother look voices in the street hosanna to the son of david the daughter a great multitude of people fills all the street and riding on an ass comes one of noble aspect like a king the people spread their garments in the way and scatter branches of the palmtrees voices blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest other voices who is this voices jesus of nazareth the daughter mother it is he voices he hath called lazarus of bethany out of his grave and raised him from the dead hosanna in the highest pharisees ye perceive that nothing we prevail behold the world is all gone after him the daughter what majesty what power is in that careworn countenance what sweetness what compassion i no longer wonder that he hath healed me voices peace in heaven and glory in the highest pharisees rabbi rabbi rebuke thy followers christus should they hold their peace the very stones beneath us would cry out the daughter all hath passed by me like a dream of wonder but i have seen him and have heard his voice and i am satisfied i ask no more ii solomons porch gamaliel the scribe when rabban simeon upon whom be peace taught in these schools he boasted that his pen had written no word that he could call his own but wholly and always had been consecrated to the transcribing of the law and prophets he used to say and never tired of saying the world itself was built upon the law and ancient hillel said that whosoever gains a good name gains something for himself but he who gains a knowledge of the law gains everlasting life and they spake truly great is the written law but greater still the unwritten the traditions of the elders the lovely words of levites spoken first to moses on the mount and handed down from mouth to mouth in one unbroken sound and sequence of divine authority the voice of god resounding through the ages the written law is water the unwritten is precious wine the written law is salt the unwritten costly spice the written law is but the body the unwritten the soul that quickens it and makes it breathe and live i can remember many years ago a little brighteyed schoolboy a mere stripling son of a galilean carpenter from nazareth i think who came one day and sat here in the temple with the scribes hearing us speak and asking many questions and we were all astonished at his quickness and when his mother came and said behold thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing he looked as one astonished and made answer how is it that ye sought me wist ye not that i must be about my fathers business often since then i see him here among us or dream i see him with his upraised face intent and eager and i often wonder unto what manner of manhood he hath grown perhaps a poor mechanic like his father lost in his little galilean village and toiling at his craft to die unknown and he no more remembered among men christus in the outer court the scribes and pharisees sit in moses seat all therefore whatsoever they command you observe and do but follow not their works they say and do not they bind heavy burdens and very grievous to be borne and lay them upon mens shoulders but they move them not with so much as a finger gamaliel looking forth who is this exhorting in the outer courts so loudly christus their works they do for to he seen of men they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments and they love the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in synagogues and greetings in the markets and to be called of all men rabbi rabbi gamaliel it is that loud and turbulent galilean that came here at the feast of dedication and stirred the people up to break the law christus woe unto you ye scribes and pharisees ye hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven and neither go ye in yourselves nor suffer them that are entering to go in gamaliel how eagerly the people throng and listen as if his ribald words were words of wisdom christus woe unto you ye scribes and pharisees ye hypocrites for ye devour the houses of widows and for pretence ye make long prayers therefore shall ye receive the more damnation gamaliel this brawler is no jew he is a vile samaritan and hath an unclean spirit christus woe unto you ye scribes and pharisees ye hypocrites ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make him twofold more the child of hell than you yourselves are gamaliel o my fathers father hillel of blessed memory hear and judge christus woe unto you ye scribes and pharisees ye hypocrites for ye pay tithe of mint of anise and of cumin and omit the weightier matters of the law of god judgment and faith and mercy and all these ye ought to have done nor leave undone the others gamaliel o rabban simeon how must thy bones stir in their grave to hear such blasphemies christus woe unto you ye scribes and pharisees ye hypocrites for ye make clean and sweet the outside of the cup and of the platter but they within are full of all excess gamaliel patience of god canst thou endure so long or art thou deaf or gone upon a journey christus woe unto you ye scribes and pharisees ye hypocrites for ye are very like to whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outwardly but are within filled full of dead mens bones and all uncleanness gamaliel am i awake is this jerusalem and are these jews that throng and stare and listen christus woe unto you ye scribes and pharisees ye hypocrites because ye build the tombs of prophets and adorn the sepulchres of righteous men and say if we had lived when lived our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of prophets so ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye are children of them that killed the prophets fill ye up then the measure of your fathers i send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes and some ye crucify and some scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city that on you may come the righteous blood that hath been shed on earth from the blood of righteous abel to the blood of zacharias son of barachias ye slew between the temple and the altar gamaliel oh had i here my subtle dialectician my little saul of tarsus the tentmaker whose wit is sharper than his needles point he would delight to foil this noisy wrangler christus jerusalem jerusalem o thou that killest the prophets and that stonest them which are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered together thy children as a hen gathereth her chickens underneath her wing and ye would not behold your house is left unto you desolate the people this is a prophet this is the christ that was to come gamaliel ye fools think ye shall christ come out of galilee iii lord is it i christus one of you shall betray me the disciples is it i lord is it i christus one of the twelve it is that dippeth with me in this dish his hand he shall betray me lo the son of man goeth indeed as it is written of him but woe shall be unto that man by whom he is betrayed good were it for that man if he had neer been born judas iscariot lord is it i christus ay

the shepherd saith the lord of hosts and scattered shall be the sheep but after i am risen i go before you into galilee peter o master though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will not i be christus simon behold how satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as one sifteth wheat whither i go thou canst not follow me not now but thou shalt follow me hereafter peter wherefore can i not follow thee i am ready to go with thee to prison and to death christus verily i say unto thee this night ere the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice peter though i should die yet will i not deny thee christus when first i sent you forth without a purse or scrip or shoes did ye lack anything the disciples not anything christus but he that hath a purse now let him take it and likewise his scrip and he that hath no sword let him go sell his clothes and buy one that which hath been written must be accomplished now he hath poured out his soul even unto death he hath been numbered with the transgressors and himself hath borne the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors and here have an end the things concerning me peter behold o lord behold here are two swords christus it is enough iv the garden of gethsemane christus my spirit is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye here and watch he goes apart peter under this ancient olivetree that spreads its broad centennial branches like a tent let us lie down and rest john what are those torches that glimmer on brook kedron there below us james it is some marriage feast the joyful maidens go out to meet the bridegroom peter i am weary the struggles of this day have overcome me they sleep christus falling on his face father all things are possible to thee oh let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt be done returning to the disciples what could ye not watch with me for one hour oh watch and pray that ye may enter not into temptation for the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak john alas it is for sorrow that our eyes are heavy i see again the glimmer of those torches among the olives they are coming hither james outside the garden wall the path divides surely they come not hither they sleep again christus as before o my father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink of it thy will be done returning to the disciples sleep on and take your rest john beloved master alas we know not what to answer thee it is for sorrow that our eves are heavy behold the torches now encompass us james they do but go about the garden wall seeking for some one or for something lost they sleep again christus as before if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink of it thy will be done returning to the disciples it is enough behold the son of man hath been betrayed into the hands of sinners the hour is come rise up let us be going for he that shall betray me is at hand john ah me see from his forehead in the torchlight great drops of blood are falling to the ground peter what lights are these what torches glare and glisten upon the swords and armor of these men and there among them judas iscariot he smites the servant of the highpriest with his sword christus put up thy sword into its sheath for they that take the sword shall perish with the sword the cup my father hath given me to drink shall i not drink it thinkst thou that i cannot pray to my father and that he shall give me more than twelve legions of angels presently judas to christus kissing him hail master hail christus friend wherefore art thou come whom seek ye captain of the temple jesus of nazareth christus i am he are ye come hither as against a thief with swords and staves to take me when i daily was with you in the temple ye stretched forth no hands to take me but this is your hour and this the power of darkness if ye seek me only let these others go their way the disciples depart christus is bound and led away a certain young aman follows him having a linen cloth cast about his body they lay hold of him and the young man flees from them naked v the palace of caiaphas pharisees what do we clearly something must we do for this man worketh many miracles caiaphas i am informed that he is a mechanic a carpenters son a galilean peasant keeping disreputable company pharisees the people say that here in bethany he hath raised up a certain lazarus who had been dead three days caiaphas impossible there is no resurrection of the dead this lazarus should be taken and put to death as an impostor if this galilean would be content to stay in galilee and preach in country towns i should not heed him but when he comes up to jerusalem riding in triumph as i am informed and drives the moneychangers from the temple that is another matter pharisees if we thus let him alone all will believe on him and then the romans come and take away our place and nation caiaphas ye know nothing at all simon ben camith my great predecessor on whom be peace would have dealt presently with such a demagogue i shall no less the man must die do ye consider not it is expedient that one man should die not the whole nation perish what is death it differeth from sleep but in duration we sleep and wake again an hour or two later or earlier and it matters not and if we never wake it matters not when we are in our graves we are at peace nothing can wake us or disturb us more there is no resurrection pharisees aside o most faithful disciple of hircanus maccabaeus will nothing but complete annihilation comfort and satisfy thee caiaphas while ye are talking and plotting and contriving how to take him fearing the people and so doing naught i who fear not the people have been acting have taken this prophet this young nazarene who by beelzebub the prince of devils casteth out devils and doth raise the dead that might as well be dead and left in peace annas my fatherinlaw hath sent him hither i hear the guard behold your galilean christus is brought in bound

openly to the world i have taught ever in the synagogue and in the temple where the jews resort in secret have said nothing wherefore then askest thou me of this ask them that heard me what i have said to them behold they know what i have said officer striking him what fellow answerest thou the highpriest so christus if i have spoken evil bear witness of the evil but if well why smitest thou me caiaphas where are the witnesses let them say what they know the two false witnesses we heard him say i will destroy this temple made with hands and will within three days build up another made without hands scribes and pharisees he is oerwhelmed with shame and cannot answer caiaphas dost thou answer nothing what is this thing they witness here against thee scribes and pharisees he holds his peace caiaphas tell us art thou the christ i do adjure thee by the living god tell us art thou indeed the christ christus i am hereafter shall ye see the son of man sit on the right hand of the power of god and come in clouds of heaven caiaphas rending his clothes it is enough he hath spoken blasphemy what further need have we of witnesses now ye have heard his blasphemy what think ye is he guilty scribes and pharisees guilty of death kinsman of malchus to peter in the vestibule surely i know thy face did i not see thee in the garden with him peter how couldst thou see me i swear unto thee i do not know this man of whom ye speak the cock crows hark the cock crows that sorrowful pale face seeks for me in the crowd and looks at me as if he would remind me of those words ere the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice goes out weeping christus is blindfolded and buffeted an officer striking him with his palm prophesy unto us thou christ thou prophet who is it smote thee caiaphas lead him unto pilate vi pontius pilate pilate wholly incomprehensible to me vainglorious obstinate and given up to unintelligible old traditions and proud and selfconceited are these jews not long ago i marched the legions down from caesarea to their winterquarters here in jerusalem with the effigies of caesar on their ensigns and a tumult arose among these jews because their law forbids the making of all images they threw themselves upon the ground with wild expostulations bared their necks and cried that they would sooner die than have their law infringed in any manner as if numa were not as great as moses and the laws of the twelve tables as their pentateuch and then again when i desired to span their valley with an aqueduct and bring a rushing river in to wash the city and its inhabitants they all rebelled as if they had been herds of unwashed swine thousands and thousands of them got together and raised so great a clamor round my doors that fearing violent outbreak i desisted and left them to their wallowing in the mire and now here comes the reverend sanhedrim of lawyers priests and scribes and pharisees like old and toothless mastiffs that can bark but cannot bite howling their accusations against a mild enthusiast who hath preached i know not what new doctrine being king of some vague kingdom in the other world that hath no more to do with rome and caesar than i have with the patriarch abraham finding this man to be a galilean i sent him straight to herod and i hope that is the last of it but if it be not i still have power to pardon and release him as is the custom at the passover and so accommodate the matter smoothly seeming to yield to them yet saving him a prudent and sagacious policy for roman governors in the provinces incomprehensible fanatic people ye have a god who seemeth like yourselves incomprehensible dwelling apart majestic cloudencompassed clothed in darkness one whom ye fear but love not yet ye have no goddesses to soften your stern lives and make you tender unto human weakness while we of rome have everywhere around us our amiable divinities that haunt the woodlands and the waters and frequent our households with their sweet and gracious presence i will go in and while these jews are wrangling read my ovidius on the art of love vii barabbas in prison barabbas to his fellowprisoners barabbas is my name barabbas the son of shame is the meaning i suppose im no better than the best and whether worse than the rest of my fellowmen who knows i was once to say it in brief a highwayman a robberchief in the open light of day so much i am free to confess but all men more or less are robbers in their way from my cavern in the crags from my lair of leaves and flags i could see like ants below the camels with their load of merchandise on the road that leadeth to jericho and i struck them unaware as an eagle from the air drops down upon bird or beast and i had my hearts desire of the merchants of sidon and tyre and damascus and the east but it is not for that i fear it is not for that i am here in these iron fetters bound sedition that is the word that pontius pilate heard and he liketh not the sound what think ye would he care for a jew slain here or there or a plundered caravan but caesar ah that is a crime to the uttermost end of time shall not be forgiven to man therefore was herod wroth with matthias margaloth and burned him for a show therefore his wrath did smite judas the gaulonite and his followers as ye know for that cause and no more am i here as i said before for one unlucky night jucundus the captain of horse was upon us with all his force and i was caught in the flight i might have fled with the rest but my dagger was in the breast of a roman equerry as we rolled there in the street they bound me hands and feet and this is the end of me who cares for death not i a thousand times i would die rather than suffer wrong already those women of mine are mixing the myrrh and the wine i shall not be with you long viii ecce homo pilate on the tessellated pavement in front of his palace ye have brought unto me this man as one who doth pervert the people and behold i have examined him and found no fault touching the things whereof ye do accuse him no nor yet herod for i sent you to him and nothing worthy of death he findeth in him ye have a custom at the passover that one condemned to death shall be released whom will ye then that i release to you jesus barabbas called the son of shame or jesus son of joseph called the christ the people shouting not this man but barabbas pilate what then will ye that i should do with him that is called christ the people crucify him pilate why what evil hath he done lo i have found no cause of death in him i will chastise him and then let him go the people more vehemently crucify him crucify him a messenger to pilate thy wife sends this message to thee have thou naught to do with that just man for i this day in dreams have suffered many things because of him pilate aside the gods speak to us in our dreams i tremble at what i have to do o claudia how shall i save him yet one effort more or he must perish washes his hands before them i am innocent of the blood of this just person see ye to it the people let his blood be on us and on our children voices within the palace put on thy royal robes put on thy crown and take thy sceptre hail thou king of the jews pilate i bring him forth to you that ye may know i find no fault in him behold the man christus is led in with the purple robe and crown of thorns chief priests and officers crucify him crucify him pilate take ye him i find no fault in him chief priests we have a law and by our law he ought to die because he made himself to be the son of god pilate aside ah there are sons of god and demigods more than ye know ye ignorant highpriests to christus whence art thou chief priests crucify him crucify him pilate to christus dost thou not answer me dost thou not know that i have power enough to crucify thee that i have also power to set thee free christus thou couldst have no power at all against me except that it were given thee from above therefore hath he that sent me unto thee the greater sin chief priests if thou let this man go thou art not caesars friend for whosoever maketh himself a king speaks against caesar pilate ye jews behold your king chief priests away with him crucify him pilate shall i crucify your king chief priests we have no king but caesar pilate take him then take him ye cruel and bloodthirsty priests more merciless than the plebeian mob who pity and spare the fainting gladiator bloodstained in roman amphitheatres take him and crucify him if ye will but if the immortal gods do ever mingle with the affairs of mortals which i doubt not and hold the attribute of justice dear they will commission the eumenides to scatter you to the four winds of heaven exacting tear for tear and blood for blood here take ye this inscription priests and nail it upon the cross above your victims head jesus of nazareth king of the jews chief priests nay we entreat write not the king of the jews but that he said i am the king of the jews pilate enough what i have written i have written ix aceldama judas iscariot lost lost forever lost i have betrayed the innocent blood o god if thou art love why didst thou leave me naked to the tempter why didst thou not commission thy swift lightning to strike me dead or why did i not perish with those by herod slain the innocent children who went with playthings in their little hands into the darkness of the other world as if to bed or wherefore was i born if thou in thy foreknowledge didst perceive all that i am and all that i must be i know i am not generous am not gentle like other men but i have tried to be and i have failed i thought by following him i should grow like him but the unclean spirit that from my childhood up hath tortured me hath been too cunning and too strong for me am i to blame for this am i to blame because i cannot love and neer have known the love of woman or the love of children it is a curse and a fatality a mark that hath been set upon my forehead that none shall slay me for it were a mercy that i were dead or never had been born too late too late i shall not see him more among the living that sweet patient face will never more rebuke me nor those lips repeat the words one of you shall betray me it stung me into madness how i loved yet hated him but in the other world i will be there before him and will wait until he comes and fall down on my knees and kiss his feet imploring pardon pardon i heard him say all sins shall be forgiven except the sin against the holy ghost that shall not be forgiven in this world nor in the world to come is that my sin have i offended so there is no hope here nor hereafter that i soon shall know o god have mercy christ have mercy on me throws himself headlong from the cliff x the three crosses manahem the essenian

the convent of flora in calabria night joachim the wind is rising it seizes and shakes the doors and windowblinds and makes mysterious moanings in the halls the conventchimneys seem almost the trumpets of some heavenly host setting its watch upon our walls where it listeth there it bloweth we hear the sound but no man knoweth whence it cometh or whither it goeth and thus it is with the holy ghost o breath of god o my delight in many a vigil of the night like the great voice in patmos heard by john the evangelist of the word i hear thee behind me saying write in a book the things that thou hast seen the things that are and that have been and the things that shall hereafter be this convent on the rocky crest of the calabrian hills to me a patmos is wherein i rest while round about me like a sea the white mists roll and overflow the world that lies unseen below in darkness and in mystery here in the spirit in the vast embrace of gods encircling arm am i uplifted from all harm the world seems something far away something belonging to the past a hostelry a peasants farm that lodged me for a night or day in which i care not to remain nor having left to see again thus in the hollow of gods hand i dwelt on sacred tabors height when as a simple acolyte i journeyed to the holy land a pilgrim for my masters sake and saw the galilean lake and walked through many a village street that once had echoed to his feet there first i heard the great command the voice behind me saying write and suddenly my soul became illumined by a flash of flame that left imprinted on my thought the image i in vain had sought and which forever shall remain as sometimes from these windows high gazing at midnight on the sky black with a storm of wind and rain i have beheld a sudden glare of lightning lay the landscape bare with tower and town and hill and plain distinct and burnt into my brain never to be effaced again and i have written these volumes three the apocalypse the harmony of the sacred scriptures new and old and the psalter with ten strings enfold within their pages all and each the eternal gospel that i teach well i remember the kingdom of heaven hath been likened to a little leaven hidden in two measures of meal until it leavened the whole mass so likewise will it come to pass with the doctrines that i here conceal open and manifest to me the truth appears and must be told all sacred mysteries are threefold three persons in the trinity three ages of humanity and holy scriptures likewise three of fear of wisdom and of love for wisdom that begins in fear endeth in love the atmosphere in which the soul delights to be and finds that perfect liberty which cometh only from above in the first age the early prime and dawn of all historic time the father reigned and face to face he spake with the primeval race bright angels on his errands sent sat with the patriarch in his tent his prophets thundered in the street his lightnings flashed his hailstorms beat in earthquake and in flood and flame in tempest and in cloud he came the fear of god is in his book the pages of the pentateuch are full of the terror of his name then reigned the son his covenant was peace on earth goodwill to man with him the reign of law began he was the wisdom and the word and sent his angels ministrant unterrified and undeterred to rescue souls forlorn and lost the troubled tempted tempesttost to heal to comfort and to teach the fiery tongues of pentecost his symbols were that they should preach in every form of human speech from continent to continent he is the light divine whose rays across the thousand years unspent shine through the darkness of our days and touch with their celestial fires our churches and our convent spires his book is the new testament these ages now are of the past and the third age begins at last the coming of the holy ghost the reign of grace the reign of love brightens the mountaintops above and the dark outline of the coast already the whole land is white with convent walls as if by night a snow had fallen on hill and height already from the streets and marts of town and traffic and low cares men climb the consecrated stairs with weary feet and bleeding hearts and leave the world and its delights its passions struggles and despairs for contemplation and for prayers in cloistercells of coenobites eternal benedictions rest upon thy name saint benedict founder of convents in the west who built on mount cassinos crest in the land of labor thine eagles nest may i be found not derelict in aught of faith or godly fear if i have written in many a page the gospel of the coming age the eternal gospel men shall hear oh may i live resembling thee and die at last as thou hast died so that hereafter men may see within the choir a form of air standing with arms outstretched in prayer as one that hath been crucified my work is finished i am strong in faith and hope and charity for i have written the things i see the things that have been and shall be conscious of right nor fearing wrong because i am in love with love and the sole thing i hate is hate for hate is death and love is life a peace a splendor from above and hate a neverending strife a smoke a blackness from the abyss where unclean serpents coil and hiss love is the holy ghost within hate the unpardonable sin who preaches otherwise than this betrays his master with a kiss part two the golden legend prologue the spire of strasburg cathedral night and storm lucifer with the powers of the air trying to tear down the cross lucifer hasten hasten o ye spirits from its station drag the ponderous cross of iron that to mock us is uplifted high in air voices oh we cannot for around it all the saints and guardian angels throng in legions to protect it they defeat us everywhere the bells laudo deum verum plebem voco congrego clerum lucifer lower lower hover downward seize the loud vociferous bells and clashing clanging to the pavement hurl them from their windy tower voices all thy thunders here are harmless for these bells have been anointed and baptized with holy water they defy our utmost power the bells defunctos ploro pestem fugo festa decoro lucifer shake the casements break the painted panes that flame with gold and crimson scatter them like leaves of autumn swept away before the blast voices oh we cannot the archangel michael flames from every window with the sword of fire that drove us headlong out of heaven aghast the bells funera plango fulgura frango sabbata pango lucifer aim your lightnings at the oaken massive ironstudded portals sack the house of god and scatter wide the ashes of the dead voices oh we cannot the apostles and the martyrs wrapped in mantles stand as warders at the entrance stand as sentinels oerhead the bells excito lentos dissipo ventos paco cruentos lucifer baffled baffled inefficient craven spirits leave this labor unto time the great destroyer come away ere night is gone

vigilemus omnes i the castle of vautsberg on the rhine a chamber in a tower prince henry sitting alone ill and restless midnight prince henry i cannot sleep my fervid brain calls up the vanished past again and throws its misty splendors deep into the pallid realms of sleep a breath from that fardistant shore comes freshening ever more and more and wafts oer intervening seas sweet odors from the hesperides a wind that through the corridor just stirs the curtain and no more and touching the aolian strings faints with the burden that it brings come back ye friendships long departed that like oerflowing streamlets started and now are dwindled one by one to stony channels in the sun come back ye friends whose lives are ended come back with all that light attended which seemed to darken and decay when ye arose and went away they come the shapes of joy and woe the airy crowds of long ago the dreams and fancies known of yore that have been and shall be no more they change the cloisters of the night into a garden of delight they make the dark and dreary hours open and blossom into flowers i would not sleep i love to be again in their fair company but ere my lips can bid them stay they pass and vanish quite away alas our memories may retrace each circumstance of time and place season and scene come back again and outward things unchanged remain the rest we cannot reinstate ourselves we can not recreate nor set our souls to the same key of the remembered harmony rest rest oh give me rest and peace the thought of life that neer shall cease has something in it like despair a weight i am too weak to bear sweeter to this afflicted breast the thought of neverending rest sweeter the undisturbed and deep tranquillity of endless sleep a flash of lightning out of which lucifer appears in the garb of a travelling physician lucifer all hail prince henry prince henry starting who is it speaks who and what are you lucifer one who seeks a moments audience with the prince prince henry when came you in lucifer a moment since i found your study door unlocked and thought you answered when i knocked prince henry i did not hear you lucifer you heard the thunder it was loud enough to waken the dead and it is not a matter of special wonder that when god is walking overhead you should not hear my feeble tread prince henry what may your wish or purpose be lucifer nothing or everything as it pleases your highness you behold in me only a travelling physician one of the few who have a mission to cure incurable diseases or those that are called so prince henry can you bring the dead to life lucifer yes very nearly and what is a wiser and better thing can keep the living from ever needing such an unnatural strange proceeding by showing conclusively and clearly that death is a stupid blunder merely and not a necessity of our lives my being here is accidental the storm that against your casement drives in the little village below waylaid me and there i heard with a secret delight of your maladies physical and mental which neither astonished nor dismayed me and i hastened hither though late in the night to proffer my aid prince henry ironically for this you came ah how can i ever hope to requite this honor from one so erudite lucifer the honor is mine or will be when i have cured your disease prince henry but not till then lucifer what is your illness prince henry it has no name a smouldering dull perpetual flame as in a kiln burns in my veins sending up vapors to the head my heart has become a dull lagoon which a kind of leprosy drinks and drains i am accounted as one who is dead and indeed i think that i shall be soon lucifer and has gordonius the divine in his famous lily of medicine i see the book lies open before you no remedy potent enough to restore you prince henry none whatever lucifer the dead are dead and their oracles dumb when questioned of the new diseases that human life evolves in its progress rank and rife consult the dead upon things that were but the living only on things that are have you done this by the appliance and aid of doctors prince henry ay whole schools of doctors with their learned rules but the case is quite beyond their science even the doctors of salern send me back word they can discern no cure for a malady like this save one which in its nature is impossible and cannot be lucifer that sounds oracular prince henry unendurable lucifer what is their remedy prince henry you shall see writ in this scroll is the mystery lucifer reading not to be cured yet not incurable the only remedy that remains is the blood that flows from a maidens veins who of her own free will shall die and give her life as the price of yours that is the strangest of all cures and one i think you will never try the prescription you may well put by as something impossible to find before the world itself shall end and yet who knows one cannot say that into some maidens brain that kind of madness will not find its way meanwhile permit me to recommend as the matter admits of no delay my wonderful catholicon of very subtile and magical powers prince henry purge with your nostrums and drugs infernal the spouts and gargoyles of these towers not me my faith is utterly gone in every power but the power supernal pray tell ne of what school are you lucifer both of the old and of the new the school of hermes trismegistus who uttered his oracles sublime before the olympiads in the dew of the early dusk and dawn of time the reign of dateless old hephaestus as northward from its nubian springs the nile forever new and old among the living and the dead its mighty mystic stream has rolled so starting from its fountainhead under the lotusleaves of isis from the dead demigods of eld through long unbroken lines of kings its course the sacred art has held unchecked unchanged by mans devices this art the arabian geber taught and in alembics finely wrought distilling herbs and flowers discovered the secret that so long had hovered upon the misty verge of truth the elixir of perpetual youth called alcohol in the arab speech like him this wondrous lore i teach prince henry what an adept luciffr about me nor more prince henry i am a reader of your books a lover of that mystic lore with such a piercing glance it looks into great natures open eye and sees within it trembling lie the portrait of the deity and yet alas with all my pains the secret and the mystery have baffled and eluded me unseen the grand result remains lucifer showing a flask behold it here this little flask contains the wonderful quintessence the perfect flower and efflorescence of all the knowledge man can ask hold it up thus against the light prince henry how limpid pure and crystalline how quick and tremulous and bright the little wavelets dance and shine as were it the water of life in sooth lucifer it is it assuages every pain cures all disease and gives again to age the swift delights of youth inhale its fragrance prince henry it is sweet a thousand different odors meet and mingle in its rare perfume such as the winds of summer waft at open windows through a room lucifer will you not taste it prince henry will one draught suffice lucifer if not you can drink more prince henry into this crystal goblet pour so much as safely i may drink lucifer pouring let not the quantity alarm you you may drink all it will not harm you prince henry i am as one who on the brink of a dark river stands and sees the waters flow the landscape dim around him waver wheel and swim and ere he plunges stops to think into what whirlpools he may sink one moment pauses and no more then madly plunges from the shore headlong into the mysteries of life and death i boldly leap nor fear the fateful currents sweep nor what in ambush lurks below for death is better than disease an angel with an aeolian harp hovers in the air angel woe woe eternal woe not only the whispered prayer of love but the imprecations of hate reverberate for ever and ever through the air above this fearful curse shakes the great universe lucifer disappearing drink drink and thy soul shall sink down into the dark abyss into the infinite abyss from which no plummet nor rope ever drew up the silver sand of hope prince henry drinking it is like a draught of fire through every vein i feel again the fever of youth the soft desire a rapture that is almost pain throbs in my heart and fills my brain o joy o joy i feel the band of steel that so long and heavily has pressed upon my breast uplifted and the malediction of my affliction is taken from me and my weary breast at length finds rest the angel it is but the rest of the fire from which the air has been taken it is but the rest of the sand when the hourglass is not shaken it is but the rest of the tide between the ebb and the flow it is but the rest of the wind between the flaws that blow with fiendish laughter hereafter this false physician will mock thee in thy perdition prince henry speak speak who says that i am ill i am not ill i am not weak the trance the swoon the dream is oer i feel the chill of death no more at length i stand renewed in all my strength beneath me i can feel the great earth stagger and reel as if the feet of a descending god upon its surface trod and like a pebble it rolled beneath his heel this o brave physician this is thy great palingenesis drinks again the angel touch the goblet no more it will make thy heart sore to its very core its perfume is the breath of the angel of death and the light that within it lies is the flash of his evil eyes beware oh beware for sickness sorrow and care all are there prince henry sinking back o thou voice within my breast why entreat me why upbraid me when the steadfast tongues of truth and the flattering hopes of youth have all deceived me and betrayed me give me give me rest oh rest golden visions wave and hover golden vapors waters streaming landscapes moving changing gleaming i am like a happy lover who illumines life with dreaming brave physician rare physician well hast thou fulfilled thy mission his head falls on his book the angel receding alas alas like a vapor the golden vision shall fade and pass and thou wilt find in thy heart again only the blight of pain and bitter bitter bitter contrition courtyard of the castle hubert standing by the gateway hubert how sad the grand old castle looks oerhead the unmolested rooks upon the turrets windy top sit talking of the farmers crop here in the courtyard springs the grass so few are now the feet that pass the stately peacocks bolder grown come hopping down the steps of stone as if the castle were their own and i the poor old senesehal haunt like a ghost the banquethall alas the merry guests no more crowd through the hospitable door no eyes with youth and passion shine no cheeks glow redder than the wine no song no laugh no jovial din of drinking wassail to the pin but all is silent sad and drear and now the only sounds i hear are the hoarse rooks upon the walls and horses stamping in their stalls a horn sounds what ho that merry sudden blast reminds me of the days long past and as of old resounding grate the heavy hinges of the gate and clattering loud with iron clank down goes the sounding bridge of plank as if it were in haste to greet the pressure of a travellers feet enter walter the minnesinger walter how now my friend this looks quite lonely no banner flying from the walls no pages and no seneschals no warders and one porter only is it you hubert hubert ah master walter walter alas how forms and faces alter i did not know you you look older your hair has grown much grayer and thinner and you stoop a little in the shoulder hubert alack i am a poor old sinner and like these towers begin to moulder and you have been absent many a year walter how is the prince hubert he is not here he has been ill and now has fled walter speak it out frankly say hes dead is it not so hubert no if you please a strange mysterious disease fell on him with a sudden blight whole hours together he would stand upon the terrace in a dream resting his head upon his hand best pleased when he was most alone like saint john nepomuck in stone looking down into a stream in the round tower night after night he sat and bleared his eyes with books until one morning we found him there stretched on the floor as if in a swoon he had fallen from his chair we hardly recognized his sweet looks walter poor prince hubert i think he might have mended and he did mend but very soon the priests came flocking in like rooks with all their crosiers and their crooks and so at last the matter ended walter how did it end hubert why in saint rochus they made him stand and wait his doom and as if he were condemned to the tomb began to mutter their hocuspocus first the mass for the dead they chanted then three times laid upon his head a shovelful of churchyard clay saying to him as he stood undaunted this is a sign that thou art dead so in thy heart be penitent and forth from the chapel door he went into disgrace and banishment clothed in a cloak of hodden gray and hearing a wallet and a bell whose sound should be a perpetual knell to keep all travellers away walter oh horrible fate outcast rejected as one with pestilence infected hubert then was the family tomb unsealed and broken helmet sword and shield buried together in common wreck as is the custom when the last of any princely house has passed and thrice as with a trumpetblast a herald shouted down the stair the words of warning and despair o hoheneck o hoheneck walter still in my soul that cry goes on forever gone forever gone ah what a cruel sense of loss like a black shadow would fall across the hearts of all if he should die his gracious presence upon earth was as a fire upon a hearth as pleasant songs at morning sung the words that dropped from his sweet tongue strengthened our hearts or heard at night made all our slumbers soft and light where is he hubert in the odenwald some of his tenants unappalled by fear of death or priestly word a holy family that make each meal a supper of the lord have him beneath their watch and ward for love of him and jesus sake pray you come in for why should i with outdoor hospitality my princes friend thus entertain walter i would a moment here remain but you good hubert go before fill me a goblet of maydrink as aromatic as the may from which it steals the breath away and which he loved so well of yore it is of him that i would think you shall attend me when i call in the ancestral banquethall unseen companions guests of air you cannot wait on will be there they taste not food they drink not wine but their soft eyes look into mine and their lips speak to me and all the vast and shadowy banquethall is full of looks and words divine leaning over the parapet the day is done and slowly from the scene the stooping sun upgathers his spent shafts and puts them back into his golden quiver below me in the valley deep and green as goblets are from which in thirsty draughts we drink its wine the swift and mantling river flows on triumphant through these lovely regions etched with the shadows of its sombre margent and soft reflected clouds of gold and argent yes there it flows forever broad and still as when the vanguard of the roman legions first saw it from the top of yonder hill how beautiful it is fresh fields of wheat vineyard and town and tower with fluttering flag the consecrated chapel on the crag and the white hamlet gathered round its base like mary sitting at her saviours feet and looking up at his beloved face o friend o best of friends thy absence more than the impending night darkens the landscape oer ii a farm in the odenwald a garden morning prince henry seated with a book elsie at a distance gathering flowers prince henry reading one morning all alone out of his convent of gray stone into the forest older darker grayer his lips moving as if in prayer his head sunken upon his breast as in a dream of rest walked the monk felix all about the broad sweet sunshine lay without filling the summer air and within the woodlands as he trod the dusk was like the truce of god with worldly woe and care under him lay the golden moss and above him the boughs of hoary trees waved and made the sign of the cross and whispered their benedicites and from the ground rose an odor sweet and fragrant of the wildflowers and the vagrant vines that wandered seeking the sunshine round and round these he heeded not but pondered on the volume in his hand wherein amazed he read a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past and as a watch in the night and with his eyes downcast in humility he said i believe o lord what is written in thy word but alas i do not understand and lo he heard the sudden singing of a bird a snowwhite bird that from a cloud dropped down and among the branches brown sat singing so sweet and clear and loud it seemed a thousand harpstrings ringing and the monk felix closed his book and long long with rapturous look he listened to the song and hardly breathed or stirred until he saw as in a vision the land elysian and in the heavenly city heard angelic feet fall on the golden flagging of the street and he would fain have caught the wondrous bird but strove in vain for it flew away away far over hill and dell and instead of its sweet singing he heard the convent bell suddenly in the silence ringing for the service of noonday and he retraced his pathway sadly and in haste in the convent there was a change he looked for each wellknown face but the faces were new and strange new figures sat in the oaken stalls new voices chanted in the choir yet the place was the same place the same dusky walls of cold gray stone the same cloisters and belfry and spire a stranger and alone among that brotherhood the monk felix stood forty years said a friar have i been prior of this convent in the wood but for that space never have i beheld thy face the heart of the monk felix fell and he answered with submissive tone this morning after the hour of prime i left my cell and wandered forth alone listening all the time to the melodious singing of a beautiful white bird until i heard the bells of the convent ringing noon from their noisy towers it was as if i dreamed for what to me had seemed moments only had been hours years said a voice close by it was an aged monk who spoke from a bench of oak fastened against the wall he was the oldest monk of all for a whole century had he been there serving god in prayer the meekest and humblest of his creatures he remembered well the features of felix and he said speaking distinct and slow one hundred years ago when i was a novice in this place there was here a monk full of gods grace who bore the name of felix and this man must be the same and straightway they brought forth to the light of day a volume old and brown a huge tome bound in brass and wildboars hide wherein were written down the names of all who had died in the convent since it was edified and there they found just as the old monk said that on a certain day and date one hundred years before had gone forth from the convent gate the monk felix and never more had entered that sacred door he had been counted among the dead and they knew at last that such had been the power of that celestial and immortal song a hundred years had passed and had not seemed so long as a single hour elsie comes in with flowers elsie here are flowers for you but they are not all for you some of them are for the virgin and for saint cecilia prince henry as thou standest there thou seemest to me like the angel that brought the immortal roses to saint cecilias bridal chamber elsie but these will fade prince henry themselves will fade but not their memory and memory has the power to recreate them from the dust they remind me too of martyred dorothea who from celestial gardens sent flowers as her witnesses to him who scoffed and doubted elsie do you know the story of christ and the sultans daughter that is the prettiest legend of them all prince henry then tell it to me but first come hither lay the flowers down beside me and put both thy hands in mine now tell me the story elsie early in the morning the sultans daughter walked in her fathers garden gathering the bright flowers all full of dew prince henry just as thou hast been doing this morning dearest elsie elsie and as she gathered them she wondered more and more who was the master of the flowers and made them grow out of the cold dark earth in my heart she said i love him and for him would leave my fathers palace to labor in his garden prince henry dear innocent child how sweetly thou recallest the longforgotten legend that in my early childhood my mother told me upon my brain it reappears once more as a birthmark on the forehead when a hand suddenly is raised upon it and removed elsie and at midnight as she lay upon her bed she heard a voice call to her from the garden and looking forth from her window she saw a beautiful youth standing among the flowers it was the lord jesus and she went down to him and opened the door for him and he said to her o maiden thou hast thought of me with love and for thy sake out of my fathers kingdom have i come hither i am the master of the flowers my garden is in paradise and if thou wilt go with me thy bridal garland shall be of bright red flowers and then he took from his finger a golden ring and asked the sultans daughter if she would be his bride and when she answered him with love his wounds began to bleed and she said to him o love how red thy heart is and thy hands are full of roses for thy sake answered he for thy sake is my heart so red for thee i bring these roses i gathered them at the cross whereon i died for thee i come for my father calls thou art my elected bride and the sultans daughter followed him to his fathers garden prince henry wouldst thou have done so elsie elsie yes very gladly prince henry then the celestial bridegroom will come for thee also upon thy forehead he will place not his crown of thorns but a crown of roses in thy bridal chamber like saint cecilia thou shalt hear sweet music and breathe the fragrance of flowers immortal go now and place these flowers before her picture a room in the farmhouse twilight ursula spinning gottlieb asleep in his chair ursula darker and darker hardly a glimmer of light comes in at the windowpane or is it my eyes are growing dimmer i cannot disentangle this skein nor wind it rightly upon the reel elsie gottlier starting the stopping of thy wheel has awakened me out of a pleasant dream i thought i was sitting beside a stream and heard the grinding of a mill when suddenly the wheels stood still and a voice cried elsie in my ear it startled me it seemed so near ursula i was calling her i want a light i cannot see to spin my flax bring the lamp elsie dost thou hear elsie within in a moment gottlieb where are bertha and max ursula they are sitting with elsie at the door she is telling them stories of the wood and the wolf and little red ridinghood gottlieb and where is the prince ursula in his room overhead i heard him walking across the floor as he always does with a heavy tread elsie comes in with a lamp max and bertha follow her and they all sing the evening song on the lighting of the lamps evening song o gladsome light of the father immortal and of the celestial sacred and blessed jesus our saviour now to the sunset again hast thou brought us and seeing the evening twilight we bless thee praise thee adore thee father omnipotent son the lifegiver spirit the comforter worthy at all times of worship and wonder prince henry at the door amen ursula who was it said amen elsie it was the prince he stood at the door and listened a moment as we chanted the evening song he is gone again i have often seen him there before ursula poor prince gottlieb i thought the house was haunted poor prince alas and yet as mild and patient as the gentlest child max i love him because he is so good and makes me such fine bows and arrows to shoot at the robins and the sparrows and the red squirrels in the wood bertha i love him too gottlieb ah yes we all love him from the bottom of our hearts he gave us the farm the house and the grange he gave us the horses and the carts and the great oxen in the stall the vineyard and the forest range we have nothing to give him but our love bertha did he give us the beautiful stork above on the chimneytop with its large round nest gottlieb no not the stork by god in heaven as a blessing the dear white stork was given but the prince has given us all the rest god bless him and make him well again elsie would i could do something for his sake something to cure his sorrow and pain gottlieb that no one can neither thou nor i nor any one else elsie and must he die ursula yes if the dear god does not take pity upon him in his distress and work a miracle gottlieb or unless some maiden of her own accord offers her life for that of her lord and is willing to die in his stead elsie i will ursula prithee thou foolish child be still thou shouldst not say what thou dost not mean elsie i mean it truly max o father this morning down by the mill in the ravine hans killed a wolf the very same that in the night to the sheepfold came and ate up my lamb that was left outside gottlieb i am glad he is dead it will be a warning to the wolves in the forest far and wide max and i am going to have his hide bertha i wonder if this is the wolf that ate little red ridinghood ursula oh no that wolf was killed a long while ago come children it is growing late max ah how i wish i were a man as stout as hans is and as strong i would do nothing else the whole day long but just kill wolves gottlieb then go to bed and grow as fast as a little boy can bertha is half asleep already see how she nods her heavy head and her sleepy feet are so unsteady she will hardly be able to creep upstairs ursula goodnight my children heres the light and do not forget to say your prayers before you sleep gottlieb good night max and bertha good night they go out with elsie ursula spinning she is a strange and wayward child that elsie of ours she looks so old and thoughts and fancies weird and wild seem of late to have taken hold of her heart that was once so docile and mild gottlieb she is like all girls ursula ah no forsooth unlike all i have ever seen for she has visions and strange dreams and in all her words and ways she seems much older than she is in truth who would think her but fifteen and there has been of late such a change my heart is heavy with fear and doubt that she may not live till the year is out she is so strange so strange so strange gottlieb i am not troubled with any such fear she will live and thrive for many a year elsies chamber night elsie praying elsie my redeemer and my lord i beseech thee i entreat thee guide me in each act and word that hereafter i may meet thee watching waiting hoping yearning with my lamp well trimmed and burning interceding with these bleeding wounds upon thy hands and side for all who have lived and erred thou hast suffered thou hast died scourged and mocked and crucified and in the grave hast thou been buried if my feeble prayer can reach thee o my saviour i beseech thee even as thou hast died for me more sincerely let me follow where thou leadest let me bleeding as thou bleedest die if dying i may give life to one who asks to live and more nearly dying thus resemble thee the chamber of gottlieb and ursula midnight elsie standing by their bedside weeping gottlieb the wind is roaring the rushing rain is loud upon roof and windowpane as if the wild huntsman of rodenstein boding evil to me and mine were abroad tonight with his ghostly train in the brief lulls of the tempest wild the dogs howl in the yard and hark some one is sobbing in the dark here in the chamber elsie it is i ursula elsie what ails thee my poor child elsie i am disturbed and much distressed in thinking our dear prince must die i cannot close mine eyes nor rest gottlieb what wouldst thou in the power divine his healing lies not in our own it is in the hand of god alone elsie nay he has put it into mine and into my heart gottlieb thy words are wild ursula what dost thou mean my child my child elsie that for our dear prince henrys sake i will myself the offering make and give my life to purchase his ursula am i still dreaming or awake thou speakest carelessly of death and yet thou knowest not what it is elsie t is the cessation of our breath silent and motionless we lie and no one knoweth more than this i saw our little gertrude die she left off breathing and no more i smoothed the pillow beneath her head she was more beautiful than before like violets faded were her eyes by this we knew that she was dead through the open window looked the skies into the chamber where she lay and the wind was like the sound of wings as if angels came to bear her away ah when i saw and felt these things i found it difficult to stay i longed to die as she had died and go forth with her side by side the saints are dead the martyrs dead and mary and our lord and i would follow in humility the way by them illumined ursula my child my child thou must not die elsie why should i live do i not know the life of woman is full of woe toiling on and on and on with breaking heart and tearful eyes and silent lips and in the soul the secret longings that arise which this world never satisfies some more some less but of the whole not one quite happy no not one ursula it is the malediction of eve elsie in place of it let me receive the benediction of mary then gottlieb ah woe is me ah woe is me most wretched am i among men ursula alas that i should live to see thy death beloved and to stand above thy grave ah woe the day elsie thou wilt not see it i shall lie beneath the flowers of another land for at salerno far away over the mountains over the sea it is appointed me to die and it will seem no more to thee than if at the village on marketday i should a little longer stay than i am wont ursula even as thou sayest and how my heart beats when thou stayest i cannot rest until my sight is satisfied with seeing thee what then if thou wert dead gottlieb ah me of our old eyes thou art the light the joy of our old hearts art thou and wilt thou die ursula not now not now elsie christ died for me and shall not be willing for my prince to die you both are silent you cannot speak this said i at our saviours feast after confession to the priest and even he made no reply does he not warn us all to seek the happier better land on high where flowers immortal never wither and could he forbid me to go thither gottlieb in gods own time my hearts delight when he shall call thee not before elsie i heard him call when christ ascended triumphantly from star to star he left the gates of heaven ajar i had a vision in the night and saw him standing at the door of his fathers mansion vast and splendid and beckoning to me from afar i cannot stay gottlieb she speaks almost as if it were the holy ghost spake through her lips and in her stead what if this were of god ursula ah then gainsay it dare we not gottlieb amen elsie the words that thou hast said are strange and new for us to hear and fill our hears with doubt and fear whether it be a dark temptation of the evil one or gods inspiration we in our blindness cannot say we must think upon it and pray for evil and good it both resembles if it be of god his will be done may he guard us from the evil one how hot thy hand is how it trembles go to thy bed and try to sleep ursula kiss me good night and do not weep elsie goes out ah what an awful thing is this i almost shuddered at her kiss as if a ghost had touched my cheek i am so childish and so weak as soon as i see the earliest gray of morning glimmer in the east i will go over to the priest and hear what the good man has to say a village church a woman kneeling at the confessional the parish priest from within go sin no more thy penance oer a new and better life begin god maketh thee forever free from the dominion of thy sin go sin no more he will restore the peace that filled thy heart before and pardon thine iniquity the woman goes out the priest comes forth and walks slowly up and down the church o blessed lord how much i need thy light to guide me on my way so many hands that without heed still touch thy wounds and make them bleed so many feet that day by day still wander from thy fold astray unless thou fill me with thy light i cannot lead thy flock aright nor without thy support can bear the burden of so great a care but am myself a castaway a pause the day is drawing to its close and what good deeds since first it rose have i presented lord to thee as offsprings of my ministry what wrong repressed what right maintained what struggle passed what victory gained what good attempted and attained feeble at best is my endeavor i see but cannot reach the height that lies forever in the light and yet forever and forever when seeming just within my grasp i feel my feeble hands unclasp and sink discouraged into night for thine own purpose thou hast sent the strife and the discouragement a pause why stayest thou prince of hoheneck why keep me pacing to and fro amid these aisles of sacred gloom counting my footsteps as i go and marking with each step a tomb why should the world for thee make room and wait thy leisure and thy beck thou comest in the hope to hear some word of comfort and of cheer what can i say i cannot give the counsel to do this and live but rather firmly to deny the tempter though his power be strong and inaccessible to wrong still like a martyr live and die a pause the evening air grows dusk and brown i must go forth into the town to visit beds of pain and death of restless limbs and quivering breath and sorrowing hearts and patient eyes that see through tears the sun go down but never more shall see it rise the poor in body and estate the sick and the disconsolate must not on mans convenience wait goes out enter lucifer as a priest lucifer with a genuflexion mocking this is the black paternoster god was my foster he fostered me under the book of the palmtree st michael was my dame he was born at bethlehem he was made of flesh and blood god send me my right food my right food and shelter too that i may to yon kirk go to read upon yon sweet book which the mighty god of heaven shook open open hells gates shut shut heavens gates all the devils in the air the stronger be that hear the black prayer looking round the church what a darksome and dismal place i wonder that any man has the face to call such a hole the house of the lord and the gate of heaven yet such is the word ceiling and walls and windows old covered with cobwebs blackened with mould dust on the pulpit dust on the stairs dust on the benches and stalls and chairs the pulpit from which such ponderous sermons have fallen down on the brains of the germans with about as much real edification as if a great bible bound in lead had fallen and struck them on the head and i ought to remember that sensation here stands the holywater stoup holywater it may be to many but to me the veriest liquor gehennae it smells like a filthy fastday soup near it stands the box for the poor with its iron padlock safe and sure i and the priest of the parish know whither all these charities go therefore to keep up the institution i will add my little contribution he puts in money underneath this mouldering tomb with statue of stone and scutcheon of brass slumbers a great lord of the village all his life was riot and pillage but at length to escape the threatened doom of the everlasting penal fire he died in the dress of a mendicant friar and bartered his wealth for a daily mass but all that afterwards came to pass and whether he finds it dull or pleasant is kept a secret for the present at his own particular desire and here in a corner of the wall shadowy silent apart from all with its awful portal open wide and its latticed windows on either side and its step well worn by the beaded knees of one or two pious centuries stands the village confessional within it as an honored guest i will sit down awhile and rest seats himself in the confessional here sits the priest and faint and low like the sighing of an evening breeze comes through these painted lattices the ceaseless sound of human woe here while her bosom aches and throbs with deep and agonizing sobs that half are passion half contrition the luckless daughter of perdition slowly confesses her secret shame the time the place the lovers name here the grim murderer with a groan from his bruised conscience rolls the stone thinking that thus he can atone for ravages of sword and flame indeed i marvel and marvel greatly how a priest can sit here so sedately reading the whole year out and in naught but the catalogue of sin and still keep any faith whatever in human virtue never never i cannot repeat a thousandth part of the horrors and crimes and sins and woes that arise when with palpitating throes the graveyard in the human heart gives up its dead at the voice of the priest as if he were an archangel at least it makes a peculiar atmosphere this odor of earthly passions and crimes such as i like to breathe at times and such as often brings me here in the hottest and most pestilential season today i come for another reason to foster and ripen an evil thought in a heart that is almost to madness wrought and to make a murderer out of a prince a sleight of hand i learned long since he comes in the twilight he will not see the difference between his priest and me in the same net was the mother caught prince henry entering and kneeling at the confessional remorseful penitent and lowly i come to crave o father holy thy benediction on my head lucifer the benediction shall be said after confession not before t is a godspeed to the parting guest who stands already at the door sandalled with holiness and dressed in garments pure from earthly stain meanwhile hast thou searched well thy breast does the same madness fill thy brain or have thy passion and unrest vanished forever from thy mind prince henry by the same madness still made blind by the same passion still possessed i come again to the house of prayer a man afflicted and distressed as in a cloudy atmosphere through unseen sluices of the air a sudden and impetuous wind strikes the great forest white with fear and every branch and bough and spray points all its quivering leaves one way and meadows of grass and fields of rain and the clouds above and the slanting rain and smoke from chimneys of the town yield themselves to it and bow down so does this dreadful purpose press onward with irresistible stress and all my thoughts and faculties struck level by the strength of this from their true inclination turn and all stream forward to salem lucifer alas we are but eddies of dust uplifted by the blast and whirled along the highway of the world a moment only then to fall back to a common level all at the subsiding of the gust prince henry o holy father pardon in me the oscillation of a mind unsteadfast and that cannot find its centre of rest and harmony for evermore before mine eyes this ghastly phantom flits and flies and as a madman through a crowd with frantic gestures and wild cries it hurries onward and aloud repeats its awful prophecies weakness is wretchedness to be strong is to be happy i am weak and cannot find the good i seek because i feel and fear the wrong lucifer be not alarmed the church is kind and in her mercy and her meekness she meets halfway her childrens weakness writes their transgressions in the dust though in the decalogue we find the mandate written thou shalt not kill yet there are cases when we must in war for instance or from scathe to guard and keep the one true faith we must look at the decalogue in the light of an ancient statute that was meant for a mild and general application to be understood with the reservation that in certain instances the right must yield to the expedient thou art a prince if thou shouldst die what hearts and hopes would prostrate lie what noble deeds what fair renown into the grave with thee go down what acts of valor and courtesy remain undone and die with thee thou art the last of all thy race with thee a noble name expires and vanishes from the earths face the glorious memory of thy sires she is a peasant in her veins flows common and plebeian blood it is such as daily and hourly stains the dust and the turf of battle plains by vassals shed in a crimson flood without reserve and without reward at the slightest summons of their lord but thine is precious the foreappointed blood of kings of gods anointed moreover what has the world in store for one like her but tears and toil daughter of sorrow serf of the soil a peasants child and a peasants wife and her soul within her sick and sore with the roughness and barrenness of life i marvel not at the hearts recoil from a fate like this in one so tender nor at its eagerness to surrender all the wretchedness want and woe that await it in this world below for the unutterable splendor of the world of rest beyond the skies so the church sanctions the sacrifice therefore inhale this healing balm and breathe this fresh life into thine accept the comfort and the calm she offers as a gift divine let her fall down and anoint thy feet with the ointment costly and most sweet of her young blood and thou shalt live prince henry and will the righteous heaven forgive no action whether foal or fair is ever done but it leaves somewhere a record written by fingers ghostly as a blessing or a curse and mostly in the greater weakness or greater strength of the acts which follow it till at length the wrongs of ages are redressed and the justice of god made manifest lucifer in ancient records it is stated that whenever an evil deed is done another devil is created to scourge and torment the offending one but evil is only good perverted and lucifer the bearer of light but an angel fallen and deserted thrust from his fathers house with a curse into the black and endless night prince henry if justice rules the universe from the good actions of good men angels of light should be begotten and thus the balance restored again lucifer yes if the world were not so rotten and so given over to the devil prince henry but this deed is it good or evil have i thine absolution free to do it and without restriction lucifer ay and from whatsoever sin lieth around it and within from all crimes in which it may involve thee i now release thee and absolve thee prince henry give me thy holy benediction lucifer stretching forth his hand and muttering maledictione perpetua maledicat vos pater eternus the angel with the aeolian harp take heed take heed noble art thou in thy birth by the good and the great of earth hast thou been taught be noble in every thought and in every deed let not the illusion of thy senses betray thee to deadly offences be strong be good be pure the right only shall endure all things else are but false pretences i entreat thee i implore listen no more to the suggestions of an evil spirit that even now is there making the foul seem fair and selfishness itself a virtue and a merit a room in the farmhouse gottlieb it is decided for many days and nights as many we have had a nameless terror in our breast making us timid and afraid of god and his mysterious ways we have been sorrowful and sad much have we suffered much have prayed that he would lead us as is best and show us what his will required it is decided and we give our child o prince that you may live ursula it is of god he has inspired this purpose in her and through pain out of a world of sin and woe he takes her to himself again the mothers heart resists no longer with the angel of the lord in vain it wrestled for he was the stronger gottlieb as abraham offered long ago his son unto the lord and even the everlasting father in heaven gave his as a lamb unto the slaughter so do i offer up my daughter ursula hides her face elsie my life is little only a cup of water but pure and limpid take it o my prince let it refresh you let it restore you it is given willingly it is given freely may god bless the gift prince henry and the giver gottlieb amen prince henry i accept it gottlieb where are the children ursula they are already asleep gottlieb what if they were dead in the garden elsie i have one thing to ask of you prince henry what is it it is already granted elsie promise me when we are gone from here and on our way are journeying to salerno you will not by word or deed endeavor to dissuade me and turn me from my purpose but remember that as a pilgrim to the holy city walks unmolested and with thoughts of pardon occupied wholly so would i approach the gates of heaven in this great jubilee with my petition putting off from me all thoughts of earth as shoes from off my feet promise me this prince henry thy words fall from thy lips like roses from the lips of angelo and angels might stoop to pick them up elsie will you not promise prince henry if ever we depart upon this journey so long to one or both of us i promise elsie shall we not go then have you lifted me into the air only to hurl me back wounded upon the ground and offered me the waters of eternal life to bid me drink the polluted puddles of the world prince henry o elsie what a lesson thou dost teach me the life which is and that which is to come suspended hang in such nice equipoise a breath disturbs the balance and that scale in which we throw our hearts preponderates and the other like an empty one flies up and is accounted vanity and air to me the thought of death is terrible having such hold on life to thee it is not so much even as the lifting of a latch only a step into the open air out of a tent already luminous with light that shines through its transparent walls o pure in heart from thy sweet dust shall grow lilies upon whose petals will be written ave maria in characters of gold iii a street in strasburg night prince henry wandering alone wrapped in a cloak prince henry still is the night the sound of feet has died away from the empty street and like an artisan bending down his head on his anvil the dark town sleeps with a slumber deep and sweet sleepless and restless i alone in the dusk and damp of these walls of stone wander and weep in my remorse crier of the dead ringing a bell wake wake all ye that sleep pray for the dead pray for the dead prince henry hark with what accents loud and hoarse this warder on the walls of death sends forth the challenge of his breath i see the dead that sleep in the grave they rise up and their garments wave dimly and spectral as they rise with the light of another world in their eyes crier of the dead wake wake all ye that sleep pray for the dead pray for the dead prince henry why for the dead who are at rest pray for the living in whose breast the struggle between right and wrong is raging terrible and strong as when good angels war with devils this is the master of the revels who at lifes flowing feast proposes the health of absent friends and pledges not in bright goblets crowned with roses and tinkling as we touch their edges but with his dismal tinkling bell that mocks and mimics their funeral knell crier op the dead wake wake all ye that sleep pray for the dead pray for the dead prince henry wake not beloved be thy sleep silent as night is and as deep there walks a sentinel at thy gate whose heart is heavy and desolate and the heavings of whose bosom number the respirations of thy slumber as if some strange mysterious fate had linked two hearts in one and mine went madly wheeling about thine only with wider and wilder sweep crier op the dead at a distance wake wake all ye that sleep pray for the dead pray for the dead prince henry lo with what depth of blackness thrown against the clouds far up the skies the walls of the cathedral rise like a mysterious grove of stone with fitful lights and shadows blending as from behind the moon ascending lights its dim aisles and paths unknown the wind is rising but the boughs rise not and fall not with the wind that through their foliage sobs and soughs only the cloudy rack behind drifting onward wild and ragged gives to each spire and buttress jagged a seeming motion undefined below on the square an armed knight still as a statue and as white sits on his steed and the moonbeams quiver upon the points of his armor bright as on the ripples of a river he lifts the visor from his cheek and beckons and makes as he would speak walter the minnesinger friend can you tell me where alight thuringias horsemen for the night for i have lingered in the rear and wander vainly up and down prince henry i am a stranger in the town as thou art but the voice i hear is not a stranger to mine ear thou art walter of the vogelweid walter thou hast guessed rightly and thy name is henry of hoheneck prince henry ay the same walter embracing him come closer closer to my side what brings thee hither what potent charm has drawn thee from thy german farm into the old alsatian city prince henry a tale of wonder and of pity a wretched man almost by stealth dragging my body to salem in the vain hope and search for health and destined never to return already thou hast heard the rest but what brings thee thus armed and dight in the equipments of a knight walter dost thou not see upon my breast the cross of the crusaders shine my pathway leads to palestine prince henry ah would that way were also mine o noble poet thou whose heart is like a nest of singingbirds rocked on the topmost bough of life wilt thou too from our sky depart and in the clangor of the strife mingle the music of thy words walter my hopes are high my heart is proud and like a trumpet long and loud thither my thoughts all clang and ring my life is in my hand and lo i grasp and bend it as a bow and shoot forth from its trembling string an arrow that shall be perchance like the arrow of the israelite king shot from the window towards the east that of the lords deliverance prince henry my life alas is what thou seest o enviable fate to be strong beautiful and armed like thee with lyre and sword with song and steel a hand to smite a heart to feel thy heart thy hand thy lyre thy sword thou givest all unto thy lord while i so mean and abject grown am thinking of myself alone walter be patient time will reinstate thy health and fortunes prince henry t is too late i cannot strive against my fate walter come with me for my steed is weary our journey has been long and dreary and dreaming of his stall he dints with his impatient hoofs the flints prince henry aside i am ashamed in my disgrace to look into that noble face tomorrow walter let it be walter tomorrow at the dawn of day i shall again be on my way come with me to the hostelry for i have many things to say our journey into italy perchance together we may make wilt thou not do it for my sake prince henry a sick mans pace would but impede thine eager and impatient speed besides my pathway leads me round to hirsehau in the forests bound where i assemble man and steed and all things for my journeys need they go out lucifer flying over the city sleep sleep o city till the light wake you to sin and crime again whilst on your dreams like dismal rain i scatter downward through the night my maledictions dark and deep i have more martyrs in your walls than god has and they cannot sleep they are my bondsmen and my thralls their wretched lives are full of pain wild agonies of nerve and brain and every heartbeat every breath is a convulsion worse than death sleep sleep o city though within the circuit of your walls there be no habitation free from sin and all its nameless misery the aching heart the aching head grief for the living and the dead and foul corruption of the time disease distress and want and woe and crimes and passions that may grow until they ripen into crime square in front of the cathedral easter sunday friar cuthbert preaching to the crowd from a pulpit in the open air prince henry and elsie crossing the square prince henry this is the day when from the dead our lord arose and everywhere out of their darkness and despair triumphant over fears and foes the hearts of his disciples rose when to the women standing near the angel in shining vesture said the lord is risen he is not here and mindful that the day is come on all the hearths in christendom the fires are quenched to be again rekindled from the sun that high is dancing in the cloudless sky the churches are all decked with flowers the salutations among men are but the angels words divine christ is arisen and the bells catch the glad murmur as it swells and chant together in their towers all hearts are glad and free from care the faces of the people shine see what a crowd is in the square gayly and gallantly arrayed elsie let us go back i am afraid prince henry nay let us mount the churchsteps here under the doorways sacred shadow we can see all things and be freer from the crowd that madly heaves and presses elsie what a gay pageant what bright dresses it looks like a flowerbesprinkled meadow what is that yonder on the square prince henry a pulpit in the open air and a friar who is preaching to the crowd in a voice so deep and clear and loud that if we listen and give heed his lowest words will reach the ear friar cuthbert gesticulating and cracking a postilions whip what ho good people do you not hear dashing along at the top of his speed booted and spurred on his jaded steed a courier comes with words of cheer courier what is the news i pray christ is arisen whence come you from court then i do not believe it you say it in sport cracks his whip again ah here comes another riding this way we soon shall know what he has to say courier what are the tidings today christ is arisen whence come you from town then i do not believe it away with you clown cracks his whip more violently and here comes a third who is spurring amain what news do you bring with your loosehanging rein your spurs wet with blood and your bridle with foam christ is arisen whence come you from rome ah now i believe he is risen indeed ride on with the news at the top of your speed great applause among the crowd to come back to my text when the news was first spread that christ was arisen indeed from the dead very great was the joy of the angels in heaven and as great the dispute as to who should carry the tidings thereof to the virgin mary pierced to the heart with sorrows seven old father adam was first to propose as being the author of all our woes but he was refused for fear said they he would stop to eat apples on the way abel came next but petitioned in vain because he might meet with his brother cain noah too was refused lest his weakness for wine should delay him at every tavernsign and john the baptist could not get a vote on account of his oldfashioned camelshair coat and the penitent thief who died on the cross was reminded that all his bones were broken till at last when each in turn had spoken the company being still at loss the angel who rolled away the stone was sent to the sepulchre all alone and filled with glory that gloomy prison and said to the virgin the lord is arisen the cathedral bells ring but hark the bells are beginning to chime and i feel that i am growing hoarse i will put an end to my discourse and leave the rest for some other time for the bells themselves are the best of preachers their brazen lips are learned teachers from their pulpits of stone in the upper air sounding aloft without crack or flaw shriller than trumpets under the law now a sermon and now a prayer the clangorous hammer is the tongue this way that way beaten and swung that from mouth of brass as from month of gold may be taught the testaments new and old and above it the great crossbeam of wood representeth the holy rood upon which like the bell our hopes are hung and the wheel wherewith it is swayed and rung is the mind of man that round and round sways and maketh the tongue to sound and the rope with its twisted cordage three denoteth the scriptural trinity of morals and symbols and history and the upward and downward motion show that we touch upon matters high and low and the constant change and transmutation of action and of contemplation downward the scripture brought from on high upward exalted again to the sky downward the literal interpretation upward the vision and mystery and now my hearers to make an end i have only one word more to say in the church in honor of easter day will be presented a miracle play and i hope you will have the grace to attend christ bring us at last to his felicity pax vobiscum et benedicite in the cathedral chant kyrie eleison christe eleison elsie i am at home here in my fathers house these paintings of the saints upon the walls have all familiar and benignant faces prince henry the portraits of the family of god thine own hereafter shall be placed among them elsie how very grand it is and wonderful never have i beheld a church so splendid such columns and such arches and such windows so many tombs and statues in the chapels and under them so many confessionals they must be for the rich i should not like to tell my sins in such a church as this who built it prince henry a great master of his craft erwin von steinbach but not he alone for many generations labored with him children that came to see these saints in stone as day by day out of the blocks they rose grew old and died and still the work went on and on and on and is not yet completed the generation that succeeds our own perhaps may finish it the architect built his great heart into these sculptured stones and with him toiled his children and their lives were builded with his own into the walls as offerings unto god you see that statue fixing its joyous but deepwrinkled eyes upon the pillars of the angels yonder that is the image of the master carved by the fair hand of his own child sabina elsie how beautiful is the column that he looks at prince henry that too she sculptured at the base of it stand the evangelists above their heads four angels blowing upon marble trumpets and over them the blessed christ surrounded by his attendant ministers upholding the instruments of his passion elsie o my lord would i could leave behind me upon earth some monument to thy glory such as this prince henry a greater monument than this thou leavest in thine own life all purity and love see too the rose above the western portal resplendent with a thousand gorgeous colors the perfect flower of gothic loveliness elsie and in the gallery the long line of statues christ with his twelve apostles watching us a bishop in armor booted and spurred passes with his train prince henry but come away we have not time to look the crowd already fills the church and yonder upon a stage a herald with a trumpet clad like the angel gabriel proclaims the mystery that will now be represented the nativity a miracleplay introitus praeco come good people all and each come and listen to our speech in your presence here i stand with a trumpet in my hand to announce the easter play which we represent today first of all we shall rehearse in our action and our verse the nativity of our lord as written in the old record of the protevangelion so that he who reads may run blows his trumpet i heaven mercy at the feet of god have pity lord be not afraid to save mankind whom thou hast made nor let the souls that were betrayed perish eternally justice it cannot be it must not be when in the garden placed by thee the fruit of the forbidden tree he ate and he must die mercy have pity lord let penitence atone for disobedience nor let the fruit of mans offence be endless misery justice what penitence proportionate can eer be felt for sin so great of the forbidden fruit he ate and damned must he be god he shall be saved if that within the bounds of earth one free from sin be found who for his kith and kin will suffer martyrdom the four virtues lord we

spring and my companions who within the threads of gold and scarlet spin and at their labor sing the angel gabriel hail virgin mary full of grace here mary looketh around her trembling and then saith mary who is it speaketh in this place with such a gentle voice gabriel the lord of heaven is with thee now blessed among all women thou who art his holy choice mary setting down the pitcher what can this mean no one is near and yet such sacred words i hear i almost fear to stay here the angel appearing to her shall say gabriel fear not o mary but believe for thou a virgin shalt conceive a child

vii jesus at play with his schoolmates jesus the shower is over let us play and make some sparrows out of clay down by the rivers side judas see how the stream has overflowed its banks and oer the meadow road is spreading far and wide they draw water out of the river by channels and form little pools jesus makes twelve sparrows of clay and the other boys do the same jesus look look how prettily

high stool with a long beard and a rod in his hand rabbi i am the rabbi ben israel throughout this village known full well and as my scholars all will tell learned in things divine the cabala and talmud hoar than all the prophets prize i more for water is all bible lore but mishna is strong wine my fame extends from west to east and always at the purim feast i am as drunk as any beast that

doth fall into his mouth a drop of gall and so he turneth white rabbi and now my judas say to me what the great voices four may be that quite across the world do flee and are not heard by men judas

crocus for the gem of his authority he passes by and others come in bearing on a litter a sick child boys set down the litter and draw near the king of bethlehem is here what ails the child who seems to fear that we shall do him harm the bearers he climbed up to the robins nest and out there darted from his rest a serpent with a crimson crest and stung him in the arm jesus bring him to me and let me feel the wounded place my touch can heal the sting of serpents and can steal the poison from the bite he touches the wound and the boy begins to cry cease to lament i can foresee that thou hereafter known shalt be among the men who follow me as simon the canaanite epilogue in the after part of the day will be represented another play of the passion of our blessed lord beginning directly after nones at the close of which we shall accord by way of benison and reward the sight of a holy martyrs bones iv the road to hirschau prince henry and elsie with their attendants on horseback elsie onward and onward the highway runs to the distant city impatiently bearing tidings of human joy and disaster of love and of hate of doing and daring prince henry this life of ours is a wild aeolian harp of many a joyous strain but under them all there runs a loud perpetual wail as of souls in pain elsie faith alone can interpret life and the heart that aches and bleeds with the stigma of pain alone bears the likeness of christ and can comprehend its dark enigma prince henry man is selfish and seeketh pleasure with little care of what may betide else why am i travelling here beside thee a demon that rides by an angels side elsie all the hedges are white with dust and the great dog under the creaking wain hangs his head in the lazy heat while onward the horses toil and strain prince henry now they stop at the wayside inn and the wagoner laughs with the landlords daughter while out of the dripping trough the horses distend their leathern sides with water elsie all through life there are wayside inns where man may refresh his soul with love even the lowest may quench his thirst at rivulets fed by springs from above prince henry yonder where rises the cross of stone our journey along the highway ends and over the fields by a bridle path down into the broad green valley descends elsie i am not sorry to leave behind the beaten road with its dust and heat the air will be sweeter far and the turf will be softer under our horses feet they turn down a green lane elsie sweet is the air with the budding haws and the valley stretching for miles below is white with blossoming cherrytrees as if just covered with lightest snow prince henry over our heads a white cascade is gleaming against the distant hill we cannot hear it nor see it move but it hangs like a banner when winds are still elsie damp and cool is this deep ravine and cool the sound of the brook by our side what is this castle that rises above us and lords it over a land so wide prince henry it is the home of the counts of calva well have i known these scenes of old well i remember each tower and turret remember the brooklet the wood and the wold elsie hark from the little village below us the bells of the church are ringing for rain priests and peasants in long procession come forth and kneel on the arid plain prince henry they have not long to wait for i see in the south uprising a little cloud that before the sun shall be set will cover the sky above us as with a shroud they pass on the convent of hirschau in the black forest the convent cellar friar claus comes in with a light and a basket of empty flagons friar claus i always enter this sacred place with a thoughtful solemn and reverent pace pausing long enough on each stair to breathe an ejaculatory prayer and a benediction on the vines that produce these various sorts of wines for my part i am well content that we have got through with the tedious lent fasting is all very well for those who have to contend with invisible foes but i am quite sure it does not agree with a quiet peaceable man like me who am not of that nervous and meagre kind that are always distressed in body and mind and at times it really does me good to come down among this brotherhood dwelling forever underground silent contemplative round and sound each one old and brown with mould but filled to the lips with the ardor of youth with the latent power and love of truth and with virtues fervent and manifold i have heard it said that at eastertide when buds are swelling on every side and the sap begins to move in the vine then in all cellars far and wide the oldest as well as the newest wine begins to stir itself and ferment with a kind of revolt and discontent at being so long in darkness pent and fain would burst from its sombre tun to bask on the hillside in the sun as in the bosom of us poor friars the tumult of halfsubdued desires for the world that we have left behind disturbs at times all peace of mind and now that we have lived through lent my duty it is as often before to open awhile the prisondoor and give these restless spirits vent now here is a cask that stands alone and has stood a hundred years or more its beard of cobwebs long and hoar trailing and sweeping along the floor like barbarossa who sits in his cave taciturn sombre sedate and grave till his beard has grown through the table of stone it is of the quick and not of the dead in its veins the blood is hot and red and a heart still beats in those ribs of oak that time may have tamed but has not broke it comes from bacharach on the rhine is one of the three best kinds of wine and costs some hundred florins the ohm but that i do not consider dear when i remember that every year four butts are sent to the pope of rome and whenever a goblet thereof i drain the old rhyme keeps running in my brain at bacharach on the rhine at hochheim on the main and at wurzburg on the stein grow the three best kinds of wine they are all good wines and better far than those of the neckar or those of the ahr in particular wurzburg well may boast of its blessed wine of the holy ghost which of all wines i like the most this i shall draw for the abbots drinking who seems to be much of my way of thinking fills a flagon ah how the streamlet laughs and sings what a delicious fragrance springs from the deep flagon while it fills as of hyacinths and daffodils between this cask and the abbots lips many have been the sips and slips many have been the draughts of wine on their way to his that have stopped at mine and many a time my soul has hankered for a deep draught out of his silver tankard when it should have been busy with other affairs less with its longings and more with its prayers but now there is no such awkward condition no danger of death and eternal perdition so heres to the abbot and brothers all who dwell in this convent of peter and paul he drinks o cordial delicious o soother of pain it flashes like sunshine into my brain a benison rest on the bishop who sends such a fudder of wine as this to his friends and now a flagon for such as may ask a draught from the noble bacharach cask and i will be gone though i know full well the cellars a cheerfuller place than the cell behold where he stands all sound and good brown and old in his oaken hood silent he seems externally as any carthusian monk may be but within what a spirit of deep unrest what a seething and simmering in his breast as if the heaving of his great heart would burst his belt of oak apart let me unloose this button of wood and quiet a little his turbulent mood sets it running see how its currents gleam and shine as if they had caught the purple hues of autumn sunsets on the rhine descending and mingling with the dews or as if the grapes were stained with the blood of the innocent boy who some years back was taken and crucified by the jews in that ancient town of bacharach perdition upon those infidel jews in that ancient town of bacharach the beautiful town that gives us wine with the fragrant odor of muscadine i should deem it wrong to let this pass without first touching my lips to the glass for here in the midst of the current i stand like the stone pfalz in the midst of the river taking toll upon either hand and much more grateful to the giver he drinks here now is a very inferior kind such as in any town you may find such as one might imagine would suit the rascal who drank wine out of a boot and after all it was not a crime for he won thereby dorf huffelsheim a jolly old toper who at a pull could drink a postilions jackboot full and ask with a laugh when that was done if the fellow had left the other one this wine is as good as we can afford to the friars who sit at the lower board and cannot distinguish bad from good and are far better off than if they could being rather the rude disciples of beer than of anything more refined and dear fills the flagon and departs the scriptorium friar pacificus transcribing and illuminating friar pacificus it is growing dark yet one line more and then my work for today is oer i come again to the name of the lord ere i that awful name record that is spoken so lightly among men let me pause awhile and wash my pen pure from blemish and blot must it be when it writes that word of mystery thus have i labored on and on nearly through the gospel of john can it be that from the lips of this same gentle evangelist that christ himself perhaps has kissed came the dread apocalypse it has a very awful look as it stands there at the end of the book like the sun in an eclipse ah me when i think of that vision divine think of writing it line by line i stand in awe of the terrible curse like the trump of doom in the closing verse god forgive me if ever i take aught from the book of that prophecy lest my part too should he taken away from the book of life on the judgment day this is well written though i say it i should not be afraid to display it in open day on the selfsame shelf with the writings of st thecla herself or of theodosius who of old wrote the gospels in letters of gold that goodly folio standing yonder without a single blot or blunder would not bear away the palm from mine if we should compare them line for line there now is an initial letter saint ulric himself never made a better finished down to the leaf and the snail down to the eyes on the peacocks tail and now as i turn the volume over and see what lies between cover and cover what treasures of art these pages hold all ablaze with crimson and gold god forgive me i seem to feel a certain satisfaction steal into my heart and into my brain as if my talent had not lain wrapped in a napkin and all in vain yes i might almost say to the lord here is a copy of thy word written out with much toil and pain take it o lord and let it be as something i have done for thee he looks from the window how sweet the air is how fair the scene i wish i had as lovely a green to paint my landscapes and my leaves how the swallows twitter under the eaves there now there is one in her nest i can just catch a glimpse of her head and breast and will sketch her thus in her quiet nook for the margin of my gospel book he makes a sketch i can see no more through the valley yonder a shower is passing i hear the thunder mutter its curses in the air the devils own and only prayer the dusty road is brown with rain and speeding on with might and main hitherward rides a gallant train they do not parley they cannot wait but hurry in at the convent gate what a fair lady and beside her what a handsome graceful noble rider now she gives him her hand to alight they will beg a shelter for the night i will go down to the corridor and try to see that face once more it will do for the face of some beautiful saint or for one of the maries i shall paint goes out the cloisters the abbot ernestus pacing to and fro abbot slowly slowly up the wall steals the sunshine steals the shade evening damps begin to fall evening shadows are displayed round me oer me everywhere all the sky is grand with clouds and athwart the evening air wheel the swallows home in crowds shafts of sunshine from the west paint the dusky windows red darker shadows deeper rest underneath and overhead darker darker and more wan in my breast the shadows fall upward steals the life of man as the sunshine from the wall from the wall into the sky from the roof along the spire ah the souls of those that die are but sunbeams lifted higher enter prince henry prince henry christ is arisen abbot amen he is arisen his peace be with you prince henry here it reigns forever the peace of god that passeth undertanding reigns in these cloisters and these corridors are you ernestus abbot of the convent abbot i am prince henry and i prince henry of hoheneck who crave your hospitality tonight abbot you are thrice welcome to our humble walls you do us honor and we shall requite it i fear but poorly entertaining you with paschal eggs and our poor convent wine the remnants of our easter holidays prince henry how fares it with the holy monks of hirschau are all things well with them abbot all things are well prince henry a noble convent i have known it long by the report of travellers i now see their commendations lag behind the truth you lie here in the valley of the nagold as in a nest and the still river gliding along its bed is like an admonition how all things pass your lands are rich and ample and your revenues large gods benediction rests on your convent abbot by our charities we strive to merit it our lord and master when he departed left us in his will as our best legacy on earth the poor these we have always with us had we not our hearts would grow as hard as are these stones prince henry if i remember right the counts of calva founded your convent abbot even as you say prince henry and if i err not it is very old abbot within these cloisters lie already buried twelve holy abbots underneath the flags on which we stand the abbot william lies of blessed memory prince henry and whose tomb is that which bears the brass escutcheon abbot a benefactors conrad a count of calva he who stood godfather to our bells prince henry your monks are learned and holy men i trust abbot there are among them learned and holy men yet in this age we need another hildebrand to shake and purify us like a mighty wind the world is wicked and sometimes i wonder god does not lose his patience with it wholly and shatter it like glass even here at times within these walls where all should be at peace i have my trials time has laid his hand upon my heart gently not smiting it but as a harper lays his open palm upon his harp to deaden its vibrations ashes are on my head and on my lips sackcloth and in my breast a heaviness and weariness of life that makes me ready to say to the dead abbots under us make room for me ony i see the dusk of evening twilight coming and have not completed half my task and so at times the thought of my shortcomings in this life falls like a shadow on the life to come prince henry we must all die and not the old alone the young have no exemption from that doom abbot ah yes the young may die but the old must that is the difference prince henry i have heard much laud of your transcribers your scriptorium is famous among all your manuscripts praised for their beauty and their excellence abbot that is indeed our boast if you desire it you shall behold these treasures and meanwhile shall the refectorarius bestow your horses and attendants for the night they go in the vesperbell rings the chapel vespers after which the monks retire a chorister leading an old monk who is blind prince henry they are all gone save one who lingers absorbed in deep and silent prayer as if his heart could find no rest at times he beats his heaving breast with clenched and convulsive fingers then lifts them trembling in the air a chorister with golden hair guides hitherward his heavy pace can it be so or does my sight deceive me in the uncertain light ah no i recognize that face though time has touched it in his flight and changed the auburn hair to white it is count hugo of the rhine the deadliest foe of all our race and hateful unto me and mine the blind monk who is it that doth stand so near his whispered words i almost hear prince henry i am prince henry of hoheneck and you count hugo of the rhine i know you and i see the scar the brand upon your forehead shine and redden like a baleful star the blind monk count hugo once but now the wreck of what i was o hoheneck the passionate will the pride the wrath that bore me headlong on my path stumbled and staggered into fear and failed me in my mad career as a tired steed some evildoer alone upon a desolate moor bewildered lost deserted blind and hearing loud and close behind the oertaking steps of his pursuer then suddenly from the dark there came a voice that called me by my name and said to me kneel down and pray and so my terror passed away passed utterly away forever contrition penitence remorse came on me with oerwhelming force a hope a longing an endeavor by days of penance and nights of prayer to frustrate and defeat despair calm deep and still is now my heart with tranquil waters overflowed a lake whose unseen fountains start where once the hot volcano glowed and you o prince of hoheneck have known me in that earlier time a man of violence and crime whose passions brooked no curb nor check behold me now in gentler mood one of this holy brotherhood give me your hand here let me kneel make your reproaches sharp as steel spurn me and smite me on each cheek no violence can harm the meek there is no wound christ cannot heal yes lift your princely hand and take revenge if t is revenge you seek then pardon me for jesus sake prince henry arise count hugo let there be no further strife nor enmity between us twain we both have erred too rash in act too wroth in word from the beginning have we stood in fierce defiant attitude each thoughtless of the others right and each reliant on his might but now our souls are more subdued the hand of god and not in vain has touched us with the fire of pain let us kneel down and side by side pray till our souls are purified and pardon will not be denied they kneel the refectory gaudiolum of monks at midnight lucifer disguised as a friar friar paul sings ave color vini clari dulcis potus non amari tua nos inebriari digneris potentia friar cuthbert not so much noise my worthy freres youll disturb the abbot at his prayers friar paul sings o quam placens in colore o quam fragrans in odore o quam sapidum in ore dulce linguae vinculum friar cuthbert i should think your tongue had broken its chain friar paul sings felix venter quem intrabis felix guttur quod rigabis felix os quod tu lavabis et beata labia friar cuthbert peace i say peace will you never cease you will rouse up the abbot i tell you again friar john no danger tonight he will let us alone as i happen to know he has guests of his own friar cuthbert who are they friar john a german prince and his train who arrived here just before the rain there is with him a damsel fair to see as slender and graceful as a reed when she alighted from her steed it seemed like a blossom blown from a tree friar cuthbert none of your palefaced girls for me none of your damsels of high degree friar john come old fellow drink down to your peg but do not drink any further i beg friar paul sings in the days of gold the days of old crosier of wood and bishop of gold friar cuthbert what an infernal racket and riot can you not drink your wine in quiet why fill the convent with such scandals as if we were so many drunken vandals friar paul continues now we have changed that law so good to crosier of gold and bishop of wood friar cuthbert well then since you are in the mood to give your noisy humors vent sing and howl to your hearts content chorus of monks funde vinum funde tanquam sint fluminis undae nec quaeras unde sed fundas semper abunde friar john what is the name of yonder friar with an eye that glows like a coal of fire and such a black mass of tangled hair friar paul he who is sitting there with a rollicking devil may care free and easy look and air as if he were used to such feasting and frolicking friar john the same friar paul hes a stranger you had better ask his name and where he is going and whence he came friar john hallo sir friar friar paul you must raise your voice a little higher he does not seem to hear what you say now try again he is looking this way friar john hallo sir friar we wish to inquire whence you came and where you are going and anything else that is worth the knowing so be so good as to open your head lucifer i am a frenchman born and bred going on a pilgrimage to rome my home is the convent of st gildas de rhuys of which very like you never have heard monks never a word lucifer you must know then it is in the diocese called the diocese of vannes in the province of brittany from the gray rocks of morbihan it overlooks the angry sea the very seashore where in his great despair abbot abelard walked to and fro filling the night with woe and wailing aloud to the merciless seas the name of his sweet heloise whilst overhead the convent windows gleamed as red as the fiery eyes of the monks within who with jovial din gave themselves up to all kinds of sin ha that is a convent that is an abbey over the doors none of your deathheads carved in wood none of your saints looking pious and good none of your patriarchs old and shabby but the heads and tusks of boars and the cells hung all round with the fells of the fallowdeer and then what cheer what jolly fat friars sitting round the great roaring fires roaring louder than they with their strong wines and their concubines and never a bell with its swagger and swell calling you up with a start of affright in the dead of night to send you grumbling down dark stairs to mumble your prayers but the cheery crow of cocks in the yard below after daybreak an hour or so and the barking of deepmouthed hounds these are the sounds that instead of bells salute the ear and then all day up and away through the forest hunting the deer ah my friends im afraid that here you are a little too pious a little too tame and the more is the shame t is the greatest folly not to be jolly thats what i think come drink drink drink and die game monks and your abbot whatshisname lucifer abelard monks did he drink hard lucifer oh no not he he was a dry old fellow without juice enough to get thoroughly mellow there he stood lowering at us in sullen mood as if he had come into brittany just to reform our brotherhood a roar of laughter but you see it never would do for some of us knew a thing or two in the abbey of st gildas de rhuys for instance the great ado with old fulberts niece the young and lovely heloise friar john stop there if you please till we drink so the fair heloise all drinking and shouting heloise heloise the chapelbell tolls lucifer starting what is that bell for are you such asses as to keep up the fashion of midnight masses friar cuthbert it is only a poor unfortunate brother who is gifted with most miraculous powers of getting up at all sorts of hours and by way of penance and christian meekness of creeping silently out of his cell to take a pull at that hideous bell so that all monks who are lying awake may murmur some kind of prayer for his sake and adapted to his peculiar weakness friar john from frailty and fall all good lord deliver us all friar cuthbert and before the bell for matins sounds he takes his lantern and goes the rounds flashing it into our sleepy eyes merely to say it is time to arise but enough of that go on if you please with your story about st gildas de rhuys lucifer well it finally came to pass that half in fun and half in malice one sunday at mass we put some poison into the chalice but either by accident or design peter abelard kept away from the chapel that day and a poor young friar who in his stead drank the sacramental wine fell on the steps of the altar dead but look do you see at the window there that face with a look of grief and despair that ghastly face as of one in pain monks who where lucifer as i spoke it vanished away again friar cuthbert it is that nefarious siebald the refectorarius that fellow is always playing the scout creeping and peeping and prowling about and then he regales the abbot with scandalous tales lucifer a spy in the convent one of the brothers telling scandalous tales of the others out upon him the lazy loon i would put a stop to that pretty soon in a way he should rue it monks how shall we do it lucifer do you brother paul creep under the window close to the wall and open it suddenly when i call then seize the villain by the hair and hold him there and punish him soundly once for all friar cuthbert as saint dunstan of old we are told once caught the devil by the nose lucifer ha ha that story is very clever but has no foundation whatsoever quick for i see his face again glaring in at the windowpane now now and do not spare your blows friar paul opens the window suddenly and seizes siebald they beat him friar siebald help help are you going to slay me friar paul that will teach you again to betray me friar siebald mercy mercy friar paul shouting and beating rumpas bellorum lorum vim confer amorum morum verorum rorum tu plena polorum lucifer who stands in the doorway yonder stretching out his trembling hand just as abelard used to stand the flash of his keen black eyes forerunning the thunder the monks in confusion the abbot the abbot friar cuthbert and what is the wonder he seems to have taken you by surprise friar francis hide the great flagon from the eyes of the dragon friar cuthbert pull the brown hood over your face this will bring us into disgrace abbot what means this revel and carouse is this a tavern and drinkinghouse are you christian monks or heathen devils to pollute this convent with your revels were peter damian still upon earth to be shocked by such ungodly mirth he would write your names with pen of gall in his book of gomorrah one and all away you drunkards to your cells and pray till you hear the matinbells you brother francis and you brother paul and as a penance mark each prayer with the scourge upon your shoulders bare nothing atones for such a sin but the blood that follows the discipline and you brother cuthbert come with me alone into the sacristy you who should be a guide to your brothers and are ten times worse than all the others for you ive a draught that has long been brewing you shall do a penance worth the doing away to your prayers then one and all i wonder the very convent wall does not crumble and crush you in its fall the neighboring nunnery the abbess irmingard sitting with elsie in the moonlight irmingard the night is silent the wind is still the moon is looking from yonder hill down upon convent and grove and garden the clouds have passed away from her face leaving behind them no sorrowful trace only the tender and quiet grace of one whose heart has been healed with pardon and such am i my soul within was dark with passion and soiled with sin but now its wounds are healed again gone are the anguish the terror and pain for across that desolate land of woe oer whose burning sands i was forced to go a wind from heaven began to blow and all my being trembled and shook as the leaves of the tree or the grass of the field and i was healed as the sick are healed when fanned by the leaves of the holy book as thou sittest in the moonlight there its glory flooding thy golden hair and the only darkness that which lies in the haunted chambers of thine eyes i feel my soul drawn unto thee strangely and strongly and more and more as to one i have known and loved before for every soul is akin to me that dwells in the land of mystery i am the lady irmingard born of a noble race and name many a wandering suabian bard whose life was dreary and bleak and hard has found through me the way to fame brief and bright were those days and the night which followed was full of a lurid light love that of every womans heart will have the whole and not a part that is to her in natures plan more than ambition is to man her light her life her very breath with no alternative but death found me a maiden soft and young just from the convents cloistered school and seated on my lowly stool attentive while the minstrels sung gallant graceful gentle tall fairest noblest best of all was walter of the vogelweid and whatsoever may betide still i think of him with pride his song was of the summertime the very birds sang in his rhyme the sunshine the delicious air the fragrance of the flowers were there and i grew restless as i heard restless and buoyant as a bird down soft aerial currents sailing oer blossomed orchards and fields in bloom and through the momentary gloom of shadows oer the landscape trailing yielding and borne i knew not where but feeling resistance unavailing and thus unnoticed and apart and more by accident than choice i listened to that single voice until the chambers of my heart were filled with it by night and day one night it was a night in may within the garden unawares under the blossoms in the gloom i heard it utter my own name with protestations and wild prayers and it rang through me and became like the archangels trump of doom which the soul hears and must obey and mine arose as from a tomb my former life now seemed to me such as hereafter death may be when in the great eternity we shall awake and find it day it was a dream and would not stay a dream that in a single night faded and vanished out of sight my fathers anger followed fast this passion as a freshening blast seeks out and fans the fire whose rage it may increase but not assuage and he exclaimed no wandering bard shall win thy hand o irmingard for which prince henry of hoheneck by messenger and letter sues gently but firmly i replied henry of hoheneck i discard never the hand of irmingard shall lie in his as the hand of a bride this said i walter for thy sake this said i for i could not choose after a pause my father spake in that cold and deliberate tone which turns the hearer into stone and seems itself the act to be that follows with such dread certainty this or the cloister and the veil no other words than these he said but they were like a funeral wail my life was ended my heart was dead that night from the castlegate went down with silent slow and stealthy pace two shadows mounted on shadowy steeds taking the narrow path that leads into the forest dense and brown in the leafy darkness of the place one could not distinguish form nor face only a bulk without a shape a darker shadow in the shade one scarce could say it moved or stayed thus it was we made our escape a foaming brook with many a bound followed us like a playful hound then leaped before us and in the hollow paused and waited for us to follow and seemed impatient and afraid that our tardy flight should be betrayed by the sound our horses hoofbeats made and when we reached the plain below we paused a moment and drew rein to look back at the castle again and we saw the windows all aglow with lights that were passing to and fro our hearts with terror ceased to beat the brook crept silent to our feet we knew what most we feared to know then suddenly horns began to blow and we heard a shout and a heavy tramp and our horses snorted in the damp nightair of the meadows green and wide and in a moment side by side so close they must have seemed but one the shadows across the moonlight run and another came and swept behind like the shadow of clouds before the wind how i remember that breathless flight across the moors in the summer night how under our feet the long white road backward like a river flowed sweeping with it fences and hedges whilst farther away and overhead paler than i with fear and dread the moon fled with us as we fled along the forests jagged edges all this i can remember well but of what afterwards befell i nothing further can recall than a blind desperate headlong fall the rest is a blank and darkness all when i awoke out of this swoon the sun was shining not the moon making a cross upon the wall with the bars of my windows narrow and tall and i prayed to it as i had been wont to pray from early childhood day by day each morning as in bed i lay i was lying again in my own room and i thanked god in my fever and pain that those shadows on the midnight plain were gone and could not come again i struggled no longer with my doom this happened many years ago i left my fathers home to come like catherine to her martyrdom for blindly i esteemed it so and when i heard the convent door behind me close to ope no more i felt it smite me like a blow through all my limbs a shudder ran and on my bruised spirit fell the dampness of my narrow cell as nightair on a wounded man giving intolerable pain but now a better life began i felt the agony decrease by slow degrees then wholly cease ending in perfect rest and peace it was not apathy nor dulness that weighed and pressed upon my brain but the same passion i had given to earth before now turned to heaven with all its overflowing fulness alas the world is full of peril the path that runs through the fairest meads on the sunniest side of the valley leads into a region bleak and sterile alike in the highborn and the lowly the will is feeble and passion strong we cannot sever right from wrong some falsehood mingles with all truth nor is it strange the heart of youth should waver and comprehend but slowly the things that are holy and unholy but in this sacred calm retreat we are all well and safely shielded from winds that blow and waves that beat from the cold and rain and blighting heat to which the strongest hearts have yielded here we stand as the virgins seven for our celestial bridegroom yearning our hearts are lamps forever burning with a steady and unwavering flame pointing upward forever the same steadily upward toward the heaven the moon is hidden behind a cloud a sudden darkness fills the room and thy deep eyes amid the gloom shine like jewels in a shroud on the leaves is a sound of falling rain a bird awakened in its nest gives a faint twitter of unrest then smooths its plumes and sleeps again no other sounds than these i hear the hour of midnight must be near thou art oerspent with the days fatigue of riding many a dusty league sink then gently to thy slumber me so many cares encumber so many ghosts and forms of fright have started from their graves tonight they have driven sleep from mine eyes away i will go down to the chapel and pray v a covered bridge at lucerne prince henry gods blessing on the architects who build the bridges oer swift rivers and abysses before impassable to human feet no less than on the builders of cathedrals whose massive walls are bridges thrown across the dark and terrible abyss of death well has the name of pontifex been given unto the churchs head as the chief builder and architect of the invisible bridge that leads from earth to heaven elsie how dark it grows what are these paintings on the walls around us prince henry the dance macaber elsie what prince henry the dance of death all that go to and fro must look upon it mindful of what they shall be while beneath among the wooden piles the turbulent river rushes impetuous as the river of life with dimpling eddies ever green and bright save where the shadow of this bridge falls on it elsie oh yes i see it now prince henry the grim musician leads all men through the mazes of that dance to different sounds in different measures moving sometimes he plays a lute sometimes a drum to tempt or terrify elsie what is this picture prince henry it is a young man singing to a nun who kneels at her devotions but in kneeling turns round to look at him and death meanwhile is putting out the candles on the altar elsie ah what a pity t is that she should listen unto such songs when in her orisons she might have heard in heaven the angels singing prince henry here he has stolen a jesters cap and bells and dances with the queen elsie a foolish jest prince henry and here the heart of the newwedded wife coming from church with her beloved lord he startles with the rattle of his drum elsie ah that is sad and yet perhaps t is best that she should die with all the sunshine on her and all the benedictions of the morning before this affluence of golden light shall fade into a cold and clouded gray then into darkness prince henry under it is written nothing but death shall separate thee and me elsie and what is this that follows close upon it prince henry death playing on a dulcimer behind him a poor old woman with a rosary follows the sound and seems to wish her feet were swifter to oertake him underneath the inscription reads better is death than life elsie better is death than life ah yes to thousands death plays upon a dulcimer and sings that song of consolation till the air rings with it and they cannot choose but follow whither he leads and not the old alone but the young also hear it and are still prince henry yes in their sadder moments t is the sound of their own hearts they hear half full of tears which are like crystal cups half filled with water responding to the pressure of a finger with music sweet and low and melancholy let us go forward and no longer stay in this great picturegallery of death i hate it ay the very thought of it elsie why is it hateful to you prince henry for the reason that life and all that speaks of life is lovely and death and all that speaks of death is hateful elsie the grave itself is but a covered bridge leading from light to light through a brief darkness prince henry emerging from the bridge i breathe again more freely ah how pleasant to come once more into the light of day out of that shadow of death to hear again the hoofbeats of our horses on firm ground and not upon those hollow planks resounding with a sepulchral echo like the clods on coffins in a churchyard yonder lies the lake of the four foresttowns apparelled in light and lingering like a village maiden hid in the bosom of her native mountains then pouring all her life into anothers changing her name and being overhead shaking his cloudy tresses loose in air rises pilatus with his windy pines they pass on the devils bridge prince henry and elsie crossing with attendants guide this bridge is called the devils bridge with a single arch from ridge to ridge it leaps across the terrible chasm yawning beneath us black and deep as if in some convulsive spasm the summits of the hills had cracked and made a road for the cataract that raves and rages down the steep lucifer under the bridge ha ha guide never any bridge but this could stand across the wild abyss all the rest of wood or stone by the devils hand were overthrown he toppled crags from the precipice and whatsoeer was built by day in the night was swept away none could stand but this alone lucifer under the bridge ha ha guide i showed you in the valley a bowlder marked with the imprint of his shoulder as he was bearing it up this way a peasant passing cried herr je and the devil dropped it in his fright and vanished suddenly out of sight lucifer under the bridge ha ha guide abbot giraldus of einsiedel for pilgrims on their way to rome built this at last with a single arch under which on its endless march runs the river white with foam like a thread through the eye of a needle and the devil promised to let it stand under compact and condition that the first living thing which crossed should he surrendered into his hand and be beyond redemption lost lucifer under the bridge ha ha perdition guide at length the bridge being all completed the abbot standing at its head threw across it a loaf of bread which a hungry dog sprang after and the rocks reechoed with the peals of laughter to see the devil thus defeated they pass on lucifer under the bridge ha ha defeated for journeys and for crimes like this i let the bridge stand oer the abyss the st gothard pass prince henry this is the highest point two ways the rivers leap down to different seas and as they roll grow deep and still and their majestic presence becomes a benefaction to the towns they visit wandering silently among them like patriarchs old among their shining tents elsie how bleak and bare it is nothing but mosses grow on these rocks prince henry yet are they not forgotten beneficent nature sends the mists to feed them elsie see yonder little cloud that borne aloft so tenderly by the wind floats fast away over the snowy peaks it seems to me the body of st catherine borne by angels prince henry thou art st catherine and invisible angels bear thee across these chasms and precipices lest thou shouldst dash thy feet against a stone elsie would i were borne unto my grave as she was upon angelic shoulders even now i seem uplifted by them light as air what sound is that prince henry the tumbling avalanches elsie how awful yet how beautiful prince henry these are the voices of the mountains thus they ope their snowy lips and speak unto each other in the primeval language lost to man elsie what land is this that spreads itself beneath us prince henry italy italy elsie land of the madonna how beautiful it is it seems a garden of paradise prince henry nay of gethsemane to thee and me of passion and of prayer yet once of paradise long years ago i wandered as a youth among its bowers and never from my heart has faded quite its memory that like a summer sunset encircles with a ring of purple light all the horizon of my youth guide o friends the days are short the way before us long we must not linger if we think to reach the inn at belinzona before vespers they pass on at the foot of the alps a halt under the trees at noon prince henry here let us pause a moment in the trembling shadow and sunshine of the roadside trees and our tired horses in a group assembling inhale long draughts of this delicious breeze our fleeter steeds have distanced our attendants they lag behind us with a slower pace we will await them under the green pendants of the great willows in this shady place ho barbarossa how thy mottled haunches sweat with this canter over hill and glade stand still and let these overhanging branches fan thy hot sides and comfort thee with shade elsie what a delightful landscape spreads before us marked with a whitewashed cottage here and there and in luxuriant garlands drooping oer us blossoms of grapevines scent the sunny air prince henry hark what sweet sounds are those whose accents holy fill the warm noon with music sad and sweet elsie it is a band of pilgrims moving slowly on their long journey with uncovered feet pilgrims chanting the hymn of st hildebert me receptet sion illa sion david urbs tranquilla cujus faber auctor lucis cujus portae lignum crucis cujus claves lingua petri cujus cives semper laeti cujus muri lapis vivus cujus custos rex festivus lucifer as a friar in the procession here am i too in the pious band in the garb of a barefooted carmelite dressed the soles of my feet are as hard and tanned as the conscience of old pope hildebrand the holy satan who made the wives of the bishops lead such shameful lives all day long i beat my breast and chant with a most particular zest the latin hymns which i understand quite as well i think as the rest and at night such lodging in barns and sheds such a hurlyburly in country inns such a clatter of tongues in empty heads such a helterskelter of prayers and sins of all the contrivances of the time for sowing broadcast the seeds of crime there is none so pleasing to me and mine as a pilgrimage to some faroff shrine prince henry if from the outward man we judge the inner and cleanliness is godliness i fear a hopeless reprobate a hardened sinner must be that carmelite now passing near lucifer there is my german prince again thus far on his journey to salern and the lovesick girl whose heated brain is sowing the cloud to reap the rain but its a long road that has no turn let them quietly hold their way i have also a part in the play but first i must act to my hearts content this mummery and this merriment and drive this motley flock of sheep into the fold where drink and sleep the jolly old friars of benevent of a truth it often provokes me to laugh to see these beggars hobble along lamed and maimed and fed upon chaff chanting their wonderful puff and paff and to make up for not understanding the song singing it fiercely and wild and strong were it not for my magic garters and staff and the goblets of goodly wine i quaff and the mischief i make in the idle throng i should not continue the business long pilgrims chanting in hac urbe lux solennis ver aeternum pax perennis in hac odor implens caelos in hac semper festum melos prince henry do you observe that monk among the train who pours from his great throat the roaring bass as a cathedral spout pours out the rain and this way turns his rubicund round face elsie it is the same who on the strasburg square preached to the people in the open air prince henry and he has crossed oer mountain field and fell on that good steed that seems to bear him well the hackney of the friars of orders gray his own stout legs he too was in the play both as king herod and ben israel good morrow friar friar cuthbert good morrow noble sir prince henry i speak in german for unless i err you are a german friar cuthbert i cannot gainsay you but by what instinct or what secret sign meeting me here do you straightway divine that northward of the alps my country lies prince henry your accent like st peters would betray you did not your yellow beard and your blue eyes moreover we have seen your face before and heard you preach at the cathedral door on easter sunday in the strasburg square we were among the crowd that gathered there and saw you play the rabbi with great skill as if by leaning oer so many years to walk with little children your own will had caught a childish attitude from theirs a kind of stooping in its form and gait and could no longer stand erect and straight whence come you now friar cuthbert from the old monastery of hirschau in the forest being sent upon a pilgrimage to benevent to see the image of the virgin mary that moves its holy eyes and sometimes speaks and lets the piteous tears run down its cheeks to touch the hearts of the impenitent prince henry oh had i faith as in the days gone by that knew no doubt and feared no mystery lucifer at a distance ho cuthbert friar cuthbert friar cuthbert fare well prince i cannot stay to argue and convince prince henry this is indeed the blessed marys land virgin and mother of our dear redeemer all hearts are touched and softened at her name alike the bandit with the bloody hand the priest the prince the scholar and the peasant the man of deeds the visionary dreamer pay homage to her as one ever present and even as children who have much offended a too indulgent father in great shame penitent and yet not daring unattended to go into his presence at the gate speak with their sister and confiding wait till she goes in before and intercedes so men repenting of their evil deeds and yet not venturing rashly to draw near with their requests an angry fathers ear offer to her their prayers and their confession and she for them in heaven makes intercession and if our faith had given us nothing more than this example of all womanhood so mild so merciful so strong so good so patient peaceful loyal loving pure this were enough to prove it higher and truer than all the creeds the world had known before pilgrims chanting afar off urbs coelestis urbs beata supra petram collocata urbs in portu satis tuto de longinquo te saluto te saluto te suspiro te affecto te requiro the inn at genoa a terrace overlooking the sea night prince henry it is the sea it is the sea in all its vague immensity fading and darkening in the distance silent majestical and slow the white ships haunt it to and fro with all their ghostly sails unfurled as phantoms from another world haunt the dim confines of existence but ah how few can comprehend their signals or to what good end from land to land they come and go upon a sea more vast and dark the spirits of the dead embark all voyaging to unknown coasts we wave our farewells from the shore and they depart and come no more or come as phantoms and as ghosts above the darksome sea of death looms the great life that is to be a land of cloud and mystery a dim mirage with shapes of men long dead and passed beyond our ken awestruck we gaze and hold our breath till the fair pageant vanisheth leaving us in perplexity and doubtful whether it has been a vision of the world unseen or a bright image of our own against the sky in vapors thrown lucifer singing from the sea thou didst not make it thou canst not mend it but thou hast the power to end it the sea is silent the sea is discreet deep it lies at thy very feet there is no confessor like unto death thou canst not see him but he is near thou needst not whisper above thy breath and he will hear he will answer the questions the vague surmises and suggestions that fill thy soul with doubt and fear prince henry the fisherman who lies afloat with shadowy sail in yonder boat is singing softly to the night but do i comprehend aright the meaning of the words he sung so sweetly in his native tongue ah yes the sea is still and deep all things within its bosom sleep a single step and all is oer a plunge a bubble an no more and thou dear elsie wilt be free from martyrdom and agony elsie coming from her chamber upon the terrace the night is calm and cloudless and still as still can be and the stars come forth to listen to the music of the sea they gather and gather and gather until they crowd the sky and listen in breathless silence to the solemn litany it begins in rocky caverns as a voice that chants alone to the pedals of the organ in monotonous undertone and anon from shelving beaches and shallow sands beyond in snowwhite robes uprising the ghostly choirs respond and sadly and unceasing the mournful voice sings on and the snowwhite choirs still answer christe eleison prince henry angel of god thy finer sense perceives celestial and perpetual harmonies thy purer soul that trembles and believes hears the archangels trumpet in the breeze and where the forest rolls or ocean heaves cecilias organ sounding in the seas and tongues of prophets speaking in the leaves but i hear discord only and despair and whispers as of demons in the air at sea il padrone the wind upon our quarter lies and on before the freshening gale that fills the snowwhite lateen sail swiftly our light felucca flies around the billows burst and foam they lift her oer the sunken rock they beat her sides with many a shock and then upon their flowing dome they poise her like a weathercock between us and the western skies the hills of corsica arise eastward in yonder long blue line the summits of the apennine and southward and still far away salerno on its sunny bay you cannot see it where it lies prince henry ah would that never more mine eyes might see its towers by night or day elsie behind us dark and awfully there comes a cloud out of the sea that bears the form of a hunted deer with hide of brown and hoofs of black and antlers laid upon its back and fleeing fast and wild with fear as if the hounds were on its track prince henry lo while we gaze it breaks and falls in shapeless masses like the walls of a burnt city broad and red the flies of the descending sun glare through the windows and oerhead athwart the vapors dense and dun long shafts of silvery light arise like rafters that support the skies elsie see from its summit the lurid levin flashes downward without warning as lucifer son of the morning fell from the battlements of heaven il padrone i must entreat you friends below the angry storm begins to blow for the weather changes with the moon all this morning until noon we had baffling winds and sudden flaws struck the sea with their catspaws only a little hour ago i was whistling to saint antonio for a capful of wind to fill our sail and instead of a breeze he has sent a gale last night i saw st elmos stars with their glimmering lanterns all at play on the tops of the masts and the tips of the spars and i knew we should have foul weather today cheerily my hearties yo heave ho brail up the mainsail and let her go as the winds will and saint antonio do you see that livornese felucca that vessel to the windward yonder running with her gunwale under i was looking when the wind oertook her she had all sail set and the only wonder is that at once the strength of the blast did not carry away her mast she is a galley of the gran duca that through the fear of the algerines convoys those lazy brigantines laden with wine and oil from lucca now all is ready high and low blow blow good saint antonio ha that is the first dash of the rain with a sprinkle of spray above the rails just enough to moisten our sails and make them ready for the strain see how she leaps as the blasts oertake her and speeds away with a bone in her mouth now keep her head toward the south and there is no danger of bank or breaker with the breeze behind us on we go not too much good saint antonio vi the school of salerno a travelling scholastic affixing his theses to the gate of the college scholastic there that is my gauntlet my banner my shield hung up as a challenge to all the field one hundred and twentyfive propositions which i will maintain with the sword of the tongue against all disputants old and young let us see if doctors or dialecticians will dare to dispute my definitions or attack any one of my learned theses here stand i the end shall be as god pleases i think i have proved by profound researches the error of all those doctrines so vicious of the old areopagite dionysius that are making such terrible work in the churches by michael the stammerer sent from the east and done into latin by that scottish beast johannes duns scotus who dares to maintain in the face of the truth the error infernal that the universe is and must be eternal at first laying down as a fact fundamental that nothing with god can be accidental then asserting that god before the creation could not have existed because it is plain that had he existed he would have created which is begging the question that should be debated and moveth me less to anger than laughter all nature he holds is a respiration of the spirit of god who in breathing hereafter will inhale it into his bosom again so that nothing but god alone will remain and therein he contradicteth himself for he opens the whole discussion by stating that god can only exist in creating that question i think i have laid on the shelf he goes out two doctors come in disputing and followed by pupils doctor serafino i with the doctor seraphic maintain that a word which is only conceived in the brain is a type of eternal generation the spoken word is the incarnation doctor cherubino what do i care for the doctor seraphic with all his wordy chaffer and traffic doctor serafino you make but a paltry show of resistance universals have no real existence doctor cherubino your words are but idle and empty chatter ideas are eternally joined to matter doctor serafino may the lord have mercy on your position you wretched wrangling culler of herbs doctor cherubino may he send your soul to eternal perdition for your treatise on the irregular verbs they rush out fighting two scholars come in first scholar monte cassino then is your college what think you of ours here at salern second scholar to tell the truth i arrived so lately i hardly yet have had time to discern so much at least i am bound to acknowledge the air seems healthy the buildings stately and on the whole i like it greatly first scholar yes the air is sweet the calabrian hills send us down puffs of mountain air and in summertime the seabreeze fills with its coolness cloister and court and square then at every season of the year there are crowds of guests and travellers here pilgrims and mendicant friars and traders from the levant with figs and wine and bands of wounded and sick crusaders coming back from palestine second scholar and what are the studies you pursue what is the course you here go through first scholar the first three years of the college course are given to logic alone as the source of all that is noble and wise and true second scholar that seems rather strange i must confess in a medical school yet nevertheless you doubtless have reasons for that first scholar oh yes for none but a clever dialectician can hope to become a great physician that has been settled long ago logic makes an important part of the mystery of the healing art for without it how could you hope to show that nobody knows so much as you know after this there are five years more devoted wholly to medicine with lectures on chirurgical lore and dissections of the bodies of swine as likest the human form divine second scholar what are the books now most in vogue first scholar quite an extensive catalogue mostly however books of our own as gariopontus passionarius and the writings of matthew platearius and a volume universally known as the regimen of the school of salern for robert of normandy written in terse and very elegant latin verse each of these writings has its turn and when at length we have finished these then comes the struggle for degrees will all the oldest and ablest critics the public thesis and disputation question and answer and explanation of a passage out of hippocrates or aristotles analytics there the triumphant magister stands a book is solemnly placed in his hands on which he swears to follow the rule and ancient forms of the good old school to report if any confectionarius mingles his drugs with matters various and to visit his patients twice a day and once in the night if they live in town and if they are poor to take no pay having faithfully promised these his head is crowned with a laurel crown a kiss on his cheek a ring on his hand the magister artium et physices goes forth from the school like a lord of the land and now as we have the whole morning before us let us go in if you make no objection and listen awhile to a learned prelection on marcus aurelius cassioderus they go in enter lucifer as a doctor lucifer this is the great school of salern a land of wrangling and of quarrels of brains that seethe and hearts that burn where every emulous scholar hears in every breath that comes to his ears the rustling of anothers laurels the air of the place is called salubrious the neighborhood of vesuvius lends it au odor volcanic that rather mends it and the buildings have an aspect lugubrious that inspires a feeling of awe and terror into the heart of the beholder and befits such an ancient homestead of error where the old falsehoods moulder and smoulder and yearly by many hundred hands are carried away in the zeal of youth and sown like tares in the field of truth to blossom and ripen in other lands what have we here affixed to the gate the challenge of some scholastic wight who wishes to hold a public debate on sundry questions wrong or right ah now this is my great delight for i have often observed of late that such discussions end in a fight let us see what the learned wag maintains with such a prodigal waste of brains reads whether angels in moving from place to place pass through the intermediate space whether god himself is the author of evil or whether that is the work of the devil when where and wherefore lucifer fell and whether he now is chained in hell i think i can answer that question well so long as the boastful human mind consents in such mills as this to grind i sit very firmly upon my throne of a truth it almost makes me laugh to see men leaving the golden grain to gather in piles the pitiful chaff that old peter lombard thrashed with his brain to have it caught up and tossed again on the horns of the dumb ox of cologne but my guests approach there is in the air a fragrance like that of the beautiful garden of paradise in the days that were an odor of innocence and of prayer and of love and faith that never fails such as the fresh young heart exhales before it begins to wither and harden i cannot breathe such an atmosphere my soul is filled with a nameless fear that after all my trouble and pain after all my restless endeavor the youngest fairest soul of the twain the most ethereal most divine will escape from my hands for ever and ever but the other is already mine let him live to corrupt his race breathing among them with every breath weakness selfishness and the base and pusillanimous fear of death i know his nature and i know that of all who in my ministry wander the great earth to and fro and on my errands come and go the safest and subtlest are such as he enter prince henry and elsie with attendants prince henry can you direct us to friar angelo lucifer he stands before you prince henry then you know our purpose i am prince henry of hoheneck and this the maiden that i spake of in my letters lucifer it is a very grave and solemn business we must nor be precipitate does she without compulsion of her own free will consent to this prince henry against all opposition against all prayers entreaties protestations she will not be persuaded lucifer that is strange have you thought well of it elsie i come not here to argue but to die your business is not to question but to kill me i am ready i am impatient to be gone from here ere any thoughts of earth disturb again the spirit of tranquillity within me prince henry would i had not come here would i were dead and thou wert in thy cottage in the forest and hadst not known me why have i done this let me go back and die elsie it cannot be not if these cold flat stones on which we tread were coulters heated white and yonder gateway flamed like a furnace with a sevenfold heat i must fulfil my purpose prince henry i forbid it not one step further for i only meant to put thus far thy courage to the proof it is enough i too have strength to die for thou hast taught me elsie o my prince remember your promises let me fulfil my errand you do not look on life and death as i do there are two angels that attend unseen each one of us and in great books record our good and evil deeds he who writes down the good ones after every action closes his volume and ascends with it to god the other keeps his dreadful daybook open till sunset that we may repent which doing the record of the action fades away and leaves a line of white across the page now if my act be good as i believe it cannot be recalled it is already sealed up in heaven as a good deed accomplished the rest is yours why wait you i am ready to her attendants weep not my friends rather rejoice with me i shall not feel the pain but shall be gone and you will have another friend in heaven then start not at the creaking of the door through which i pass i see what lies beyond it to prince henry and you o prince bear back my benison unto my fathers house and all within it this morning in the church i prayed for them after confession after absolution when my whole soul was white i prayed for them god will take care of them they need me not and in your life let my remembrance linger as something not to trouble and disturb it but to complete it adding life to life and if at times beside the evening fire you see my face among the other faces let it not be regarded as a ghost that haunts your house but as a guest that loves you nay even as one of your own family without whose presence there were something wanting i have no more to say let us go in prince henry friar angelo i charge you on your life believe not what she says for she is mad and comes here not to die but to be healed elsie alas prince henry lucifer come with me this way elsie goes in with lucifer who thrusts prince henry back and closes the door prince henry gone and the light of all my life gone with her a sudden darkness falls upon the world oh what a vile and abject thing am i that purchase length of days at such a cost not by her death alone but by the death of all thats good and true and noble in me all manhood excellence and selfrespect all love and faith and hope and heart are dead all my divine nobility of nature by this one act is forfeited forever i am a prince in nothing but in name to the attendants why did you let this horrible deed be done why did you not lay hold on her and keep her from self destruction angelo murderer struggles at the door but cannot open it elsie within farewell dear prince farewell prince henry unbar the door lucifer it is too late prince henry it shall not be too late they burst the door open and rush in the farmhouse in the odenwald ursula spinning a summer afternoon a table spread ursula i have marked it well it must be true death never takes one alone but two whenever he enters in at a door under roof of gold or roof of thatch he always leaves it upon the latch and comes again ere the year is oer never one of a household only perhaps it is a mercy of god lest the dead there under the sod in the land of strangers should be lonely ah me i think i am lonelier here it is hard to go but harder to stay were it not for the children i should pray that death would take me within the year and gottlieb he is at work all day in the sunny field or the forest murk but i know that his thoughts are far away i know that his heart is not in his work and when he comes home to me at night he is not cheery but sits and sighs and i see the great tears in his eyes and try to be cheerful for his sake only the childrens hearts are light mine is weary and ready to break god help us i hope we have done right we thought we were acting for the best looking through the open door who is it coming under the trees a man in the princes livery dressed he looks about him with doubtful face as if uncertain of the place he stops at the beehives now he sees the garden gate he is going past can he be afraid of the bees no he is coming in at last he fills my heart with strange alarm enter a forester forester is this the tenant gottliebs farm ursula this is his farm and i his wife pray sit what may your business be forester news from the prince ursula of death or life forester you put your questions eagerly ursula answer me then how is the prince forester i left him only two hours since homeward returning down the river as strong and well as if god the giver had given him back his youth again ursula despairing then elsie my poor child is dead forester that my good woman i have not said dont cross the bridge till you come to it is a proverb old and of excellent wit ursula keep me no longer in this pain forester it is true your daughter is no more that is the peasant she was before ursula alas i am simple and lowly bred i am poor distracted and forlorn and it is not well that you of the court should mock me thus and make a sport of a joyless mother whose child is dead for you too were of mother born forester your daughter lives and the prince is well you will learn erelong how it all befell her heart for a moment never failed but when they reached salernos gate the princes nobler self prevailed and saved her for a noble fate and he was healed in his despair by the touch of st matthews sacred bones though i think the long ride in the open air that pilgrimage over stocks and stones in the miracle must come in for a share ursula virgin who lovest the poor and lowly if the loud cry of a mothers heart can ever ascend to where thou art into thy blessed hands and holy receive my prayer of praise and thanksgiving let the hands that bore our saviour bear it into the awful presence of god for thy feet with holiness are shod and if thou hearest it he will hear it our child who was dead again is living forester i did not tell you she was dead if you thought so t was no fault of mine at this very moment while i speak they are sailing homeward down the rhine in a splendid barge with golden prow and decked with banners white and red as the colors on your daughters cheek they call her the lady alicia now for the prince in salerno made a vow that elsie only would he wed ursula jesu maria what a change all seems to me so weird and strange forester i saw her standing on the deck beneath an awning cool and shady her cap of velvet could not hold the tresses of her hair of gold that flowed and floated like the stream and fell in masses down her neck as fair and lovely did she seem as in a story or a dream some beautiful and foreign lady and the prince looked so grand and proud and waved his hand thus to the crowd that gazed and shouted from the shore all down the river long and loud ursula we shall behold our child once more she is not dead she is not dead god listening must have overheard the prayers that without sound or word our hearts in secrecy have said oh bring me to her for mine eyes are hungry to behold her face my very soul within me cries my very hands seem to caress her to see her gaze at her and bless her dear elsie child of god and grace goes out toward the garden forester there goes the good woman out of her head and gottliebs supper is waiting here a very capacious flagon of beer and a very portentous loaf of bread one would say his grief did not much oppress him heres to the health of the prince god bless him he drinks ha it buzzes and stings like a hornet and what a scene there through the door the forest behind and the garden before and midway an old man of threescore with a wife and children that caress him let me try still further to cheer and adorn it with a merry echoing blast of my cornet goes out blowing his horn the castle of vautsberg on the rhine prince henry and elsie standing on the terrace at evening the sound of tells heard from a distance prince henry we are alone the wedding guests ride down the hill with plumes and cloaks and the descending dark invests the niederwald and all the nests among its hoar and haunted oaks elsie what bells are those that ring so slow so mellow musical and low prince henry they are the bells of geisenheim that with their melancholy chime ring out the curfew of the sun elsie listen beloved prince henry they are done dear elsie many years ago those same soft bells at eventide rang in the ears of charlemagne as seated by fastradas side at ingelheim in all his pride he heard their sound with secret pain elsie their voices only speak to me of peace and deep tranquillity and endless confidence in thee prince henry thou knowest the story of her ring how when the court went back to aix fastrada died and how the king sat watching by her night and day till into one of the blue lakes which water that delicious land they cast the ring drawn from her hand and the great monarch sat serene and sad beside the fated shore nor left the land forevermore elsie that was true love prince henry for him the queen neer did what thou hast done for me elsie wilt thou as fond and faithful be wilt thou so love me after death prince henry in lifes delight in deaths dismay in storm and sunshine night and day in health in sickness in decay here and hereafter i am thine thou hast fastradas ring beneath the calm blue waters of thine eyes deep in thy steadfast soul it lies and undisturbed by this worlds breath with magic light its jewels shine this golden ring which thou hast worn upon thy finger since the morn is but a symbol and a semblance an outward fashion a remembrance of what thou wearest within unseen o my fastrada o my queen behold the hilltrips all aglow with purple and with amethyst while the whole valley deep below is filled and seems to overflow with a fastrising tide of mist the evening air grows damp and chill let us go in elsie ah not so soon see yonder fire it is the moon slow rising oer the eastern hill it glimmers on the forest tips and through the dewy foliage drips in little rivulets of light and makes the heart in love with night prince henry oft on this terrace when the day was closing have i stood and gazed and seen the landscape fade away and the white vapors rise and drown hamlet and vineyard tower and town while far above the hilltops blazed but then another hand than thine was gently held and clasped in mine another head upon my breast was laid as thine is now at rest why dost thou lift those tender eyes with so much sorrow and surprise a minstrels not a maidens hand was that which in my own was pressed a manly form usurped thy place a beautiful but bearded face that now is in the holy land yet in my memory from afar is shining on us like a star but linger not for while i speak a sheeted spectre white and tall the cold mist climbs the castle wall and lays his hand upon thy cheek they go in epilogue the two recording angels ascending the angel of good deeds with closed book god sent his messenger the rain and said unto the mountain brook rise up and from thy caverns look and leap with naked snowwhite feet from the cool hills into the heat of the broad arid plain god sent his messenger of faith and whispered in the maidens heart rise up and look from where thou art and scatter with unselfish hands thy freshness on the barren sands and solitudes of death o beauty of holiness of selfforgetfulness of lowliness o power of meekness whose very gentleness and weakness are like the yielding but irresistible air upon the pages of the sealed volume that i bear the deed divine is written in characters of gold that never shall grow old but through all ages burn and shine with soft effulgence o god it is thy indulgence that fills the world with the bliss of a good deed like this the angel of evil deeds with open book not yet not yet is the red sun wholly set but evermore recedes while open still i bear the book of evil deeds to let the breathings of the upper air visit its pages and erase the records from its face fainter and fainter as i gaze in the broad blaze the glimmering landscape shines and below me the black river is hidden by wreaths of vapor fainter and fainter the black lines begin to quiver along the whitening surface of the paper shade after shade the terrible words grow faint and fade and in their place runs a white space down goes the sun but the soul of one who by repentance hath escaped the dreadful sentence shines bright below me as i look it is the end with closed book to god do i ascend lo over the mountain steeps a dark gigantic shadow sweeps beneath my feet a blackness inwardly brightening with sullen heat as a stormcloud lurid with lightning and a cry of lamentation repeated and again repeated deep and loud as the reverberation of cloud answering unto cloud swells and rolls away in the distance as if the sheeted lightning retreated baffled and thwarted by the winds resistance it is lucifer the son of mystery and since god suffers him to be he too is gods minister and labors for some good by us not understood second interlude martin luther a chamber in the wartburg morning martin luther writing martin luther our god a tower of strength is he a goodly wall and weapon from all our need he helps us free that now to us doth happen the old evil foe doth in earnest grow in grim armor dight much guile and great might on earth there is none like him oh yes a tower of strength indeed a present help in all our need a sword and buckler is our god innocent men have walked unshod oer burning ploughshares and have trod unharmed on serpents in their path and laughed to scorn the devils wrath safe in this wartburg tower i stand where god hath led me by the hand and look down with a heart at ease over the pleasant neighborhoods over the vast thuringian woods with flash of river and gloom of trees with castles crowning the dizzy heights and farms and pastoral delights and the morning pouring everywhere its golden glory on the air safe yes safe am i here at last safe from the overwhelming blast of the mouths of hell that followed me fast and the howling demons of despair that hunted me like a beast to his lair of our own might we nothing can we soon are unprotected there fighteth for us the right man whom god himself elected who is he ye exclaim christus is his name lord of sabaoth very god in troth the field he holds forever nothing can vex the devil more than the name of him whom we adore therefore doth it delight me best to stand in the choir among the rest with the great organ trumpeting through its metallic tubes and sing et verbum caro factum est these words the devil cannot endure for he knoweth their meaning well him they trouble and repel us they comfort and allure and happy it were if our delight were as great as his affright yea music is the prophets art among the gifts that god hath sent one of the most magnificent it calms the agitated heart temptations evil thoughts and all the passions that disturb the soul are quelled by its divine control as the evil spirit fled from saul and his distemper was allayed when david took his harp and played this world may full of devils be all ready to devour us yet not so sore afraid are we they shall not overpower us this worlds prince howeer fierce he may appear he can harm us not he is doomed god wot one little word can slay him incredible it seems to some and to myself a mystery that such weak flesh and blood as we armed with no other shield or sword or other weapon than the word should combat and should overcome a spirit powerful as he he summons forth the pope of rome with all his diabolic crew his shorn and shaven retinue of priests and children of the dark kill kill they cry the heresiarch who rouseth up all christendom against us and at one fell blow seeks the whole church to overthrow not yet my hour is not yet come yesterday in an idle mood hunting with others in the wood i did not pass the hours in vain for in the very heart of all the joyous tumult raised around shouting of men and baying of hound and the bugles blithe and cheery call and echoes answering back again from crags of the distant mountain chain in the very heart of this i found a mystery of grief and pain it was an image of the power of satan hunting the world about with his nets and traps and welltrained dogs his bishops and priests and theologues and all the rest of the rabble rout seeking whom he may devour enough i have had of hunting hares enough of these hours of idle mirth enough of nets and traps and gins the only hunting of any worth is where i can pierce with javelins the cunning foxes and wolves and bears the whole iniquitous troop of beasts the roman pope and the roman priests that sorely infest and afflict the earth ye nuns ye singing birds of the air the fowler hath caught you in his snare and keeps you safe in his gilded cage singing the song that never tires to lure down others from their nests how ye flutter and heat your breasts warm and soft with young desires against the cruel pitiless wires reclaiming your lost heritage behold a hand unbars the door ye shall be captives held no more the word they shall perforce let stand and little thanks they merit for he is with us in the land with gifts of his own spirit though they take our life goods honors child and wife lot these pass away little gain have they the kingdom still remaineth yea it remaineth forevermore however satan may rage and roar though often be whispers in my ears what if thy doctrines false should be and wrings from me a bitter sweat then i put him to flight with jeers saying saint satan pray for me if thou thinkest i am not saved yet and my mortal foes that lie in wait in every avenue and gate as to that odious monk john tetzel hawking about his hollow wares like a huckster at village fairs and those mischievous fellows wetzel campanus carlstadt martin cellarius and all the busy multifarious heretics and disciples of arius halflearned duncebold dry and hard they are not worthy of my regard poor and humble as i am but ah erasmus of rotterdam he is the vilest miscreant that ever walked this world below a momus making his mock and mow at papist and at protestant sneering at st john and st paul at god and man at one and all and yet as hollow and false and drear as a cracked pitcher to the ear and ever growing worse and worse whenever i pray i pray for a curse on erasmus the insincere philip melanethon thou alone faithful among the faithless known thee i hail and only thee behold the record of us three res et verba philippus res sine verbis lutherus erasmus verba sine re my philip prayest thou for me lifted above all earthly care from these high regions of the air among the birds that day and night upon the branches of tall trees sing their lauds and litanies praising god with all their might my philip unto thee i write my philip thou who knowest best all that is passing in this breast the spiritual agonies the inward deaths the inward hell and the divine new births as well that surely follow after these as after winter follows spring my philip in the nighttime sing this song of the lord i send to thee and i will sing it for thy sake until our answering voices make a glorious antiphony and choral chant of victory part three the new england tragedies john endicott dramatis personae john endicott governor john endicott his son richard bellingham deputy governor john

wenlock christison edith his daughter edward wharton quakers assistants halberdiers marshal etc the scene is in boston in the year prologue tonight we strive to read as we may best this city like an ancient palimpsest and bring to light upon the blotted page the mournful record of an earlier age that pale and half effaced lies hidden away beneath the fresher writing of today rise then o buried city that hast been rise up rebuilded in the painted scene and let our curious eyes behold once more the pointed gable and the penthouse door the meetinghouse with leaden latticed panes the narrow thoroughfares the crooked lanes rise too ye shapes and shadows of the past rise from your longforgotten graves at last let us behold your faces let us hear the words ye uttered in those days of fear revisit your familiar haunts again the scenes of triumph and the scenes of pain and leave the footprints of your bleeding feet once more upon the pavement of the street nor let the historian blame the poet here if he perchance misdate the day or year and group events together by his art that in the chronicles lie far apart for as the double stars though sundered far seem to the naked eye a single star so facts of history at a distance seen into one common point of light convene why touch upon such themes perhaps some friend may ask incredulous and to what good end why drag again into the light of day the errors of an age long passed away i answer for the lessons that they teach the tolerance of opinion and of speech hope faith and charity remain these three and greatest of them all is charity let us remember if these words be true that unto all men charity is due give what we ask and pity while we blame lest we become copartners in the shame lest we condemn and yet ourselves partake and persecute the dead for conscience sake therefore it is the author seeks and strives to represent the dead as in their lives and lets at times his characters unfold their thoughts in their own language strong and bold he only asks of you to do the like to hear hint first and if you will then strike act i scene i sunday afternoon the interior of the meetinghouse on the pulpit an hourglass below a box for contributions john norton in the pulpit governor endicott in a canopied seat attended by four halberdiers the congregation singing the lord descended from above and bowed the heavens high and underneath his feet he cast the darkness of the sky on cherubim and seraphim right royally he rode and on the wings of mighty winds came flying all abroad norton rising and turning the hourglass on the pulpit i heard a great voice from the temple saying unto the seven angels go your ways pour out the vials of the wrath of god upon the earth and the first angel went and poured his vial on the earth and straight there fell a noisome and a grievous sore on them which had the birthmark of the beast and them which worshipped and adored his image on us hath fallen this grievous pestilence there is a sense of terror in the air and apparitions of things horrible are seen by many from the sky above us the stars fall and beneath us the earth quakes the sound of drums at midnight from afar the sound of horsemen riding to and fro as if the gates of the invisible world were opened and the dead came forth to warn us all these are omens of some dire disaster impending over us and soon to fall moreover in the language of the prophet death is again come up into our windows to cut off little children from without and young men from the streets and in the midst of all these supernatural threats and warnings doth heresy uplift its horrid head a vision of sin more awful and appalling than any phantasm ghost or apparition as arguing and portending some enlargement of the mysterious power of darkness edith barefooted and clad in sackcloth with her hair hanging loose upon her shoulders walks slowly up the aisle followed by wharton and other quakers the congregation starts up in confusion edith to norton raising her hand peace norton anathema maranatha the lord cometh edith yea verily he cometh and shall judge the shepherds of israel who do feed themselves and leave their flocks to eat what they have trodden beneath their feet norton be silent babbling woman st paul commands all women to keep silence within the churches edith yet the women prayed and prophesied at corinth in his day and among those on whom the fiery tongues of pentecost descended some were women norton the elders of the churches by our law alone have power to open the doors of speech and silence in the assembly i command you edith the law of god is greater than your laws ye build your church with blood your town with crime the heads thereof give judgment for reward the priests thereof teach only for their hire your laws condemn the innocent to death and against this i bear my testimony norton what testimony edith that of the holy spirit which as your calvin says surpasseth reason norton the laborer is worthy of his hire edith yet our great master did not teach for hire and the apostles without purse or scrip went forth to do his work behold this box beneath thy pulpit is it for the poor thou canst not answer it is for the priest and against this i bear my testimony norton away with all these heretics and quakers quakers forsooth because a quaking fell on daniel at beholding of the vision must ye needs shake and quake because isaiah went stripped and barefoot must ye wail and howl must ye go stripped and naked must ye make a wailing like the dragons and a mourning as of the owls ye verify the adage that satan is gods ape away with them tumult the quakers are driven out with violence edith following slowly the congregation retires in confusion thus freely do the reprobates commit such measure of iniquity as fits them for the intended measure of gods wrath and even in violating gods commands are they fulfilling the divine decree the will of man is but an instrument disposed and predetermined to its action according unto the decree of god being as much subordinate thereto as is the axe unto the hewers hand he descends from the pulpit and joins governor endicott who comes forward to meet him the omens and the wonders of the time famine and fire and shipwreck and disease the blast of corn the death of our young men our sufferings in all precious pleasant things are manifestations of the wrath divine signs of gods controversy with new england these emissaries of the evil one these servants and ambassadors of satan are but commissioned executioners of gods vindictive and deserved displeasure we must receive them as the roman bishop once received attila saying i rejoice you have come safe whom i esteem to be the scourge of god sent to chastise his people this very heresy perchance may serve the purposes of god to some good end with you i leave it but do not neglect the holy tactics of the civil sword endicott and what more can be done norton the hand that cut the red cross from the colors of the king can cut the red heart from this heresy fear not all blasphemies immediate and heresies turbulent must be suppressed by civil power endicott but in what way suppressed norton the book of deuteronomy declares that if thy son thy daughter or thy wife ay or the friend which is as thine own soul entice thee secretly and say to thee let us serve other gods then shalt thine eye not pity him but thou shalt surely kill him and thine own hand shall be the first upon him to slay him endicott four already have been slain and others banished upon pain of death but they come back again to meet their doom bringing the linen for their windingsheets we must not go too far in truth i shrink from shedding of more blood the people murmur at our severity norton then let them murmur truth is relentless justice never wavers the greatest firmness is the greatest mercy the noble order of the magistracy cometh immediately from god and yet this noble order of the magistracy is by these heretics despised and outraged endicott tonight they sleep in prison if they die they cannot say that we have caused their death we do but guard the passage with the sword pointed towards them if they dash upon it their blood will be on their own heads not ours norton enough i ask no more my predecessor coped only with the milder heresies of antinomians and of anabaptists he was not born to wrestle with these fiends chrysostom in his pulpit augustine in disputation timothy in his house the lantern of st botolphs ceased to burn when from the portals of that church he came to be a burning and a shining light here in the wilderness and as he lay on his deathbed he saw me in a vision ride on a snowwhite horse into this town his vision was prophetic thus i came a terror to the impenitent and death on the pale horse of the apocalypse to all the accursed race of heretics exeunt scene ii a street on one side nicholas upsalls house on the other walter merrys with a flock of pigeons on the roof upsall seated in the porch of his house upsall o day of rest how beautiful how fair how welcome to the weary and the old day of the lord and truce to earthly cares day of the lord as all our days should be ah why will man by his austerities shut out the blessed sunshine and the light and make of thee a dungeon of despair walter merry entering and looking round him all silent as a graveyard no one stirring no footfall in the street no sound of voices by righteous punishment and perseverance and perseverance in that punishment at last i have brought this contumacious town to strict observance of the sabbath day those wanton gospellers the pigeons yonder are now the only sabbathbreakers left i cannot put them down as if to taunt me they gather every sabbath afternoon in noisy congregation on my roof billing and cooing whir take that ye quakers throws a stone at the pigeons sees upsall ah master nicholas upsall good afternoon dear neighbor walter merry master nicholas you have today withdrawn yourself from meeting upsall yea i have chosen rather to worship god sitting in silence here at my own door merry worship the devil you this day have broken three of our strictest laws first by abstaining from public worship secondly by walking profanely on the sabbath upsall not one step i have been sitting still here

wharton william and marmaduke our martyred brothers sleep in untimely graves if aught untimely can find place in the providence of god where nothing comes too early or too late i saw their noble death they to the scaffold walked hand in hand two hundred armed men and many horsemen guarded them for fear of rescue by the crowd whose hearts were stirred edith o holy martyrs wharton when they tried to speak their voices by the roll of drums were drowned when they were dead they still looked fresh and fair the terror of death was not upon their faces our sister mary likewise the meek woman has passed through martyrdom to her reward exclaiming as they led her to her death these many days ive been in paradise and when she died priest wilson threw the hangman his handkerchief to cover the pale face he dared not look upon edith as persecuted yet not forsaken as unknown yet known as dying and behold we are alive as sorrowful and yet rejoicing always as having nothing yet possessing all wharton and leddra too is dead but from his prison the day before his death he sent these words unto the little flock of christ what ever may come upon the followers of the light distress affliction famine nakedness or perils in the city or the sea or persecution or even death itself i am persuaded that gods armor of light as it is loved and lived in will preserve you yea death itself through which you will find entrance into the pleasant pastures of the fold where you shall feed forever as the herds that roam at large in the low valleys of achor and as the flowing of the ocean fills each creek and branch thereof and then retires leaving behind a sweet and wholesome savor so doth the virtue and the life of god flow evermore into the hearts of those whom he hath made partakers of his nature and when it but withdraws itself a little leaves a sweet savor after it that many can say they are made clean by every word that he hath spoken to them in their silence edith rising and breaking into a kind of chant truly we do but grope here in the dark near the partitionwall of life and death at every moment dreading or desiring to lay our hands upon the unseen door let us then labor for an inward stillness an inward stillness and an inward healing that perfect silence where the lips and heart are still and we no longer entertain our own imperfect thoughts and vain opinions but god alone speaks in us and we wait in singleness of heart that we may know his will and in the silence of our spirits that we may do his will and do that only a long pause interrupted by the sound of a drum approaching then shouts in the street and a loud knocking at the door marshal within there open the door merry will no one answer marshal in the kings name within there merry open the door

words were ringing in mine ears a sorrowful sweet face a look that pierced me with meek reproach a voice of resignation that had a life of suffering in its tone and that was all and yet i could not sleep or when i slept i dreamed that awful dream i stood beneath the elmtree on the common on which the quakers have been hanged and heard a voice not hers that cried amid the darkness this is aceldama the field of blood i will have mercy and not sacrifice opens the window and looks out the sun is up already and my heart sickens and sinks within me when i think how many tragedies will be enacted before his setting as the earth rolls round it seems to me a huge ixions wheel upon whose whirling spokes we are bound fast and must go with it ah how bright the sun strikes on the sea and on the masts of vessels that are uplifted in the morning air like crosses of some peaceable crusade it makes me long to sail for lands unknown no matter whither under me in shadow gloomy and narrow lies the little town still sleeping but to wake and toil awhile then sleep again how dismal looks the prison how grim and sombre in the sunless street the prison where she sleeps or wakes and waits for what i dare not think of death perhaps a word that has been said may he unsaid it is but air but when a deed is done it cannot be undone nor can our thoughts reach out to all the mischiefs that may follow t is time for morning prayers i will go down my father though severe is kind and just and when his heart is tender with devotion when from his lips have fallen the words forgive us as we forgive then will i intercede for these poor people and perhaps may save them exit scene ii dock square on one side the tavern of the three mariners in the background a quaint building with gables and

away from grace merry worshipful sir i meant no harm endicott t is well youve done your duty though youve done it roughly and every word youve uttered since you came has stabbed me to the heart merry

is of them i wished to speak with you i have been angry with you but t is passed for when i hear your footsteps come or go see in your features your dead mothers face and in your voice detect some tone of hers all anger vanishes and i remember the days that are no more and come no more when as a child you sat upon my knee and prattled of your playthings and the games you played among the pear trees in the orchard john endicott oh let the memory of my noble mother plead with you to be mild and merciful for mercy more becomes a magistrate than the vindictive wrath which men call justice endicott the sin of heresy is a deadly sin t is like the falling of the snow whose crystals the traveller plays with thoughtless of his danger until he sees the air so full of light that it is dark and blindly staggering onward lost and bewildered he sits down to rest there falls a pleasant drowsiness upon him and what he thinks is sleep alas is death john endicott and yet who is there that has never doubted and doubting and believing has not said lord i believe help thou my unbelief endicott in the same way we trifle with our doubts whose shining shapes are like the stars descending until at last bewildered and dismayed blinded by that which seemed to give us light we sink to sleep and find that it is death rising death to the soul through all eternity alas that i should see you growing up to mans estate and in the admonition and nurture of the law to find you now pleading for heretics john endicott rising in the sight of god perhaps all men are heretics who dares to say that he alone has found the truth we cannot always feel and think and act as those who go before us had you done so you would not now be here endicott have you forgotten the doom of heretics and the fate of those who aid and comfort them have you forgotten that in the marketplace this very day you trampled on the laws what right have you an inexperienced and untravelled youth to sit in judgment here upon the acts of older men and wiser than yourself thus stirring up sedition in the streets and making me a byword and a jest john endicott words of an inexperienced youth like me were powerless if the acts of older men were not before them t is these laws themselves stir up sedition not my judgment of them endicott take heed lest i be called as brutus was to be the judge of my own son begone when you are tired of feeding upon husks return again to duty and submission but not till then john endicott i hear and i obey exit endicott oh happy happy they who have no children hes gone i hear the hall door shut behind him it sends a dismal echo through my heart as if forever it had closed between us and i should look upon his face no more oh this will drag me down into my grave to that eternal restingplace wherein man lieth down and riseth not again till the heavens be no more he shall not wake nor be roused from his sleep for thou dost change his countenance and sendest him away

yourself a quaker do you not edith i own that in derision and reproach i am so called endicott then you deny the scripture to be the rule of life edith yea i believe the inner light and not the written word to be the rule of life endicott and you deny that the lords day is holy edith every day is the lords day it runs through all our lives as through the pages of the holy bible thus saith the lord endicott you are accused of making an horrible disturbance and affrighting the people in the meetinghouse on sunday what answer make you edith i do not deny that i was present in your steeplehouse on the first day but i made no disturbance endicott why came you there edith because the lord commanded his word was in my heart a burning fire shut up within me and consuming me and i was very weary with forbearing i could not stay endicott t was not the lord that sent you as an incarnate devil did you come edith on the first day when seated in my chamber i heard the bells toll calling you together the sound struck at my life as once at his the holy man our founder when he heard the faroff bells toll in the vale of beavor it sounded like a market bell to call the folk together that the priest might set his wares to sale and the lord said within me thou must go cry aloud against that idol and all the worshippers thereof i went barefooted clad in sackcloth and i stood and listened at the threshold and i heard the praying and the singing and the preaching which were but outward forms and without power then rose a cry within me and my heart was filled with admonitions and reproofs remembering how the prophets and apostles denounced the covetous hirelings and diviners i entered in and spake the words the lord commanded me to speak i could no less endicott are you a prophetess edith is it not written upon my handmaidens will i pour out my spirit and they shall prophesy endicott enough for out of your own mouth are you condemned need we hear further the judges we are satisfied endicott it is sufficient edith christison the sentence of the court is that you be scourged in three towns with forty stripes save one then banished upon pain of death edith your sentence is truly no more terrible to me than had you blown a feather into the the air and as it fell upon me you had said take heed it hurt thee not gods will he done wenlock christison unseen in the crowd woe to the city of blood the stone shall cry out of the wall the beam from out the timber shall answer it woe unto him that buildeth a town with blood and stablisheth a city by his iniquity endicott who is it makes such outcry here christison coming forward i wenlock christison endicott banished on pain of death why come you here christison i come to warn you that you shed no more the blood of innocent men it cries aloud for vengeance to the lord endicott your life is forfeit unto the law and you shall surely die and shall not live christison like unto eleazer maintaining the excellence of ancient years and the honor of his gray head i stand before you like him disdaining all hypocrisy lest through desire to live a little longer i get a stain to my old age and name endicott being in banishment on pain of death you come now in among us in rebellion christison i come not in among you in rebellion but in obedience to the lord of heaven not in contempt to any magistrate but only in the love i bear your souls as ye shall know hereafter when all men give an account of deeds done in the body gods righteous judgments ye cannot escape one of the judges those who have gone before you said the same and yet no judgment of the lord hath fallen upon us christison he but waiteth till the measure of your iniquities shall be filled up and ye have run your race then will his wrath descend upon you to the uttermost for thy part humphrey atherton it hangs over thy head already it shall come suddenly as a thief doth in the night and in the hour when least thou thinkest of it endicott we have a law and by that law you die christison i a free man of england and freeborn appeal unto the laws of mine own nation endicott theres no appeal to england from this court what do you think our statutes are but paper are but dead leaves that rustle in the wind or litter to be trampled under foot what say ye judges of the court what say ye shall this man suffer death speak your opinions one of the judges i am a mortal man and die i must and that erelong and i must then appear before the awful judgmentseat of christ to give account of deeds done in the body my greatest glory on that day will be that i have given my vote against this man christison if thomas danforth thou hast nothing more to glory in upon that dreadful day than blood of innocent people then thy glory will be turned into shame the lord hath said it another judge i cannot give consent while other men who have been banished upon pain of death are now in their own houses here among us endicott ye that will not consent make record of it i thank my god that i am not afraid to give my judgment wenlock christison you must be taken back from hence to prison thence to the place of public execution there to he hanged till you be dead dead dead christison if ye have power to take my life from me which i do question god hath power to raise the principle of life in other men and send them here among you there shall be no peace unto the wicked saith my god listen ye magistrates for the lord hath said it the day ye put his servitors to death that day the day of your own

speak only in low whispers to each other upsall i know this people and that underneath a cold outside there burns a secret fire that will find vent and will not be put out till every remnant of these barbarous laws shall be to ashes burned and blown away john endicott scourged in three towns it is incredible such things can be i feel the blood within me fast mounting in rebellion since in vain have i implored compassion of my father upsall you know your father only as a father i know him better as a magistrate he is a man both loving and severe a tender heart a will inflexible none ever loved him more than i have loved him he is an upright man and a just man in all things save the treatment of the quakers john endicott yet i have found him cruel and unjust even as a father he has driven me forth into the street has shut his door upon me with words of bitterness i am as homeless as these poor quakers are upsall then come with me you shall be welcome for your fathers sake and

that in this i did god service now in deep contrition i come to rescue thee edith from what john endicott from prison edith i am safe here within these gloomy walls john endicott from scourging in the streets and in three towns edith remembering who was scourged for me i shrink not nor shudder at the forty stripes save one john endicott perhaps from death itself edith i fear not death knowing who died for me john endicott aside surely some divine ambassador is speaking through those lips and looking through those eyes i cannot answer edith if all these prison doors stood opened wide i would not cross the threshold not one step there are invisible bars i cannot break there are invisible doors that shut me in and keep me ever steadfast to my purpose john endicott thou hast the patience and the faith of saints edith thy priest hath been with me this day to save me not only from the death that comes to all but from the second death john endicott the pharisee my heart revolts against him and his creed alas the coat that was without a seam is rent asunder by contending sects each bears away a portion of the garment blindly believing that he has the whole edith when death the healer shall have touched our eyes with moist clay of the grave then shall we see the truth as we have never yet beheld it but he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death has he forgotten the many mansions in our fathers house john endicott there is no pity in his iron heart the hands that now bear stamped upon their palms the burning sign of heresy hereafter shall be uplifted against such accusers and then the imprinted letter and its meaning will not be heresy but holiness edith remember thou condemnest thine own father john endicott i have no father he has cast me off i am as homeless as the wind that moans and wanders through the streets oh come with me do not delay thy god shall be my god and where thou goest i will go edith i cannot yet will i not deny it nor conceal it

trust me oh come with me edith in the next room my father an old man sitteth imprisoned and condemned to death willing to prove his faith by martyrdom and thinkest thou his daughter would do less john endicott oh life is sweet and death is terrible edith i have too long walked hand in hand with death to shudder at that pale familiar face but leave me now i wish to be alone john endicott not yet oh let me stay edith urge me no more john endicott alas goodnight i will not say goodby edith put this temptation underneath thy feet to him that overcometh shall be given the white stone with the new name written on it that no man knows save him that doth receive it and i will give thee a new name and call thee paul of damascus and not saul of tarsus exit endicott edith sits down again to read the

halberdiers ascending the steps of his house scene iii the governors private room papers upon the table endicott and bellingham endicott there is a ship from england has come in bringing despatches and much news from home his majesty was at the abbey crowned and when the coronation was complete there passed a mighty tempest oer the city portentous with great thunderings and lightnings bellingham after his fathers if i well remember there was an earthquake that foreboded evil endicott ten of the regicides have been put to death the bodies of cromwell ireton and bradshaw have been dragged from their graves and publicly hanged in their shrouds at tyburn bellingham horrible endicott thus the old tyranny revives again its arm is long enough to reach us here as you will see for more insulting still than flaunting in our faces dead mens shrouds here is the kings mandamus taking from us from this day forth all power to punish quakers bellingham that takes from us all power we are but puppets and can no longer execute our laws endicott his majesty begins with pleasant words trusty and wellbeloved we greet you well then with a ruthless hand he strips from me all that which makes me what i am as if from some old general in the field grown gray in service scarred with many wounds just at the hour of victory he should strip his badge of office and his wellgained honors and thrust him back into the ranks again opens the mandamus and hands it to bellingham and while he is reading endicott walks up and down the room here read it for yourself you see his words are pleasant words considerate not reproachful nothing could be more gentle or more royal but then the meaning underneath the words mark that he says all people known as quakers among us now condemned to suffer death or any corporal punishment whatever who are imprisoned or may be obnoxious to the like condemnation shall be sent forthwith to england to be dealt with there in such wise as shall be agreeable unto the english law and their demerits is it not so bellingham returning the paper ay so the paper says endicott it means we shall no longer rule the province it means farewell to law and liberty authority respect for magistrates the peace and welfare of the commonwealth if all the knaves upon this continent can make appeal to england and so thwart the ends of truth and justice by delay our power is gone forever we are nothing but ciphers valueless save when we follow some unit and our unit is the king t is he that gives us value bellingham i confess such seems to be the meaning of this paper but being the kings mandamus signed and sealed we must obey or we are in rebellion endicott i tell you richard bellingham i tell you that this is the beginning of a struggle of which no mortal can foresee the end i shall not live to fight the battle for you i am a man disgraced in every way this order takes from me my selfrespect and the respect of others t is my doom yes my deathwarrant but must be obeyed take it and see that it is executed so far as this that all be set at large but see that none of them be sent to england to bear false witness and to spread reports that might be prejudicial to ourselves exit bellingham theres a dull pain keeps knocking at my heart dolefully saying set thy house in order for thou shalt surely die and shalt not live for me the shadow on the dialplate goeth not back but on into the dark exit scene iv the street a crowd reading a placard on the door of the meetinghouse nicholas upsall among them enter john norton norton what is this gathering here upsall one william brand an old man like ourselves and weak in body has been so cruelly tortured in his prison the people are excited and they threaten to tear the prison down norton what has been done upsall he has been put in irons with his neck and heels tied close together and so left from five in the morning until nine at night norton what more was done upsall he has been kept five days in prison without food and cruelly beaten so that his limbs were cold his senses stopped norton what more upsall and is this not enough norton now hear me this william brand of yours has tried to beat our gospel ordinances black and blue and if he has been beaten in like manner it is but justice and i will appear in his behalf that did so i suppose that he refused to work upsall he was too weak how could an old man work when he was starving norton and what is this placard upsall the magistrates to appease the people and prevent a tumult have put up these placards throughout the town declaring that the jailer shall be dealt with impartially and sternly by the court norton tearing down the placard down with this weak and cowardly concession this flag of truce with satan and with sin i fling it in his face i trample it under my feet it is his cunning craft the masterpiece of his diplomacy to cry and plead for boundless toleration but toleration is the firstborn child of all abominations and deceits there is no room in christs triumphant army for tolerationists and if an angel preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received gods malediction descend upon him let him be accursed exit upsall now go thy ways john norton go thy ways thou orthodox evangelist as men call thee but even now there cometh out of england like an oertaking and accusing conscience an outraged man to call thee to account for the unrighteous murder of his son exit scene v the wilderness enter edith edith how beautiful are these autumnal woods the wilderness doth blossom like the rose and change into a garden of the lord how silent everywhere alone and lost here in the forest there comes over me an inward awfulness i recall the words of the apostle paul in journeyings often often in perils in the wilderness in weariness in painfulness in watchings in hunger and thirst in cold and nakedness and i forget my weariness and pain my watchings and my hunger and my thirst the lord hath said that he will seek his flock in cloudy and dark days and they shall dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep safe in the woods whichever way i turn i come back with my face towards the town dimly i see it and the sea beyond it o cruel town i know what waits me there and yet i must go back for ever louder i hear the inward calling of the spirit and must obey the voice o woods that wear your golden crown of martyrdom bloodstained from you i learn a lesson of submission and am obedient even unto death if god so wills it exit john endicott within edith edith edith he enters it is in vain i call she answers not i follow but i find no trace of her blood blood the leaves above me and around me are red with blood the pathways of the forest the clouds that canopy the setting sun and even the little river in the meadows are stained with it whereer i look i see it away thou horrible vision leave me leave me alas you winding stream that gropes its way through mist and shadow doubling on itself at length will find by the unerring law of nature what it seeks o soul of man groping through mist and shadow and recoiling back on thyself are too thy devious ways subject to law

got access to the presence of the king told him there was a vein of innocent blood opened in his dominions here which threatened to overrun them all the king replied but i will stop that vein and he forthwith sent his mandamus to our magistrates that they proceed no further in this business so all are pardoned and all set at large john endicott thank god this is a victory for truth our thoughts are free they cannot be shut up in prison wall nor put to death on scaffolds upsall come in the morning air blows sharp and cold through the damp streets john endicott it is the dawn of day that

me that john norton is dead bellingham you have not dreamed it he is dead and gone to his reward it was no dream endicott then it was very sudden for i saw him standing where you now stand not long ago bellingham by his own fireside in the afternoon a faintness and a giddiness came oer him and leaning on the chimneypiece he cried the hand of god is on me and fell dead endicott and did not some one say or have i dreamed it that humphrey atherton is dead bellingham alas he too is gone and by a death as sudden returning home one evening at the place where usually the quakers have been scourged his horse took fright and threw him to the ground so that his brains were dashed about the street endicott i am not superstitions bellingham and yet i tremble lest it may have been a judgment on him bellingham so the people think they say his horse saw standing in the way the ghost of william leddra and was frightened and furthermore brave richard davenport the captain of the castle in the storm has been struck dead by lightning endicott speak no more for as i listen to your voice it seems as if the seven thunders uttered their voices and the dead bodies lay about the streets of the disconsolate city bellingham i did not put those wretched men to death i did but guard the passage with the sword pointed towards them and they rushed upon it yet now i would that i had taken no part

scene is in salem in the year prologue delusions of the days that once have been witchcraft and wonders of the world unseen phantoms of air and necromantic arts that crushed the weak and awed the stoutest hearts these are our theme tonight and vaguely here through the dim mists that crowd the atmosphere we draw the outlines of weird figures cast in shadow on the background of the past who would believe that in the quiet town of salem and amid the woods that crown the neighboring hillsides and the sunny farms that fold it safe in their paternal arms who would believe that in those peaceful streets where the great elms shut out the summer heats where quiet reigns and breathes through brain and breast the benediction of unbroken rest who would believe such deeds could find a place as these whose tragic history we retrace t was but a village then the goodman ploughed his ample acres under sun or cloud the goodwife at her doorstep sat and spun and gossiped with her neighbors in the sun the only men of dignity and state were then the minister and the magistrate who ruled their little realm with iron rod less in the love than in the fear of god and who believed devoutly in the powers of darkness working in this world of ours in spells of witchcraft incantations dread and shrouded apparitions of the dead upon this simple folk with fire and flame saith the old chronicle the devil came scattering his firebrands and his poisonous darts to set on fire of hell all tongues and hearts and t is no wonder for with all his host there most he rages where he hateth most and is most hated so on us he brings all these stupendous and portentous things something of this our scene tonight will show and ye who listen to the tale of woe be not too swift in casting the first stone nor think new england bears the guilt alone this sudden burst of wickedness and crime was but the common madness of the time when in all lands that lie within the sound of sabbath bells a witch was burned or drowned act i scene i the woods near salem village enter tituba with a basket of herbs tituba heres monkshood that breeds fever in the blood and deadly nightshade that makes men see ghosts and henbane that will shake them with convulsions and meadowsaffron and black hellebore that rack the nerves and puff the skin with dropsy and bittersweet and briony and eyebright that cause eruptions nosebleed rheumatisms i know them and the places where they hide in field and meadow and i know their secrets and gather them because they give me power over all men and women armed with these i tituba an indian and a slave am stronger than the captain with his sword am richer than the merchant with his money am wiser than the scholar with his books mightier than ministers and magistrates with all the fear and reverence that attend them for i can fill their bones with aches and pains can make them cough with asthma shake with palsy can make their daughters see and talk with ghosts or fall into delirium and convulsions i have the evil eye the evil hand a touch from me and they are weak with pain a look from me and they consume and die the death of cattle and the blight of corn the shipwreck the tornado and the fire these are my doings and they know it not thus i work vengeance on mine enemies who while they call me slave are slaves to me exit tituba enter mather booted and spurred with a ridingwhip in his hand mather methinks that i have come by paths unknown into the land and atmosphere of witches for meditating as i journeyed on lo i have lost my way if i remember rightly it is scribonius the learned that tells the story of a man who praying for one that was possessed by evil spirits was struck by evil spirits in the face i journeying to circumvent the witches surely by witches have been led astray i am persuaded there are few affairs in which the devil doth not interfere we cannot undertake a journey even but satan will be there to meddle with it by hindering or by furthering he hath led me into this thicket struck me in the face with branches of the trees and so entangled the fetlocks of my horse with vines and brambles that i must needs dismount and search on foot for the lost pathway leading to the village reenter tituba what shape is this what monstrous apparition exceeding fierce that none may pass that way tell me good woman if you are a woman tituba i am a woman but i am not good i am a witch mather then tell me witch and woman for you must know the pathways through this wood where lieth salem village tituba reverend sir the village is near by im going there with these few herbs ill lead you follow me mather first say who are you i am loath to follow a stranger in this wilderness for fear of being misled and left in some morass who are you tituba i am tituba the witch wife of john indian mather you are tituba i know you then you have renounced the devil and have become a penitent confessor the lord be praised go on ill follow you wait only till i fetch my horse that stands tethered among the trees not far from here tituba let me get up behind you reverend sir mather the lord forbid what would the people think if they should see the reverend cotton mather ride into salem with a witch behind him the lord forbid tituba i do not need a horse i can ride through the air upon a stick above the treetops and above

beneath my humble roof mather i thank your worship hathorne pray you be seated you must be fatigued with your long ride through unfrequented woods they sit down mather you know the purport of my visit here to be advised by you and counsel with you and with the reverend clergy of the village touching these witchcrafts that so much afflict you and see with mine own eyes the wonders told of spectres and the shadows of the dead that come back from their graves to speak with men hathorne some men there are i have known such who think that the two worlds the seen and the unseen the world of matter and the world of spirit are like the hemispheres upon our maps and touch each other only at a point but these two worlds are not divided thus save for the purposes of common speech they form one globe in which the parted s as all flow together and are intermingled while the great continents remain distinct mather i doubt it not the spiritual world lies all about us and its avenues are open to the unseen feet of phantoms that come and go and we perceive them not save by their influence or when at times a most mysterious providence permits them to manifest themselves to mortal eyes hathorne you who are always welcome here among us are doubly welcome now we need your wisdom your learning in these things to be our guide the devil hath come down in wrath upon us and ravages the land with all his hosts mather the unclean spirit said my name is legion multitudes in the valley of destruction but when our fervent welldirected prayers which are the great artillery of heaven are brought into the field i see them scattered and driven like autumn leaves before the wind hathorne you as a minister of god can meet them with spiritual weapons but alas i as a magistrate must combat them with weapons from the armory of the flesh mather these wonders of the world invisible these spectral shapes that haunt our habitations the multiplied and manifold afflictions with which the aged and the dying saints have their death prefaced and their age imbittered are but prophetic trumpets that proclaim the second coming of our lord on earth the evening wolves will be much more abroad when we are near the evening of the world hathorne when you shall see as i have hourly seen the sorceries and the witchcrafts that torment us see children tortured by invisible spirits and wasted and consumed by powers unseen you will confess the half has not been told you mather it must be so the deathpangs of the devil will make him more a devil than before and nebuchadnezzars furnace will be heated seven times more hot before its putting out hathorne advise me reverend sir i look to you for counsel and for guidance in this matter what further shall we do mather remember this that as a sparrow falls not to the ground without the will of god so not a devil can come down from the air without his leave we must inquire hathorne dear sir we have inquired sifted the matter thoroughly through and through and then resifted it mather if god permits these evil spirits from the unseen regions to visit us with surprising informations we must inquire what cause there is for this but not receive the testimony borne by spectres as conclusive proof of guilt in the accused hathorne upon such evidence we do not rest our case the ways are many in which the guilty do betray themselves mather be careful carry the knife with such exactness that on one side no innocent blood be shed by too excessive zeal and on the other no shelter given to any work of darkness hathorne for one i do not fear excess of zeal what do we gain by parleying with the devil you reason but you hesitate to act ah reverend sir believe me in such cases the only safety is in acting promptly t is not the part of wisdom to delay in things where not to do is still to do a deed more fatal than the deed we shrink from you are a man of books and meditation but i am one who acts mather god give us wisdom in the directing of this thorny business and guide us lest new england should become of an unsavory and sulphurous odor in the opinion of the world abroad the clock strikes i never hear the striking of a clock without a warning and an admonition that time is on the wing and we must quicken our tardy pace in journeying heavenward as israel did in journeying canaanward they rise hathorne then let us make all haste and i will show you in what disguises and what fearful shapes the unclean spirits haunt this neighborhood and you will pardon my excess of zeal mather ah poor new england he who hurricanoed the house of

says i burned his house martha does he say that corey he says i burned his house i was in bed and fast asleep that night and i can prove it martha if he says that i think the father of lies is surely in the man corey he does say that and that i did it to wreak vengeance on him for taking sides against me in the quarrel i had with that john gloyd about his wages and god knows that i never bore him malice for that as i have told him twenty times martha it is john gloyd has stirred him up to this i do not like that gloyd i think him crafty not to be trusted sullen and untruthful come have your

it has gone down upon it and will rise tomorrow and go down again upon it they have trumped up against me the old story of causing goodells death by trampling on him martha oh that is false i know it to be false corey he has been dead these fourteen years or more why cant they let him rest why must they drag him out of his grave to give me a bad name i did not kill him in his bed he died as most men die because his hour had come i have wronged no man why should proctor say such things bout me i will not forgive him till he confesses he has slandered me then ive more trouble all my cattle gone martha they will come back again corey not in this world did i not tell you they were overlooked they ran down through the woods into the meadows and tried to swim the river and were drowned it is a heavy loss martha im sorry for it corey all my dear oxen dead i loved them martha next to yourself i liked to look at them and watch the breath come out of their wide nostrils and see their patient eyes somehow i thought it gave me strength only to look at them and how they strained their necks against the yoke if i but spoke or touched them with the goad they were my friends and when gloyd came and told me they were all drowned i could have drowned myself from sheer vexation and i said as much to gloyd and others martha do not trust john gloyd with anything you would not have repeated corey as i came through the woods this afternoon impatient at my loss and much perplexed with all that i had heard there in the village the yellow leaves lit up the trees about me like an enchanted palace and i wished i knew enough of magic or of witchcraft to change them into gold then suddenly a tree shook down some crimson leaves upon me like drops of blood and in the path before me stood tituba the indian the old crone martha were you not frightened corey no i do not think i know the meaning of that word why frightened i am not one of those who think the lord is waiting till he catches them some day in the back yard alone what should i fear she started from the bushes by the path and had a basket full of herbs and roots for some witchbroth or other the old hag martha she has been here today corey with hand outstretched she said giles corey will you sign the book avaunt i cried get thee behind me satan at which she laughed and left me but a voice was whispering in my ear continually selfmurder is no crime the life of man is his to keep it or to throw away martha t was a temptation of the evil one giles giles why will you harbor these dark thoughts corey rising i am too tired to talk ill go to bed martha first tell me something about bridget bishop how did she look you saw her you were there corey ill tell you that tomorrow not tonight ill go to bed martha first let us pray together corey i cannot pray tonight martha say the lords prayer and that will comfort you corey i cannot say as we forgive those that have sinned against us when i do not forgive them martha kneeling on the hearth god forgive you corey i will not make believe i say tonight theres something thwarts me when i wish to pray and thrusts into my mind instead of prayers hate and revenge and things that are not prayers something of my old self my old bad life and the old adam in me rises up and will not let me pray i am afraid the devil hinders me you know i say just what i think and nothing more nor less and when i pray my heart is in my prayer i cannot say one thing and mean another if i cant pray i will not make believe exit corey martha continues kneeling act iii scene i giles coreys kitchen morning corey and martha sitting at the breakfasttable corey rising well now ive told you all i saw and heard of bridget bishop and i must be gone martha dont go into the village giles today last night you came back tired and out of humor corey say angry say right angry i was never in a more devilish temper in my life all things went wrong with me martha you were much vexed so dont go to the village corey going no i wont i wont go near it we are going to mow the ipswich meadows for the aftermath the crop of sedge and rowens martha stay a moment i want to tell you what i dreamed last night do you believe in dreams corey why yes and no when they come true then i believe in them when they come false i dont believe in them but let me hear what did you dream about martha i dreamed that you and i were both in prison that we had fetters on our hands and feet that we were taken before the magistrates and tried for witchcraft and condemned to death i wished to pray they would not let me pray you tried to comfort me and they forbade it but the most dreadful thing in all my dream was that they made you testify against me and then there came a kind of mist between us i could not see you and i woke in terror i never was more thankful in my life than when i found you sleeping at my side corey with tenderness it was our talk last night that made you dream im sorry for it ill control myself another time and keep my temper down i do not like such dreams remember martha im going to mow the ipswich river meadows if gardner comes youll tell him where to find me exit martha so this delusion grows from bad to worse first a forsaken and forlorn old woman ragged and wretched and without a friend then something higher now its bridget bishop god only knows whose turn it will be next the magistrates are blind the people mad if they would only seize the afflicted children and put them in the workhouse where they should be thered be an end of all this wickedness exit scene ii a street in salem village enter mather and hathorne mather yet one thing troubles me hathorne and what is that mather may not the devil take the outward shape of innocent persons are we not in danger perhaps of punishing some who are not guilty hathorne as i have said we do not trust alone to spectral evidence mather and then again if any shall be put to death for witchcraft we do but kill the body not the soul the unclean spirits that possessed them once live still to enter into other bodies what have we gained surely theres nothing gained hathorne doth not the scripture say thou shalt not suffer a witch to live mather the scripture sayeth it but speaketh to the jews and we are christians what say the laws of england hathorne they make witchcraft felony without the benefit of clergy witches are burned in england you have read for you read all things not a book escapes you the famous demonology of king james mather a curious volume i remember also the plot of the two hundred with one fian the registrar of the devil at their head to drown his majesty on his return from denmark how they sailed in sieves or riddles unto north berwick kirk in lothian and landing there danced hand in hand and sang goodwife go ye before good wife go ye if yell not go before goodwife let me while geilis duncan played the witches reel upon a jewsharp hathorne then you know full well the english law and that in england witches when lawfully convicted and attainted are put to death mather when lawfully convicted that is the point hathorne you heard the evidence produced before us yesterday at the trial of bridget bishop mather one of the afflicted i know bore witness to the apparition of ghosts unto the spectre of this bishop saying you murdered us of the truth whereof there was in matter of fact too much suspicion hathorne and when she cast her eyes on the afflicted they were struck down and this in such a manner there could be no collusion in the business and when the accused but laid her hand upon them as they lay in their swoons they straight revived although they stirred not when the others touched them mather what most convinced me of the womans guilt was finding hidden in her cellar wall those poppets made of rags with headless pins stuck into them point outwards and whereof she could not give a reasonable account hathorne when you shall read the testimony given before the court in all the other cases i am persuaded you will find the proof no less conclusive than it was in this come then with me and i will tax your patience with reading of the documents so far as may convince you that these sorcerers are lawfully convicted and attainted like doubting thomas you shall lay your hand upon these wounds and you will doubt no more exeunt scene iii a room in coreys house martha and two deacons of the church martha be seated i am glad to see you here i know what you are come for you are come to question me and learn from my own lips if i have any dealings with the devil in short if im a witch deacon sitting down such is our purpose how could you know beforehand why we came martha t was only a surmise deacon we came to ask you you being with us in church covenant what part you have if any in these matters martha and i make answer no part whatsoever i am a farmers wife a working woman you see my spinningwheel you see my loom you know the duties of a farmers wife and are not ignorant that my life among you has been without reproach until this day is it not true deacon so much were bound to own and say it frankly and without reserve martha ive heard the idle tales that are abroad ive heard it whispered that i am a witch i cannot help it i do not believe in any witchcraft it is a delusion deacon how can you say that it is a delusion when all our learned and good men believe it our ministers and worshipful magistrates martha their eyes are blinded and see not the truth perhaps one day they will be open to it deacon you answer boldly the afflicted children say you appeared to them martha and did they say what clothes i came in deacon no they could not tell they said that you foresaw our visit here and blinded them so that they could not see the clothes you wore martha the cunning crafty girls i say to you in all sincerity i never have appeared to anyone in my own person if the devil takes my shape to hurt these children or afflict them i am not guilty of it and i say its all a mere delusion of the senses deacon i greatly fear that you will find too late it is not so martha rising they do accuse me falsely it is delusion or it is deceit there is a story in the ancient scriptures which i much wonder comes not to your minds let me repeat it to you deacon we will hear it martha it came to pass that naboth had a vineyard hard by the palace of the king called ahab and ahab king of israel spake to naboth and said to him give unto me thy vineyard that i may have it for a garden of herbs and i will give a better vineyard for it or if it seemeth good to thee its worth in money and then naboth said to ahab the lord forbid it me that i should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee and ahab came into his house displeased and heavy at the words which naboth spake and laid him down upon his bed and turned his face away and he would eat no bread and jezebel the wife of ahab came and said to him why is thy spirit sad and he said unto her because i spake to naboth to the jezreelite and said give me thy vineyard and he answered saying i will not give my vineyard unto thee and jezebel the wife of ahab said dost thou not rule the realm of israel arise eat bread and let thy heart be merry i will give naboths vineyard unto thee so she wrote letters in king ahabs name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters unto the elders that were in his city dwelling with naboth and unto the nobles and in the letters wrote proclaim a fast and set this naboth high among the people and set two men the sons of belial before him to bear witness and to say thou didst blaspheme against god and the king and carry him out and stone him that he die and the elders and the nobles in the city did even as jezebel the wife of ahab had sent to them and written in the letters and then it came to pass when ahab heard naboth was dead that ahab rose to go down unto naboths vineyard and to take possession of it and the word of god came to elijah saying to him arise go down to meet the king of israel in naboths vineyard whither he hath gone to take possession thou shalt speak to him saying thus saith the lord what hast thou killed and also taken possession in the place wherein the dogs have licked the blood of naboth shall the dogs lick thy blood ay even thine both of the deacons start from their seats and ahab then the king of israel said hast thou found me o mine enemy elijah the prophet answered i have found thee so will it be with those who have stirred up the sons of belial here to bear false witness and swear away the lives of innocent people their enemy will find them out at last the prophets voice will thunder i have found thee exeunt scene iv meadows on ipswich river corey and his men

forgotten law to do such deeds those who lie buried in the potters field will rise again as surely as ourselves that sleep in honored graves with epitaphs and this poor man whom we have made a victim hereafter will be counted as a martyr finale saint john saint john wandering over the face of the earth saint john the ages come and go the centuries pass as years my hair is white as the snow my feet are weary and slow the earth is wet with my tears the kingdoms crumble and fall apart like a ruined wall or a bank that is undermined by a rivers ceaseless flow and leave no trace behind the world itself is old the portals of time unfold on hinges of iron that grate and groan with the rust and the weight like the hinges of a gate that hath fallen to decay but the evil doth not cease there is war instead of peace instead of love there is hate and still i must wander and wait still i must watch and pray not forgetting in whose sight a thousand years in their flight are as a single day the life of man is a gleam of light that comes and goes like the course of the holy stream the cityless river that flows from fountains no one knows through the lake of galilee through forests and level lands over rocks and shallows and sands of a wilderness wild and vast till it findeth its rest at last in the desolate dead sea but alas alas for me not yet this rest shall be what then doth charity fail is faith of no avail is hope blown out like a light by a gust of wind in the night the clashing of creeds and the strife of the many beliefs that in vain perplex mans heart and brain are naught but the rustle of leaves when the breath of god upheaves the boughs of the tree of life and they subside again and i remember still the words and from whom they came not he that repeateth the name but he that doeth the will and him evermore i behold walking in galilee through the cornfields waving gold in hamlet in wood and in wold by the shores of the beautiful sea he toucheth the sightless eyes before him the demons flee to the dead he sayeth arise to the living follow me and that voice still soundeth on from the centuries that are gone to the centuries that shall be from all vain pomps and shows from the pride that overflows and the false conceits of men from all the narrow rules and subtleties of schools and the craft of tongue and pen bewildered in its search bewildered with the cry lo here lo there the church poor sad humanity through all the dust and heat turns back with bleeding feet by the weary road it came unto the simple thought by the great master taught and that remaineth still not he that repeateth the name but he that doeth the will judas maccabaeus act i the citadel of antiochus at jerusalem scene i antiochus jason antiochus o antioch my antioch my city

and games and baths stageplays and festivals and most of all the dionysia jason they shall have them all antiochus by heracles but i should like to see these hebrews crowned with ivy and arrayed in skins of fawns with drums and flutes and thyrsi revel and riot through the solemn streets of their old town ha ha it makes me merry only to think of it thou dost not laugh jason yea i laugh inwardly

starve my lord the ambassadors of samaria await thy pleasure antiochus why not my displeasure ambassadors are tedious they are men who work for their own ends and not for mine there is no furtherance in them let them go to apollonius my governor there in samaria and not trouble me what do they want jason only the royal sanction to give a name unto a nameless temple upon mount gerizim antiochus then bid them enter this pleases me and furthers my designs the occasion is auspicious bid them enter scene ii antiochus jason the samaritan ambassadors antiochus approach come forward stand not at the door wagging your long beards but demean yourselves as doth become ambassadors what seek ye an ambassador an audience from the king antiochus speak and be brief waste not the time in useless rhetoric words are not things ambassador reading to king antiochus the god epiphanes a memorial from the sidonians who live at sichem antiochus sidonians ambassador ay my lord antiochus go on go on and do not tire thyself and me with bowing ambassador reading we are a colony of medes and persians antiochus no ye are jews from one of the ten tribes whether sidonians or samaritans or jews of jewry matters not to me ye are all israelites ye are all jews when the jews prosper ye claim kindred with them when the jews suffer ye are medes and persians i know that in the days of alexander ye claimed exemption from the annual tribute in the sabbatic year because ye said your fields had not been planted in that year ambassador reading our fathers upon certain frequent plagues and following an ancient superstition were long accustomed to observe that day which by the israelites is called the sabbath and in a temple on mount gerizim without a name they offered sacrifice now we who are sidonians beseech thee who art our benefactor and our savior not to confound us with these wicked jews but to give royal order and injunction to apollonius in samaria thy governor and likewise to nicanor thy procurator no more to molest us and let our nameless temple now be named the temple of jupiter hellenius antiochus this shall be done full well it pleaseth me ye are not jews or are no longer jews but greeks if not by birth yet greeks by custom your nameless temple shall receive the name of jupiter hellenius ye may go scene iii antiochus jason antiochus my task is easier than i

good augury the rest will follow till the whole land is hellenized jason my lord these are samaritans the tribe of judah is of a different temper and the task will be more difficult antiochus dost thou gainsay me jason i know the stubborn nature of the jew yesterday eleazer an old man being fourscore years and ten chose rather death by torture than to eat the flesh of swine antiochus the life is in the blood and the whole nation shall bleed to death or it shall change its faith jason hundreds have fled already to the mountains of ephraim where judas maccabaeus hath raised the standard of revolt against thee antiochus i will burn down their city and will make it waste as a wilderness its thoroughfares shall be but furrows in a field of ashes it shall be sown with salt as sodom is this hundred and fiftythird olympiad shall have a broad and bloodred sea upon it stamped with the awful letters of my name antiochus the god epiphanes where are those seven sons jason my lord they wait thy royal pleasure antiochus they shall wait no longer act ii the dungeons in the citadel scene i the mother of the seven sons alone listening the mother be strong my heart break not till they are dead all all my seven sons then burst asunder and let this tortured and tormented soul leap and rush out like water through the shards of earthen vessels broken at a well o my dear children mine in life and death i know not how ye came into my womb i neither gave you breath nor gave you life and neither was it i that formed the members of every one of you but the creator who made the world and made the heavens above us who formed the generation of mankind and found out the beginning of all things he gave you breath and life and will again of his own mercy as ye now regard not your own selves but his eternal law i do not murmur nay i thank thee god that i and mine have not been deemed unworthy to suffer for thy sake and for thy law and for the many sins of israel hark i can hear within the sound of scourges i feel them more than ye do o my sons but cannot come to you i who was wont to wake at night at the least cry ye made to whom ye ran at every slightest hurt i cannot take you now into my lap and soothe your pain but god will take you all into his pitying arms and comfort you and give you rest a voice within what wouldst thou ask of us ready are we to die but we will never transgress the law and customs of our fathers the mother it is the voice of my firstborn o brave and noble boy thou hast the privilege of dying first as thou wast born the first the same voice within god looketh on us and hath comfort in us as moses in his song of old declared he in his servants shall be comforted the mother i knew thou wouldst not fail he speaks no more he is beyond all pain antiochus within if thou eat not thou shalt be tortured throughout all the members of thy whole body wilt thou eat then second voice within no the mother it is adaiahs voice i tremble for him i know his nature devious as the wind and swift to change gentle and yielding always be steadfast o my son the same voice within thou like a fury takest us from this present life but god who rules the world shall raise us up again into life everlasting the mother god i thank thee that thou hast breathed into that timid heart courage to die for thee o my adaiah witness of god if thou for whom i feared canst thus encounter death i need not fear the others will not shrink third voice within behold these hands held out to thee o king antiochus not to implore thy mercy but to show that i despise them he who gave them to me will give them back again the mother o avilan it is thy voice for the last time i hear it for the last time on earth but not the last to death it bids defiance and to torture it sounds to me as from another world and makes the petty miseries of this seem unto me as naught and less than naught farewell my avilan nay i should say welcome my avilan for i am dead before thee i am waiting for the others why do they linger fourth voice within it is good o king being put to death by men to look for hope from god to be raised up again by him but thou no resurrection shalt thou have to life hereafter the mother four already four three are still living nay they all are living half here half there make haste antiochus to reunite us for the sword that cleaves these miserable bodies makes a door through which our souls impatient of release rush to each others arms fifth voice within thou hast the power thou doest what thou wilt abide awhile and thou shalt see the power of god and how he will torment thee and thy seed the mother o hasten why dost thou pause thou who hast slain already so many hebrew women and hast hung their murdered infants round their necks slay me for i too am a woman and these boys are mine make haste to slay us all and hang my lifeless babes about my neck sixth voice within think not antiochus that takest in hand to strive against the god of israel thou shalt escape unpunished for his wrath shall overtake thee and thy bloody house the mother one more my sirion and then all is ended having put all to bed then in my turn i will lie down and sleep as sound as they my sirion my youngest best beloved and those bright golden locks that i so oft have curled about these fingers even now are foul with blood and dust like a lambs fleece slain in the shambles not a sound i hear this silence is more terrible to me than any sound than any cry of pain that might escape the lips of one who dies doth his heart fail him doth he fall away in the last hour from god o sirion sirion art thou afraid i do not hear thy voice die as thy brothers died thou must not live scene ii the mother antiochus sirion the mother are they all dead antiochus of all thy seven sons one only lives behold them where they lie how dost thou like this picture the mother god in heaven can a man do such deeds and yet not die by the recoil of his own wickedness ye murdered bleeding mutilated bodies that were my children once and still are mine i cannot watch oer you as rispah watched in sackcloth oer the seven sons of saul till water drop upon you out of heaven and wash this blood away i cannot mourn as she the daughter of aiah mourned the dead from the beginning of the barleyharvest until the autumn rains and suffered not the birds of air to rest on them by day nor the wild beasts by night for ye have died a better death a death so full of life that i ought rather to rejoice than mourn wherefore art thou not dead o sirion wherefore art thou the only living thing among thy brothers dead art thou afraid antiochus o woman i have spared him for thy sake for he is fair to look upon and comely and i have sworn to him by all the gods that i would crown his life with joy and honor heap treasures on him luxuries delights make him my friend and keeper of my secrets if he would turn from your mosaic law and be as we are but he will not listen the mother my noble sirion antiochus therefore i beseech thee who art his mother thou wouldst speak with him and wouldst persuade him i am sick of blood the mother yea i will speak with him and will persuade him o sirion my son have pity on me on me that bare thee and that gave thee suck and fed and nourished thee and brought thee up with the dear trouble of a mothers care unto this age look on the heavens above thee and on the earth and all that is therein consider that god made them out of things that were not and that likewise in this manner mankind was made then fear not this tormentor but being worthy of thy brethren take thy death as they did that i may receive thee again in mercy with them antiochus i am mocked yea i am laughed to scorn sirion whom wait ye for never will i obey the kings commandment but the commandment of the ancient law that was by moses given unto our fathers and thou o godless man that of all others art the most wicked be not lifted up nor puffed up with uncertain hopes uplifting thy hand against the servants of the lord for thou hast not escaped the righteous judgment of the almighty god who seeth all things antiochus he is no god of mine i fear him not sirion my brothers who have suffered a brief pain are dead but thou antiochus shalt suffer the punishment of pride i offer up my body and my life beseeching god that he would speedily be merciful unto our nation and that thou by plagues mysterious and by torments mayest confess that he alone is god antiochus ye both shall perish by torments worse than any that your god here or hereafter hath in store for me the mother my sirion i am proud of thee antiochus be silent go to thy bed of torture in yon chamber where lie so many sleepers heartless mother thy footsteps will not wake them nor thy voice nor wilt thou hear amid thy troubled dreams thy children crying for thee in the night the mother o death that stretchest thy white hands to me i fear them not but press them to my lips that are as white as thine for i am death nay am the mother of death seeing these sons all lying lifeless kiss me sirion act iii the battlefield of bethhoron scene i judas maccabaeus in armor before his tent judas the trumpets sound the echoes of the mountains answer them as the sabbath morning breaks over bethhoron and its battlefield where the great captain of the hosts of god a slave brought up in the brickfields of egypt oercame the amorites there was no day like that before or after it nor shall be the sun stood still the hammers of the hail beat on their harness and the captains set their weary feet upon the necks of kings as i will upon thine antiochus thou man of blood behold the rising sun strikes on the golden letters of my banner be elohim yehovah who is like to thee o lord among the gods alas i am not joshua i cannot say sun stand thou still on gibeon and thou moon in ajalon nor am i one who wastes the fateful time in useless lamentation but one who bears his life upon his hand to lose it or to save it as may best serve the designs of him who giveth life scene ii judas maccabaeus jewish fugitives judas who and what are ye that with furtive steps steal in among our tents fugitives o maccabaeus outcasts are we and fugitives as thou art jews of jerusalem that have escaped from the polluted city and from death judas none can escape from death say that ye come to die for israel and ye are welcome what tidings bring ye fugitives tidings of despair the temple is laid waste the precious vessels censers of gold vials and veils and crowns and golden ornaments and hidden treasures have all been taken from it and the gentiles with revelling and with riot fill its courts and dally with harlots in the holy places judas all this i knew before fugitives upon the altar are things profane things by the law forbidden nor can we keep our sabbaths or our feasts but on the festivals of dionysus must walk in their processions bearing ivy to crown a drunken god judas this too i know but tell me of the jews how fare the jews fugitives the coming of this mischief hath been sore and grievous to the people all the land is full of lamentation and of mourning the princes and the elders weep and wail the young men and the maidens are made feeble the beauty of the women hath been changed judas and are there none to die for israel t is not enough to mourn breastplate and harness are

virtues of thy race without the failings that attend those virtues thou canst be strong and yet not tyrannous canst righteous be and not intolerant let there be peace between us judas what is peace is it to bow in silence to our victors is it to see our cities sacked and pillaged our people slain or sold as slaves or fleeing at nighttime by the blaze of burning towns jerusalem laid waste the holy temple polluted with strange gods are these things peace nicanor these are the dire necessities that wait on war whose loud and bloody enginery i seek to stay let there be peace between antiochus and thee judas antiochus what is antiochus that he should prate of peace to me who am a fugitive today he shall be lifted up tomorrow shall not be found because he is returned unto his dust his thought has come to nothing there is no peace between us nor can be until this banner floats upon the walls of our jerusalem nicanor between that city and thee there lies a waving wall of tents held by a host of forty thousand foot and horsemen seven thousand what hast thou to bring against all these judas the power of god whose breath shall scatter your white tents abroad as flakes of snow nicanor your mighty one in heaven will not do battle on the seventh day it is his day of rest judas silence blasphemer go to thy tents nicanor shall it be war or peace judas war war and only war go to thy tents

shields of gold and brass the mountains glisten with them and shine like lamps and we who are so few and poorly armed and ready to faint with fasting how shall we fight against this multitude judas the victory of a battle standeth not in multitudes but in the strength that cometh from heaven above the lord forbid that i should do this thing and flee away from them nay if our hour be come then let us die let us not stain our honor captains t is the sabbath wilt thou fight on the sabbath maccabaeus judas ay when i fight the battles of the lord i fight them on his day as on all others have ye forgotten certain fugitives that fled once to these hills and hid themselves in caves how their pursuers camped against them upon the seventh day and challenged them and how they answered not nor cast a stone nor stopped the places where they lay concealed but meekly perished with their wives and children even to the number of a thousand souls we who are fighting for our laws and lives will not so perish captains lead us to the battle judas and let our watchword be the help of god last night i dreamed a dream and in my vision beheld onias our highpriest of old who holding up his hands prayed for the jews this done in the like manner there appeared an old man and exceeding glorious with hoary hair and of a wonderful and excellent majesty and onias said this is a lover of the jews who prayeth much for the people and the holy city gods prophet jeremias and the prophet held forth his right hand and gave unto me a sword of gold and giving it he said take thou this holy sword a gift from god and with it thou shalt wound thine adversaries captains the lord is with us judas hark i hear the trumpets sound from bethhoron from the battlefield of joshua where he smote the amorites

its hateful aspect insults us with the bitter memories of other days judas wait it shall disappear and vanish as a cloud first let us cleanse the sanctuary see it is become waste like a wilderness its golden gates wrenched from their hinges and consumed by fire shrubs growing in its courts as in a forest upon its altars hideous and strange idols and strewn about its pavement at my feet its sacred books half burned and painted oer with images of heathen gods jews woe woe our beauty and our glory are laid waste the gentiles have profaned our holy paces lamentation and alarm of trumpets judas

have but done what king antiochus commanded me judas true thou hast been the weapon with which he struck but hast been such a weapon so flexible so fitted to his hand it tempted him to strike so thou hast urged him to double wickedness thine own and his where is this king is he in antioch among his women still and from his windows throwing down gold by handfuls for the rabble to scramble for jason nay he is gone from there gone with an army into the far east judas and wherefore gone jason i know not for the space of forty days almost were horsemen seen running in air in cloth of gold and armed with lances like a band of soldiery it was a sign of triumph judas or of death wherefore art thou not with him jason i was left for service in the temple judas to pollute it and to corrupt the jews for there are men whose presence is corruption to be with them degrades us and deforms the things we do jason i never made a boast as some men do of my superior virtue nor denied the weakness of my nature that hath made me subservient to the will of other men judas upon this day the five and twentieth day of the month caslan was the temple here profaned by strangers by antiochus and thee his instrument upon this day shall it be cleansed thou who didst lend thyself unto this profanation canst not be a witness of these solemn services there can be nothing clean where thou art present the people put to death callisthenes who burned the temple gates and if they find thee will surely slay thee i will spare thy life to punish thee the longer thou shalt wander among strange nations thou

hour an hour of weakness that cometh unto all i fell away from the old faith and did not clutch the new only an outward semblance of belief for the new faith i cannot make mine own not being born to it it hath no root within me i am neither jew nor greek but stand between them both a renegade to each in turn having no longer faith in gods or men then what mysterious charm what fascination is it chains my feet and keeps me gazing like a curious child into the holy places where the priests have raised their altar striking stones together they take fire out of them and light the lamps in the great candlestick they spread the veils and set the loaves of showbread on the table the incense burns the wellremembered odor comes wafted unto me and takes me back to other days i see myself among them as i was then and the old superstition creeps over me again a childish fancy and hark they sing with citherns and with cymbals and all the people fall upon their faces praying and worshipping i

pain of hearts that long have ceased to beat remain to throb in hearts that are or are to be so from old chronicles where sleep in dust names that once filled the world with trumpet tones i build this verse and flowers of song have thrust their roots among the loose disjointed stones which to this end i fashion as i must quickened are they that touch the prophets bones part first i prologue at ischia the castle terrace vittoria colonna and julia gonzaga vittoria will you then leave me julia and so soon to pace alone this terrace like a ghost julia tomorrow dearest vittoria do not say tomorrow a whole month of tomorrows were too soon you must not go you are a part of me julia i must return to fondi vittoria the old castle needs not your presence no one waits for you stay one day longer with me they who go feel not the pain of parting it is they who stay behind that suffer i was thinking but yesterday how like and how unlike have been and are our destinies your husband the good vespasian an old man who seemed a father to you rather than a husband died in your arms but mine in all the flower and promise of his youth was taken from me as by a rushing wind the breath of battle breathed on him and i saw his face no more save as in dreams it haunts me as our love was for these men so is our sorrow for them yours a childs sorrow smiling through its tears but mine the grief of an impassioned woman who drank her life up in one draught of love julia behold this locket this is the white hair of my vespasian this is the floweroflove this amaranth and beneath it the device non moritura thus my heart remains true to his memory and the ancient castle where we have lived together where he died is dear to me as ischia is to you vittoria i did not mean to chide you julia let your heart find if it can some poor apology for one who is too young and feels too keenly the joy of life to give up all her days to sorrow for the dead while i am true to the remembrance of the man i loved and mourn for still i do not make a show of all the grief i feel nor live secluded and like veronica da gambara drape my whole house in mourning and drive forth in coach of sable drawn by sable horses as if i were a corpse ah one today is worth for me a thousand yesterdays vittoria dear julia friendship has its jealousies as well as love who waits for you at fondi julia a friend of mine and yours a friend and friar you have at naples your fra bernadino and i at fondi have my fra bastiano the famous artist who has come from rome to paint my portrait that is not a sin vittoria only a vanity julia he painted yours vittoria do not call up to me those days departed when i was young and all was bright about me and the vicissitudes of life were things but to be read of in old histories though as pertaining unto me or mine impossible ah then i dreamed your dreams and now grown older i look back and see they were illusions julia yet without illusions what would our lives become what we ourselves dreams or illusions call them what you will they lift us from the commonplace of life to better things vittoria are there no brighter dreams no higher aspirations than the wish to please and to be pleased julia for you there are i am no saint i feel the world we live in comes before that which is to be here after and must be dealt with first vittoria but in what way julia let the soft wind that wafts to us the odor of orange blossoms let the laughing sea and the bright sunshine bathing all the world answer the question vittoria and for whom is meant this portrait that you speak of julia for my friend the cardinal ippolito vittoria for him julia yes for ippolito the magnificent t is always flattering to a womans pride to be admired by one whom all admire vittoria ah julia she that makes herself a dove is eaten by the hawk be on your guard he is a cardinal and his adoration should be elsewhere directed julia you forget the horror of that night when barbarossa the moorish corsair landed on our coast to seize me for the sultan soliman how in the dead of night when all were sleeping he scaled the castle wall how i escaped and in my nightdress mounting a swift steed fled to the mountains and took refuge there among the brigands then of all my friends the cardinal ippolito was first to come with his retainers to my rescue could i refuse the only boon he asked at such a time my portrait vittoria i have heard strange stories of the splendors of his palace and how apparelled like a spanish prince he rides through rome with a long retinue of ethiopians and numidians and turks and tartars in fantastic dresses making a gallant show is this the way a cardinal should live julia he is so young hardly of age or little more than that beautiful generous fond of arts and letters a poet a musician and a scholar master of many languages and a player on many instruments in rome his palace is the asylum of all men distinguished in art or science and all florentines escaping from the tyranny of his cousin duke alessandro vittoria i have seen his portrait painted by titian you have painted it in brighter colors julia and my cardinal at itri in the courtyard of his palace keeps a tame lion vittoria and so counterfeits st mark the evangelist julia ah your tame lion is michael angelo vittoria you speak a name that always thrills me with a noble sound as of a trumpet michael angelo a lion all men fear and none can tame a man that all men honor and the model that all should follow one who works and prays for work is prayer and consecrates his life to the sublime ideal of his art till art and life are one a man who holds such place in all mens thoughts that when they speak of great things done or to be done his name is ever on their lips julia you too can paint he portrait of your hero and in colors brighter than titians i might warn you also against the dangers that beset your path but i forbear vittoria if i were made of marble of fior di persico or pavonazzo he might admire me being but flesh and blood i am no more to him than other women that is am nothing julia does he ride through rome upon his little mule as he was wont with his slouched hat and boots of cordovan as when i saw him last vittoria pray do not jest i cannot couple with his noble name a trivial word look how the setting sun lights up castelamare and sorrento and changes capri to a purple cloud and there vesuvius with its plume of smoke and the great city stretched upon the shore as in a dream julia parthenope the siren vittoria and yon long line of lights those sunlit windows blaze like the torches carried in procession to do her honor it is beautiful julia i have no heart to feel the beauty of it my feet are weary pacing up and down these level flags and wearier still my thoughts treading the broken pavement of the past it is too sad i will go in and rest and make me ready for tomorrows journey vittoria i will go with you for i would not lose one hour of your dear presence t is enough only to be in the same room with you i need not speak to you nor hear you speak if i but see you i am satisfied they go in monologue the last judgment michael angelos studio he is at work on the cartoon of the last judgment michael angelo why did the pope and his ten cardinals come here to lay this heavy task upon me were not the paintings on the sistine ceiling enough for them they saw the hebrew leader waiting and clutching his tempestuous beard but heeded not the bones of julius shook in their sepulchre i heard the sound they only heard the sound of their own voices are there no other artists here in rome to do this work that they must needs seek me fra bastian my era bastian might have done it but he is lost to art the papal seals like leaden weights upon a dead mans eyes press down his lids and so the burden falls on michael angelo chief architect and painter of the apostolic palace that is the title they cajole me with to make me do their work and leave my own but having once begun i turn not back blow ye bright angels on your golden trumpets to the four corners of the earth and wake the dead to judgment ye recording angels open your books and read ye dead awake rise from your graves drowsy and drugged with death as men who suddenly aroused from sleep look round amazed and know not where they are in happy hours when the imagination wakes like a wind at midnight and the soul trembles in all its leaves it is a joy to be uplifted on its wings and listen to the prophetic voices in the air that call us onward then the work we do is a delight and the obedient hand never grows weary but how different is it en the disconsolate discouraged hours when all the wisdom of the world appears as trivial as the gossip of a nurse in a sickroom and all our work seems useless what is it guides my hand what thoughts possess me that i have drawn her face among the angels where she will be hereafter o sweet dreams that through the vacant chambers of my heart walk in the silence as familiar phantoms frequent an ancient house what will ye with me t is said that emperors write their names in green when under age but when of age in purple so love the greatest emperor of them all writes his in green at first but afterwards in the imperial purple of our blood first love or last love which of these two passions is more omnipotent which is more fair the star of morning or the evening star the sunrise or the sunset of the heart the hour when we look forth to the unknown and the advancing day consumes the shadows or that when all the landscape of our lives lies stretched behind us and familiar places gleam in the distance and sweet memories rise like a tender haze and magnify the objects we behold that soon must vanish what matters it to me whose countenance is like the laocoons full of pain whose forehead is a ploughed harvestfield where threescore years have sown in sorrow and have reaped in anguish to me the artisan to whom all women have been as if they were not or at most a sudden rush of pigeons in the air a flutter of wings a sound and then a silence i am too old for love i am too old to flatter and delude myself with visions of neverending friendship with fair women imaginations fantasies illusions in which the things that cannot be take shape and seem to be and for the moment are convent bells ring distant and near and low and loud the bells dominican benedictine and franciscan jangle and wrangle in their airy towers discordant as the brotherhoods themselves in their dim cloisters the descending sun seems to caress the city that he loves and crowns it with the aureole of a saint i will go forth and breathe the air a while ii san silvestro a chapel in the church of san silvestra on monte cavallo vittoria colonna claudio tolommei and others vittoria here let us rest a while until the crowd has left the church i have already sent for michael angelo to join us here messer claudio after fra bernardinos wise discourse on the pauline epistles certainly some words of michael angelo on art were not amiss to bring us back to earth michael angelo at the door how like a saint or goddess she appears diana or madonna which i know not in attitude and aspect formed to be at once the artists worship and despair vittoria welcome maestro we were waiting for you michael angelo i met your messenger upon the way and hastened hither vittoria it is kind of you to come to us who linger here like gossips wasting the afternoon in idle talk these are all friends of mine and friends of yours michael angelo if friends of yours then are they friends of mine pardon me gentlemen but when i entered i saw but the marchesa vittoria take this seat between me and ser claudio tolommei who still maintains that our italian tongue should be called tuscan but for that offence we will not quarrel with him michael angelo eccellenza vittoria ser claudio has banished eccellenza and all such titles from the tuscan tongue messer claudio t is the abuse of them and not the use i deprecate michael angelo the use or the abuse it matters not let them all go together as empty phrases and frivolities and common as goldlace upon the collar of an obsequious lackey vittoria that may be but something of politeness would go with them we should lose something of the stately manners of the old school messer claudio undoubtedly vittorla but that is not what occupies my thoughts at present nor why i sent for you messer michele it was to counsel me his holiness has granted me permission long desired to build a convent in this neighborhood where the old tower is standing from whose top nero looked down upon the burning city michael angelo it is an inspiration vittoria i am doubtful how i shall build how large to make the convent and which way fronting michael angelo ah to build to build that is the noblest art of all the arts painting and sculpture are but images are merely shadows cast by outward things on stone or canvas having in themselves no separate existence architecture existing in itself and not in seeming a something it is not surpasses them as substance shadow long long years ago standing one morning near the baths of titus i saw the statue of laocoon rise from its grave of centuries like a ghost writhing in pain and as it tore away the knotted serpents from its limbs i heard or seemed to hear the cry of agony from its white parted lips and still i marvel at the three rhodian artists by whose hands this miracle was wrought yet he beholds far nobler works who looks upon the ruins of temples in the forum here in rome if god should give me power in my old age to build for him a temple half as grand as those were in their glory i should count my age more excellent than youth itself and all that i have hitherto accomplished as only vanity vittoria i understand you art is the gift of god and must be used unto his glory that in art is highest which aims at this when st hilarion blessed the horses of italicus they won the race at gaza for his benediction oerpowered all magic and the people shouted that christ had conquered marnas so that art which bears the consecration and the seal of holiness upon it will prevail over all others those few words of yours inspire me with new confidence to build what think you the old walls might serve perhaps some purpose still the tower can hold the bells michael angelo if strong enough vittoria if not it can be strengthened michael angelo i see no bar nor drawback to this building and on our homeward way if it shall please you we may together view the site vittoria i thank you i did not venture to request so much michael angelo let us now go to the old walls you spake of vossignoria vittoria what again maestro michael angelo pardon me messer claudio if once more i use the ancient courtesies of speech i am too old to change iii cardinal ippolito a richly furnished apartment in the palace of cardinal ippolito night jacopo nardi an old man alone nardi i am bewildered these numidian slaves in strange attire these endless antechambers this lighted hall with all its golden splendors pictures and statues can this be the dwelling of a disciple of that lowly man who had not where to lay his head these statues are not of saints nor is this a madonna this lovely face that with such tender eyes looks down upon me from the painted canvas my heart begins to fail me what can he who lives in boundless luxury at rome care for the imperilled liberties of florence her people her republic ah the rich feel not the pangs of banishment all doors are open to them and all hands extended the poor alone are outcasts they who risked all they possessed for liberty and lost and wander through the world without a friend sick comfortless distressed unknown uncared for enter cardinal hippolito in spanish cloak and slouched hat ippolito i pray you pardon me that i have kept you waiting so long alone nardi i wait to see the cardinal ippolito i am the cardinal and you nardi jacopo nardi ippolito you are welcome i was expecting you philippo strozzi had told me of your coming nardi t was his son that brought me to your door ippolito pray you be seated you seem astonished at the garb i wear but at my time of life and with my habits the petticoats of a cardinal would be troublesome i could neither ride nor walk nor do a thousand things if i were dressed like an old dowager it were putting wine young as the young astyanax into goblets as old as priam nardi oh your eminence knows best what you should wear ippolito dear messer nardi you are no stranger to me i have read your excellent translation of the books of titus livius the historian of rome and model of all historians that shall come after him it does you honor but greater honor still the love you bear to florence our dear country and whose annals i hope your hand will write in happier days than we now see nardi your eminence will pardon the lateness of the hour ippolito the hours i count not as a sundial but am like a clock that tells the time as well by night as day so no excuse i know what brings you here you come to speak of florence nardi and her woes ippolito the duke my cousin the black alessandro whose mother was a moorish slave that fed the sheep upon lorenzos farm still lives and reigns nardi alas that such a scourge should fall on such a city ippolito when he dies the wild boar in the gardens of lorenzo the beast obscene should be the monument of this bad man nardi he walks the streets at night with revellers insulting honest men no house is sacred from his lusts the convents are turned by him to brothels and the honor of women and all ancient pious customs are quite forgotten now the offices of the priori and gonfalonieri have been abolished all the magistrates are now his creatures liberty is dead the very memory of all honest living is wiped away and even our tuscan tongue corrupted to a lombard dialect ippolito and worst of all his impious hand has broken the martinella our great battle bell that sounding through three centuries has led the florentines to victory lest its voice should waken in their souls some memory of faroff times of glory nardi what a change ten little years have made we all remember those better days when niccola capponi the gonfaloniere from the windows of the old palace with the blast of trumpets proclaimed to the inhabitants that christ was chosen king of florence and already christ is dethroned and slain and in his stead reigns lucifer alas alas for florence ippolito lilies with lilies said savonarola florence and france but i say florence only or only with the emperors hand to help us in sweeping out the rubbish nardi little hope of help is there from him he has betrothed his daughter margaret to this shameless duke what hope have we from such an emperor ippolito baccio valori and philippo strozzi once the dukes friends and intimates are with us and cardinals salvati and ridolfi we shall soon see then as valori says whether the duke can best spare honest men or honest men the duke nardi we have determined to send ambassadors to spain and lay our griefs before the emperor though i fear more than i hope ippolito the emperor is busy with this new war against the algerines and has no time to listen to complaints from our ambassadors nor will i trust them but go myself all is in readiness for my departure and tomorrow morning i shall go down to itri where i meet dante da castiglione and some others republicans and fugitives from florence and then take ship at gaeta and go to join the emperor in his new crusade against the turk i shall have time enough and opportunity to plead our cause nardi rising it is an inspiration and i hail it as of good omen may the power that sends it bless our beloved country and restore its banished citizens the soul of florence is now outside its gates what lies within is but a corpse corrupted and corrupting heaven help us all i will not tarry longer for you have need of rest goodnight ippolito goodnight enter fra sebastiano turkish attendants ippolito fra bastiano how your portly presence contrasts with that of the spare florentine who has just left me fra sebastiano as we passed each other i saw that he was weeping ippolito poor old man fra sebastiano who is he ippolito jacopo nardi a brave soul one of the fuoruseiti and the best and noblest of them all but he has made me sad with his sadness as i look on you my heart grows lighter i behold a man who lives in an ideal world apart from all the rude collisions of our life in a calm atmosphere fra sebastiano your eminence is surely jesting if you knew the life of artists as i know it you might think far otherwise ippolito but wherefore should i jest the world of art is an ideal world the world i love and that i fain would live in so speak to me of artists and of art of all the painters sculptors and musicians that now illustrate rome fra sebastiano of the musicians i know but goudimel the brave maestro and chapelmaster of his holiness who trains the papal choir ippolito in church this morning i listened to a mass of goudimel divinely chanted in the incarnatus in lieu of latin words the tenor sang with infinite tenderness in plain italian a neapolitan lovesong fra sebastiano you amaze me was it a wanton song ippolito not a divine one i am not overscrupulous as you know in word or deed yet such a song as that sung by the tenor of the papal choir and in a papal mass seemed out of place theres something wrong in it fra sebastiano theres something wrong in everything we cannot make the world go right t is not my business to reform the papal choir ippolito nor mine thank heaven then tell me of the artists fra sebastiano naming one i name them all for there is only one his name is messer michael angelo all art and artists of the present day centre in him ippolito you count yourself as nothing fra sebastiano or less than nothing since i am at best only a portraitpainter one who draws with greater or less skill as best he may the features of a face ippolito and you have had the honor nay the glory of portraying julia gonzaga do you count as nothing a privilege like that see there the portrait rebuking you with its divine expression are you not penitent he whose skilful hand painted that lovely picture has not right to vilipend the art of portraitpainting but what of michael angelo fra sebastiano but lately strolling together down the crowded corso we stopped well pleased to see your eminence pass on an arab steed a noble creature which michael angelo who is a lover of all things beautiful especially when they are arab horses much admired and could not praise enough ippolito to an attendant hassan tomorrow when i am gone but not till i am gone be careful about that take barbarossa to messer michael angelo the sculptor who lives there at macello dei corvi near to the capitol and take besides some ten muleloads of provender and say your master sends them to him as a present fra sebastiano a princely gift though michael angelo refuses presents from his holiness yours he will not refuse ippolito you think him like thymoetes who received the wooden horse into the walls of troy that book of virgil have i translated in italian verse and shall some day when we have leisure for it be pleased to read you when i speak of troy i am reminded of another town and of a lovelier helen our dear countess julia gonzaga you remember surely the adventure with the corsair barbarossa and all that followed fra sebastiano a most strange adventure a tale as marvellous and full of wonder as any in boccaccio or sacchetti almost incredible ippolito were i a painter i should not want a better theme than that the lovely lady fleeing through the night in wild disorder and the brigands camp with the red firelight on their swarthy faces could you not paint it for me fra sebastiano no not i it is not in my line ippolito then you shall paint the portrait of the corsair when we bring him a prisoner chained to naples for i feel something like admiration for a man who dared this strange adventure fra sebastiano i will do it but catch the corsair first ippolito you may begin tomorrow with the sword hassan come hither bring me the turkish scimitar that hangs beneath the picture yonder now unsheathe it t is a damascus blade you see the inscription in arabic la allah illa allah there is no god but god fra sebastiano how beautiful in fashion and in finish it is perfect the arsenal of venice can not boast a finer sword ippolito you like it it is yours fra sebastiano you do not mean it ippolito i am not a spaniard to say that it is yours and not to mean it i have at itri a whole armory full of such weapons when you paint the portrait of barbarossa it will be of use you have not been rewarded as you should be for painting the gonzaga throw this bauble into the scale and make the balance equal till then suspend it in your studio you artists like such trifles fra sebastiano i will keep it in memory of the donor many thanks ippolito fra bastian i am growing tired of rome the old dead city with the old dead people priests everywhere like shadows on a wall and morning noon and night the ceaseless sound of convent bells i must be gone from here though ovid somewhere says that rome is worthy to be the dwellingplace of all the gods i must be gone from here tomorrow morning i start for itri and go thence by sea to join the emperor who is making war upon the algerines perhaps to sink some turkish galleys and bring back in chains the famous corsair thus would i avenge the beautiful gonzaga fra sebastiano an achievement worthy of charlemagne or of orlando berni and ariosto both shall add a canto to their poems and describe you as furioso and innamorato now i must say goodnight ippolito you must not go first you shall sup with me my seneschal giovan andrea dal borgo a san sepolcro i like to give the whole sonorous name it sounds so like a verse of the aeneid has brought me eels fresh from the lake of fondi and lucrine oysters cradled in their shells these with red fondi wine the caecu ban that horace speaks of under a hundred keys kept safe until the heir of posthumus shall stain the pavement with it make a feast fit for lucullus or fra bastian even so we will go to supper and be merry fra sebastiano beware i remember that bolsenas eels and vernage wine once killed a pope of rome ippolito t was a french pope and then so long ago who knows perhaps the story is not true iv borgo delle vergine at naples room in the palace of julia gonzaga night julia gonzaga giovanni valdesso julia do not go yet valdesso the night is far advanced i fear to stay too late and weary you with these discussions julia i have much to say i speak to you valdesso with that frankness which is the greatest privilege of friendship speak as i hardly would to my confessor such is my confidence in you valdesso dear countess if loyalty to friendship be a claim upon your confidence then i may claim it julia then sit again and listen unto things that nearer are to me than life itself valdesso in all things i am happy to obey you and happiest then when you command me most julia laying aside all useless rhetoric that is superfluous between us two i come at once unto the point and say you know my outward life my rank and fortune countess of fondi duchess of trajetto a widow rich and flattered for whose hand in marriage princes ask and ask it only to be rejected all the world can offer lies at my feet if i remind you of it it is not in the way of idle boasting but only to the better understanding of what comes after valdesso god hath given you also beauty and intellect and the signal grace to lead a spotless life amid temptations that others yield to julia but the inward life that you know not t is known but to myself and is to me a mystery and a pain a soul disquieted and ill at ease a mind perplexed with doubts and apprehensions a heart dissatisfied with all around me and with myself so that sometimes i weep discouraged and disgusted with the world valdesso wheneer we cross a river at a ford if we would pass in safety we must keep our eyes fixed steadfast on the shore beyond for if we cast them on the flowing stream the head swims with it so if we would cross the running flood of things here in the world our souls must not look down but fix their sight on the firm land beyond julia i comprehend you you think i am too worldly that my head swims with the giddying whirl of life about me is that your meaning valdesso yes your meditations are more of this world and its vanities than of the world to come julia between the two i am confused valdesso yet have i seen you listen enraptured when fra bernardino preached of faith and hope and charity julia i listen but only as to music without meaning it moves me for the moment and i think how beautiful it is to be a saint as dear vittoria is but i am weak and wayward and i soon fall back again to my old ways so very easily there are too many weekdays for one sunday valdesso then take the sunday with you through the week and sweeten with it all the other days julia in part i do so for to put a stop to idle tongues what men might say of me if i lived all alone here in my palace and not from a vocation that i feel for the monastic life i now am living with sister caterina at the convent of santa chiara and i come here only on certain days for my affairs or visits of ceremony or to be with friends for i confess to live among my friends is paradise to me my purgatory is living among people i dislike and so i pass my life in these two worlds this palace and the convent valdesso it was then the fear of man and not the love of god that led you to this step why will you not give all your heart to god julia if god commands it wherefore hath he not made me capable of doing for him what i wish to do as easily as i could offer him this jewel from my hand this gown i wear or aught else that is mine valdesso the hindrance lies in that original sin by which all fell julia ah me i cannot bring my troubled mind to wish well to that adam our first parent who by his sin lost paradise for us and brought such ills upon us valdesso we ourselves when we commit a sin lose paradise as much as he did let us think of this and how we may regain it julia teach me then to harmonize the discord of my life and stop the painful jangle of these wires valdesso that is a task impossible until you tune your heartstrings to a higher key than earthly melodies julia how shall i do it point out to me the way of this perfection and i will follow you for you have made my soul enamored with it and i cannot rest satisfied until i find it out but lead me privately so that the world hear not my steps i would not give occasion for talk among the people valdesso now at last i understand you fully then what need is there for us to beat about the bush i know what you desire of me julia what rudeness if you already know it why not tell me valdesso because i rather wait for you to ask it with your own lips julia do me the kindness then to speak without reserve and with all frankness if you divine the truth will i confess it valdesso i am content julia then speak valdesso you would be free from the vexatious thoughts that come and go through your imagination and would have me point out some royal road and ladylike which you may walk in and not wound your feet you would attain to the divine perfection and yet not turn your back upon the world you would possess humility within but not reveal it in your outward actions you would have patience but without the rude occasions that require its exercise you would despise the world but in such fashion the world should not despise you in return would clothe the soul with all the christian graces yet not despoil the body of its gauds would feed the soul with spiritual food yet not deprive the body of its feasts would seem angelic in the sight of god yet not too saintlike in the eyes of men in short would lead a holy christian life in such a way that even your nearest friend would not detect therein one circumstance to show a change from what it was before have i divined your secret julia you have drawn the portrait of my inner self as truly as the most skilful painter ever painted a human face valdesso this warrants me in saying you think you can win heaven by compromise and not by verdict julia you have often told me that a bad compromise was better even than a good verdict valdesso yes in suits at law not in religion with the human soul there is no compromise by faith alone can man be justified julia hush dear valdesso that is a heresy do not i pray you proclaim it from the housetop but preserve it as something precious hidden in your heart as i who half believe and tremble at it valdesso i must proclaim the truth julia enthusiast why must you you imperil both yourself and friends by your imprudence pray be patient you have occasion now to show that virtue which you lay stress upon let us return to our lost pathway show me by what steps i shall walk in it convent bells are heard valdesso hark the convent bells are ringing it is midnight i must leave you and yet i linger pardon me dear countess since you tonight have made me your confessor if i so far may venture i will warn you upon one point julia what is it speak i pray you for i have no concealments in my conduct all is as open as the light of day what is it you would warn me of valdesso your friendship with cardinal ippolito julia what is there to cause suspicion or alarm in that more than in friendships that i entertain with you and others i neer sat with him alone at night as i am sitting now with you valdesso valdesso pardon me the portrait that fra bastiano painted was for him is that quite prudent julia that is the same question vittoria put to me when i last saw her i make you the same answer that was not a pledge of love but of pure gratitude recall the adventure of that dreadful night when barbarossa with two thousand moors landed upon the coast and in the darkness attacked my castle then without delay the cardinal came hurrying down from rome to rescue and protect me was it wrong that in an hour like that i did not weigh too nicely this or that but granted him a boon that pleased him and that flattered me valdesso only beware lest in disguise of friendship another corsair worse than barbarossa steal in and seize the castle not by storm but strategy and now i take my leave julia farewell but ere you go look forth and see how night hath hushed the clamor and the stir of the tumultuous streets the cloudless moon roofs the whole city as with tiles of silver the dim mysterious sea in silence sleeps and straight into the air vesuvius lifts his plume of smoke how beautiful it is voices in the street giovan andrea poisoned at itri another voice poisoned who is poisoned giovan andrea the cardinal ippolito my master call it malaria it was sudden julia swoons v vittoria colonna a room in the torre argentina vittoria colonna and julia gonzaga vittoria come to my arms and to my heart once more my soul goes out to meet you and embrace you for we are of the sisterhood of sorrow i know what you have suffered julia name it not let me forget it vittoria i will say no more let me look at you what a joy it is to see your face to hear your voice again you bring with you a breath as of the morn a memory of the faroff happy days when we were young when did you come from fondi julia i have not been at fondi since vittoria ah me you need not speak the word i understand you julia i came from naples by the lovely valley the terra di lavoro vittoria and you find me but just returned from a long journey northward i have been staying with that noble woman renee of france the duchess of ferrara julia oh tell me of the duchess i have heard flaminio speak her praises with such warmth that i am eager to hear more of her and of her brilliant court vittoria you shall hear all but first sit down and listen patiently while i confess myself julia what deadly sin have you committed vittoria not a sin a folly i chid you once at ischia when you told me that brave fra bastian was to paint your portrait julia well i remember it vittoria then chide me now for i confess to something still more strange old as i am i have at last consented to the entreaties and the supplications of michael angelo julia to marry him vittoria i pray you do not jest with me you now or you should know that never such a thought entered my breast i am already married the marquis of pescara is my husband and death has not divorced us julia pardon me have i offended you vittoria no but have hurt me unto my buried lord i give myself unto my friend the shadow of myself my portrait it is not from vanity but for the love i bear him julia i rejoice to hear these words oh this will be a portrait worthy of both of you a knock vittoria hark he is coming julia and shall i go or stay vittoria by all means stay the drawing will be better for your presence you will enliven me julia i shall not speak the presence of great men doth take from me all power of speech i only gaze at them in silent wonder as if they were gods or the inhabitants of some other planet enter michael angelo vittoria come in michael angelo i fear my visit is illtimed i interrupt you vittoria no this is a friend of yours as well as mine the lady julia the duchess of trajetto michael angelo to julia i salute you t is long since i have seen your face my lady pardon me if i say that having seen it one never can forget it julia you are kind to keep me in your memory michael angelo it is the privilege of age to speak with frankness you will not be offended when i say that never was your beauty more divine julia when michael angelo condescends to flatter or praise me i am proud and not offended vittoria now this is gallantry enough for one show me a little michael angelo ah my gracious lady you know i have not words to speak your praise i think of you in silence you conceal your manifold perfections from all eyes and make yourself more saintlike day by day and day by day men worship you the wore but now your hour of martyrdom has come you know why i am here vittoria ah yes i know it and meet my fate with fortitude you find me surrounded by the labors of your hands the woman of samaria at the well the mater dolorosa and the christ upon the cross beneath which you have written those memorable words of alighieri men have forgotten how much blood it costs michael angelo and now i come to add one labor more if you will call that labor which is pleasure and only pleasure vittoria how shall i be seated michael angelo opening his portfolio just as you are the light falls well upon you vittoria i am ashamed to steal the time from you that should be given to the sistine chapel how does that work go on michael angelo drawing but tardily old men work slowly brain and hand alike are dull and torpid to die young is best and not to be remembered as old men tottering about in their decrepitude vittoria my dear maestro have you then forgotten the story of sophocles in his old age michael angelo what story is it vittoria when his sons accused him before the areopagus of dotage for all defence he read there to his judges the tragedy of oedipus coloneus the work of his old age michael angelo t is an illusion a fabulous story that will lead old men into a thousand follies and conceits vittoria so you may show to cavilers your painting of the last judgment in the sistine chapel michael angelo now you and lady julia shall resume the conversation that i interrupted vittoria it was of no great import nothing more nor less than my late visit to ferrara and what i saw there in the ducal palace will it not interrupt you michael angelo not the least vittoria well first then of duke ercole a man cold in his manners and reserved and silent and yet magnificent in all his ways not hospitable unto new ideas but from state policy and certain reasons concerning the investiture of the duchy a partisan of rome and consequently intolerant of all the new opinions julia i should not like the duke these silent men who only look and listen are like wells that have no water in them deep and empty how could the daughter of a king of france wed such a duke michael angelo the men that women marry and why they marry them will always be a marvel and a mystery to the world vittoria and then the duchess how shall i describe her or tell the merits of that happy nature which pleases most when least it thinks of pleasing not beautiful perhaps in form and feature yet with an inward beauty that shines through each look and attitude and word and gesture a kindly grace of manner and behavior a something in her presence and her ways that makes her beautiful beyond the reach of mere external beauty and in heart so noble and devoted to the truth and so in sympathy with all who strive after the higher life julia she draws me to her as much as her duke ercole repels me vittoria then the devout and honorable women that grace her court and make it good to be there francesca bucyronia the truehearted lavinia della rovere and the orsini the magdalena and the cherubina and anne de parthenai who sings so sweetly all lovely women full of noble thoughts and aspirations after noble things julia boccaccio would have envied you such dames vittoria no his fiammettas and his philomenas are fitter company for ser giovanni i fear he hardly would have comprehended the women that i speak of michael angelo yet he wrote the story of griselda that is something to set down in his favor vittoria with these ladies was a young girl olympia morate daughter of fulvio the learned scholar famous in all the universities a marvellous child who at the spinning wheel and in the daily round of household cares hath learned both greek and latin and is now a favorite of the duchess and companion of princess anne this beautiful young sappho sometimes recited to us grecian odes that she had written with a voice whose sadness thrilled and oermastered me and made me look into the future time and ask myself what destiny will be hers julia a sad one surely frost kills the flowers that blossom out of season and these precocious intellects portend a life of sorrow or an early death vittoria about the court were many learned men chilian sinapius from beyond the alps and celio curione and manzolli the dukes physician and a pale young man charles despeville of geneva whom the duchess doth much delight to talk with and to read for he hath written a book of institutes the duchess greatly praises though some call it the koran of the heretics julia and what poets were there to sing you madrigals and praise olympias eyes and cherubinas tresses vittoria no for great ariosto is no more the voice that filled those halls with melody has long been hushed in death julia you should have made a pilgrimage unto the poets tomb and laid a wreath upon it for the words he spake of you vittoria and of yourself no less and of our master michael angelo michael angelo of me vittoria have you forgotten that he calls you michael less man than angel and divine you are ungrateful michael angelo a mere play on words that adjective he wanted for a rhyme to match with gian bellino and urbino vittoria bernardo tasso is no longer there nor the gay troubadour of gascony clement marot surnamed by flatterers the prince of poets and the poet of princes who being looked upon with much disfavor by the duke ercole has fled to venice michael angelo there let him stay with pietro aretino the scourge of princes also called divine the title is so common in our mouths that even the pifferari of abruzzi who play their bagpipes in the streets of rome at the epiphany will bear it soon and will deserve it better than some poets vittoria what bee hath stung you michael angelo one that makes no honey one that comes buzzing in through every window and stabs men with his sting a bitter thought passed through my mind but it is gone again i spake too hastily julia i pray you show me what you have done michael angelo not yet it is not finished part second i monologue a room in michael angelos house michael angelo fled to viterbo the old papal city where once an emperor humbled in his pride held the popes stirrup as his holiness alighted from his mule a fugitive from cardinal caraffas hate who hurls his thunders at the house of the colonna with endless bitterness among the nuns in santa catarinas convent hidden herself in soul a nun and now she chides me for my too frequent letters that disturb her meditations and that hinder me and keep me from my work now graciously she thanks me for the crucifix i sent her and says that she will keep it with one hand inflicts a wound and with the other heals it reading profoundly i believed that god would grant you a supernatural faith to paint this christ i wished for that which i now see fulfilled so marvellously exceeding all my wishes nor more could be desired or even so much and greatly i rejoice that you have made the angel on the right so beautiful for the archangel michael will place you you michael angelo on that new day upon the lords right hand and waiting that how can i better serve you than to pray to this sweet christ for you and to beseech you to hold me altogether yours in all things well i will write less often or no more but wait her coming no one born in rome can live elsewhere but he must pine for rome and must return to it i who am born and bred a tuscan and a florentine feel the attraction and i linger here as if i were a pebble in the pavement trodden by priestly feet this i endure because i breathe in rome an atmosphere heavy with odors of the laurel leaves that crowned great heroes of the sword and pen in ages past i feel myself exalted to walk the streets in which a virgil walked or trajan rode in triumph but far more and most of all because the great colonna breathes the same air i breathe and is to me an inspiration now that she is gone rome is no longer rome till she return this feeling overmasters me i know not if it be love this strong desire to be forever in her presence but i know that i who was the friend of solitude and ever was best pleased when most alone now weary grow of my own company for the first time old age seems lonely to me opening the divina commedia i turn for consolation to the leaves of the great master of our tuscan tongue whose words like colored garnetshirls in lava betray the heat in which they were engendered a mendicant he ate the bitter bread of others but repaid their meagre gifts with immortality in courts of princes he was a byword and in streets of towns was mocked by children like the hebrew prophet himself a prophet i too know the cry go up thou bald head from a generation that wanting reverence wanteth the best food the soul can feed on theres not room enough for age and youth upon this little planet age must give way there was not room enough even for this great poet in his song i hear reverberate the gates of florence closing upon him never more to open but mingled with the sound are melodies celestial from the gates of paradise he came and he is gone the people knew not what manner of man was passing by their doors until he passed no more but in his vision he saw the torments and beatitudes of souls condemned or pardoned and hath left behind him this sublime apocalypse i strive in vain to draw here on the margin the face of beatrice it is not hers but the colonnas each hath his ideal the image of some woman excellent that is his guide no grecian art nor roman hath yet revealed such loveliness as hers ii viterbo vittoria colonna at the convent window vittoria parting with friends is temporary death as all death is we see no more their faces nor hear their voices save in memory but messages of love give us assurance that we are not forgotten who shall say that from the world of spirits comes no greeting no message of remembrance it may be the thoughts that visit us we know not whence sudden as inspiration are the whispers of disembodied spirits speaking to us as friends who wait outside a prison wall through the barred windows speak to those within a pause as quiet as the lake that lies beneath me as quiet as the tranquil sky above me as quiet as a heart that beats no more this convent seems above below all peace silence and solitude the souls best friends are with me here and the tumultuous world makes no more noise than the remotest planet o gentle spirit unto the third circle of heaven among the blessed souls ascended who living in the faith and dying for it have gone to their reward i do not sigh for thee as being dead but for myself that i am still alive turn those dear eyes once so benignant to me upon mine that open to their tears such uncontrolled and such continual issue still awhile have patience i will come to thee at last a few more goings in and out these doors a few more chimings of these convent bells a few more prayers a few more sighs and tears and the long agony of this life will end and i shall be with thee if i am wanting to thy wellbeing as thou art to mine have patience i will come to thee at last ye minds that loiter in these cloister gardens or wander far above the city walls bear unto him this message that i ever or speak or think of him or weep for him by unseen hands uplifted in the light of sunset yonder solitary cloud floats with its white apparel blown abroad and wafted up to heaven it fades away and melts into the air ah would that i could thus be wafted unto thee francesco a cloud of white an incorporeal spirit iii michael angelo and benvenuto cellini michael angelo benvenuto cellini in gay attire benvenuto a good day and good year to the divine maestro michael angelo the sculptor michael angelo welcome my benvenuto benvenuto that is what my father said the first time he beheld this handsome face but say farewell not welcome i come to take my leave i start for florence as fast as horse can carry me i long to set once more upon its level flags these feet made sore by your vile roman pavements come with me you are wanted there in florence the sacristy is not finished michael angelo speak not of it how damp and cold it was how my bones ached and my head reeled when i was working there i am too old i will stay here in rome where all is old and crumbling like myself to hopeless ruin all roads lead to rome benvenuto and all lead out of it michael angelo there is a charm a certain something in the atmosphere that all men feel and no man can describe benvenuto malaria michael angelo yes malaria of the mind out of this tomb of the majestic past the fever to accomplish some great work that will not let us sleep i must go on until i die benvenuto do you neer think of florence michael angelo yes whenever i think of anything beside my work i think of florence i remember too the bitter days i passed among the quarries of seravezza and pietrasanta roadbuilding in the marshes stupid people and cold and rain incessant and mad gusts of mountain wind like howling dervishes that spun and whirled the eddying snow about them as if it were a garment aye vexations and troubles of all kinds that ended only in loss of time and money benvenuto true maestro but that was not in florence you should leave such work to others sweeter memories cluster about you in the pleasant city upon the arno michael angelo in my waking dreams i see the marvellous dome of brunelleschi ghibertis gates of bronze and giottos tower and ghirlandajos lovely benci glides with folded hands amid my troubled thoughts a splendid vision time rides with the old at a great pace as travellers on swift steeds see the near landscape fly and flow behind them while the remoter fields and dim horizons go with them and seem wheeling round to meet them so in old age things near us slip away and distant things go with as pleasantly come back to me the days when as a youth i walked with ghirlandajo in the gardens of medici and saw the antique statues the forms august of gods and godlike men and the great world of art revealed itself to my young eyes then all that man hath done seemed possible to me alas how little of all i dreamed of has my hand achieved benvenuto nay let the night and morning let lorenzo and julian in the sacristy at florence prophets and sibyls in the sistine chapel and the last judgment answer is it finished michael angelo the work is nearly done but this last judgment has been the cause of more vexation to me than it will be of honor ser biagio master of ceremonies at the papal court a man punctilious and over nice calls it improper says that those nude forms showing their nakedness in such shameless fashion are better suited to a common bagnio or wayside wineshop than a papal chapel to punish him i painted him as minos and leave him there as master of ceremonies in the infernal regions what would you have done to such a man benvenuto i would have killed him when any one insults me if i can i kill him kill him michael angelo oh you gentlemen who dress in silks and velvets and wear swords are ready with your weapon and have all a taste for homicide benvenuto i learned that lesson under pope clement at the siege of rome some twenty years ago as i was standing upon the ramparts of the campo santo with alessandro bene i beheld a sea of fog that covered all the plain and hid from us the foe when suddenly a misty figure like an apparition rose up above the fog as if on horseback at this i aimed my arquebus and fired the figure vanished and there rose a cry out of the darkness long and fierce and loud with imprecations in all languages it was the constable of france the bourbon that i had slain michael angelo rome should be grateful to you benvenuto but has not been you shall hear presently during the siege i served as bombardier there in st angelo his holiness one day was walking with his cardinals on the round bastion while i stood above among my falconets all thought and feeling all skill in art and all desire of fame were swallowed up in the delightful music of that artillery i saw far off within the enemys trenches on the prati a spanish cavalier in scarlet cloak and firing at him with due aim and range i cut the gay hidalgo in two pieces the eyes are dry that wept for him in spain his holiness delighted beyond measure with such display of gunnery and amazed to see the man in scarlet cut in two gave me his benediction and absolved me from all the homicides i had committed in service of the apostolic church or should commit thereafter from that day i have not held in very high esteem the life of man michael angelo and who absolved pope clement now let us speak of art benvenuto of what you will michael angelo say have you seen our friend fra bastian lately since by a turn of fortune he became friar of the signet benvenuto faith a pretty artist to pass his days in stamping leaden seals on papal bulls michael angelo he has grown fat and lazy as if the lead clung to him like a sinker he paints no more since he was sent to fondi by cardinal ippolito to paint the fair gonzaga ah you should have seen him as i did riding through the city gate in his brown hood attended by four horsemen completely armed to frighten the banditti i think he would have frightened them alone for he was rounder than the o of giotto benvenuto he must have looked more like a sack of meal than a great painter michael angelo well he is not great but still i like him greatly benvenuto have faith in nothing but in industry be at it late and early persevere and work right on through censure and applause or else abandon art benvenuto no man works harder then i do i am not a moment idle michael angelo and what have you to show me benvenuto this gold ring made for his holiness my latest work and i am proud of it a single diamond presented by the emperor to the pope targhetta of venice set and tinted it i have reset it and retinted it divinely as you see the jewellers say ive surpassed targhetta michael angelo let me see it a pretty jewel benvenuto that is not the expression pretty is not a very pretty word to be applied to such a precious stone given by an emperor to a pope and set by benvenuto michael angelo messer benvenuto i lose all patience with you for the gifts that god hath given you are of such a kind they should be put to far more noble uses than setting diamonds for the pope of rome you can do greater things benvenuto the god who made me knows why he made me what i am a goldsmith a mere artificer michael angelo oh no an artist richly endowed by nature but who wraps his talent in a napkin and consumes his life in vanities benvenuto michael angelo may say what benvenuto would not bear from any other man he speaks the truth i know my life is wasted and consumed in vanities but i have better hours and higher aspirations than you think once when a prisoner at st angelo fasting and praying in the midnight darkness in a celestial vision i beheld a crucifix in the sun of the same substance as is the sun itself and since that hour there is a splendor round about my head that may he seen at sunrise and at sunset above my shadow on the grass and now i know that i am in the grace of god and none henceforth can harm me michael angelo none but one none but yourself who are your greatest foe he that respects himself is safe from others he wears a coat of mail that none can pierce benvenuto i always wear one michael angelo o incorrigible at least forget not the celestial vision man must have something higher than himself to think of benvenuto that i know full well now listen i have been sent for into france where grow the lilies that illumine heaven and earth and carry in mine equipage the model of a most marvellous golden saltcellar for the kings table and here in my brain a statue of mars armipotent for the fountain of fontainebleau colossal wonderful i go a goldsmith to return a sculptor and so farewell great master think of me as one who in the midst of all his follies had also his ambition and aspired to better things michael angelo do not forget the vision sitting down again to the divina commedia now in what circle of his poem sacred would the great florentine have placed this man whether in phlegethon the river of blood or in the fiery belt of purgatory i know not but most surely not with those who walk in leaden cloaks though he is one whose passions like a potent alkahest dissolve his better nature he is not that despicable thing a hypocrite he doth not cloak his vices nor deny them come back my thoughts from him to paradise iv fra sebastiano del piombo michael angelo fra sebastiano del piombo michael angelo not turning round who is it fra sebastiano wait for i am out of breath in climbing your steep stairs michael angelo ah my bastiano if you went up and down as many stairs as i do still and climbed as many ladders it would be better for you pray sit down your idle and luxurious way of living will one day take your breath away entirely and you will never find it fra sebastiano well what then that would be better in my apprehension than falling from a scaffold michael angelo that was nothing it did not kill me only lamed me slightly i am quite well again fra sebastiano but why dear master why do you live so high up in your house when you could live below and have a garden as i do michael angelo from this window i can look on many gardens oer the city roofs see the campagna and the alban hills and all are mine fra sebastiano can you sit down in them on summer afternoons and play the lute or sing or sleep the time away michael angelo i never sleep in the daytime scarcely sleep at night i have not time did you meet benvenuto as you came up the stair fra sebastiano he ran against me on the first landing going at full speed dressed like the spanish captain in a play with his long rapier and his short red cloak why hurry through the world at such a pace life will not be too long michael angelo it is his nature a restless spirit that consumes itself with useless agitations he oerleaps the goal he aims at patience is a plant that grows not in all gardens you are made of quite another clay fra sebastiano and thank god for it and now being somewhat rested i will tell you why i have climbed these formidable stairs i have a friend francesco berni here a very charming poet and companion who greatly honors you and all your doings and you must sup with us michael angelo not i indeed i know too well what artists suppers are you must excuse me fra sebastiano i will not excuse you you need repose from your incessant work some recreation some bright hours of pleasure michael angelo to me what you and other men call pleasure is only pain work is my recreation the play of faculty a delight like that which a bird feels in flying or a fish in darting through the water nothing more i cannot go the sibylline leaves of life grow precious now when only few remain i cannot go fra sebastiano berni perhaps will read a canto of the orlando inamorato michael angelo that is another reason for not going if aught is tedious and intolerable it is a poet reading his own verses fra sebastiano berni thinks somewhat better of your verses than you of his he says that you speak things and other poets words so pray you come michael angelo if it were now the improvisatore luigia pulci whom i used to hear with benvenuto in the streets of florence i might be tempted i was younger then and singing in the open air was pleasant fra sebastiano there is a frenchman here named rabelais once a franciscan friar and now a doctor and secretary to the embassy a learned man who speaks all languages and wittiest of men who wrote a book of the adventures of gargantua so full of strange conceits one roars with laughter at every page a jovial booncompanion and lover of much wine he too is coming michael angelo then you will not want me who am not witty and have no sense of mirth and love not wine i should be like a dead man at your banquet why should i seek this frenchman rabelais and wherefore go to hear francesco berni when i have dante alighieri here the greatest of all poets fra sebastiano and the dullest and only to be read in episodes his day is past petrarca is our poet michael angelo petrarca is for women and for lovers and for those soft abati who delight to wander down long garden walks in summer tinkling their little sonnets all day long as lap dogs do their bells fra sebastiano i love petrarca how sweetly of his absent love he sings when journeying in the forest of ardennes i seem to hear her hearing the boughs and breezes and leaves and birds lamenting and the waters murmuring flee along the verdant herbage michael angelo enough it is all seeming and no being if you would know how a man speaks in earnest read here this passage where st peter thunders in paradise against degenerate popes and the corruptions of the church till all the heaven about him blushes like a sunset i beg you to take note of what he says about the papal seals for that concerns your office and yourself fra sebastiano reading is this the passage nor i be made the figure of a seal to privileges venal and mendacious whereat i often redden and flash with fire that is not poetry michael angelo what is it then fra sebastiano vituperation gall that might have spirited from aretinos pen michael angelo name not that man a profligate whom your francesco berni describes as having one foot in the brothel and the other in the hospital who lives by flattering or maligning as best serves his purpose at the time he writes to me with easy arrogance of my last judgment in such familiar tone that one would say the great event already had occurred and he was present and from observation informed me how the picture should be painted fra sebastiano what unassuming unobtrusive men these critics are now to have aretino aiming his shafts at you brings back to mind the gascon archers in the square of milan shooting their arrows at duke sforzas statue by leonardo and the foolish rabble of envious florentines that at your david threw stones at night but aretino praised you michael angelo his praises were ironical he knows how to use words as weapons and to wound while seeming to defend but look bastiano see how the setting sun lights up that picture fra sebastiano my portrait of vittoria colonna michael angelo it makes her look as she will look hereafter when she becomes a saint fra sebastiano a noble woman michael angelo ah these old hands can fashion fairer shapes in marble and can paint diviner pictures since i have known her fra sebastiano and you like this picture and yet it is in oil which you detest michael angelo when that barbarian jan van eyck discovered the use of oil in painting he degraded his art into a handicraft and made it signpainting merely for a country inn or wayside wineshop t is an art for women or for such leisurely and idle people as you fra bastiano nature paints not in oils but frescoes the great dome of heaven with sunset and the lovely forms of clouds and flying vapors fra sebastiano and how soon they fade behold yon line of roofs and belfries painted upon the golden background of the sky like a byzantine picture or a portrait of cimabue see how hard the outline sharpcut and clear not rounded into shadow yet that is nature michael angelo she is always right the picture that approaches sculpture nearest is the best picture fra sebastiano leonardo thinks the open air too bright we ought to paint as if the sun were shining through a mist t is easier done in oil than in distemper michael angelo do not revive again the old dispute i have an excellent memory for forgetting but i still feel the hurt wounds are not healed by the unbending of the bow that made them fra sebastiano so say petrarca and the ancient proverb michael angelo but that is past now i am angry with you not that you paint in oils but that grown fat and indolent you do not paint at all fra sebastiano why should i paint why should i toil and sweat who now am rich enough to live at ease and take my pleasure michael angelo when pope leo died he who had been so lavish of the wealth his predecessors left him who received a basket of goldpieces every morning which every night was empty left behind hardly enough to pay his funeral fra sebastiano i care for banquets not for funerals as did his holiness i have forbidden all tapers at my burial and procession of priests and friars and monks and have provided the cost thereof be given to the poor michael angelo you have done wisely but of that i speak not ghiberti left behind him wealth and children but who today would know that he had lived if he had never made those gates of bronze in the old baptistery those gates of bronze worthy to be the gates of paradise his wealth is scattered to the winds his children are long since dead but those celestial gates survive and keep his name and memory green fra sebastiano but why should i fatigue myself i think that all things it is possible to paint have been already painted and if not why there are painters in the world at present who can accomplish more in two short months than i could in two years so it is well that some one is contented to do nothing and leave the field to others michael angelo o blasphemer not without reason do the people call you sebastian del piombo for the lead of all the papal bulls is heavy upon you and wraps you like a shroud fra sebastiano misericordia sharp is the vinegar of sweet wine and sharp the words you speak because the heart within you is sweet unto the core michael angelo how changed you are from the sebastiano i once knew when poor laborious emulous to excel you strove in rivalry with badassare and raphael sanzio fra sebastiano raphael is dead he is but dust and ashes in his grave while i am living and enjoying life and so am victor one live pope is worth a dozen dead ones michael angelo raphael is not dead he doth but sleep for how can he be dead who lives immortal in the hearts of men he only drank the precious wine of youth the outbreak of the grapes before the vintage was trodden to bitterness by the feet of men the gods have given him sleep we never were nor could be foes although our followers who are distorted shadows of ourselves have striven to make us so but each one worked unconsciously upon the others thought both giving and receiving he perchance caught strength from me and i some greater sweetness and tenderness from his more gentle nature i have but words of praise and admiration for his great genius and the world is fairer that he lived in it fra sebastiano we at least are friends so come with me michael angelo no no i am best pleased when im not asked to banquets i have reached a time of life when daily walks are shortened and even the houses of our dearest friends that used to be so near seem far away fra sebastiano then we must sup without you we shall laugh at those who toil for fame and make their lives a tedious martyrdom that they may live a little longer in the mouths of men and so goodnight michael angelo goodnight my fra bastiano returning to his work how will men speak of me when i am gone when all this colorless sad life is ended and i am dust they will remember only the wrinkled forehead the marred countenance the rudeness of my speech and my rough manners and never dream that underneath them all there was a womans heart of tenderness they will not know the secret of my life locked up in silence or but vaguely hinted in uncouth rhymes that may perchance survive some little space in memories of men each one performs his lifework and then leaves it those that come after him will estimate his influence on the age in which he lived v palazzo belvedere titians studio a painting of danae with a curtain before it titian michael angelo and giorgio vasari michael angelo so you have left at last your still lagoons your city of silence floating in the sea and come to us in rome titian i come to learn but i have come too late i should have seen rome in my youth when all my mind was open to new impressions our vasari here leads me about a blind man groping darkly among the marvels of the past i touch them but do not see them michael angelo there are things in rome that one might walk barefooted here from venice but to see once and then to die content titian i must confess that these majestic ruins oppress me with their gloom i feel as one who in the twilight stumbles among tombs and cannot read the inscriptions carved upon them michael angelo i felt so once but i have grown familiar with desolation and it has become no more a pain to me but a delight titian i could not live here i must have the sea and the seamist with sunshine interwoven like cloth of gold must have beneath my windows the laughter of the waves and at my door their pattering footsteps or i am not happy michael angelo then tell me of your city in the sea paved with red basalt of the paduan hills tell me of art in venice three great names giorgione titian and the tintoretto illustrate your venetian school and send a challenge to the world the first is dead but tintoretto lives titian and paints with fires sudden and splendid as the lightning paints the cloudy vault of heaven giorgio does he still keep above his door the arrogant inscription that once was painted there the color of titian with the design of michael angelo titian indeed i know not t was a foolish boast and does no harm to any but himself perhaps he has grown wiser michael angelo when you two are gone who is there that remains behind to seize the pencil falling from your fingers giorgio oh there are many hands upraised already to clutch at such a prize which hardly wait for death to loose your grasp a hundred of them schiavone bonifazio campagnola moretto and moroni who can count them or measure their ambition titian when we are gone the generation that comes after us will have far other thoughts than ours our ruins will serve to build their palaces or tombs they will possess the world that we think ours and fashion it far otherwise michael angelo i hear your son orazio and your nephew marco mentioned with honor titian ay brave lads brave lads but time will show there is a youth in venice one paul cagliari called the veronese still a mere stripling but of such rare promise that we must guard our laurels or may lose them michael angelo these are good tidings for i sometimes fear that when we die with us all art will die t is but a fancy nature will provide others to take our places i rejoice to see the young spring forward in the race eager as we were and as full of hope and the sublime audacity of youth titian men die and are forgotten the great world goes on the same among the myriads of men that live or have lived or shall live what is a single life or thine or mime that we should think all nature would stand still if we were gone we must make room for others michael angelo and now maestro pray unveil your picture of danae of which i hear such praise titian drawing hack the curtain what think you michael angelo that acrisius did well to lock such beauty in a brazen tower and hide it from all eyes titian the model truly was beautiful michael angelo and more that you were present and saw the showery jove from high olympus descend in all his splendor titian from your lips such words are full of sweetness michael angelo you have caught these golden hues from your venetian sunsets titian possibly michael angelo or from sunshine through a shower on the lagoons or the broad adriatic nature reveals herself in all our arts the pavements and the palaces of cities hint at the nature of the neighboring hills red lavas from the euganean quarries of padua pave your streets your palaces are the white stones of istria and gleam reflected in your waters and your pictures and thus the works of every artist show something of his surroundings and his habits the uttermost that can be reached by color is here accomplished warmth and light and softness mingle together never yet was flesh painted by hand of artist dead or living with such divine perfection titian i am grateful for so much praise from you who are a master while mostly those who praise and those who blame know nothing of the matter so that mainly their censure sounds like praise their praise like censure michael angelo wonderful wonderful the charm of color fascinates me the more that in myself the gift is wanting i am not a painter giorgio messer michele all the arts are yours not one alone and therefore i may venture to put a question to you michael angelo well speak on giorgio two nephews of the cardinal farnese have made me umpire in dispute between them which is the greater of the sister arts painting or sculpture solve for me the doubt michael angelo sculpture and painting have a common goal and whosoever would attain to it whichever path he take will find that goal equally hard to reach giorgio no doubt no doubt but you evade the question michael angelo when i stand in presence of this picture i concede that painting has attained its uttermost but in the presence of my sculptured figures i feel that my conception soars beyond all limit i have reached giorgio you still evade me michael angelo giorgio vasari i have often said that i account that painting as the best which most resembles sculpture here before us we have the proof behold those rounded limbs how from the canvas they detach themselves till they deceive the eye and one would say it is a statue with a screen behind it titian signori pardon me but all such questions seem to me idle michael angelo idle as the wind and now maestro i will say once more how admirable i esteem your work and leave you without further interruption titian your friendly visit hath much honored me gioroio farewell michael angelo to giorgio going out if the venetian painters knew but half as much of drawing as of color they would indeed work miracles in art and the world see what it hath never seen vi palazzo cesarini vittoria colonna seated in an armchair julia gonzaga standing near her julia it grieves me that i find you still so weak and suffering vittoria no not suffering only dying death is the chillness that precedes the dawn we shudder for a moment then awake in the broad sunshine of the other life i am a shadow merely and these hands these cheeks these eyes these tresses that my husband once thought so beautiful and i was proud of because he thought them so are faded quite all beauty gone from them julia ah no not that paler you are but not less beautiful vittoria hand me the mirror i would fain behold what change comes oer our features when we die thank you and now sit down beside me here how glad i am that you have come today above all other days and at the hour when most i need you julia do you ever need me victoria always and most of all today and now do you remember julia when we walked one afternoon upon the castle terrace at ischia on the day before you left me julia well i remember but it seems to me something unreal that has never been something that i have read of in a book or heard of some one else vittoria ten years and more have passed since then and many things have happened in those ten years and many friends have died marco flaminio whom we all admired and loved as our catullus dear valldesso the noble champion of free thought and speech and cardinal ippolito your friend julia oh do not speak of him his sudden death oercomes me now as it oercame me then let me forget it for my memory serves me too often as an unkind friend and i remember things i would forget while i forget the things i would remember vittoria forgive me i will speak of him no more the good fra bernardino has departed has fled from italy and crossed the alps fearing caraffas wrath because he taught that he who made us all

gradation goes keeping until the end its lustre bright not pale but whiter than the sheet of snows that without wind on some fair hilltop lies her weary body seemed to find repose like a sweet slumber in her lovely eyes when now the spirit was no longer there was what is dying called by the unwise een death itself in her fair face seemed fair is it of laura that he here is speaking she doth not

in her fair face seems fair how wonderful the light upon her face shines from the windows of another world saint only have such faces holy angels bear her like sainted catherine to her rest kisses vittorias hand part third i monologue macello de corvi a room in michael angelos house michael angelo standing before a model of st peters michael angelo better than thou i cannot brunelleschi and less than thou i will not if the thought could like a windlass lift the ponderous stones and swing them to their places if a breath could blow this rounded dome into the air as if it were a bubble and these statues spring at a signal to their sacred stations as sentinels mount guard upon a wall then were my task completed now alas naught am i but a saint sebaldus holding upon his hand the model of a church as german artists paint him and what years what weary years must drag themselves along ere this be turned to stone what hindrances must block the way what idle interferences of cardinals and canons of st peters who nothing know of art beyond the color of cloaks and stockings nor of any building save that of their own fortunes and what then i must then the shortcoming of my means piece out by stepping forward as the spartan was told to add a step to his short sword a pause and is fra bastian dead is all that light gone out that sunshine darkened all that music and merriment that used to make our lives less melancholy swallowed up in silence like madrigals sung in the street at night by passing revellers it is strange indeed that he should die before me t is against the laws of nature that the young should die and the old live unless it be that some have long been dead who think themselves alive because not buried well what matters it since now that greater light that was my sun is set and all is darkness all is darkness deaths lightnings strike to right and left of me and like a ruined wall the world around me crumbles away and i am left alone i have no friends and want none my own thoughts are now my sole companions thoughts of her that like a benediction from the skies come to me in my solitude and soothe me when men are old the incessant thought of death follows them like their shadow sits with them at every meal sleeps with them when they sleep and when they wake already is awake and standing by their bedside then what folly it is in us to make an enemy of this importunate follower not a friend to me a friend and not an enemy has he become since all my friends are dead ii vigna di papa giulio pope julius iii seated by the fountain of acqua vergine surrounded by cardinals julius tell me why is it ye are discontent you cardinals salviati and marcello with michael angelo what has he done or left undone that ye are set against him when one pope dies another is soon made and i can make a dozen cardinals but cannot make one michael angelo cardinal salviati your holiness we are not set against him we but deplore his incapacity he is too old julius you cardinal salviati are an old man are you incapable t is the old ox that draws the straightest furrow cardinal marcello your holiness remembers he was charged with the repairs upon st marys bridge made cofferdams and heaped up load on load of timber and travertine and yet for years the bridge remained unfinished till we gave it to baccio bigio julius always baccio bigio is there no other architect on earth was it not he that sometime had in charge the harbor of ancona cardinal marcello ay the same julius then let me tell you that your baccio bigio did greater damage in a single day to that fair harbor than the sea had done or would do in ten years and him you think to put in place of michael angelo in building the basilica of st peter the ass that thinks himself a stag discovers his error when he comes to leap the ditch cardinal marcello he does not build he but demolishes the labors of bramante and san gallo julius only to build more grandly cardinal marcello but time passes year after year goes by and yet the work is not completed michael angelo is a great sculptor but no architect his plans are faulty julius i have seen his model and have approved it but here comes the artist beware of him he may make persians of you to carry burdens on your backs forever scene ii the same michael angelo julius come forward dear maestro in these gardens all ceremonies of our court are banished sit down beside me here michael angelo sitting down how graciously your holiness commiserates old age and its infirmities julius say its privileges art i respect the building of this palace and laying out these pleasant garden walks are my delight and if i have not asked your aid in this it is that i forbear to lay new burdens on you at an age when you need rest here i escape from rome to be at peace the tumult of the city scarce reaches here michael angelo how beautiful it is and quiet almost as a hermitage julius we live as hermits here and from these heights oerlook all rome and see the yellow tiber cleaving in twain the city like a sword as far below there as st marys bridge what think you of that bridge michael angelo i would advise your holiness not to cross it or not often it is not safe julius it was repaired of late michael angelo some morning you will look for it in vain it will be gone the current of the river is undermining it julius but you repaired it michael angelo i strengthened all its piers and paved its road with travertine he who came after me removed the stone and sold it and filled in the space with gravel julius cardinal salviati and cardinal marcello do you listen this is your famous nanni baccio bigio michael angelo aside there is some mystery here these cardinals stand lowering at me with unfriendly eyes julius now let us come to what concerns us more than bridge or gardens some complaints are made concerning the three chapels in st peters certain supposed defects or imperfections you doubtless can explain michael angelo this is no longer the golden age of art men have become iconoclasts and critics they delight not in what an artist does but set themselves to censure what they do not comprehend you will not see them bearing a madonna of cimabue to the church in triumph but tearing down the statue of a pope to cast it into cannon who are they that bring complaints against me julius deputies of the commissioners and they complain of insufficient light in the three chapels michael angelo your holiness the insufficient light is somewhere else and not in the three chapels who are the deputies that make complaint julius the cardinals salviati and marcello here present michael angelo rising with permission monsignori what is it ye complain of cardinal marcello we regret you have departed from bramantes plan and from san gallos michael angelo since the ancient time no greater architect has lived on earth than lazzari bramante his design without confusion simple clear welllighted merits all praise and to depart from it would be departing from the truth san gallo building about with columns took all light out of this plan left in the choir dark corners for infinite ribaldries and lurking places for rogues and robbers so that when the church was shut at night not five and twenty men could find them out it was san gallo then that left the church in darkness and not i cardinal marcello excuse me but in each of the three chapels is but a single window michael angelo monsignore perhaps you do not know that in the vaulting above there are to go three other windows cardinal salviati how should we know you never told us of it michael angelo i neither am obliged nor will i be to tell your eminence or any other what i intend or ought to do your office is to provide the means and see that thieves do not lay hands upon them the designs must all be left to me cardinal marcello sir architect you do forget yourself to speak thus rudely in presence of his holiness and to us who are his cardinals michael angelo putting on his hat i do not forget i am descended from the counts canossa linked with the imperial line and with matilda who gave the church saint peters patrimony i too am proud to give unto the church the labor of these hands and what of life remains to me my father buonarotti was podesta of chiusi and caprese i am not used to have men speak to me as if i were a mason hired to build a garden wall and paid on saturdays so much an hour cardinal salviati aside no wonder that pope clement never sat down in presence of this man lest he should do the same and always bade him put on his hat lest he unasked should do it michael angelo if any one could die of grief and shame i should this labor was imposed upon me i did not seek it and if i assumed it t was not for love of fame or love of gain but for the love of god perhaps old age deceived me or selfinterest or ambition i may be doing harm instead of good therefore i pray your holiness release me take off from me the burden of this work let me go back to florence julius never never while i am living michael angelo doth your holiness remember what the holy scriptures say of the inevitable time when those who look out of the windows shall be darkened and the almondtree shall flourish julius that is in ecclesiastes michael angelo and the grasshopper shall be a burden and desire shall fail because man goeth unto his long home vanity of vanities saith the preacher all is vanity julius ah were to do a thing as easy as to dream of doing it we should not want for artists but the men who carry out in act their great designs are few in number ay they may be counted upon the fingers of this hand your place is at st peters michael angelo i have had my dream and cannot carry out my great conception and put it into act julius then who can do it you would but leave it to some baccio bigio to mangle and deface michael angelo rather than that i will still bear the burden on my shoulders a little longer if your holiness will keep the world in order and will leave the building of the church to me the work will go on better for it holy father if all the labors that i have endured and shall endure advantage not my soul i am but losing time julius laying his hands on michael angelos shoulders you will be gainer both for your soul and body michael angelo not events exasperate me but the funest conclusions i draw from these events the sure decline of art and all the meaning of that word all that embellishes and sweetens life and lifts it from the level of low cares into the purer atmosphere of beauty the faith in the ideal the inspiration that made the canons of the church of seville say let us build so that all men hereafter will say that we were madmen holy father i beg permission to retire from here julius go and my benediction be upon you michael angelo goes out my cardinals this michael angelo must not be dealt with as a common mason he comes of noble blood and for his crest bear two bulls horns and he has given us proof that he can toss with them from this day forth unto the end of time let no man utter the name of baccio bigio in my presence all great achievements are the natural fruits of a great character as trees bear not their fruits of the same size and quality but each one in its kind with equal ease so are great deeds as natural to great men as mean things are to small ones by his work we know the master let us not perplex him iii bindo altoviti a street in rome bindo altoviti standing at the door of his house michael angelo passing bindo goodmorning messer michael angelo michael angelo goodmorning messer bindo altoviti bindo what brings you forth so early michael angelo the same reason that keeps you standing sentinel at your door the air of this delicious summer morning what news have you from florence bindo nothing new the same old tale of violence and wrong since the disastrous day at monte murlo when in procession through san gallos gate bareheaded clothed in rags on sorry steeds philippo strozzi and the good valori were led as prisoners down the streets of florence amid the shouts of an ungrateful people hope is no more and liberty no more duke cosimo the tyrant reigns supreme michael angelo florence is dead her houses are but tombs silence and solitude are in her streets bindo ah yes and often i repeat the words you wrote upon your statue of the night there in the sacristy of san lorenzo grateful to me is sleep to be of stone more grateful while the wrong and shame endure to see not feel not is a benediction therefore awake me not oh speak in whispers michael angelo ah messer bindo the calamities the fallen fortunes and the desolation of florence are to me a tragedy deeper than words and darker than despair i who have worshipped freedom from my cradle have loved her with the passion of a lover and clothed her with all lovely attributes that the imagination can conceive or the heart conjure up now see her dead and trodden in the dust beneath the feet of an adventurer it is a grief too great for me to bear in my old age bindo i say no news from florence i am wrong for benvenuto writes that he is coming to be my guest in rome michael angelo those are good tidings he hath been many years away from us bindo pray you come in michael angelo i have not time to stay and yet i will i see from here your house is filled with works of art that bust in bronze is of yourself tell me who is the master that works in such an admirable way and with such power and feeling bindo benvenuto michael angelo ah benvenuto t is a masterpiece it pleases me as much and even more than the antiques about it and yet they are of the best one sees but you have placed it by far too high the light comes from below and injures the expression were these windows above and not beneath it then indeed it would maintain its own among these works of the old masters noble as they are i will go in and study it more closely i always prophesied that benvenuto with all his follies and fantastic ways would show his genius in some work of art that would amaze the world and be a challenge unto all other artists of his time they go in iv in the coliseum michael angelo and tomaso de cavalieri cavalieri what have you here alone messer michele michael angelo i come to learn cavalieri you are already master and teach all other men michael angelo nay i know nothing not even my own ignorance as some philosopher hath said i am a schoolboy who hath not learned his lesson and who stands ashamed and silent in the awful presence of the great master of antiquity who built these walls cyclopean cavalieri gaudentius his name was i remember his reward was to be thrown alive to the wild beasts here where we now are standing michael angelo idle tales cavalieri but you are greater than gaudentius was and your work nobler michael angelo silence i beseech you cavalieri tradition says that fifteen thousand men were toiling for ten years incessantly upon this amphitheatre michael angelo behold how wonderful it is the queen of flowers the marble rose of rome its petals torn by wind and rain of thrice five hundred years its mossy sheath half rent away and sold to ornament our palaces and churches or to be trodden under feet of man upon the tibers bank yet what remains still opening its fair bosom to the sun and to the constellations that at night hang poised above it like a swarm of bees cavalieri the rose of rome but not of paradise not the white rose our tuscan poet saw with saints for petals when this rose was perfect its hundred thousand petals were not saints but senators in their thessalian caps and all the roaring populace of rome and even an empress and the vestal virgins who came to see the gladiators die could not give sweetness to a rose like this michael angelo i spake not of its uses but its beauty cavalieri the sand beneath our feet is saturate with blood of martyrs and these rifted stones are awful witnesses against a people whose pleasure was the pain of dying men michael angelo tomaso cavalieri on my word you should have been a preacher not a painter think you that i approve such cruelties because i marvel at the architects who built these walls and curved these noble arches oh i am put to shame when i consider how mean our work is when compared with theirs look at these walls about us and above us they have been shaken by earthquake have been made a fortress and been battered by long sieges the iron clamps that held the stones together have been wrenched from them but they stand erect and firm as if they had been hewn and hollowed out of the solid rock and were a part of the foundations of the world itself cavalieri your work i say again is nobler work in so far as its end and aim are nobler and this is but a ruin like the rest its vaulted passages are made the caverns of robbers and are haunted by the ghosts of murdered men michael angelo a thousand wild flowers bloom from every chink and the birds build their nests among the ruined arches and suggest new thoughts of beauty to the architect now let us climb the broken stairs that lead into the corridors above and study the marvel and the mystery of that art in which i am a pupil not a master all things must have an end the world itself must have an end as in a dream i saw it there came a great hand out of heaven and touched the earth and stopped it in its course the seas leaped a vast cataract into the abyss the forests and the fields slid off and floated like wooded islands in the air the dead were hurled forth from their sepulchres the living were mingled with them and themselves were dead all being dead and the fair shining cities dropped out like jewels from a broken crown naught but the core of the great globe remained a skeleton of stone and over it the wrack of matter drifted like a cloud and then recoiled upon itself and fell back on the empty world that with the weight reeled staggered righted and then headlong plunged into the darkness as a ship when struck by a great sea throws off the waves at first on either side then settles and goes down into the dark abyss with her dead crew cavalieri but the earth does not move michael angelo who knows who knowst there are great truths that pitch their shining tents outside our walls and though but dimly seen in the gray dawn they will be manifest when the light widens into perfect day a certain man copernicus by name sometime professor here in rome has whispered it is the earth and not the sun that moves what i beheld was only in a dream yet dreams sometimes anticipate events being unsubstantial images of things as yet unseen v macello de corvi michael angelo benvenuto cellini michael angelo so benvenuto you return once more to the eternal city t is the centre to which all gravitates one finds no rest elsewhere than here there may be other cities that please us for a while but rome alone completely satisfies it becomes to all a second native land by predilection and not by accident of birth alone benvenuto i am but just arrived and am now lodging with bindo altoviti i have been to kiss the feet of our most holy father and now am come in haste to kiss the hands of my miraculous master michael angelo and to find him grown very old benvenuto you know that precious stones never grow old michael angelo half sunk beneath the horizon and yet not gone twelve years are a long while tell me of france benvenuto it were too long a tale to tell you all suffice in brief to say the king received me well and loved me well gave me the annual pension that before me our leonardo had nor more nor less and for my residence the tour de nesle upon the riverside michael angelo a princely lodging benvenuto what in return i did now matters not for there are other things of greater moment i wish to speak of first of all the letter you wrote me not long since about my bust of bindo altoviti here in rome you said my benvenuto i for many years have known you as the greatest of all goldsmiths and now i know you as no less a sculptor ah generous master how shall i eer thank you for such kind language michael angelo by believing it i saw the bust at messer bindos house and thought it worthy of the ancient masters and said so that is all benvenuto it is too much and i should stand abashed here in your presence had i done nothing worthier of your praise than bindos bust michael angelo what have you done thats better benvenuto when i left rome for paris you remember i promised you that if i went a goldsmith i would return a sculptor i have kept the promise i then made michael angelo dear benvenuto i recognized the latent genius in you but feared your vices benvenuto i have turned them all to virtues my impatient wayward nature that made me quick in quarrel now has served me where meekness could not and where patience could not as you shall hear now i have cast in bronze a statue of perseus holding thus aloft in his left hand the head of the medusa and in his right the sword that severed it his right foot planted on the lifeless corse his face superb and pitiful with eyes downlooking on the victim of his vengeance michael angelo i see it as it should be benvenuto as it will be when it is placed upon the ducal square halfway between your david and the judith of donatello michael angelo rival of them both benvenuto but ah what infinite trouble have i had with bandinello and that stupid beast the majordomo of duke cosimo francesco ricci and their wretched agent gorini who came crawling round about me like a black spider with his whining voice that sounded like the buzz of a mosquito oh i have wept in utter desperation and wished a thousand times i had not left my tour do nesle nor eer returned to florence or thought of perseus what malignant falsehoods they told the grand duke to impede my work and make me desperate michael angelo the nimble lie is like the secondhand upon a clock we see it fly while the hourhand of truth seems to stand still and yet it moves unseen and wins at last for the clock will not strike till it has reached the goal benvenuto my obstinacy stood me in stead and helped me to oercome the hindrances that envy and illwill put in my way michael angelo when anything is done people see not the patient doing of it nor think how great would be the loss to man if it had not been done as in a building stone rests on stone and wanting the foundation all would be wanting so in human life each action rests on the foregone event that made it possible but is forgotten and buried in the earth benvenuto even bandinello who never yet spake well of anything speaks well of this and yet he told the duke that though i cast small figures well enough i never could cast this michael angelo but you have done it and proved ser bandinello a false prophet that is the wisest way benvenuto and ah that casting what a wild scene it was as late at night a night of wind and rain we heaped the furnace with pine of serristori till the flames caught in the rafters over us and threatened to send the burning roof upon our heads and from the garden side the wind and rain poured in upon us and half quenched our fires i was beside myself with desperation a shudder came upon me then a fever i thought that i was dying and was forced to leave the workshop and to throw myself upon my bed as one who has no hope and as i lay there a deformed old man appeared before me and with dismal voice like one who doth exhort a criminal led forth to death exclaimed poor benvenuto thy work is spoiled there is no remedy then with a cry so loud it might have reached the heaven of fire i bounded to my feet and rushed back to my workmen they all stood bewildered and desponding and i looked into the furnace and beheld the mass half molten only and in my despair i fed the fire with oak whose terrible heat soon made the sluggish metal shine and sparkle then followed a bright flash and an explosion as if a thunderbolt had fallen among us the covering of the furnace had been rent asunder and the bronze was flowing over so that i straightway opened all the sluices to fill the mould the metal ran like lava sluggish and heavy and i sent my workmen to ransack the whole house and bring together my pewter plates and pans two hundred of them and cast them one by one into the furnace to liquefy the mass and in a moment the mould was filled i fell upon my knees and thanked the lord and then we ate and drank and went to bed all hearty and contented it was two hours before the break of day my fever was quite gone michael angelo a strange adventure that could have happened to no man alive but you my benvenuto benvenuto as my workmen said to majordomo ricci afterward when he inquired of them t was not a man but an express great devil michael angelo and the statue benvenuto perfect in every part save the right foot of perseus as i had foretold the duke there was just bronze enough to fill the mould not a drop over not a drop too little i looked upon it as a miracle wrought by the hand of god michael angelo and now i see how you have turned your vices into virtues benvenuto but wherefore do i prate of this i came to speak of other things duke cosimo through me invites you to return to florence and offers you great honors even to make you one of the fortyeight his senators michael angelo his senators that is enough since florence was changed by clement seventh from a republic into a dukedom i no longer wish to be a florentine that dream is ended the grand duke cosimo now reigns supreme all liberty is dead ah woe is me i hoped to see my country rise to heights of happiness and freedom yet unreached by other nations but the climbing wave pauses lets go its hold and slides again back to the common level with a hoarse death rattle in its throat i am too old to hope for better days i will stay here and die in rome the very weeds that grow among the broken fragments of her ruins are sweeter to me than the garden flowers of other cities and the desolate ring of the campagna round about her walls fairer than all the villas that encircle the towns of tuscany benvenuto but your old friends michael angelo all dead by violence baccio valori has been beheaded guicciardini poisoned philippo strozzi strangled in his prison is florence then a place for honest men to flourish in what is there to prevent my sharing the same fate benvenuto why this if all your friends are dead so are your enemies michael angelo is aretino dead benvenuto he lives in venice and not in florence michael angelo t is the same to me this wretched mountebank whom flatterers call the divine as if to make the word unpleasant in the mouths of those who speak it and in the ears of those who hear it sends me a letter written for the public eye and with such subtle and infernal malice i wonder at his wickedness t is he is the express great devil and not you some years ago he told me how to paint the scenes of the last judgment benvenuto i remember michael angelo well now he writes to me that as a christian he is ashamed of the unbounded freedom with which i represent it benvenuto hypocrite michael angelo he says i show mankind that i am wanting in piety and religion in proportion as i profess perfection in my art profess perfection why t is only men like bugiardini who are satisfied with what they do i never am content but always see the labors of my hand fall short of my conception benvenuto i perceive the malice of this creature he would taint you with heresy and in a time like this t is infamous michael angelo i represent the angels without their heavenly glory and the saints without a trace of earthly modesty benvenuto incredible audacity michael angelo the heathen veiled their diana with some drapery and when they represented venus naked they made her by her modest attitude appear half clothed but i who am a christian do so subordinate belief to art that i have made the very violation of modesty in martyrs and in virgins a spectacle at which all men would gaze with halfaverted eyes even in a brothel benvenuto he is at home there and he ought to know what men avert their eyes from in such places from the last judgment chiefly i imagine michael angelo but divine providence will never leave the boldness of my marvellous work unpunished and the more marvellous it is the more t is sure to prove the ruin of my fame and finally if in this composition i had pursued the instructions that he gave me concerning heaven and hell and paradise in that same letter known to all the world nature would not be forced as she is now to feel ashamed that she invested me with such great talent that i stand myself a very idol in the world of art he taunts me also with the mausoleum of julius still unfinished for the reason that men persuaded the inane old man it was of evil augury to build his tomb while he was living and he speaks of heaps of gold this pope bequeathed to me and calls it robbery that is what he says what prompted such a letter benvenuto vanity he is a clever writer and he likes to draw his pen and flourish it in the face of every honest man as swordsmen do their rapiers on occasion but to show how skilfully they do it had you followed the advice he gave or even thanked him for it you would have seen another style of fence t is but his wounded vanity and the wish to see his name in print so give it not a moments thought it soon will be forgotten michael angelo i will not think of it but let it pass for a rude speech thrown at me in the street as boys threw stones at dante benvenuto and what answer shall i take back to grand duke cosimo he does not ask your labor or your service only your presence in the city of florence with such advice upon his work in hand as he may ask and you may choose to give michael angelo you have my answer nothing he can offer shall tempt me to leave rome my work is here and only here the building of st peters what other things i hitherto have done have fallen from me are no longer mine i have passed on beyond them and have left them as milestones on the way what lies before me that is still mine and while it is unfinished no one shall draw me from it or persuade me by promises of ease or wealth or honor till i behold the finished dome uprise complete as now i see it in my thought benvenuto and will you paint no more michael angelo no more benvenuto t is well sculpture is more divine and more like nature that fashions all her works in high relief and that is sculpture this vast ball the earth was moulded out of clay and baked in fire men women and all animals that breathe are statues and not paintings even the plants the flowers the fruits the grasses were first sculptured and colored later painting is a lie a shadow merely michael angelo truly as you say sculpture is more than painting it is greater to raise the dead to life than to create phantoms that seem to live the most majestic of the three sister arts is that which builds the eldest of them all to whom the others are but the handmaids and the servitors being but imitation not creation henceforth i dedicate myself to her benvenuto and no more from the marble hew those forms that fill us all with wonder michael angelo many statues will there be room for in my work their station already is assigned them in my mind but things move slowly there are hindrances want of material want of means delays and interruptions endless interference of cardinal commissioners and disputes and jealousies of artists that annoy me but twill persevere until the work is wholly finished or till i sink down surprised by death that unexpected guest who waits for no mans leisure but steps in unasked and unannounced to put a stop to all our occupations and designs and then perhaps i may go back to florence this is my answer to duke cosimo vi michael angelos studio michael angelo and urbino michael angelo pausing in his work urbino thou and i are both old men my strength begins to fail me urbino eccellenza that is impossible do i not see you attack the marble blocks with the same fury as twenty years ago michael angelo t is an old habit i must have learned it early from my nurse at setignano the stonemasons wife for the first sounds i heard were of the chisel chipping away the stone urbino at every stroke you strike fire with your chisel michael angelo ay because the marble is too hard urbino it is a block that topolino sent you from carrara he is a judge of marble michael angelo i remember with it he sent me something of his making a mercury with long body and short legs as if by any possibility a messenger of the gods could have short legs it was no more like mercury than you are but rather like those little plaster figures that peddlers hawk about the villages as images of saints but luckily for topolino there are many people who see no difference between what is best and what is only good or not even good so that poor artists stand in their esteem on the same level with the best or higher urbino how eccellenza laughed michael angelo poor topolino all men are not born artists nor will labor eer make them artists urbino no no more than emperors or popes or cardinals one must be chosen for it i have been your colorgrinder six and twenty years and am not yet an artist michael angelo some have eyes that see not but in every block of marble i see a statue see it as distinctly as if it stood before me shaped and perfect in attitude and action i have only to hew away the stone walls that imprison the lovely apparition and reveal it to other eyes as mine already see it but i grow old and weak what wilt thou do when i am dead urbino urbino eccellenza i must then serve another master michael angelo never bitter is servitude at best already so many years hast thou been serving me but rather as a friend than as a servant we have grown old together dost thou think so meanly of this michael angelo as to imagine he would let thee serve when he is free from service take this purse two thousand crowns in gold urbino two thousand crowns michael angelo ay it will make thee rich thou shalt not die a beggar in a hospital urbino oh master michael angelo i cannot have them with me on the journey that i am undertaking the last garment that men will make for me will have no pockets urbino kissing the hand of michael angelo my generous master michael angelo hush urbino my providence michael angelo not a word more go now to bed old man thou hast served michael angelo remember henceforward thou shalt serve no other master vii the oaks of monte luca michael angelo alone in the woods michael angelo how still it is among these ancient oaks surges and undulations of the air uplift the leafy boughs and let them fall with scarce a sound such sylvan quietudes become old age these huge centennial oaks that may have heard in infancy the trumpets of barbarossas cavalry deride mans brief existence that with all his strength he cannot stretch beyond the hundredth year this little acorn turbaned like the turk which with my foot i spurn may be an oak hereafter feeding with its bitter mast the fierce wild boar and tossing in its arms the cradled nests of birds when all the men that now inhabit this vast universe they and their children and their childrens children shall be but dust and mould and nothing more through openings in the trees i see below me the valley of clitumnus with its farms and snowwhite oxen grazing in the shade of the tall poplars on the rivers brink o nature gentle mother tender nurse i who have never loved thee as i ought but wasted all my years immured in cities and breathed the stifling atmosphere of streets now come to thee for refuge here is peace yonder i see the little hermitages dotting the mountain side with points of light and here st julians convent like a nest of curlews clinging to some windy cliff beyond the broad illimitable plain down sinks the sun red as apollos quoit that by the envious zephyr blown aside struck hyacinthus dead and stained the earth with his young blood that blossomed into flowers and now instead of these fair deities dread demons haunt the earth hermits inhabit the leafy homes of sylvan hamadryads and jovial friars rotund and rubicund replace the old silenus with his ass here underneath these venerable oaks wrinkled and brown and gnarled like them with age a brother of the monastery sits lost in his meditations what may be the questions that perplex the hopes that cheer him goodevening holy father monk god be with you michael angelo pardon a stranger if he interrupt your meditations monk it was but a dream the old old dream that never will come true the dream that all my life i have been dreaming and yet is still a dream michael angelo all men have dreams i have had mine but none of them came true they were but vanity sometimes i think the happiness of man lies in pursuing not in possessing for the things possessed lose half their value tell me of your dream monk the yearning of my heart my sole desire that like the sheaf of joseph stands up right while all the others bend and bow to it the passion that torments me and that breathes new meaning into the dead forms of prayer is that with mortal eyes i may behold the eternal city michael angelo rome monk there is but one the rest are merely names i think of it as the celestial city paved with gold and sentinelled with angels michael angelo would it were i have just fled from it it is beleaguered by spanish troops led by the duke of alva monk but still for me t is the celestial city and i would see it once before i die michael angelo each one must bear his cross monk were it a cross that had been laid upon me i could bear it or fall with it it is a crucifix i am nailed hand and foot and i am dying michael angelo what would you see in rome monk his holiness michael angelo him that was once the cardinal caraffa you would but see a man of fourscore years with sunken eyes burning like carbuncles who sits at table with his friends for hours cursing the spaniards as a race of jews and miscreant moors and with what soldiery think you he now defends the eternal city monk with legions of bright angels michael angelo so he calls them and yet in fact these bright angelic legions are only german lutherans monk crossing himself heaven protect us michael angelo what further would you see monk the cardinals going in their gilt coaches to high mass michael angelo men do not go to paradise in coaches monk the catacombs the convents and the churches the ceremonies of the holy week in all their pomp or at the epiphany the feast of the santissima bambino at ara coeli but i shall not see them michael angelo these pompous ceremonies of the church are but an empty show to him who knows the actors in them stay here in your convent for he who goes to rome may see too much what would you further monk i would see the painting of the last judgment in the sistine chapel michael angelo the smoke of incense and of altar candles has blackened it already monk woe is me then i would hear allegris miserere sung by the papal choir michael angelo a dismal dirge i am an old old man and i have lived in rome for thirty years and more and know the jarring of the wheels of that great world its jealousies its discords and its strife therefore i say to you remain content here in your convent here among your woods where only there is peace go not to rome there was of old a monk of wittenberg who went to rome you may have heard of him his name was luther and you know what followed the convent bell rings monk rising it is the convent bell it rings for vespers let us go in we both will pray for peace viii the dead christ michael angelos studio michael angelo with a light working upon the dead christ midnight michael angelo o death why is it i cannot portray thy form and features do i stand too near thee or dost thou hold my hand and draw me back as being thy disciple not thy master let him who knows not what old age is like have patience till it comes and he will know i once had skill to fashion life and death and sleep which is the counterfeit of death and i remember what giovanni strozzi wrote underneath my statue of the night in san lorenzo ah so long ago grateful to me is sleep more grateful now than it was then for all my friends are dead and she is dead the noblest of them all i saw her face when the great sculptor death whom men should call divine had at a blow stricken her into marble and i kissed her cold white hand what was it held me back from kissing her fair forehead and those lips those dead dumb lips grateful to me is sleep enter giorgio vasari giorgio goodevening or goodmorning for i know not which of the two it is michael angelo how came you in giorgio why by the door as all men do michael angelo ascanio must have forgotten to bolt it giorgio probably am i a spirit or so like a spirit that i could slip through bolted door or window as i was passing down the street i saw a glimmer of light and heard the wellknown chink of chisel upon marble so i entered to see what keeps you from your bed so late michael angelo coming forward with the lamp you have been revelling with your boon companions giorgio vasari and you come to me at an untimely hour giorgio the pope hath sent me his holiness desires to see again the drawing you once showed him of the dome of the basilica michael angelo we will look for it giorgio what is the marble group that glimmers there behind you michael angelo nothing and yet everything as one may take it it is my own tomb that i am building giorgio do not hide it from me by our long friendship and the love i bear you refuse me not michael angelo letting fall the lamp life hath become to me an empty theatre its lights extinguished the music silent and the actors gone and i alone sit musing on the scenes that once have been i am so old that death oft plucks me by the cloak to come with him and some day like this lamp shall i fall down and my last spark of life will be extinguished ah me ah me what darkness of despair so near to death and yet so far from god translations prelude as treasures that men seek deepburied in seasands vanish if they but speak and elude their eager hands so ye escape and slip o songs and fade away when the word is on my lip to interpret what ye say were it not better then to let the treasures rest hid from the eyes of men locked in their iron chest i have but marked the place but half the secret told that following this slight trace others may find the gold from the spanish coplas de manrique o let the soul her slumbers break let thought be quickened and awake awake to see how soon this life is past and gone and death comes softly stealing on how silently swiftly our pleasures glide away our hearts recall the distant day with many sighs the moments that are speeding fast we heed not but the past the past more highly prize onward its course the present keeps onward the constant current sweeps till life is done and did we judge of time aright the past and future in their flight would be as one let no one fondly dream again that hope and all her shadowy train will not decay fleeting as were the dreams of old remembered like a tale thats told they pass away our lives are rivers gliding free to that unfathomed boundless sea the silent grave thither all earthly pomp and boast roll to be swallowed up and lost in one dark wave thither the mighty torrents stray thither the brook pursues its way and tinkling rill there all are equal side by side the poor man and the son of pride lie calm and still i will not here invoke the throng of orators and sons of song the deathless few fiction entices and deceives and sprinkled oer her fragrant leaves lies poisonous dew to one alone my thoughts arise the eternal truth the good and wise to him i cry who shared on earth our common lot but the world comprehended not his deity this world is but the rugged road which leads us to the bright abode of peace above so let us choose that narrow way which leads no travellers foot astray from realms of love our cradle is the startingplace life is the running of the race we reach the goal when in the mansions of the blest death leaves to its eternal rest the weary soul did we but use it as we ought this world would school each wandering thought to its high state faith wings the soul beyond the sky up to that better world on high for which we wait yes the glad messenger of love to guide us to our home above the saviour came born amid mortal cares and fears he suffered in this vale of tears a death of shame behold of what delusive worth the bubbles we pursue on earth the shapes we chase amid a world of treachery they vanish ere death shuts the eye and leave no trace time steals them from us chances strange disastrous accident and change that come to all even in the most exalted state relentless sweeps the stroke of fate the strongest fall tell me the charms that lovers seek in the clear eye and blushing cheek the hues that play oer rosy lip and brow of snow when hoary age approaches slow ah where are they the cunning skill the curious arts the glorious strength that youth imparts in lifes first stage these shall become a heavy weight when time swings wide his outward gate to weary age the noble blood of gothic name heroes emblazoned high to fame in long array how in the onward course of time the landmarks of that race sublime were swept away some the degraded slaves of lust prostrate and trampled in the dust shall rise no more others by guilt and crime maintain the scutcheon that without a stain their fathers bore wealth and the high estate of pride with what untimely speed they glide how soon depart bid not the shadowy phantoms stay the vassals of a mistress they of fickle heart these gifts in fortunes hands are found her swift revolving wheel turns round and they are gone no rest the inconstant goddess knows but changing and without repose still hurries on even could the hand of avarice save its gilded baubles till the grave reclaimed its prey let none on such poor hopes rely life like an empty dream flits by and where are they earthly desires and sensual lust are passions springing from the dust they fade and die but in the life beyond the tomb they seal the immortal spirits doom eternally the pleasures and delights which mask in treacherous smiles lifes serious task what are they all but the fleet coursers of the chase and death an ambush in the race wherein we fall no foe no dangerous pass we heed brook no delay but onward speed with loosened rein and when the fatal snare is near we strive to check our mad career but strive in vain could we new charms to age impart and fashion with a cunning art the human face as we can clothe the soul with light and make the glorious spirit bright with heavenly grace how busily each passing hour should we exert that magic power what ardor show to deck the sensual slave of sin yet leave the freeborn soul within in weeds of woe monarchs the powerful and the strong famous in history and in song of olden time saw by the stern decrees of fate their kingdoms lost and desolate their race sublime who is the champion who the strong pontiff and priest and sceptred throng on these shall fall as heavily the hand of death as when it stays the shepherds breath beside his stall i speak not of the trojan name neither its glory nor its shame has met our eyes nor of romes great and glorious dead though we have heard so oft and read their histories little avails it now to know of ages passed so long ago nor how they rolled our theme shall be of yesterday which to oblivion sweeps away like days of old where is the king don juan where each royal prince and noble heir of aragon where are the courtly gallantries the deeds of love and high emprise in battle done tourney and joust that charmed the eye and scarf and gorgeous panoply and nodding plume what were they but a pageant scene what but the garlands gay and green that deck the tomb where are the highborn dames and where their gay attire and jewelled hair and odors sweet where are the gentle knights that came to kneel and breathe loves ardent flame low at their feet where is the song of troubadour where are the lute and gay tambour they loved of yore where is the mazy dance of old the flowing robes inwrought with gold the dancers wore and he who next the sceptre swayed henry whose royal court displayed such power and pride o in what winning smiles arrayed the world its various pleasures laid his throne beside but o how false and full of guile that world which wore so soft a smile but to betray she that had been his friend before now from the fated monarch tore her charms away the countless gifts the stately walls the loyal palaces and halls all filled with gold plate with armorial bearings wrought chambers with ample treasures fraught of wealth untold the noble steeds and harness bright and gallant lord and stalwart knight in rich array where shall we seek them now alas like the bright dewdrops on the grass they passed away his brother too whose factious zeal usurped the sceptre of castile unskilled to reign what a gay brilliant court had he when all the flower of chivalry was in his train but he was mortal and the breath that flamed from the hot forge of death blasted his years judgment of god that flame by thee when raging fierce and fearfully was quenched in tears spains haughty constable the true and gallant master whom we knew most loved of all breathe not a whisper of his pride he on the gloomy scaffold died ignoble fall the countless treasures of his care his villages and villas fair his mighty power what were they all but grief and shame tears and a broken heart when came the parting hour his other brothers proud and high masters who in prosperity might rival kings who made the bravest and the best the bondsmen of their high behest their underlings what was their prosperous estate when high exalted and elate with power and pride what but a transient gleam of light a flame which glaring at its height grew dim and died so many a duke of royal name marquis and count of spotless fame and baron brave that might the sword of empire wield all these o death hast thou concealed in the dark grave their deeds of mercy and of arms in peaceful days or wars alarms when thou dost show o death thy stern and angry face one stroke of thy allpowerful mace can overthrow unnumbered hosts that threaten nigh pennon and standard flaunting high and flag displayed high battlements intrenched around bastion and moated wall and mound and palisade and covered trench secure and deep all these cannot one victim keep o death from thee when thou dost battle in thy wrath and thy strong shafts pursue their path unerringly o world so few the years we live would that the life which thou dost give were life indeed alas thy sorrows fall so fast our happiest hour is when at last the soul is freed our days are covered oer with grief and sorrows neither few nor brief veil all in gloom left desolate of real good within this cheerless solitude no pleasures bloom thy pilgrimage begins in tears and ends in bitter doubts and fears or dark despair midway so many toils appear that he who lingers longest here knows most of care thy goods are bought with many a groan by the hot sweat of toil alone and weary hearts fleetfooted is the approach of woe but with a lingering step and slow its form departs and he the good mans shield and shade to whom all hearts their homage paid as virtues son roderic manrique he whose name is written on the scroll of fame spains champion his signal deeds and prowess high demand no pompous eulogy ye saw his deeds why should their praise in verse be sung the name that dwells on every tongue no minstrel needs to friends a friend how kind to all the vassals of this ancient hall and feudal fief to foes how stern a foe was he and to the valiant and the free how brave a chief what prudence with the old and wise what grace in youthful gayeties in all how sage benignant to the serf and slave he showed the base and falsely brave a lions rage his was octavians prosperous star the rush of caesars conquering car at battles call his scipios virtue his the skill and the indomitable will of hannibal his was a trajans goodness his a titus noble charities and righteous laws the arm of hector and the might of tully to maintain the right in truths just cause the clemency of antonine aurelius countenance divine firm gentle still the eloquence of adrian and theodosius love to man and generous will in tented field and bloody fray an alexanders vigorous sway and stern command the faith of constantine ay more the fervent love camillus bore his native land he left no wellfilled treasury he heaped no pile of riches high nor massive plate he fought the moors and in their fall city and tower and castled wall were his estate upon the hardfought battleground brave steeds and gallant riders found a common grave and there the warriors hand did gain the rents and the long vassal train that conquest gave and if of old his halls displayed the honored and exalted grade his worth had gained so in the dark disastrous hour brothers and bondsmen of his power his hand sustained after high deeds not left untold in the stern warfare which of old t was his to share such noble leagues he made that more and fairer regions than before his guerdon were these are the records half effaced which with the hand of youth he traced on historys page but with fresh victories he drew each fading character anew in his old age by his unrivalled skill by great and veteran service to the state by worth adored he stood in his high dignity the proudest knight of chivalry knight of the sword he found his cities and domains beneath a tyrants galling chains and cruel power but by fierce battle and blockade soon his own banner was displayed from every tower by the tried valor of his hand his monarch and his native land were nobly served let portugal repeat the story and proud castile who shared the glory his arms deserved and when so oft for weal or woe his life upon the fatal throw had been cast down when he had served with patriot zeal beneath the banner of castile his sovereigns crown and done such deeds of valor strong that neither history nor song can count them all then on ocanas castled rock death at his portal came to knock with sudden call saying good cavalier prepare to leave this world of toil and care with joyful mien let thy strong heart of steel this day put on its armor for the fray the closing scene since thou hast been in battlestrife so prodigal of health and life for earthly fame let virtue nerve thy heart again loud on the last stern battleplain they call thy name think not the struggle that draws near too terrible for man nor fear to meet the foe nor let thy noble spirit grieve its life of glorious fame to leave on earth below a life of honor and of worth has no eternity on earth t is but a name and yet its glory far exceeds that base and sensual life which leads to want and shame the eternal life beyond the sky wealth cannot purchase nor the high and proud estate the soul in dalliance laid the spirit corrupt with sin shall not inherit a joy so great but the good monk in cloistered cell shall gain it by his book and bell his prayers and tears and the brave knight whose arm endures fierce battle and against the moors his standard rears and thou brave knight whose hand has poured the lifeblood of the pagan horde oer all the land in heaven shalt thou receive at length the guerdon of thine earthly strength and dauntless hand cheered onward by this promise sure strong in the faith entire and pure thou dost profess depart thy hope is certainty the third the better life on high shalt thou possess o death no more no more delay my spirit longs to flee away and be at rest the will of heaven my will shall be i bow to the divine decree to gods behest my soul is ready to depart no thought rebels the obedient heart breathes forth no sigh the wish on earth to linger still were vain when t is gods sovereign will that we shall die o thou that for our sins didst take a human form and humbly make thy home on earth thou that to thy divinity a human nature didst ally by mortal birth and in that form didst suffer here torment and agony and fear so patiently by thy redeeming grace alone and not for merits of my own o pardon me as thus the dying warrior prayed without one gathering mist or shade upon his mind encircled by his family watched by affections gentle eye so soft and kind his soul to him who gave it rose god lead it to its long repose its glorious rest and though the warriors sun has set its light shall linger round us yet bright radiant blest sonnets i the good shepherd el buen pastor by lope de vega shepherd who with

thy smooth round pebbles count how without malice murmuring glides thy current o sweet simplicity of days gone by thou shunst the haunts of man to dwell in limpid fount ancient spanish ballads in the chapter with this title in outremer besides illustrations from byron and lockhart are the three following examples contributed by mr longfellow i rio verde rio verde many a corpse is bathed in thee both of moors and eke of christians slain with swords most cruelly and thy pure and crystal waters dappled are with crimson gore for between the moors and christians long has been the fight and sore dukes and counts fell bleeding near thee lords of high renown were slain perished many a brave hidalgo of the noblemen of spain ii king alfonso the eighth having exhausted his treasury in war wishes to lay a tax of five farthings upon each of the castillan hidalgos in order to defray the expenses of a journey from burgos to cuenca this proposition of the king was met with disdain by the noblemen who had been assembled on the occasion don nuno count of lara in anger and in pride forgot all reverence for the king and thus in wrath replied our noble ancestors quoth he neer such a tribute paid nor shall the king receive of us what they have once gainsaid the baseborn soul who deems it just may here with thee remain but follow me ye cavaliers ye noblemen of spain forth followed they the noble count they marched to gleras plain out of three thousand gallant knights did only three remain they tied the tribute to their spears they raised it in the air and they sent to tell their lord the king that his tax was ready there he may send and take by force said they this paltry sum of gold but the goodly gift of liberty cannot be bought and sold iii one of the finest of the historic ballads is that which describes bernardos march to roncesvalles he sallies forth with three thousand leonese and more to protect the glory and freedom of his native land from all sides the peasantry of the land flock to the heros standard the peasant leaves his plough afield the reaper leaves his hook and from his hand the shepherdboy lets fall the pastoral crook the young set up a shout of joy the old forget their years the feeble man grows stout of heart no more the craven fears all rush to bernards standard and on liberty they call they cannot brook to wear the yoke when threatened by the gaul free were we born t is thus they cry and willingly pay we the duty that we owe our king by the divine decree but god forbid that we obey the laws of foreign knaves tarnish the glory of our sires and make our children slaves our hearts have not so craven grown so bloodless all our veins so vigorless our brawny arms as to submit to chains has the audacious frank forsooth subdued these seas and lands shall he a bloodless victory have no not while we have hands he shall learn that the gallant leonese can bravely fight and fall but that they know not how to yield they are castilians all was it for this the roman power of old was made to yield unto numantias valiant hosts on many a bloody field shall the bold lions that have bathed their paws in libyan gore crouch basely to a feebler foe and dare the strife no more let the false king sell town and tower but not his vassals free for to subdue the freeborn soul no royal power hath he vida de san millan by gonzalo de berceo and when the kings were in the field their squadrons in array with lance in rest they onward pressed to mingle in the fray but soon upon the christians fell a terror of their foes these were a numerous army a little handful those and while the christian people stood in this uncertainty upward to heaven they turned their eyes and fixed their thoughts on high and there two figures they beheld all beautiful and bright even than the pure newfallen snow their garments were more white they rode upon two horses more white than crystal sheen and arms they bore such as before no mortal man had seen the one he held a crosier a pontiffs mitre wore the other held a crucifix such man neer saw before their faces were angelical celestial forms had they and downward through the fields of air they urged their rapid way they looked upon the moorish host with fierce and angry look and in their hands with dire portent their naked sabres shook the christian host beholding this straightway take heart again they fall upon their bended knees all resting on the plain and each one with his clenched fist to smite his breast begins and promises to god on high he will forsake his sins and when the heavenly knights drew near unto the battleground they dashed among the moors and dealt unerring blows around such deadly havoc there they made the foremost ranks along a panic terror spread unto the hindmost of the throng together with these two good knights the champions of the sky the christians rallied and began to smite full sore and high the moors raised up their voices and by the koran swore that in their lives such deadly fray they neer had seen before down went the misbelievers fast sped the bloody fight some ghastly and dismembered lay and some half dead with fright full sorely they repented that to the field they came for they saw that from the battle they should retreat with shame another thing befell them they dreamed not of such woes the very arrows that the moors shot front their twanging bows turned back against them in their flight and wounded them full sore and every blow they dealt the foe was paid in drops of gore now he that bore the crosier and the papal crown had on was the

pentecost day of rejoicing had come the church of the village gleaming stood in the mornings sheen on the spire of the bell decked with a brazen cock the friendly flames of the springsun glanced like the tongues of fire beheld by apostles aforetime clear was the heaven and blue and may with her cap crowned with roses stood in her holiday dress in the fields and the wind and the brooklet murmured gladness and peace godspeace with lips rosytinted whispered the race of the flowers and merry on balancing branches birds were singing their carol a jubilant hymn to the highest swept and clean was the churchyard adorned like a leafwoven arbor stood its oldfashioned gate and within upon each cross of iron hung was a fragrant garland new twined by the hands of affection even the dial that stood on a mound among the departed there full a hundred years had it stood was embellished with blossoms like to the patriarch hoary the sage of his kith and the hamlet who on his birthday is crowned by children and childrens children so stood the ancient prophet and mute with his pencil of iron marked on the tablet of stone and measured the time and its changes while all around at his feet an eternity slumbered in quiet also the church within was adorned for this was the season when the young their parents hope and the lovedones of heaven should at the foot of the altar renew the vows of their baptism therefore each nook and corner was swept and cleaned and the dust was blown from the walls and ceiling and from the oilpainted benches there stood the church like a garden the feast of the leafy pavilions saw we in living presentment from noble arms on the church wall grew forth a cluster of leaves and the preachers pulpit of oakwood budded once more anew as aforetime the rod before aaron wreathed thereon was the bible with leaves and the dove washed with silver under its canopy fastened had on it a necklace of windflowers but in front of the choir round the altarpiece painted by horberg crept a garland gigantic and brightcurling tresses of angels peeped like the sun from a cloud from out of the shadowy leafwork likewise the lustre of brass newpolished blinked from the ceiling and for lights there were lilies of pentecost set in the sockets loud rang the bells already the thronging crowd was assembled far from valleys and hills to list to the holy preaching hark then roll forth at once the mighty tones of the organ hover like voices from god aloft like invisible spirits like as elias in heaven when he cast from off him his mantle so cast off the soul its garments of earth and with one voice chimed in the congregation and sang an anthem immortal of the sublime wallin of davids harp in the northland tuned to the choral of luther the song on its mighty pinions took every living soul and lifted it gently to heaven and each face did shine like the holy ones face upon tabor lo there entered then into the church the reverend teacher father he hight and he was in the parish a christianly plainness clothed from his head to his feet the old man of seventy winters friendly was he to behold and glad as the heralding angel walked he among the crowds but still a contemplative grandeur lay on his forehead as clear as on mosscovered gravestone a sunbeam as in his inspiration an evening twilight that faintly gleams in the human soul even now from the day of creation th artist the friend of heaven imagines saint john when in patmos gray with his eyes uplifted to heaven so seemed then the old man such was the glance of his eye and such were his tresses of silver all the congregation arose in the pews that were numbered but with a cordial look to the right and the left hand the old man nodding all hail and peace disappeared in the innermost chancel simply and solemnly now proceeded the christian service singing and prayer and at last an ardent discourse from the old man many a moving word and warning that out of the heart came fell like the dew of the morning like manna on those in the desert then when all was finished the teacher reentered the chancel followed therein by the young the boys on the right had their places delicate figures with closecurling hair and cheeks rosyblooming but on the left of these there stood the tremulous lilies tinged with the blushing light of the dawn the diffident maidens folding their hands in prayer and their eyes cast down on the pavement now came with question and answer the catechism in the beginning answered the children with troubled and faltering voice but the old mans glances of kindness encouraged them soon and the doctrines eternal flowed like the waters of fountains so clear from lips unpolluted each time the answer was closed and as oft as they named the redeemer lowly louted the boys and lowly the maidens all courtesied friendly the teacher stood like an angel of light there among them and to the children explained the holy the highest in few words thorough yet simple and clear for sublimity always is simple both in sermon and song a child can seize on its meaning een as the greengrowing bud unfolds when springtide approaches leaf by leaf puts forth and wanued by the radiant sunshine blushes with purple and gold till at last the perfected blossom opens its odorous chalice and rocks with its crown in the breezes so was unfolded here the christian lore of salvation line by line from the soul of childhood the fathers and mothers stood behind them in tears and were glad at the wellworded answer now went the old man up to the altar and straightway transfigured so did it seem unto me was then the affectionate teacher like the lords prophet sublime and awful as death and as judgment stood he the godcommissioned the soulsearcher earthward descending glances sharp as a sword into hearts that to him were transparent shot he his voice was deep was low like the thunder afar off so on a sudden transfigured he stood there lie spake and he questioned this is the faith of the fathers the faith the apostles delivered this is moreover the faith whereunto i baptized you while still ye lay on your mothers breasts and nearer the portals of heaven slumbering received you then the holy church in its bosom wakened from sleep are ye now and the light in its radiant splendor downward rains from the heaven today on the threshold of childhood kindly she frees you again to examine and make your election for she knows naught of compulsion and only conviction desireth this is the hour of your trial the turningpoint of existence seed for the coming days without revocation departeth now from your lips the confession bethink ye before ye make answer think not o think not with guile to deceive the questioning teacher sharp is his eye today and a curse ever rests upon falsehood enter not with a lie on lifes journey the multitude hears you brothers and sisters and parents what dear upon earth is and holy standeth before your sight as a witness the judge everlasting looks from the sun down upon you and angels in waiting beside him grave your confession in letters of fire upon tablets eternal thus then believe ye in god in the father who this world created him who redeemed it the son and the spirit where both are united will ye promise me here a holy promise to cherish god more than all things earthly and every man as a brother will ye promise me here to confirm your faith by your living th heavenly faith of affection to hope to forgive and to suffer be what it may your condition and walk before god in uprightness will ye promise me this before god and man with a clear voice answered the young men yes and yes with lips softlybreathing answered the maidens eke then dissolved from the brow of the teacher clouds with the lightnings therein and lie spake in accents more gentle soft as the evenings breath as harps by babylons rivers hail then hail to you all to the heirdom of heaven be ye welcome children no more from this day but by covenant brothers and sisters yet for what reason not children of such is the kingdom of heaven here upon earth an assemblage of children in heaven one father ruling them all as his household forgiving in turn and chastising that is of human life a picture as scripture has taught us blest are the pure before god upon purity and upon virtue resteth the christian faith she herself from on high is descended strong as a man and pure as a child is the sum of the doctrine which the divine one taught and suffered and died on the cross for oh as ye wander this day from childhoods sacred asylum downward and ever downward and deeper in ages chill valley oh how soon will ye come too soon and long to turn backward up to its hilltops again to the sunillumined where judgment stood like a father before you and pardon clad like a mother gave you her hand to kiss and the loving heart was for given life was a play and your hands grasped after the roses of heaven seventy years have i lived already the father eternal gave rue gladness and care but the loveliest hours of existence when i have steadfastly gazed in their eyes i have instantly known them known them all again the were my childhoods acquaintance therefore take from henceforth as guides in the paths of existence prayer with her eyes raised to heaven and innocence bride of mans childhood innocence child beloved is a guest from the world of the blessed beautiful and in her hand a lily on lifes roaring billows swings she in safety she heedeth them not in the ship she is sleeping calmly she gazes around in the turmoil of men in the desert angels descend and minister unto her she herself knoweth naught of her glorious attendance but follows faithful and humble follows so long as she may her friend oh do not reject her for she cometh from god and she holdeth the keys of the heavens prayer is innocence friend and willingly flieth incessant twixt rhe earth and the sky the carrierpigeon of heaven son of eternity fettered in time and an exile the spirit tugs at his chains evermore and struggles like flame ever upward still he recalls with emotion his fathers manifold mansions thinks of the land of his fathers where blossomed more freshly the flowerets shone a more beautiful sun and he played with the wingm angels then grows the earth too narrow too close and homesick for heaven longs the wanderer again and the spirits longings are worship worship is called his most beautiful hour and its tongue is entreaty aid when the infinite burden of life descendeth upon us crushes to earth our hope and under the earth in the graveyard then it is good to pray unto god for his sorrowiug children turns he neer from his door but he heals and helps and consoles them yet is it better to pray when all things are prosperous ti ith us pray in fortunate days for lifes most beautiful fortune kneels before the eternals throne and with hands interfolded praises thankful and moved the only giver of blessings or do ye know ye children one blessing that comes not from heaven what has mankind forsooth the poor that it has not received therefore fall in the dust and pray the seraphs adoring cover with pinions six their face in the glory of him who hung his masonry pendent on naught when the world be created earth declareth his might and the firmament utters his glory races blossom and die and stars fall downward from heaven downward like withered leaves at the last stroke of midnight millenniums lay themselves down at his feet and he sees them but counts them as nothing who shall stand in his presence the wrath of the judge is terrific casting the insolent down at a glance when he speaks in his anger hillocks skip like the kid and mountains leap like the roebuck yet why are ye afraid ye children this awful avenger ah is a merciful god gods voice was not in the earthquake not in the fire nor the storm but it was in the whispering breezes love is the root of creation gods essence worlds without number lie in his bosom like children he made them for this purpose only only to love and to be loved again he breathed forth his spirit into the slumbering dust and upright standing it laid its hand on its heart and felt it was warm with a flame out of heaven quench oh quench not that flame it is the breath of your being love is life but hatred is death not father nor mother loved you as god has loved you for t was that you may be happy gave he his only son when he bowed down his head in the deathhour solemnized love its triumph the sacrifice then was completed lo then was rent on a sudden the veil of the temple dividing earth and heaven apart and the dead from their sepulchres rising whispered with pallid lips and low in the ears of each other th answer but dreamed of before to creations enigma atonement depths of love are atonements depths for love is atonement therefore child of mortality love thou the merciful father wish what the holy one wishes and not from fear but affection fear is the virtue of slaves but the heart that loveth is willing perfect was before god and perfect is love and love only lovest thou god as thou oughtest then lovest thou likewise thy brethren one is the sun in heaven and one only one is love also bears not each human figure the godlike stamp on his forehead readest thou not in his face thou origin is he not sailing lost like thyself on an ocean unknown and is he not guided by the same stars that guide thee why shouldst thou hate then thy brother hateth he thee forgive for t is sweet to stammer one letter of the eternals language on earth it is called forgiveness knowest thou him who forgave with the crown of thorns on his temples earnestly prayed for his foes for his murderers say dost thou know him ah thou confessest his name so follow likewise his example think of thy brother no ill but throw a veil over his failings guide the erring aright for the good the heavenly shepherd took the lost lamb in his arms and bore it back to its mother this is the fruit of love and it is by its fruits that we know it love is the creatures welfare with god but love among mortals is but an endless sigh he longs and endures and stands waiting suffers and yet rejoices and smiles with tears on his eyelids hope so is called upon earth his recompense hope the befriending does what she can for she points evermore up to heaven and faithful plunges her anchors peak in the depths of the grave and beneath it paints a more beautiful world a dim but a sweet play of shadows races better than we have leaned on her wavering promise having naught else but hope then praise we our father in heaven him who has given us more for to us has hope been transfigured groping no longer in night she is faith she is living assurance faith is enlightened hope she is light is the eye of affection dreams of the longing interprets and carves their visions in marble faith is the sun of life and her countenance shines like the hebrews for she has looked upon god the heaven on its stable foundation draws she with chains down to earth and the new jerusalem sinketh splendid with portals twelve in golden vapors descending there enraptured she wanders and looks at the figures majestic fears not the winged crowd in the midst of them all is her homestead therefore love and believe for works will follow spontaneous even as day does the sun the right from the good is an offspring love in a bodily shape and christian works are no more than animate love and faith as flowers are the animate springtide works do follow us all unto god there stand and bear witness not what they seemed but what they were only blessed is he who hears their confession secure they are mute upon earth until deaths hand opens the mouth of the silent ye children does death eer alarm you death is the brother of love twinbrother is he and is only more austere to behold with a kiss upon lips that are fading takes he the soul and departs and rocked in the arms of affection places the ransomed child new born fore the face of its father sounds of his coming already i hear see dimly his pinions swart as the night but with stars strewn upon them i fear not before him death is only release and in mercy is mute on his bosom freer breathes in its coolness my breast and face to face standing look i on god as he is a sun unpolluted by vapors look on the light of the ages i loved the spirits majestic nobler better than i they stand by the throne all transfigured vested in white and with harps of gold and are singing an anthem writ in the climate of heaven in the language spoken by angels you in like manner ye children beloved he one day shall gather never forgets he the weary then welcome ye loved ones hereafter meanwhile forget not the keeping of vows forget not the promise wander from holiness onward to holiness earth shall ye heed not earth is but dust and heaven is light i have pledged you to heaven god of the universe hear me thou fountain of love everlasting hark to the voice of thy servant i send up my prayer to thy heaven let me hereafter not miss at thy throne one spirit of all these whom thou hast given me here i have loved them all like a father may they bear witness for me that i taught them the way of salvation faithful so far as i knew of thy word again may they know me fall on their teachers breast and before thy face may i place them pure as they now are but only more tried and exclaiming with gladness father lo i am here and the children whom thou hast given me weeping he spake in these words and now at the beck of the old man knee against knee they knitted a wreath round the altars enclosure kneeling he read then the prayers of the consecration and softly with him the children read at the close with tremulous accents asked he the peace of heaven a benediction upon them now should have ended his task for the day the following sunday was for the young appointed to eat of the lords holy supper sudden as struck from the clouds stood the teacher silent and laid his hand on his forehead and cast his looks upward while thoughts high and holy flew through the midst of his soul and his eyes glanced with wonderful brightness on the next sunday who knows perhaps i shall rest in the graveyard some one perhaps of yourselves a lily broken untimely bow down his head to the earth why delay i the hour is accomplished warm is the heart i will for today grows the harvest of heaven what i began accomplish i now what failing therein is i the old man will answer to god and the reverend father say to me only ye children ye denizens newcome in heaven are ye ready this day to eat of the bread of atonement what it denoteth that know ye full well i have told it you often of the new covenant symbol it is of atonement a token stablished between earth and heaven man by his sins and transgressions far has wandered from god from his essence t was in the beginning fast by the tree of knowledge he fell and it hangs its crown oer the fall to this day in the thought is the fall in the heart the atonement infinite is the fall the atonement infinite likewise see behind me as far as the old man remembers and forward far as hope in her flight can reach with her wearied pinions sin and atonement incessant go through the lifetime of mortals sin is brought forth fullgrown but atonement sleeps in our bosoms still as the cradled babe and dreams of heaven and of angels cannot awake to sensation is like the tones in the harps strings spirits imprisoned that wait evermore the deliverers finger therefore ye children beloved descended the prince of atonement woke the slumberer from sleep and she stands now with eyes all resplendent bright as the vault of the sky and battles with sin and oercomes her downward to earth he came and transfigured thence reascended not from the heart in like wise for there he still lives in the spirit loves and atones evermore so long as time is is atonement therefore with reverence take this day her visible token tokens are dead if the things live not the light everlasting unto the blind is not but is born of the eye that has vision neither in bread nor in wine but in the heart that is hallowed lieth forgiveness enshrined the intention alone of amendment fruits of the earth ennobles to heavenly things and removes all sin and the guerdon of sin only love with his arms wide extended penitence wee ping and praying the will that is tried and whose gold flows purified forth from the flames in a word mankind by atonement breaketh atonements bread and drinketh atonements winecup but he who cometh up hither unworthy with hate in his bosom scoffing at men and at god is guilty of christs blessed body and the redeemers blood to himself he eateth and drinketh death and doom and from this preserve us thou heavenly father are ye ready ye children to eat of the bread of atonement thus with emotion he asked and together answered the children yes with deep sobs interrupted then read he the due supplications read the form of communion and in chimed the organ and anthem o holy lamb of god who takest away our transgressions hear us give us thy peace have mercy have mercy upon us th old man with trembling hand and heavenly pearls on his eyelids filled now the chalice and paten and dealt round the mystical symbols oh then seemed it to me as if god with the broad eye of midday clearer looked in at the windows and all the trees in the church yard bowed down their summits of green and the grass on the graves gan to shiver but in the children i noted it well i knew it there ran a tremor of holy rapture along through their icecold members decked like an altar before them there stood the green earth and above it heaven opened itself as of old before stephen they saw there radiant in glory the father and on his right hand the redeemer under them hear they the clang of harpstrings and angels from gold clouds beckon to them like brothers and fan with their pinions of purple closed was the teachers task and with heaven in their hearts and their faces up rose the children all and each bowed him weeping full sorely downward to kiss that reverend hand but all of them pressed he moved to his bosom and laid with a prayer his hands full of blessings now on the holy breast and now on the innocent tresses king christian a national song of denmark king christian stood by the lofty mast in mist and smoke his sword was hammering so fast through gothic helm and brain it passed then sank each hostile hulk and mast in mist

sorrows till death childhood by jens immanuel baggesen there was a time when i was very small when my whole frame was but an ell in height sweetly as i recall it tears do fall and therefore i recall it with delight i sported in my tender mothers arms and rode ahorseback on best fathers knee alike were sorrows passions and alarms and gold and greek and love unknown to me then seemed to me this world far less in size likewise it seemed to me less wicked far like points in heaven i saw the stars arise and longed for wings that i might catch a star i saw the moon behind the island fade and thought oh were i on that island there i could find out of what the moon is made find out how large it is how round how fair wondering i saw gods sun through western skies sink in the oceans golden lap at night and yet upon the morrow early rise and paint the eastern heaven with crimson light and thought of god the gracious heavenly father who made me and that lovely sun on high and all those pearls of heaven thickstrung together dropped clustering from his hand oer all the sky with childish reverence my young lips did say the prayer my pious mother taught to me o gentle god oh let me strive alway still to be wise and good and follow thee so prayed i for my father and my mother and for my sister and for all the town the king i knew not and the beggarbrother who bent with age went sighing up and down they perished the blithe days of boyhood perished and all the gladness all the peace i knew now have i but their memory fondly cherished god may i never lose that too from the

greatest kingdom upon earth cannot with that compare with all the stout and hardy men and the nutbrown maidens there ha cried a saxon laughing and dashed his heard with wine i had rather live in laplaud than that swabian land of thine the goodliest land on all this earth it is the saxon land there have i as many maidens as fingers on this hand hold your tongues both swabian and saxon a bold bohemian cries if theres a heaven upon this earth in bohemia it lies there the tailor blows the flute and the cobbler blows the horn and the miner blows the bugle over mountain gorge and bourn and then the landlords daughter up to heaven raised her hand and said ye may no more contend there lies the happiest land the wave by christoph august tiedge whither thou turbid wave whither with so much

his wounds all bleeding fresh and free and then his cheek more ghastly grew and wan and a faint shudder through his members ran upon the battlefield his knee was bent brave roland saw and to his succor went straightway his helmet from his brow unlaced and tore the shining hauberk from his breast then raising in his arms the man of god gently he laid him on the verdant sod rest sire he cried for rest thy suffering needs the priest replied think but of warlike deeds the field is ours well may we boast this strife but death steals on there is no hope of life in paradise where almoners live again there are our couches spread there shall we rest from pain sore roland grieved nor marvel i alas that thrice he swooned upon the thick green grass when he revived with a loud voice cried he o heavenly father holy saint marie why lingers death to lay me in my grave beloved france how have the good and brave been torn from thee and left thee weak and poor then thoughts of aude his ladylove came oer his spirit and he whispered soft and slow my gentle friend what parting full of woe never so true a liegeman shalt thou see whateer my fate christs benison on thee christ who did save from realms of woe beneath the hebrew prophets from the second death then to the paladins whom well he knew he went and one by one unaided drew to turpins side well skilled in ghostly lore no heart had he

rehearse this little tragedy aright let me attempt it with an english quill and take o reader for the deed the will i at the foot of the mountain height where is perched castel cuille when the apple the plum and the almond tree in the plain below were growing white this is the song one might perceive on a wednesday morn of saint josephs eve the roads should blossom the roads should bloom so fair a bride shall leave her home should blossom and bloom with garlands gay so fair a bride shall pass today this old te deum rustic rites attending seemed from the clouds descending when lo a merry company of rosy village girls clean as the eye each one with her attendant swain came to the cliff all singing the same strain resembling there so near unto the sky rejoicing angels that kind heaven has sent for their delight and our encouragement together blending and soon descending the narrow sweep of the hillside steep they wind aslant towards saint amant through leafy alleys of verdurous valleys with merry sallies singing their chant the roads should blossom the roads should bloom so fair a bride shall leave her home should blossom and bloom with garlands gay so fair a bride shall pass today it is baptiste and his affianced maiden with garlands for the bridal laden the sky was blue without one cloud of gloom the sun of march was shining brightly and to the air the freshening wind gave lightly its breathings of perfume when one beholds the dusky hedges blossom a rustic bridal oh how sweet it is to sounds of joyous melodies that touch with tenderness the trembling bosom a band of maidens gayly frolicking a band of youngsters wildly rollicking kissing caressing with fingers pressing till in the veriest madness of mirth as they dance they retreat and advance trying whose laugh shall be loudest and merriest while the bride with roguish eyes sporting with them now escapes and cries those who catch me married verily this year shall be and all pursue with eager haste and all attain what they pursue and touch her pretty apron fresh and new and the linen kirtle round her waist meanwhile whence comes it that among these youthful maidens fresh and fair so joyous with such laughing air baptiste stands sighing with silent tongue and yet the bride is fair and young is it saint joseph would say to us all that love oerhasty precedeth a fall o no for a maiden frail i trow never bore so lofty a brow what lovers they give not a single caress to see them so careless and cold today these are grand people one would say what ails baptiste what grief doth him oppress it is that halfway up the hill in yon cottage by whose walls stand the carthouse and the stalls dwelleth the blind orphan still daughter of a veteran old and you must know one year ago that margaret the young and tender was the village pride and splendor and baptiste her lover bold love the deceiver them ensnared for them the altar was prepared but alas the summers blight the dread disease that none can stay the pestilence that walks by night took the young brides sight away all at the fathers stern command was changed their peace was gone but not their love estranged wearied at home erelong the lover fled returned but three short days ago the golden chain they round him throw he is enticed and onward led to marry angela and yet is thinking ever of margaret then suddenly a maiden cried anna theresa mary kate here comes the cripple jane and by a fountains side a woman bent and gray with years under the mulberrytrees appears and all towards her run as fleet as had they wings upon their feet it is that jane the cripple jane is a soothsayer wary and kind she telleth fortunes and none complain she promises one a village swain another a happy weddingday and the bride a lovely boy straightway all comes to pass as she avers she never deceives she never errs but for this once the village seer wears a countenance severe and from beneath her eyebrows thin and white her two eyes flash like cannons bright aimed at the bridegroom in waistcoat blue who like a statue stands in view changing color as well he might when the beldame wrinkled and gray takes the young bride by the hand and with the tip of her reedy wand making the sign of the cross doth say thoughtless angela beware lest when thou weddest this false bridegroom thou diggest for thyself a tomb and she was silent and the maidens fair saw from each eye escape a swollen tear but on a little streamlet silverclear what are two drops of turbid rain saddened a moment the bridal train resumed the dance and song again the bridegroom only was pale with fear and down green alleys of verdurous valleys with merry sallies they sang the refrain the roads should blossom the roads should bloom so fair a bride shall leave her home should blossom and bloom with garlands gay so fair a bride shall pass today ii and by suffering worn and weary but beautiful as some fair angel yet thus lamented margaret in her cottage lone and dreary he has arrived arrived at last yet jane has named him not these three days past arrived yet keeps aloof so far and knows that of my night he is the star knows that long months i wait alone benighted and count the moments since he went away come keep the promise of that happier day that i may keep the faith to thee i plighted what joy have i without thee what delight grief wastes my life and makes it misery day for the others ever but for me forever night forever night when he is gone t is dark my soul is sad i suffer o my god come make me glad when he is near no thoughts of day intrude day has blue heavens but baptiste has blue eyes within them shines for me a heaven of love a heaven all happiness like that above no more of grief no more of lassitude earth i forget and heaven and all distresses when seated by my side my hand he presses but when alone remember all where is baptiste he hears not when i call a branch of ivy dying on the ground i need some bough to twine around in pity come be to my suffering kind true love they say in grief doth more abound what then when one is blind who knows perhaps i am forsaken ah woe is me then bear me to my grave o god what thoughts within me waken away he will return i do but rave he will return i need not fear he swore it by our saviour dear he could not come at his own will is weary or perhaps is ill perhaps his heart in this disguise prepares for me some sweet surprise but some one comes though blind my heart can see and that deceives me not t is he t is he and the door ajar is set and poor confiding margaret rises with outstretched arms but sightless eyes t is only paul her brother who thus cries angela the bride has passed i saw the wedding guests go by tell me my sister why were we not asked for all are there but you and i angela married and not send to tell her secret unto me o speak who may the bridegroom be my sister t is baptiste thy friend a cry the blind girl gave but nothing said a milky whiteness spreads upon her cheeks an icy hand as heavy as lead descending as her brother speaks upon her heart that has ceased to beat suspends awhile its life and heat she stands beside the boy now sore distressed a wax madonna as a peasant dressed at length the bridal song again brings her back to her sorrow and pain hark the joyous airs are ringing sister dost thou hear them singing how merrily they laugh and jest would we were bidden with the rest i would don my hose of homespun gray and my doublet of linen striped and gay perhaps they will come for they do not wed till tomorrow at seven oclock it is said i know it answered margaret whom the vision with aspect black as jet mastered again and its hand of ice held her heart crushed as in a vice paul be not sad t is a holiday tomorrow put on thy doublet gay but leave me now for a while alone away with a hop and a jump went paul and as he whistled along the hall entered jane the crippled crone holy virgin what dreadful heat i am faint and weary and out of breath but thou art cold art chill as death my little friend what ails thee sweet nothing i heard them singing home the bride and as i listened to the song i thought my turn would come erelong thou knowest it is at whitsuntide thy cards forsooth can never lie to me such joy they prophesy thy skill shall be vaunted far and wide when they behold him at my side and poor baptiste what sayest thou it must seem long to him methinks i see him now jane shuddering her hand doth press thy love i cannot all approve we must not trust too much to happiness go pray to god that thou mayst love him less the more i pray the more i love it is no sin for god is on my side it was enough and jane no more replied now to all hope her heart is barred and cold but to deceive the beldame old she takes a sweet contented air speak of foul weather or of fair at every word the maiden smiles thus the beguiler she beguiles so that departing at the evenings close she says she may be saved she nothing knows poor jane the cunning sorceress now that thou wouldst thou art no prophetess this morning in the fulness of thy heart thou wast so far beyond thine art iii now rings the bell nine times reverberating and the white daybreak stealing up the sky sees in two cottages two maidens waiting how differently queen of a day by flatterers caressed the one puts on her cross and crown decks with a huge bouquet her breast and flaunting fluttering up and down looks at herself and cannot rest the other blind within her little room has neither crown nor flowers perfume but in their stead for something gropes apart that in a drawers recess doth lie and neath her bodice of bright scarlet dye convulsive clasps it to her heart the one fantastic light as air mid kisses ringing and joyous singing forgets to say her morning prayer the other with cold drops upon her brow joins her two hands and kneels upon the floor and whispers as her brother opes the door o god forgive me now and then the orphan young and blind conducted by her brothers hand towards the church through paths unscanned with tranquil air her way doth wind odors of laurel making her faint and pale round her at times exhale and in the sky as yet no sunny ray but brumal vapors gray near that castle fair to see crowded with sculptures old in every part marvels of nature and of art and proud of its name of high degree a little chapel almost bare at the base of the rock is builded there all glorious that it lifts aloof above each jealous cottage roof its sacred summit swept by autumn gales and its blackened steeple high in air round which the osprey screams and sails paul lay thy noisy rattle by thus margaret said where are we we ascend yes seest thou not our journeys end hearest not the osprey from the belfry cry the hideous bird that brings ill luck we know dost thou remember when our father said the night we watched beside his bed o daughter i am weak and low take care of paul i feel that i am dying and thou and he and i all fell to crying then on the roof the osprey screamed aloud and here they brought our father in his shroud there is his grave there stands the cross we set why dost thou clasp me so dear margaret come in the bride will be here soon thou tremblest o my god thou art going to swoon she could no more the blind girl weak and weary a voice seemed crying from that grave so dreary what wouldst thou do my daughter and she started and quick recoiled aghast fainthearted but paul impatient urges evermore her steps towards the open door and when beneath her feet the unhappy maid crushes the laurel near the house immortal and with her head as paul talks on again touches the crown of filigrane suspended from the lowarched portal no more restrained no more afraid she walks as for a feast arrayed and in the ancient chapels sombre night they both are lost to sight at length the bell with booming sound sends forth resounding round its hymeneal peal oer rock and down the dell it is broad day with sunshine and with rain and yet the guests delay not long for soon arrives the bridal train and with it brings the village throng in sooth deceit maketh no mortal gay for lo baptiste on this triumphant day mute as an idiot sad as yestermorning thinks only of the beldames words of warning and angela thinks of her cross i wis to be a bride is all the pretty lisper feels her heart swell to hear all round her whisper how beautiful how beautiful she is but she must calm that giddy head for already the mass is said at the holy table stands the priest the wedding ring is blessed baptiste receives it ere on the finger of the bride he leaves it he must pronounce one word at least t is spoken and sudden at the groomsmans side t is he a wellknown voice has cried and while the wedding guests all hold their breath opes the confessional and the blind girl see baptiste she said since thou hast wished my death as holy water be my blood for thee and calmly in the air a knife suspended doubtless her guardian angel near attended for anguish did its work so well that ere the fatal stroke descended lifeless she fell at eve instead of bridal verse the de profundis filled the air decked with flowers a simple hearse to the churchyard forth they bear village girls in robes of snow follow weeping as they go nowhere was a smile that day no ah no for each one seemed to say the road should mourn and be veiled in gloom so fair a corpse shall leave its home should mourn and should weep ah wellaway so fair a corpse shall pass today a christmas carol from the noei bourguignon de

gentleman of aix in provence on the death of his daughter by francoise malherbe will then duperrier thy sorrow be eternal and shall the sad discourse whispered within thy heart by tenderness paternal only augment its force thy daughters mournful fate into the tomb descending by deaths frequented ways has it become to thee a labyrinth never ending where thy lost reason strays i know the charms that made her youth a benediction nor should i be content as a censorious friend to solace thine affliction by her disparagement but she was of the world which fairest things exposes to fates the most forlorn a rose she too hath lived as long as live the roses the space of one brief morn death has his rigorous laws unparalleled unfeeling all prayers to him are vain cruel he stops his ears and deaf to our appealing he leaves us to complain the poor man in his hut with only thatch for cover unto these laws must bend the sentinel that guards the barriers of the louvre cannot our kings defend to murmur against death in petulant defiance is never for the best to will what god doth will that is the only science that gives us any rest to cardinal richelieu by francois de malherbe thou mighty prince of church and state richelieu until the hour of death whatever road man chooses fate still holds him subject to her breath spun of all silks our days and nights have sorrows woven with delights and of this intermingled shade our various destiny appears even as one sees the course of years of summers and of winters made sometimes the soft deceitful hours let us enjoy the halcyon wave sometimes impending peril lowers beyond the seamans skill to save the wisdom infinitely wise that gives to human destinies their foreordained necessity has made no law more fixed below than the

as in the waters of a brook dear child who me resemblest so it whispered come o come with me happy together let us go the earth unworthy is of thee here none to perfect bliss attain the soul in pleasure suffering lies joy hath an undertone of pain and even the happiest hours their sighs fear doth at every portal knock never a day serene and pure from the oershadowing tempests shock hath made the morrows dawn secure what then shall sorrows and shall fears come to disturb so pure a brow and with the bitterness of tears these eyes of azure troubled grow ah no into the fields of space away shalt thou escape with me and providence will grant thee grace of all the days that were to be let no one in thy dwelling cower in sombre vestments draped and veiled but let them welcome thy last hour

tempests here among my seaweeds lie asleep the town says i am filled and fraught with tumult and with smoke and care my days with toil are overwrought and in my nights i gasp for air the highway says my wheeltracks guide to the pale climates of the north where my last milestone stands abide the people to their death gone forth here in the shade this life of ours full of delicious air glides by amid a multitude of flowers as countless as the stars on high these redtiled roofs this fruitful soil bathed with an azure all divine where springs the tree that gives us oil the grape that giveth us the wine beneath these mountains stripped of trees whose tops with flowers are covered oer where springtime of the hesperides begins but endeth nevermore under these leafy vaults and walls that unto gentle sleep persuade this rainbow of the waterfalls of mingled mist and sunshine made upon these shores where all invites we live our languid life apart this air is that of lifes delights the

brooklet all unknown to song hid in the covert of the wood ah yes like thee i fear the throng like thee i love the solitude o brooklet let my sorrows past lie all forgotten in their graves till in my thoughts remain at last only thy peace thy flowers thy waves the lily by thy margin waits the nightingale the marguerite in shadow here he meditates his nest his love his music sweet near thee the selfcollected soul knows naught of error or of crime thy waters murmuring as they roll transform his musings into rhyme ah when on bright autumnal eves pursuing still thy course shall i lisp the soft shudder of the leaves and hear the lapwings plaintive cry barreges by lefranc de pompignan i leave you ye cold mountain chains dwelling of warriors stark and frore you may these eyes behold no more

break pathways through the rocky walls with your terrific waterfalls fatigue no more my weary brain arise ye landscapes full of charms arise ye pictures of delight ye brooks that water in your flight the flowers and harvests of our farms you i perceive ye meadows green where the garonne the lowland fills not far from that long chain of hills with intermingled vales between you wreath of smoke that mounts so high methinks from my own hearth must come with speed to that beloved home fly ye too lazy coursers fly and bear me thither where the soul in quiet may itself possess where all things soothe the minds distress where all things teach me and console will ever the dear days come back again will ever the dear days come back again those days of june when lilacs were in bloom and bluebirds sang their sonnets in the gloom of leaves that roofed them in from sun or rain i know not but a presence will remain forever and forever in this room formless diffused in air like a perfume a phantom of the heart and not the brain delicious days when every spoken word was like a footfall nearer and more near and a mysterious knocking at the gate of the hearts secret places and we heard in the sweet tumult of delight and fear a voice that whispered open i cannot wait at la chaudeau by xavier marmier at la chaudeau t is long since then i was young my years twice ten all things smiled on the happy boy dreams of love and songs of joy azure of heaven and wave below at la chaudeau at la chaudeau i come back old my head is gray my blood is cold seeking along the meadow ooze seeking beside the river seymouse the days of my springtime of long ago at la chaudeau at la chaudeau nor heart nor brain ever grows old with grief and pain a sweet remembrance keeps off age a tender friendship doth still assuage the burden of sorrow that one may know at la chaudeau at la chaudeau had fate decreed to limit the wandering life i lead peradventure i still forsooth should have preserved my fresh green youth under the shadows the hilltops throw at la chaudeau at la chaudeau live on my friends happy to be where god intends and sometimes by the evening fire think of him whose sole desire is again to sit in the old chateau at la chaudeau a quiet life let him who will by force or fraud innate of courtly grandeurs gain the slippery height i leaving not the home of my delight far from the world and noise will meditate then without pomps or perils of the great i shall behold the day succeed the night behold the alternate seasons take their flight and in serene repose old age await and so whenever death shall come to close the happy moments that my days compose i full of years shall die obscure alone how wretched is the man with honors crowned who having not the one thing needful found dies

history and she who was the cause nor knew it nor believed alas i shall have passed close by her unperceived forever at her side and yet forever lonely i shall unto the end have made lifes journey only daring to ask for naught and having naught received for her though god has made her gentle and endearing she will go on her way distraught and without hearing these murmurings of love that round her steps ascend piously faithful still unto her austere duty will say when she shall read these lines full of her beauty who can this woman be and will not comprehend from the italian the celestial pilot purgatorio ii and now behold as at the approach of morning through the gross vapors mars grows fiery red down in the west upon the ocean floor appeared to me may i again behold it a light along the sea so swiftly coming its motion by no flight of wing is equalled and when therefrom i had withdrawn a little mine eyes that i might question my conductor again i saw it brighter grown and larger thereafter on all sides of it appeared i knew not what of white and underneath little by little there came forth another my master yet had uttered not a word while the first whiteness into wings unfolded but when he clearly recognized the pilot he cried aloud quick quick and bow the knee behold the angel of god fold up thy hands henceforward shalt thou see such officers see how he scorns all human arguments so that no oar he wants nor other sail than his own wings between so distant shores see how he holds them pointed straight to heaven fanning the air with the eternal pinions that do not moult themselves like mortal hair and then as nearer and more near us came the bird of heaven more glorious he appeared so that the eye could not sustain his presence but down i cast it and he came to shore with a small vessel gliding swift and light so that the water swallowed naught thereof upon the stern stood the celestial pilot beatitude seemed written in his face and more than a hundred spirits sat within in exitu israel de aegypto thus sang they all together in one voice with whatso in that psalm is after written then made he sign of holy rood upon them whereat all cast themselves upon the shore and he departed swiftly as he came the terrestrial paradise purgatorio xxviii longing already to search in and round the heavenly forest dense and livinggreen which tempered to the eyes the newborn day withouten more delay i left the bank crossing the level country slowly slowly over the soil that everywhere breathed fragrance a gentlybreathing air that no mutation had in itself smote me upon the forehead no heavier blow than of a pleasant breeze whereat the tremulous branches readily did all of them bow downward towards that side where its first shadow casts the holy mountain yet not from their upright direction bent so that the little birds upon their tops should cease the practice of their tuneful art but with fullthroated joy the hours of prime singing received they in the midst of foliage that made monotonous burden to their rhymes even as from branch to branch it gathering swells through the pine forests on the shore of chiassi when aeolus unlooses the sirocco already my slow steps had led me on into the ancient wood so far that i could see no more the place where i had entered and lo my further course cut off a river which towrds the left hand with its little waves bent down the grass that on its margin sprang all waters that on earth most limpid are would seem to have within themselves some mixture compared with that which nothing doth conceal although it moves on with a brown brown current under the shade perpetual that never ray of the sun lets in nor of the moon beatrice purgatorio xxx xxxi even as the blessed at the final summons shall rise up quickened each one from his grave wearing again the garments of the flesh so upon that celestial chariot a hundred rose ad vocem tanti senis ministers and messengers of life eternal they all were saying benedictus qui venis and scattering flowers above and round about manibus o date lilia plenis oft have i seen at the approach of day the orient sky all stained with roseate hues and the other heaven with light serene adorned and the suns face uprising overshadowed so that by temperate influence of vapors the eye sustained his aspect for long while thus in the bosom of a cloud of flowers which from those hands angelic were thrown up and down descended inside and without with crown of olive oer a snowwhite veil appeared a lady under a green mantle vested in colors of the living flame even as the snow among the living rafters upon the back of ltaly congeals blown on and beaten by sclavonian winds and then dissolving filters through itself wheneer the land that loses shadow breathes like as a taper melts before a fire even such i was without a sigh or tear before the song of those who chime forever after the chiming of the eternal spheres but when i heard in those sweet melodies compassion for me more than had they said o wherefore lady dost thou thus consume him the ice that was about my heart congealed to air and water changed and in my anguish through lips and eyes came gushing from my breast confusion and dismay together mingled forced such a feeble yes out of my mouth to understand it one had need of sight even as a crossbow breaks when t is discharged too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow and with less force the arrow hits the mark so i gave way beneath this heavy burden gushing forth into bitter tears and sighs and the voice fainting flagged

hand that follows intellect can achieve the ill i flee the good that i believe in thee fair lady lofty and divine thus hidden lie and so that death be mine art of desired success doth me bereave love is not guilty then nor thy fair face nor fortune cruelty nor great disdain of my disgrace nor chance nor destiny if in thy heart both death and love find place at the same time and if my humble brain burning can nothing draw but death from thee ii fire not without fire can any workman mould the iron to his preconceived design nor can the artist without fire refine and purify from all its dross the gold nor can revive the phoenix we are told except by fire hence if such death be mine i hope to rise again with the divine whom death augments and time cannot make old o sweet sweet death o fortunate fire that burns within me still to renovate my days though i am almost numbered with the dead if by its nature unto heaven returns this element me kindled in its blaze will it bear upward when my life is fled iii youth and age oh give me back the days when loose and free to my blind passion were the curb and rein oh give me back the angelic face again with which all virtue buried seems to be oh give my panting footsteps back to me that are in age so slow and fraught with pain and fire and moisture in the heart and brain if thou wouldst have me burn and weep for thee if it be true thou livest alone amor on the sweetbitter tears of human hearts in an old man thou canst not wake desire souls that have almost reached the other shore of a diviner love should feel the darts and be as tinder to a holier fire iv old age the course of my long life hath reached at last in fragile bark oer a tempestuous sea the common harbor where must rendered be account of all the actions of the past the impassioned phantasy that vague and vast made art an idol and a king to me was an illusion and but vanity were the desires that lured me and harassed the dreams of love that were so sweet of yore what

colonna when the prime mover of my many sighs heaven took through death from out her earthly place nature that never made so fair a face remained ashamed and tears were in all eyes o fate unheeding my impassioned cries o hopes fallacious o thou spirit of grace where art thou now earth holds in its embrace thy lovely limbs thy holy thoughts the skies vainly did cruel death attempt to stay the rumor

dreary and i am near to fail infirm and weary the nature of love by guido guinizelli to noble heart love doth for shelter fly as seeks the bird the forests leafy shade love was not felt till noble heart beat high nor before love the noble heart was made soon as the suns broad flame was formed so soon the clear light filled the air yet was not till he came so love springs up in noble breasts and there has its appointed space as heat in the bright flames finds its allotted place kindles in noble heart the fire of love as hidden virtue in the precious stone this virtue comes not from the stars above till round it the ennobling sun has shone but when his powerful blaze has drawn forth what was vile the stars impart strange virtue in their rays and thus when nature doth create the heart noble and pure and high like virtue from the star love comes from womans eye from the portuguese song by gil vicente if thou art sleeping maiden awake and open thy door t is the break of day and we must

to my tall white tent come back my only son thy hand in freedom shall cast thy hawks when morning breaks on the swans of the seven lakes on the lakes of karajal i will give thee leave to stray and pasture thy hunting steeds in the long grass and the reeds of the meadows of karaday i will give thee my coat of mail of softest leather made with choicest steel inlaid will not all this prevail ii this hand no longer shall cast my hawks when morning breaks on the swans of the seven lakes on the lakes of karajal i will no longer stray and pasture my hunting steeds in the long grass and the reeds of the meadows of karaday though thou give me thy coat of mall of softest leather made with choicest steel inlaid all this cannot prevail what right hast thou o khan to me who am mine own who am slave to god alone and not to any man god will appoint the day when i again shall be by the blue shallow sea where the steelbright sturgeons play god who doth care for me in the barren wilderness on unknown hills no less will my companion be when i wander lonely and lost in the wind when i watch at night like a hungry wolf and am white and covered with hoarfrost yea wheresoever i be in the yellow desert sands in mountains or unknown lands allah will care for me iii then sobra the old old man three hundred and sixty years had he lived in this land of tears bowed down and said o khan if you bid me i will speak theres no sap in dry grass no marrow in dry bones alas the mind of old men is weak i am old i am very old i have seen the primeval man i have seen the great gengis khan arrayed in his robes of gold what i say to you is the truth and i say to you o khan pursue not the starwhite man pursue not the beautiful youth him the almighty made and brought him forth of the light at the verge and end of the night when men on the mountain prayed he was born at the break of day when abroad the angels walk he hath listened to their talk and he knoweth what they say gifted with allahs grace like the moon of ramazan when it shines in the skies o khan is the light of his beautiful face when first on earth he trod the first words that he said were these as he stood and prayed there is no god but god and he shall be king of men for allah hath heard his prayer and the archangel in the air gabriel hath said amen the siege of kazan black are the moors before kazan and their stagnant waters smell of blood i said in my heart with horse and man i will swim across this shallow flood under the feet of argamack like new moons were the shoes he bare silken trappings hung on his back in a talisman on his neck a prayer my warriors thought i are following me but when i looked behind alas not one of all the band could i see all had sunk in the black morass where are our shallow fords and where the power of kazan with its fourfold gates from the prison windows our maidens fair talk of us still through the iron grates we cannot hear them for horse and man lie buried deep in the dark abyss ah the black day hath come down on kazan ah was ever a grief like this the boy and the brook down from yon distant mountain height the brooklet flows through the village street a boy comes forth to wash his hands washing yes washing there he stands in the water cool and sweet brook from what mountain dost thou come o my brooklet cool and sweet i come from yon mountain high and cold where lieth the new snow on the old and melts in the summer heat brook to what river dost thou go o my brooklet cool and sweet i go to the river there below where in bunches the violets grow and sun and shadow meet brook to what garden dost thou go o my brooklet cool and sweet i go to the garden in the vale where all night long the nightingale her lovesong doth repeat brook to what fountain dost thou go o my brooklet cool and sweet i go to the fountain at whose brink the maid that loves thee comes to drink and whenever she looks therein i rise to meet her and kiss her chin and my joy is then complete to the stork

created for he will be unto me a god forever his altar oftentimes shall imbue a tender lamb from our sheepfolds he my heifers to wander at large and myself as thou seest on my rustic reed to play what i will hath permitted meliboeus truly i envy not i marvel rather on all sides in all the fields is such trouble behold my goats i am driving heartsick further away this one scarce tityrus lead i for having here yeaned twins just now among the dense hazels hope of the flock ah me on the naked flint she hath left them often this evil to me if my mind had not been insensate oaktrees stricken by heaven predicted as now i remember often the sinister crow from the hollow ilex predicted nevertheless who this god may be o tityrus tell me tityrus o meliboeus the city that they call rome i imagined foolish i to be like this of ours where often we shepherds wonted are to drive down of our ewes the delicate offspring thus whelps like unto dogs had i known and kids to their mothers thus to compare great things with small had i been accustomed but this among other cities its head as far hath exalted as the cypresses do among the lissome viburnums meliboeus and what so great occasion of seeing rome hath possessed thee tityrus liberty which though late looked upon me in my inertness after the time when my beard fell whiter front me in shaving yet she looked upon me and came to me after a long while since amaryllis possesses and galatea hath left me for i will even confess that while galatea possessed me neither care of my flock nor hope of liberty was there though from my wattled folds there went forth many a victim and the unctuous cheese was pressed for the city ungrateful never did my right hand return home heavy with money meliboeus i have wondered why sad thou invokedst the gods amaryllis and for whom thou didst suffer the apples to hang on the branches tityrus hence was absent thee tityrus even the pinetrees thee the very fountains the very copses were calling tityrus what could i do no power had i to escape from my bondage nor had i power elsewhere to recognize gods so propitious here i beheld that youth to whom each year meliboeus during twice six days ascends the smoke of our altars here first gave he response to me soliciting favor feed as before your heifers ye boys and yoke up your bullocks meliboeus fortunate old man so then thy fields will be left thee and large enough for thee though naked stone and the marish all thy pasturelands with the dreggy rush may encompass no unaccustomed food thy gravid ewes shall endanger nor of the neighboring flock the dire contagion inject them fortunate old man here among familiar rivers and these sacred founts shalt thou take the shadowy coolness on this side a hedge along the neighboring crossroad where hyblaean bees ever feed on the flower of the willow often with gentle susurrus to fall asleep shall persuade thee yonder beneath the high rock the pruner shall sing to the breezes nor meanwhile shalt thy hearts delight the hoarse woodpigeons nor the turtledove cease to mourn from aerial elmtrees tityrus therefore the agile stags shall sooner feed in the ether and the billows leave the fishes bare on the seashore sooner the borderlands of both overpassed shall the exiled parthian drink of the soane or the german drink of the tigris than the face of him shall glide away from my bosom meliboeus but we hence shall go a part to the thirsty afries part to scythia come and the rapid cretan oaxes and to the britons from all the universe utterly sundered ah shall i ever a long time hence the bounds of my country and the roof of my lowly cottage covered with greensward seeing with wonder behold my kingdoms a handful of wheatears shall an impious soldier possess these lands newly cultured and these fields of corn a barbarian lo whither dicord us wretched people hath brought for whom our fields we have planted graft meliboeus thy peartrees now put in order thy vineyards go my goats go hence my flocks so happy aforetime never again henceforth outstretched in my verdurous cavern shall i behold you afar from the bushy precipice hanging songs no more shall i sing not with me ye goats as your shepherd shall ye browse on the bitter willow or blooming laburnum tityrus nevertheless this night together with me canst thou rest thee here on the verdant leaves for us there are mellowing apples chestnuts soft to the touch and clouted cream in abundance and the high roofs now of the villages smoke in the distance and from the lofty mountains are falling larger the shadows ovid in exile at tomis in bessarabia near the mouths of the danube tristia book iii elegy x should any one there in rome remember ovid the exile and without me my name still in the city survive tell him that under stars which never set in the ocean i am existing still here in a barbarous land fierce sarmatians encompass me round and the bessi and getae names how unworthy to be sung by a genius like mine yet when the air is warm intervening ister defends us he as he flows repels inroads of war with his waves but when the dismal winter reveals its hideous aspect when all the earth becomes white with a marblelike frost and when boreas is loosed and the snow hurled under arcturus then these nations in sooth shudder and shiver with cold deep lies the snow and neither the sun nor the rain can dissolve it boreas hardens it still makes it forever remain hence ere the first has melted away another succeeds it and two years it is wont in many places to lie and so great is the power of the northwind awakened it levels lofty towers with the ground roofs uplifted bears off wrapped in skins and with trousers sewed they contend with the weather and their faces alone of the whole body are seen often their tresses when shaken with pendent icicles tinkle and their whitened beards shine with the gathering frost wines consolidate stand preserving the form of the vessels no more draughts of wine pieces presented they drink why should i tell you how all the rivers are frozen and solid and from out of the lake frangible water is dug ister no narrower stream than the river that bears the papyrus which through its many mouths mingles its waves with the deep ister with hardening winds congeals its cerulean waters under a roof of ice winding its way to the sea there where ships have sailed men go on foot and the billows solid made by the frost hoofbeats of horses indent over unwonted bridges with water gliding beneath them the sarmatian steers drag their barbarian carts scarcely shall i be believed yet when naught is gained by a falsehood absolute credence then should to a witness be given i have beheld the vast black sea of ice all compacted and a slippery crust pressing its motionless tides t is not enough to have seen i have trodden this indurate ocean dry shod passed my foot over its uppermost wave if thou hadst had of old such a sea as this is leander then thy death had not been charged as a crime to the strait nor can the curved dolphins uplift themselves from the water all their struggles to rise merciless winter prevents and though boreas sound with roar of wings in commotion in the blockaded gulf never a wave will there be and the ships will stand hemmed in by the frost as in marble nor will the oar have power through the stiff waters to cleave fastbound in the ice have i seen the fishes adhering yet notwithstanding this some of them still were alive hence if the savage strength of omnipotent boreas freezes whether the saltsea wave whether the refluent stream straightway the ister made level by arid blasts of the northwind comes the barbaric foe borne on his swiftfooted steed foe that powerful made by his steed and his farflying arrows all the neighboring land void of inhabitants makes some take flight and none being left to defend their possessions unprotected their goods pillage and plunder become cattle and creaking carts the little wealth of the country and what riches beside indigent peasants possess some as captives are driven along their hands bound behind them looking backward in vain toward their lares and lands others transfixed with barbed arrows in agony perish for the swift arrowheads all have in poison been dipped what they cannot carry or lead away they demolish and the hostile flames burn up the innocent cots even when there is peace the fear of war is impending none with the ploughshare pressed furrows the soil any more either this region sees or fears a foe that it sees not and the sluggish land slumbers in utter neglect no sweet grape lies hidden here in the shade of its vineleaves no fermenting must fills and oerflows the deep vats apples the region denies nor would acontius have found here aught upon which to write words for his mistress to read naked and barren plains without leaves or trees we behold here places alas unto which no happy man would repair since then this mighty orb lies open so wide upon all sides has this region been found only my prison to be tristia book iii elegy xii now the zephyrs diminish the cold and the year being ended winter maeotian seems longer than ever before and the ram that bore unsafely the burden of helle now makes the hours of the day equal with those of the night now the boys and the laughing girls the violet gather which the fields bring forth nobody sowing the seed now the meadows are blooming with flowers of various colors and with untaught throats carol the garrulous birds now the swallow to shun the crime of her merciless mother under the rafters builds cradles and dear little homes and the blade that lay hid covered up in the furrows of ceres now from the tepid ground raises its delicate head where there is ever a vine the bud shoots forth from the tendrils but from the getic shore distant afar is the vine where there is ever a tree on the tree the branches are swelling but from the getic land distant afar is the tree now it is holiday there in rome and to games in due order give place the windy wars of the vociferous bar now they are riding the horses with light arms now they are playing now with the ball and now round rolls the swiftflying hoop now when the young athlete with flowing oil is anointed he in the virgins fount bathes overwearied his limbs thrives the stage and applause with voices at variance thunders and the theatres three for the three forums resound four times happy is he and times without number is happy who the city of rome uninterdicted enjoys but all i see is the snow in the vernal sunshine dissolving and the waters no more delved from the indurate lake nor is the sea now frozen nor as before oer the ister comes the sarmatian boor driving his stridulous cart hitherward nevertheless some keels already are steering and on this pontic shore alien vessels will be eagerly shall i run to the sailor and having saluted who he may be i shall ask wherefore and whence he hath come strange indeed will it be if he come not from regions adjacent and incautious unless ploughing the neighboring sea rarely a mariner over the deep from italy passes rarely he comes to these shores wholly of harbors devoid whether he knoweth greek or whether in latin he speaketh surely on this account he the more welcome will be also perchance from the mouth of the strait and the waters propontic unto the steady southwind some one is spreading his sails whosoever he is the news he can faithfully tell me which may become a part and an approach to the truth he i pray may he able to tell me the triumphs of caesar which he has heard of and vows paid to the latian jove and that thy sorrowful head germania thou the rebellious under the feet at last of the great captain hast laid whoso shall tell me these things that not to have seen will afflict me forthwith unto my house welcomed as guest shall he be woe is me is the house of ovid in scythian lands now and doth punishment now give me its place for a home grant ye gods that caesar make this not my house and my homestead but decree it to be only the inn of my pain
