chapter suddenly the child began to scream piercing shrieks of terror that died down to shaking sobs clutching at his mother so that his tiny ringers pinched her skin agonisingly through her flimsy summer dress veronica jones grimaced in the deep green gloom of the reptile house had to check herself from giving her fiveyearold son one of her habitual cuffs across his head she held him to her closed her eyes momentarily a human ostrich trying to hide her embarrassment from the ghostly white faces that turned in her direction trust the little sod to start playing up you squandered a sizeable chunk of the weekly family allowance to give him a treat and this was how he repaid you outside he had complained of the heat incessantly and shown more interest in playing with the gravel on the paths than looking at the zoo animals not that there were many on show because the bloody place was closing down at the end of the week and the owners appeared to have got rid of a lot of the exhibits already conning you right up to the end the money grabbers and now ian was frightened of the snakes its all right she muttered and forced her eyes open im frightened mam theres nothing to be frightened of she replied hoping her tone was reassuring but she could not keep her annoyance out of it the snakes are all in glass cages they cant get at you at least i hope they cant that one the boy pointed to a large glass exhibit case with a shaking hand he wants to kill me dont be so stupid she hissed the way an angry snake might hiss it her voice died away and she felt the sweat on her body turning cold a clammy invisible hand stroking her sliding up and down her the way that creature in the cage might do if it got out a slimy reptile revolting in every aspect and deadly veronica tried to pull herself together it was the heat that was affecting her just like it had upset ian hell it was hot outside but it was like a blast furnace in here no airconditioning the lighting just a dim green glow designed to make these reptiles doubly sinister all part of the creep show like the spook house at the funfair an extra quid to go in the snake house halfprice for children and well guarantee to scare the shit out of them so that neither you nor they will get any sleep tonight youll have to have the little boy in your bed tonight maam after hes seen what weve got in store for him i want to go home mam youll get a clip round the ear in a minute she breathed i can see that ive wasted my money on you but im going to have my moneys worth so shut your eyes and hang on to me if you dont want to look she was aware that he was trembling shaking with sheer terror afraid to cry out loud in case she hit him you start blarting and see what you get she warned now hold on to my hand and lets have no more of this nonsense veronica jones wanted to move on a quick glance at each cage as she passed just to satisfy her own conscience no more than a cursory glimpse and then back outside into the heat of a summers day except that the crowd in here seemed to have swelled a crush of bodies hemming her in you arent going anywhere lady you cant escape as easily as that youve got to stay and look she almost screamed for gods sake let me out but she realised the futility of it nobody was interested in her they didnt give a damn whether she lived or died just faceless shapes that were supposed to be people aliens in a reptile den everybody just staring gloating at the hideous things on the other side of the glass somebody was tapping on the front of a case stabbing a finger at the hideous thing only a quarter of an inch away you cant get at me you bugger youll stop in there till you die go on try and bite me go on it was the same snake that had scared ian veronica stared at the toadlike head the large unblinking eyes features that might have been left unchanged over a million years coiled motionless you didnt even know if it saw you knew you were there it could even have been dead its a bloody stuffed one someone said but nobody laughed veronica felt the watchers move back half a pace a man trod on her toe and it hurt but she stopped her self from crying out aloud dont make a noise it might hear you and it might get out she found herself reading the illuminated notice below the aquariumtype cage she read the printed words because for some reason she wanted to know just what kind of creature it was that remained motionless and scared you to hell russells viper one of the most feared snakes of india burma and thailand its bite is usually fatal but its venom is sometimes used in medication ugh veronica jones hoped that she had never had any injected into her you couldnt trust doctors these days they got up to all sorts of tricks that snake ought never to have been brought back to england it shouldve been left in peace in india or wherever theyd got it there should be a ban on importing such things it moved at least she thought it did although it could have been just her own start of fright everybody seemed to move back another halfpace and a clumsy shoe scraped the side of her sandalled foot again faces still staring an entire audience hypnotised by that viper in its pseudojungle of no more than a cubic metre watching it intently basking in their terror though logically it could not get at them all the same the fingerpoking jibes had stopped the reptiles tormentor standing well back from the glass he was scared too and then its jaws opened a reptilian cavern of sheer evil the watchers felt its hate for them as if a dragon had breathed angry fire those glassy eyes fixed them searched out every single one of them without so much as a blink or a movement of that squat head a loathsome creature that loathed its captors with a malevolence that even plate glass could not shut in you felt the sheer power of the viper felt it turning your lathered sweat to an icy chill drying out your mouth and weakening your legs huddling you together silent mass panic that made you incapable of flight and if it got out then you wouldnt be able to do a damned thing to protect yourself the russells vipers spell might have lasted a second or an hour veronica was aware of the others pressed up against her of ian pinching her flesh in his infantile terror but she made no move to push him away greenish silhouettes all around that might have been statues in some underground temple of snake worship bow before your lord and master and beg of him forgiveness and mercy the snakes eyes were closed and suddenly everybody was moving just a flexing of cramped limbs turning one way then another as though they had become so disorientated that they had forgotten in which direction the exit lay the atmosphere was heavy with the sour smell of human sweat the tension had built up to a peak it might have blown but instead it had subsided you knew it was still there though and you wanted to get the hell out of here before something happened mam i want to go home a distant muffled familiar cry she didnt want to hit her bastard son any more suddenly she wanted to protect him to shield him from this illogical evil she thought for a moment that she might cry theyre nasty things in cages she wished her whispers didnt echo didnt quaver shut your eyes and think of something else well be outside in a minute the queue had bottlenecked nobody seemed to be in a hurry any more more glass cages all lit with that same eerie glow the horror show isnt over yet folks oh jesus christ get a move on veronica stole a sideways glance breathed her relief aloud this case was empty thank god the thick glass acted like a mirror threw her own reflection back at her a little more personal care and she could have been attractive a perm for that shoulderlength blonde hair she didnt have the money but a good combing and brushing would have helped to separate those tangled strands cosmetics would have masked the lines in her face knocked five years off her maybe even made her feel thirty again the flowered cotton dress the one she had picked up for p at a jumble sale down at the hall clung wetly to a figure that was still sensuous an observer could see that she wasnt wearing a bra that she didnt really care any longer the hardness was there in her expression the compressed lips the lines beneath the eyes the resentment towards life once almost six years ago it seemed an eternity she had been happy her boyfriend was going to rescue her from a life of downtown squalor and hardship a man of some means was going to spirit her away from all this take her someplace else where she could forget the past like a bad dream which was why she had let him have his way most nights and had not been too bothered about being careful the same week that she discovered that she was pregnant ken wasnt around no goodbyes no sudden heartbreaking parting she was just on her own again like it always used to be except that this time she was going to have a baby to look after ken didnt leave he just didnt come any more faded back into the mists of a background which she had not bothered too much to explore not a new story just another one of many thousands and the kid was a burden on her a perpetual memory of what might have been if it had not all been a lie oh god where was that bloody exit the crowd had slowed bunched again not even jostling one another staring at the glass cages on either side transfixed immobile so hot you could scarcely breathe drawing the humidity down into your lungs holding on to strangers afraid you might faint faces staring back at you reptilian features seemingly distorted by the heavy glass so that heads and bodies were out of proportion evil masks things that might have been dead except that you knew they werent they fixed you with those awful penetrating evil stares wanted to get to you to coil themselves around you let you feel the coldness of their supple bodies as they slid over your flesh savoured their sadistic delight before they sank their venomous fangs into you slid to the floor with you writhed with you until you died somebody screamed another child not ian this time her son clutched her cold sweaty hand and she felt his sobs his fear he was shaking violently well soon be outside she said and her words echoed hung in the sultry stillness as though to mock her her anger welled up temporarily overcame that claustrophobic terror that had engulfed her she wanted to push these stupid people who stood about obstructing her bang on those glass cages with her puny fists and scream obscenities at their occupants i hope you die in there instead she spoke loudly and surprisingly calmly the zoos closing in a couple of days all the animals will have to go these snakes will probably be put down destroyed killed they havent long to live silence people turned she was aware of them looking at her in the halfdarkness wondering who she was and how she knew sensing relief jubilation not a trace of pity kill the snakes kill em all and then her terror came back a fleeting sensation but she knew she was not mistaken she heard the rustling of reptilian bodies behind the prison screens serpent shapes becoming erect rearing up and seeking out the puny mortal who had voiced her contempt dared to issue a threat to the deadly killers from the swamps and jungles of the world veronica cowered wanted to throw up her hands to shield her eyes from them but ian was clinging on to her in a panicstricken determination again she had to look meet their gazes found herself muttering incoherent apologies for her blasphemy in this temple of serpents we shall not die human our hour is nigh and soon we shall be free and there will be nowhere for man to hide our vengeance will be terrible suddenly everybody was pushing and shoving a oncedormant crowd that had awoken from a nightmare and was stampeding towards the dim neon exit sign you went with them because you had no choice swept along by a tide of panic away from the evil green fluorescence towards a shaft of sunlight euphoria that it had all been a trick of the mind your imagination succumbing to the mock swamps and forests and their awful reptilian killers staggering gulping in the hot sunlit atmosphere looking for a bench so that you could rest and allow your trembling legs to recover a real live scare show but it hadnt hurt you just made you appreciate living in a safe world mam i want to go home were going home veronica glanced about her spotted a bluepainted arrow with the words way out painted on it were going home right now mam whatre they doin over there she stopped looked where he pointed a large covered lorry was backed up to the elephant enclosure its tailboard down several men were trying to coax a lumbering elephant up the ramp the animal trumpeted once then shambled up into the trailer the men hurried to close the doors bolting them where are they takin the elephant mam away somewhere the zoos closing all the animals have got to go they goin to kill the elephant i i shouldnt think so theyre probably taking it to another zoo a bigger and better place than this scruffy dump where itll have more room and be better looked after then why dont they take the snakes there instead of killing them like you said they were goin to i i couldve been wrong an instinctive mental apology to those serpents that saw into your mind maybe theyll take the snakes too but maybe theyll kill em after all id like that snakes are horrible come on veronica grabbed her sons hand and pulled him along with her almost running until they reached the open gate that led out into the street by the busstop veronica jones felt foolish now it had been the excessive heat the eerie lighting in the reptile house which had been responsible she was just glad that nobody there had recognised her witnessed her terror everything was going to be all right now all the same that night mother and son had a dual nightmare in the cramped bed which they shared in the council flat in the darkness the snakes came condemned creatures that had escaped from their death cells slithering their way up the steep flights of stairs and across the dingy illlit landings until they smelled out flat number their serpent bodies shrank and flattened enabling them to pass beneath the warped door guided by that sour human body odour emanating from the woman who had scorned and defied them growing again to their full size once they were within wriggling and sliding up on to the bed wrapping themselves around the warmblooded forms of the adult and the boy delighting in the screams of their victims entwining them until their death throes ceased and then moving on in search of others it was only a bad dream veronica comforted the sobbing ian until the first light of a summer dawn crept through the dirtstained bedroom window it was real he muttered but theyve gone now its always worse at night she held him close and kissed him tell you what tonight well sleep with the light on she wondered how much the meter would take and regretted her rash statement its always all right in the light but she still had that uneasy feeling and wondered how long it would take to get yesterday out of her system even in full daylight she could still see those snakes the way they glared their hate out of their prisons desperate hopeless inmates willing to risk death rather than succumb to a life of incarceration they would kill if they could there was no doubt in veronicas mind about that chapter hey there was a cry of indignation mingled with horror from the fairhaired man in dungarees standing back from the big van this bloody aint on no it bloody aint and im not standing for it the two workmen carrying the large glass case covered with a soiled and torn dust sheet lowered it to the floor of the van and turned to the speaker what bloody aint on mate that ken wilsons normally pale features had turned deathly white nobody told me the consignment was was fucking snakes nothin to do with you one of the workmen drew himself up to his full height and his expression hardened why should it be youre just the bleedin driver i refuse wilson began to bluster but deep down he already accepted the futility of his protests he had been lucky to get this driving job he might have to wait months years to get another i cant stand bloody snakes the very thought of em makes me ill theyll be safely locked up in the back of the van the second workman intervened tried to cool it the last thing they wanted was a bloody driver refusing to take the snakes up north he visualised union intervention maybe an embargo on the transport of all dangerous animals a little diplomacy was called for you wont even see em mate theyll all be stacked in the back covered up locked up and when you get to the other end youll have em unloaded for you ah on a plate and you dont have to do anything except drive from a to b cant see what youre complaining about christ yesterday we were moving the elephants and giraffes all right all right ken wilson puckered his lips hoped the others didnt notice the way his skin goosepimpled and a shudder shook his body ill take em just wish somebody had had the common courtesy to tell me first what the load would be i thought itd probably be monkeys they went wednesday wilson turned away there was a cafeteria some fifty yards across the childrens playground but he could tell from here that it was closed you sensed the desolation the atmosphere of a place that had once been alive with animals and sightseers and was now suddenly dead a sadness that you couldnt escape even as an onlooker some more men in overalls were struggling out of a narrow doorway with a cage that reminded ken of a coffin it was bigger in fact the one side a hinged glass partition he didnt want to look tried to turn his head away but all the same he looked jesus christ there were no prizes for guessing that that was a python as thick as his own arm with brown and green markings that would have camouflaged it almost anywhere not moving maybe it was dead no that was too much to hope for even coiled it filled the container and he found himself mentally calculating the constrictors length it had to be eighteen twenty feet possibly more christ only knew what other horrors were down in that underground place waiting to be brought up and loaded into the van and they would be his travelling companions for the next five or six hours do like the man said forget about em theyre just a cargo units in transit no he couldnt shut them out of his mind that was impossible once he got out of here he would go like hell as soon as he hit the motorway push the old wagon to its limit until he reached his destination come on you buggers get her loaded up and lets get the job done it was hotter today than it had been yesterday more of a sultry heat with cloud formations building up in the western sky the driver had listened to the weather forecast on the way down hot and dry becoming thundery towards midafternoon he tensed thought he caught a faroff rumble of thunder it could have been an aircraft thunderstorms always made him uneasy had done so ever since childhood and those bleedin snakes didnt help he shuddered again he glanced about him almost furtively he knew this area well and that made him uneasy too hold on youre imagining things that woman isnt likely to be wandering around a closeddown zoo your chances of bumping into her are virtually nil and anyway she wouldnt recognise you with this moustache certainly not in passing he shaded his eyes with a hand that was unsteady and squinted across to where the conurbation began or ended depending on how you looked at it tall unsightly blocks of council flats there was a rumpus going on about whether they were safe or not he had read in the papers that they had put glass telltales in them to check whether the foundations were shifting or not she lived in one of those ken wilson used to go there sometimes stopping overnight no he experienced a twinge of guilt maybe veronica had forgotten all about him certainly she hadnt made much effort to trace him and she wasnt likely to after all this time stop worrying shes ok probably shacked up with another guy by now nevertheless ken wilson did not like it when his truck driving brought him this way there was always the awful chance that fate might have destined him to meet up with veronica jones again and now that he was living with an eighteenyearold checkout girl from wiggins superstore the last thing he wanted was a thirtyfiveyearold spectre coming out of the past forget the woman and the snakes everythings loaded up mate ken wilson turned slowly saw that the zoo workmen had even shut the back of the van up for him all you have to do is to drive it a clap of thunder had him starting visibly looks like were goin to get it this time mate yeah looks like it wilson walked towards the cab opened the door felt the heat come out at him like the forerunner of a fireball he winced saw the clouds of flies buzzing on the windscreen this was what you got in flaming june either pouring wet or too hot to move no moderation he climbed up into the cab wound the window down he should have done that as soon as he arrived he felt in his pockets for cigarettes and matches his hands were still shaking deliberately blowing smoke at the flies take that lot you bastards they bunched and buzzed their protest but they did not fly off finger on the starter button he hesitated listening listening intently anticipating slitherings and stirrings from the back they cant get into the cab even if they escape from their containers can they then the thunder rolled again terminating in a reverberating clap almost overhead the sun was obscured by the advancing clouds which brought with them a gloom that was akin to dusk eerie he pressed the starter and the engine turned over maybe half a dozen times before it fired this van was a heap of crap a pregistered vehicle that had struggled to pass its mot like everything else at hadleys transport it was on the way out but in this day and age a job was a job and you stuck it ken wilson let in the clutch and the van rolled forward crunched on the gravel as he turned towards the main gates a few rain spots smacked on the windscreen but the expected downpour did not follow the storm was coming from the southwest he was travelling north he might just keep ahead of it he was going to do his damnedest anyhow motorway mile a sense of freedom no stops until he reached his destination one last glance in the direction of those hideous council flats just thinking about veronica gave him an arousement well that was all she was good for get her out of bed and she wasnt much use for anything else no intelligence you couldnt take her anywhere not with that whining complaining voice veronicas virtues began and ended between her thighs all the same he hoped she was ok hell he was getting a guilt complex the motorway was unusually busy an unending line of trundling trucks in the slow lane cars cruising in the middle one he awaited his chance and pulled out got in behind a mini clubman estate that seemed packed with kids and luggage right up to the roof a gimmicky notice above the rear number plate read if you can read this youre too bloody close silly buggers what did they expect on the motorway if you dropped back then somebody overtook you and cut in front so you couldnt make a gap no matter what you did the roads were dry all the same ken doubted if he could pull up in time if anything happened in front very few drivers could the sun was shining again he glanced in his mirror saw those black and yellow clouds way behind thought he could make out the rain sheeting down hed give the storm a run for its money he experienced momentary exhilaration he was watching those kids in the clubman quarrelling and fighting when something on the seat beside him moved something cylindrical rolling jerking oh god the van swerved violently and he only just hauled it back into the middle lane in time horns blared somebody flashed his headlights now he could see the offending object lying motionless on the floor a screwdriver one he had used to tighten a loose screw on the dash earlier and had left lying on the seat bloody hell for a moment he had thought it was a dont think about those snakes like the man at the zoo said you wont even have to unload them at the other end you can report your arrival go and get a cup of tea and by the time you get back youll have an empty van to take home as simple as that youre just a driver ken wilson nothing else he would have to break the return journey overnight that was a bit of a bummer when there was a teenage girl waiting back home willing to do anything you wanted her to if it wasnt for these bloody tachometers they fitted in hgvs these days he would have put his foot down and gone all out to get home in one run those bloody kids in front were getting on his nerves one had climbed over into the boot and was clinging precariously on to a pile of luggage and trying to kick hell out of the other at the same time why for fucks sake didnt their bloody parents do something about it vandals and muggers in the making thats how it all started a lack of discipline in the home the sun had gone behind the clouds and it was hotter than ever that crap cooling system must have packed up altogether wilson wondered if he could get his overalls undone whilst he was driving but changed his mind when a police patrol car passed him in the fast lane the sweat was pouring off him his trousers were stuck to the seat in his mirror he noticed headlights being used and switched his own on those thunder clouds had moved at an unbelievable rate of knots now he heard the thunder again resonant rolls like an angry monster roaring its wrath as it tried to run him down the sudden daytime gloom had him thinking about his reptilian passengers in the back again man was a daytime creature scared of the dark no matter how he tried to tell himself he wasnt probably the snakes were all asleep it was bloody cruel imprisoning them in zoos just done to make money taken out of their natural environment they slept and ate their lives away in sheer boredom you couldnt blame them if they got nasty and turned on somebody man was the cruellest creature of all there was no getting away from that christ ken thought im going bloody soft he found himself listening again but all he heard was engine noise if the buggers did manage to escape they couldnt go anywhere it was the guys the other end who would find them whilst he was somewhere safe having a bite to eat hed keep well clear of the van until it was empty the rain came without warning a few heavy spots followed by an instant downpour the wipers struggling to cope ken wilson cursed under his breath the most depressing sound of all was that of the monotonous noise of windscreen wipers fuck it rain was bouncing up off the tarmac being whipped into a blinding spray by the tyres of speeding traffic obliterating from view the vehicles up ahead the cars and lorries did not seem to be slowing any and those idiot children in the clubman were still slinging punches at each other one had found a tennis racket somewhere and was attempting to brain the other battering him viciously with it ken glanced at his watch night had come about four hours early there was driving rain and a lashing gale that was bending newly planted birch saplings on the embankments almost double another police car passed doing a ton for sure one law for some another for others and then it happened ken did not know whether the clubman estate had failed to see the brake lights of the ford transit in front or whether he had simply driven into its back distracted by those bastards of fighting kids suddenly the clubman crunched reared like a frisky filly momentarily upright on its rear wheels ah in an instant before he hit it the roof buckled split and the glass showered out of the windows spilling those children with it he saw them for a split second and braked hard but knew he could not miss them one was still clutching the racket swinging it the others face a mass of scarlet pulp a broken rag doll bouncing on the hard surface disappearing please god he felt the front tyre crushing the infant body saw in his mind the squashed form like those hedgehogs you saw flattened on the roads every morning the crunching of frail bones instant death the other child was still airborne when he hit it saw it flatten on the windscreen without breaking the glass a gnat caught by a speeding vehicle the wipers would knock it off in a second they were buffeting it bouncing back off swiping it again with mechanical determination then ken wilsons van ploughed into the wreckage of the clubman and the transit and seconds later came a shuddering jolt as he was hit from behind he screamed aloud gave up trying to do anything positive the windscreen shattered and that bloody mulch disintegrated some of it splattering the interior of the cab and in that same second his own van appeared to concertina the rear of the vehicle crushing and coming forward his seat and harness ripped from their moorings he was catapulted blinding pain as the steering column shattered his chest threw him back and then bounced him down on to the floor of the cab dazed screaming tasting his own blood he lay there in the semidarkness he heard the squeal of tortured rubber smelled its acrid stench the screech of tearing metal cries of anguish vehicles were still running into one another he felt the van move again pushed forward another few yards shouting screams of pain and terror then silence complete and utter for a few seconds he did not try to move just lay there in the bloody halfdarkness trying to figure out exactly what had happened a multi pileup they made the television news every so often but everybody forgot and they happened again vehicles travelling too close together in adverse weather conditions people never learned including himself it cant happen to me its those other silly buggers and suddenly he was one of those silly buggers dont move just lie still and somebody will come to help soon im scared to hell to look out there im not badly hurt really just cut and bruised his senses swam came back again he fought down his rising panic it might have been seconds or hours later he had lost all concept of time when he sensed rather than heard a movement in the cab a flicker of hope raising his head up a few inches off the ground his eyes hurt as if somebody was pushing a sharp instrument into them he gasped coughed tasted blood im here you bloody fool help me he tried to call out but the words would not come were strangulated into a low moan something moved his vision blurred cleared but only partially an arm was reaching in through the smashed cab window feeling inside jesus dont tell me you cant see me ken tried to shout mustered his vocal cords for one supreme effort and managed a wheezing gurgle experienced a sensation as if he were drowning and tasted blood again a fist clenched erect some guys got one helluva long arm he thought if they cant get to me why the fuck dont they start cutting into the cab that fist was starting to open out the driver stared forced his agonised eyes to work with sheer willpower it did not look right the arm was elongated like one of those cartoons they fed the kids every afternoon on tv no fingers either a malformed hand or else the berk was wearing mittens bloody crazy ill go mad in a second and then everything turned crazy that hand if it was a hand had two tiny eyes orbs that glinted and flickered came forward in a sinister supple movement a kind of mottled greenishgrey a mouth opening and in those eyes ken wilson read hate and malevolence and death the worst moment was when realisation dawned the jigsaw pieces slotted together through a haze of pain and fear formed a picture which left no doubt in his terrorcrazed mind jesus god almighty no a cobra the most fearsome and deadly of all snakes its face was only a foot away from his own he tried to press himself back against the crumpled wreckage of the cab but there was nowhere to go the creature was gloating prolonging the fatal strike savouring the mental anguish of man its captor for so long and now at its mercy no please i dont want to hurt you im only the driver a trick of the halflight or did it smile an evil elongation of that awful mouth another movement of the hooded head he wanted to close his eyes and shut it out but his lids appeared to have stuck forced to look into those flashing pinpoints reading death there and praying that it would be quick im dying anyhow you dont have to bother to kill me just leave me alone and ill be dead before long background noises engines running people screaming for help outside in the stygian blackness a stench that was overpowering the smell of burning rubber and heated metal the smell of death wilsons mind had gone numb an instinctive anaesthetic that spared him pain at the very last transcending the limits of human endurance he saw the cobra knew that it was going to kill him but suddenly it did not seem so terrible after all he would have died anyway maybe lingered for days perhaps ended up on a lifesupport machine clinically dead but the vital organs kept alive a pointless exercise demonstrating mans cruelty to man the law forbidding euthanasia they wouldnt let a wounded animal suffer theyd put it down yet it was all right for a fellowhuman to undergo indescribable agonies a twisted philosophy he wanted to laugh because he had beaten the system cheated them the reptile struck a sharp pain somewhere in the region of his neck like the prick of an injection he couldnt make up his mind whether it had bitten him or spat venom because the head was several inches away from his face possibly a movement too quick for the eye to follow it didnt matter because it was all over now he felt the movement of its body as it crawled across him like a thick rough hosepipe being dragged over him and then he wondered where it had gone because he could neither see it nor hear it any longer probably out of the opposite window a sensation as if he were burning up as if somebody had injected him with acid and his veins were corroding away and then the numbness took over again and cut out the pain left him with a lightheadedness as though he were floating weightlessly through the atmosphere euphoric because it was all over and it didnt hurt outside the van the cobra dropped silently on to the wet tarmac and slithered away beneath the crumpled wreckage its victim forgotten the killing was over and now its instincts turned to survival in an alien world of hard manmade surfaces where the air was filled with pungent smoke and noises beyond its primitive comprehension it made it to the hard shoulder found the long grass of the adjacent embankment and began the ascent a powerful wary creature that underwent a new experience after a lifetime of boredom in captivity it tasted fear for the first time fear that merged into anger and gave it the killing urge again chapter the young police constable in the motorway patrol car felt his stomach churn as the message came over the radio a weakness engulfed his limbs and he remembered how he used to be carsick as a child every time his parents took him out in the dark blue maxi which they kept polished in the garage in readiness for a sunday afternoon spin an urge to open the door lean out leave a trail of vomit in their wake he wanted to be back at hq a desk job checking traffic reports anywhere except out here he did not speak turned his head to one side in case sergeant bufton saw how white hed gone the sergeant had a reputation as a right bastard both in the station and out on the cars just plain nasty and sarcastic he didnt know any other way and a young pc was fair game ever seen a dead body constable i dont mean a stiff all neatly laid out in a mortuary i mean one in a dozen different pieces that youve got to retrieve from the highway gather em up in a sack and try and find out what fits where like a kind of jigsaw puzzle and some of them can be real teasers but when youve been to a dozen or so such accidents you instinctively know what fits where youll find out before long that was how bufton had briefed young mark bazeley on the first morning he reported for motorway patrol duty a week last monday things had been quiet just two or three smashes one death but the victim had died in hospital three days later from internal injuries now the horror was about to start the real horror sounds like a bad un sarge bazeley tried to keep his voice even attempted to sound almost casual better get in first before the bastard gives me a rundown of what to expect you heard what the radio said bufton shouted to make himself heard above the whine of the siren a multiple pileup that could mean a dozen vehicles or fifty we wont know until we get there and as its only at junction twentytwo well be first on the scene another minute and a half by my reckoning ill count the vehicles you count the corpses a laugh that was devoid of humour bazeley wished there was somewhere he could vomit in private just a quick throwup to clear his guts and then hed face it his companion wasnt just being sadistic for the sake of it it was a kind of mental barrier a shield he was throwing up to protect the two of them dont think of them as people think of them as units units of work and when the jobs done you can put it all out of your mind if you dont youll end up in the head farm but bufton wouldnt put it into words you had to read him like a complicated book to see what he was driving at just dont let him see youre scared here we are the sergeant eased his foot off the throttle the speedo needle dropping from to to braking it was difficult to discern details through the deluge the wet road reflecting the deep red of rear lights interspersed with the flashing blue from the police car a tailback of traffic people out of their vehicles and walking down the lanes oblivious of the thunderstorm orslowing cars and lorries idiots bufton slowed eased off the motorway and on to the hard shoulder kept his speed down to mph ghouls ah theyre interested in is gawping at mangled bodies you get em at the scene of every accident now it seems to start here the police car came to a halt warning lights and flashers left on as the two officers got out two or three prangs nothing more the bad ones would be further along where the first vehicles had collided at speed bazeleys mouth was dry as they put some orange cones out this was the easy part take your time and follow the sergeant hes a bastard but you need him now more than youve ever needed anybody the constable glanced back behind them he could hear wailing sirens ambulances fire engines and more motorway patrols were on the way jesus hurry up the rain storm was at its peak the thunder and lightning had passed on left the cloudburst to follow a deluge of water that hit the officers orange plastic jackets with force then they heard the screams of pain and terror the hysterical cries for help vehicles were crunched up now these were the ones that had taken the full force of the accident at speeds of up to mph a van it was impossible to recognise the make was flattened beneath the trailer of an articulated lorry a sheet of pressed metal the chassis would have to be prised apart if they were going to find out who was inside human silhouettes bazeley noticed a pool of scarlet fluid being diluted by the rain and tasted bile at the back of his throat but at least he didnt have to do anything about it the artic had ploughed into a big carrier which in turn had crunched a small car it could have been a clubman estate but the details would be sorted out later the young officer felt something else besides fear sheer helplessness i cant do anything i cant help anybody im just a bystander like these ghouls the sarge was on about except that i dont want to be here a car was blazing somewhere the thick black smoke kept low by the thunderstorm creating a dense black fog that made everything a thousand times more terrifying shapes that moved and screamed came at you out of the blackness and you only saw the injuries and the blood when they got close had you stepping carefully in case you fell headlong over a corpse there appeared to be bodies everywhere bazeley kicked something recognised it as a severed arm as it rolled away that was when he threw up vomited everything out of his guts in one spouting spew and hoped that the sergeant did not see him in the smoky darkness and then he saw the girl her piercing screams had his blood running cold and when she came staggering out of the darkness he almost turned and ran oh god she had to be hurt bad he didnt want to see didnt want to have her clinging to him and bleeding all over him miraculously she wasnt bleeding in fact she did not appear to be injured at all he stared at her with smarting eyes and wondered for a second if his brain was playing tricks on him if he wasnt up to all this and something inside him had snapped she could not have been more than twenty long blonde hair that fell below her shoulders and a figure that any model would have been proud of so beautiful and naked except for a shoe on her left foot she was screaming hysterically clutching at her stomach bent double straightening up again but even in her crazed agonised state she recognised a police officer knew that he might be able to help her police constable bazeley stared mentally recoiled but there was no blood coming from the girl maybe her injuries were internal in which case it wouldnt be so bad for him he would help her stay with her until the ambulances arrived it was a letoff not a pleasant one but better than tending injuries that spouted blood all over you whilst you tried to stem an arterial wound coward ok im a coward but ill try and calm this bird he reached out for her just as she stumbled slipped through his grasp and fell face down on the tarmac immediately her body was convulsing doubling up her toes on the unclad foot curling inwards in sheer agony she was clutching at her abdomen mark bazeley felt her pain as he grasped her every nerve and muscle in her lithe body at breaking point as it took the strain of the ultimate in pain shuddering crazed she tried to fight him as he rolled her over her white even teeth clenched as though in the throes of a fit spittle frothing from her soft red lips for a split second his mind shut off and he saw her as a young man sees a beautiful naked girl the shapely thighs parted legs wide and kicking frantically as though she had just hit a climax moans that he wished were orgasmic cries of delight and the two of them anywhere else but here her hands came off her stomach her fists clenched and she pummelled at him crazily those groans escalating into screams back to reality she was in unbelievable pain probably dying take it easy what a bloody stupid thing to say he began to smooth his fingers over her rain washed slippery flesh probing for an injury of some kind a swelling maybe anything and all the time she rained blows on him caught him full in the face and he tasted blood in his mouth she was writhing jerking sobbing and in the end he caught her wrists had to kneel on her to prevent her from twisting out of his grip what the hell do i do now slap her across the face assaulted by a police officer at the scene of the accident attempted rape christ sarge where the hell are you just when i need you most but bufton had gone off into the rain and smoke doing what hardened experienced officers do at the scene of motorway carnage youre on your own copper the girl was desperately trying to tug free of her captor managed to drag a hand away and those fingers shot back to her belly just above the triangle of pubic hair the moment she made contact with the flesh her lips parted to emit a piercing shriek of pain what happened the policeman had to shout to make himself heard above the screams from around him and the bansheelike noises of the ambulances which were nosing their way down the slip road what happened she muttered something and he bent his head low in an attempt to hear half thought that she might attempt to bite him her lips were moving again frothy with saliva grinding her teeth bitten she got the word out and there was no mistaking the sheer terror in her rolling eyes he stared at her let the word sink in it was nonsense bitten his mouth was close to her ear shouting bitten by what for christs sake the expression of terror was back on her pallid features her eyes rolling her head moved from side to side and the hands which had punched him now clutched at him her lips were moving again fighting the pain to get the word out snakes she was delirious of course she had to be take it easy ill try and get you to an ambulance she groaned and her body went as taut as a steel hawser took the strain and then reached breaking point she came off the ground like an uncoiling spring convulsing so that her spine was in terrible danger of snapping a landed fish desperate to flap its way back to the water she hit the ground rolled came up to her knees in a grotesque unnatural posture dug her fingers deep into the flesh of her lower stomach as though she were intent on clawing out some cancerous growth pain and terror doubled up yet jerking her head from side to side peering fearfully into the darkness with eyes that bulged unnaturally bazeley watched helpless where the fuck were the ambulances there was one stopped about fifty yards away some a little further down stretcherbearers hardly knowing who to take first hey he called out but gave up even if they heard him which they werent likely to in all this din they wouldnt be taking orders from a rookie copper youre wasting your time maybe if you carry her across to them theyll have to put her in one of the ambulances he turned back to her saw that her fit had subsided she lay slumped on the ground muscles quivering after the strain her eyes were closed but they flickered open as he knelt beside her relax im going to try and carry you to one of the ambulances its no good she tried to smile and in her expression he read a resignation to death im done for snakes lots of them loose on the motorway well round em up afterwards he said sliding an arm under her buttocks another behind her shoulders now easy does it he lifted her up stood a moment to get his balance and that was when he felt her go limp her head fell back arms dropped and dangled oh god no his dilemma arose from his inexperience should he lay her down again give her the kiss of life or should he hurry to one of those ambulances let the experts in first aid take over he chose the latter god this had to be hell it could not be happening anywhere else flames were raging where vehicles had caught fire a thick pall of smoke reduced visibility still further and the rain lashed you mercilessly and mingled with the choking atmosphere were the screams of the injured blasphemous curses thrown at ambulancemen and policemen because they could not be everywhere at the same time shes dead a little voice inside pc bazeley whispered bitten by a snake died in excruciating pain you couldnt have done anything for her damn it shes only passed out fainted with agony and one place you wont find snakes is on an english motorway get that into your thick skull before you go crazy the smoke was becoming thicker burning tyres scaring your lungs smarting your eyes there was an ambulance not too far away even this evil vapour could not screen its flashing beacon head that way and hurry a hose was stretched across the road between some mangled cars he sensed it rather than saw it and went to step over it swore as he stumbled almost fell and dropped his burden damn it wasnt easy in these conditions your judgement was impaired that fucking hose something encircled his left leg tightened he kicked at it with his right foot stared down in disbelief felt the hairs on the back of his neck start to prickle that hose it had coiled had trapped his leg with such pressure that it was already beginning to cut off the circulation the firemen must be rolling it out and it had become lodged on some obstruction kicked back it moved again a flexible thing that came alive whipped upwards and threw itself around his waist he felt the pressure on his ribs a constriction that threatened to crush and break them an inarticulate cry of terror escaped him as he saw the end of the hose in silhouette a small slender head with eyes that shone redly in the glow from the burning vehicles it shifted secured an even tighter hold that virtually halted his breathing and looped round him again pinioning his arms mark bazeley screamed but nobody heard him his second shriek was merely a wheeze as his supply of air was cut off the girl fell from his arms thudded lifelessly on to the tarmac and sprawled full length death sparing her this fresh horror the policeman realised only too well what it was that was swiftly crushing his bones and throttling the life out of him hed seen the species at the zoo watched it in more spectacular settings on the television he thought oh my god the girl was telling the truth this cant be happening his ribs cracked and he knew that it was breathless tasting blood a roaring in his ears and his vision blurred and streaked with crimson as he felt himself being pulped consciousness was slipping from him he had given up struggling just wondered with his last thoughts where the sarge was the python relaxed its hold the moment it felt its prey go limp uncoiled itself with amazing rapidity for its eighteenfoot length wary but hungry capable of devouring a waterbuck it began to swallow the corpse there were other bodies it could have taken more easily but it was primarily a hunter and only ate its own kill the creature was confused frightened by the noise and the smell of fire and now that its hunger was satisfied its instinct was to find a place of safety a strange land of artificial surfaces yet beyond these were grass and trees and something else which it had never before known and yet had craved for freedom chapter the tall police superintendent had all the hallmarks of one who had not slept in hours his sallow face was etched with lines there were discoloured puffy patches beneath his redrimmed eyes tightlipped he consulted a sheaf of papers on the desk before him in the temporary headquarters which had hastily been installed adjoining the small police station in the sleepy little village of stainforth the setup the procedure were all too familiar last summer a child had gone missing it had taken them a week to find her body buried on the extensive moorland before that it had been a gunman holding an elderly couple hostage and it had taken the police three days to talk him into surrendering now stainforth would be in the public eye a crisis you dropped routine work devoted yourself mentally and physically to it snatched food and sleep if you got the chance if not you drew on every bodily reserve until you dropped this time it was different oh christ it was something you didnt expect ever to come across except in farfetched movies dangerous snakes were on the loose in a countryside which was tailormade for them moorlands woodlands and there was a heat wave to keep them alive a snap of cold weather would in all probability finish off the reptiles but according to the met office that was unlikely to happen in the near future and before the snakes were found a number of humans might die a sudden thunderstorm had been responsible for a motorway pileup and as a result a vanload of poisonous snakes had crashed and the reptiles were on the loose frightened angry killers a police officer had been crushed to death by an african rock python and a girl had been fatally bitten by a rattler there might be other victims but there had been fifteen mutilated corpses three as yet unidentified out of that carnage and they could not be sure might never be if the snakes had got any of them chief superintendent burlington glanced up at the others in the room the cleanshaven pc ken aylott stainforths resident bobby you read resentment on the young coppers face a chip on his shoulder because he wanted the action of the big city got the crazy notion in his head that the stainforth posting was a kind of demotion maybe all this would change his mind it was up to him it could be the big test colonel marks from stainforth barracks two miles away a surprisingly mildmannered man with rimless spectacles but he wouldnt have got his rank for nothing the police would need the soldiers and somebody to lead them chief inspector watts he would be in charge of operations outside the organisations room a good man to have in the field tough and meticulous an invaluable blend of qualities and the civilian price burlington wasnt keen on civvy street help a personal opinion which he was diplomatic enough to keep to himself he let his gaze rest on the young man for a few seconds insignificant like a lot of others today he could not be more than twentytwo or twentythree a degree in zoology he would not be here otherwise with a specialist knowledge of poisonous snakes a lot of good it had done him just given him some kind of status on the dole im an expert on snakes but i cant get a job might as well be an unemployed labourer burlington smiled cynically faded jeans and a tshirt a rollyourownman judging by the packet of rizlas he was fidgeting with uncertain of himself could be on drugs too an upperclass hippy his dark beard could do with a trim to tidy it up and his hair wouldnt miss a couple of inches shorn off it clean though so he obviously washed regularly or maybe he had had a spruceup specially for this meeting felt important at being called in to help the police burlington thought that maybe theyd have to take him down a peg or two to get the balance right but theyd give him a chance to prove himself first strewth who else here really knew the enemy they were up against right gentlemen the superintendents voice was low tired and it was going to be very hot again today which was a daunting prospect when you had not seen your bed since the night before last we all know what were up against killer snakes that have already claimed the lives of two people he dropped his spectacles back onto the bridge of his nose and consulted his file once more we have done our best to compile an accurate list of the escaped reptiles i cannot guarantee it and neither can that heath robinson zoo apparently various means of transport were used to take the zoo animals away and nobody really knows which vehicles took which consequently we encountered an additional delay whilst the recipients of species were contacted and our inventory has had to be compiled by a process of elimination anyway to the best of our knowledge we are hunting he paused flipped over a page one african rock python presumably the one that killed pc bazeley a pair of western diamondback rattlesnakes which apparently kill more people in the united states than any other poisonous reptile one cobra one african mamba a pair of coral snakes and one russells viper eight in all they have to be found and destroyed as quickly as possible because until they are his eyes closed momentarily nobody in the area surrounding stainforth village is safe it will mean meticulous searching of the moors and woods by police and army with shotguns there is no question of trying to recapture the snakes they must be shot and we must risk the lives of tracker dogs to find them perhaps he smiled wryly trying to exude optimism he did not feel we shall come upon them quickly and blast them before they can do any harm i doubt it sir john price spoke softly an interruption which had the superintendent pushing his heavy rimmed spectacles up on to his forehead and glowering from beneath bushy eyebrows why do you doubt it mr price because these snakes are a variety of species from all over the world no way is a mixture like this gregarious their hatred for one another is as great as their hatred towards man i would think that the chances of finding them all in a small area are very remote id like to think im wrong sir but i very much doubt it i see superintendent burlington passed a hand across his forehead he had not realised until now that he had a headache a dull throbbing behind the eyes thank you mr price for that information at least we now have no illusions about the size of the task that faces us well i wish you the best of luck gentlemen i take it colonel that you have already discussed with mr price your plans for searching the area we are both agreed that in all probability the snakes will head for high ground the moors are a wild stretch and that is where we shall begin the uniformed colonel consulted his watch fortunately the days are long and we have ample men at our disposal i would hope to finish combing the moorland before dark good and now unfortunately i must give a press conference you can imagine how some of the more sensational dailies will blow the whole thing up an awful lot of people in britain are not going to sleep easy in their beds until every one of those snakes is dead john price followed the others outside pausing in the doorway to glance back at the senior police officer burlingtons dislike of the zoologist had not gone unnoticed whatever happened john knew he was the odd man out if they were successful the police and army would take the credit if they failed they had a scapegoat he accepted his lot with a shrug so much for a weeks vacation with aunt elsie his mothers sister his last surviving relative one came to the countryside for a few days away from it all and found oneself caught up in something too awful to contemplate they didnt realise none of them and there was no way of making them until they met up with the escaped killers each and every one of those snakes was a cunning and deadly killer a master of camouflage an expert in ambush they remembered their long incarceration in an inexplicable way they were seeking revenge to begin with they would run then they would turn and fight chapter elsie harrison was in the twilight of her life at seventysix the only thing to look forward to was the visit of her nephew john price the only person in the world she had not that the villagers of stainforth were unkind to her but when you were getting on the only people who really cared for you were your own kin the loneliness of old age had closed in on her this last couple of years or so small and frail her white hair tied up in a bun on the back of her head elsie walked with two sticks she had built her hopes on a replacement hip early last year had even gone into hospital for the op and then they had shattered her by telling her that her heart wasnt strong enough to stand it and had sent her home to be a cripple for the rest of her life in due course she came to accept the fact that she would not be able to dispense with her sticks and she endured the worsening pain and decreasing mobility because the next step would be a wheelchair and that meant going into a home and when that happened she wanted to die after bert had passed away she sold the cottage and bought this small bungalow on the edge of the village she missed daffodil cottage with its quaint tumbledown features and the ivy over the front porch but there was no way she could have kept it on and the garden would have to have gone untended and bert wouldnt have liked that neither she winced at the thought would he have approved of what those people from manchester who bought it had done to it they had completely destroyed its character knocked down walls built a modern extension one of those pine structures that might have come all the way from canada turned it into something that looked like a logcabin and they werent interested in gardening either they had landscaped the whole place built hideous rockeries and made slab paths there was not a vegetable in sight and they had ripped out all the soft fruit bushes too vandalism perhaps it was as well that her husband was not here to see it just thinking of bert brought tears to her eyes and she hoped her maker would decide that it was time to send for her too before long the district nurse had tried to persuade her to have one of those aluminium walkingframes certainly not she had told the rather sharptongued woman who always thought she knew best and that you had no right to have an opinion of your own when she needed that she did not want to be here anymore elsie would manage with her sticks she would defy them all right up to the very end but this was no time to indulge in selfpity with john here for a few days she worried a lot about the boy all this college education and he finished up no better off than any of the other youths out of work who didnt have a qualification or a skill to their name young doyle out of the village was another example hed got five a levels and a lot of good it had done him never worked since he left school until in the end he got so fed up with doing nothing that hed built up a gardening round for himself all credit to the boy but gardening was a hobby like it had been with bert not a way of earning your living it was just labouring nothing more elsie hobbled across to the kettle and switched it on my how she missed her old rayburn with the kettle bubbling on top of it all the time but that was the price you had to pay for growing old she wondered how long john was going to be away hed said probably most of the day it wasnt fair the police dragging him away from her like that to help them look for these escaped snakes horrible things snakes whatever was john thinking about when he elected to study them at university his mother and father should never have allowed it they should have taken a firmer line with him not enough discipline but she would probably have been equally soft with him if he had been her son she missed not having children of her own that was another cruel twist life had dealt her but shed make do with her nephew she wished he would shave that awful beard off though and have his hair cut properly if he didnt like wearing a suit then why on earth couldnt he settle for a nice smart sports jacket and flannels instead of those disreputable jeans he needed to smarten himself up and then at least hed stand a chance of getting a job all the same she mustnt nag him too much or else he might not come and stay with her again and that was an unbearable thought she poured herself a cup of tea hobbled back to her chair by the gasfire with it at least in this hot weather she didnt need to light the gas and that was a relief after selling the cottage and buying this bungalow she had to rely solely on her pension her thoughts turned to the snakes again what a terrible thing to happen pc aylott had called round earlier in the day to warn her warn everybody in stainforth to stay indoors and keep the doors and windows shut well you couldnt really do that this weather the heat would suffocate you those snakes wouldnt be looking to enter houses she told herself they would be heading for the woods and the moors as far from human habitation as they could get she dozed aware of the flies buzzing on the windows a kind of soothing summer sound perhaps the only redeemable feature the filthy little insects had later on she would give them a squirt of flykiller but she couldnt be bothered right now footsteps she opened her eyes listened tried to will them to turn in off the pavement and crunch their way up the short gravel path to the front door but they carried on faded away in the direction of the village sank her hopes goodness it was almost dusk she must have fallen asleep surely john wouldnt be long now she began to worry it was almost half past nine if he wasnt home by ten then she would go to the fence and shout for the howarths ask them to phone the police station for news of her nephew the howarths were always very good about phoning for her she really ought to get a telephone of her own put in before the winter in case of an emergency shed give john until ten oclock no longer the grandfather clock in the corner ticked loudly somehow it was out of place in this modern bungalow but she wouldnt get rid of it you had to cling on to a few things that reminded you of happier days ten to ten elsie harrison sucked her lips it really was getting quite dark outside now she listened hard but there did not seem to be anybody about outside at all probably the villagers had taken the policemans advice literally and were all remaining indoors she wondered if the howarths might have their windows shut and be unable to hear her she must do her best to rouse them she reached for her sticks had to exert considerable effort to haul herself up out of the easy chair felt a wave of slight dizziness as she came upright that was her blood pressure but she wasnt going to tell the nurse about her dizzy turns she knew too much about her already she felt for the light switch pressed it down the strip light in the ceiling flickered hesitantly took a second or two before it gave off that dazzling white light that lit up every corner of the room elsie harrison blinked had to wait for her eyes to adjust one unsteady step in the direction of the door and then she stopped gave a little cry of fear the snake was lying on the mat just inside the slightly open back door motionless it might have been dead or a stuffed woollen draughtstopper like those they sold for p down at the church rummage sales except that its eyes moved glittered and winked evilly in the fluorescent lighting the reptile was three feet maybe four feet long olive coloured tapering from the blunt squat snout down to a fine slender tail now it moved almost a lazy stretching of its entire body see just how long i am and im not dead or stuffed im alive elsie harrisons dizziness returned causing her to sway unsteadily and then it passed her heart began to pound as though it were deliberately racing against the ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner triggering off her fear she wanted to scream a piercing cry that would fetch the howarths round on the run but her throat had gone dry and a kind of temporary seizure paralysed her vocal cords she glanced about her the snake barred her escape via the door and she could not reach the window without going near the fearsome intruder just the corner behind the chair she had vacated nowhere else she was trapped keeping her eyes firmly on the reptile she moved awkwardly unsteadily backwards until finally she had the chair between herself and her adversary she was breathing heavily and there was a sharp pain in her chest she leaned on the upholstery clasping a walking stick in either hand wondering if she had the strength to strike a blow if the thing advanced shed darned well have a go if it came any nearer oh please god send john home soon she would have to shout out to warn him when she heard him coming or else he would walk right into it and all she could manage at the moment was a hoarse whisper go away you devil go away the snake did not move just lay there stretched out across the doormat watching her waiting she wondered what kind it was some venomous viper from the swamps of somewhereorother no doubt her flesh crawled and her heartbeat was speeding up even faster hurting her with those fast little hammer blows inside her chest that she had felt this past six months but had kept to herself the light wasnt as bright as it usually was quite dim in fact perhaps the fitting was going due for replacement elsie leaned her full weight on the back of the chair she couldnt stand much longer the pain in her hip had started up viciously but it wasnt as bad as the one in her chest oh lord she couldnt stand it much longer go away you devil and let me sit down dyou hear me go away and then something inside her seemed to explode an agonising pain as though she had been delivered a physical blow throwing her back against the wall behind her she cried out a pathetic little shriek of terror and the dimness turned to blackness she slumped forward and the chair rolled sideways on its flimsy castors elsie harrison pitching headlong unconscious before she hit the floor even then the snake did not move possibly there was a slight change of reptilian expression on its blunt features one of puzzlement it was after nine oclock before the shotguncarrying searchers had finished combing the moorland above stainforth hot and weary their feet painful after the necessity of wearing kneelength protective rubber boots disillusioned the dogs lay panting licking at tufts of grass in the hope of obtaining a droplet of moisture but there was none a barren wilderness where only the heather and bracken survived bilberry bushes loaded with red fruit that would ripen in a month or so the domain of the grouse and the buzzard even the freeranging sheep preferring the lower slopes where there were patches of shade to be found john price had had his misgivings from the start a feeling that one sometimes got that it was all going to be a waste of time you sensed you were in the wrong place but with no alternative you had to start somewhere the snakes were definitely not on the moor unless they had gone to ground somewhere and it was unlikely that every one of the escaped eight reptiles would have done that of course the dogs had no idea what they were hunting they could not be expected to they were the sacrificial victims it was inevitable that should one of them come upon a reptile it would attack in ignorance and get bitten there was no other way canine lives were expendable human lives were not they beat out the threethousandacre triangular moorland from its apex the furthermost point john had to agree with colonel marks that that was the logical thing to do even though the slight breeze was blowing towards the ragged line of police and army you knew then when you finally arrived at the rocky outcrop overlooking stainforth village that the poisonous reptiles were not on the moor a process of elimination tomorrow it would be the grassy slopes down to the arable land that would be thrashed out on day three it would be the barley and oilseed rape fields and after that nightfall was the snakes greatest ally they could have been lying low further down by day and with the coming of darkness they might start to move upwards so tomorrow whilst the searchers toiled down below their prey could be safely ensconced several hundred feet above them up on the moorland but not all of them john price was adamant about that they were not hunting a flock of snakes rather six very different species the pairs would stay together in all probability but nobody really knew they could only guess the killers were in a strange alien environment and there was no way of knowing how they might react there was no book of rules to consult john heard the whine of the helicopters again the choppers were flying low sweeping the grassy slopes determined not to give up until the light was gone altogether a long shot but when lives were at stake you played every card you had well have to call it a day the sweatgrimed colonel was polishing his spectacles dejection in his tone head bowed as though their failure to find the snakes was a personal affront to his own rank and status well make an early start in the morning am everybody assemble at the police station its the hillsides and slopes tomorrow working back towards the village the choppers will be out before then scouring we can only hope chief inspector watts nodded but declined to comment everybody knew the position the colonel had said everything there was to be said surely the reptiles had to show up somewhere the worrying factor was just where it was when john price disembarked from the camouflaged army land rover and began to walk the length of the village in the direction of aunt elsies bungalow his feet dragged but mentally he was still alert on a balmy summer evening such as this he would have expected to see families enjoying the late evening in deckchairs in their gardens or taking a stroll before going to bed the main street was deserted lights showing in some of the houses on either side he passed the rising sun the beergarden at the side was deserted an air of desolation about the array of whitepainted tables and chairs an empty glass tipped over with insects crawling inside it after the dregs you had the feeling that it had been like that since yesterday that nobody had ventured out there stay indoors and be safe never mind the stifling atmosphere thats a small price to pay for your life there were people in the bar he heard their voices and the wafting aroma of beer almost tempted him inside god he could swallow a pint of lager at one go but the thought of his aunt all alone dissuaded him she would doubtless be worrying probably had been all day and he was later than he had anticipated the trouble with elsie harrison was that she was always so precise what time will you be home john even when he just popped out for a quick half between ten and half past meant she started looking out for him at five to ten he had not failed to notice the pack of lowalcohol shandies lined up on the shelf in the fridge a subtle move on her part to keep him in at nights depriving him of that one halfhour of freedom down at the rising sun but nobody had bargained for this crisis and john price would stay in stainforth until every one of those poisonous creatures was accounted for he noted that the livingroom and kitchen lights were on in the bungalow experienced a fleeting sense of guilt like the times he used to come and stay when he was a teenager and hed been to a disco at the hall which did not finish until the earlyhours and a fatigued aunt elsie was waiting up for him you know i cant possibly go to sleep until youre safe back john emotional blackmail he pushed open the gate and his booted feet crunched on the gravel next door was in darkness and their car wasnt parked outside where it usually was probably they had done what quite a lot of the residents had done fled stainforth until it was all over you couldnt blame anybody for that john wished there was somewhere his aunt could go in the meantime but he knew only too well that no way would aunt elsie be persuaded to vacate her home not even in the threat of a nuclear war this is the place ill die in john she had told him some time ago the only time ill leave here is when they carry me out feet first he slowed his step saw the light shafting out through the partly open back door now that was naughty of her hadnt he reminded her before he left that morning to keep all doors and windows shut he pushed open the door saw the empty kitchen a plate and cup on the draining board silence except for the hum of the fridge even those oversweet commercial shandies would be welcome right now aunt elsie he called im back no answer still she was becoming a trifle hard of hearing even if she refused to admit it she was probably asleep in the armchair in the other room i didnt hear you come in john what time is it the clock on the cooker read he strode to the door which led through to the livingroom that was open a few inches too he flung it wide and stood aghast petrified at the scene which greeted him his brain struggling to accept what his eyes saw the old lady was dead there was no doubt about that she lay face downwards on the carpet her white hair having flipped out of that bun spraying across her head and shoulders in the manner of a shroud which tried to hide the corpse it covered the grandfather clock ticked loudly steadily mournfully even as his brain registered shock he saw the snake it was on the mat only a few inches from his feet a long length of serpent that did not move just saw and was afraid because it had wandered out of its own environment into the domain of man john price did not hesitate he stooped and with one lightning movement he grabbed it just below the head scooped it up and held it out at arms length felt its futile struggles begin its helpless wriggles you bastard he hissed of all the land youve got to roam in peace you have to come in here and kill an old lady swiftly he carried it across the kitchen to the open back door and with one deft movement he hurled it out into the night watched the shadows swallow up the fourfootlong thrashing creature heard it thud softly on to the lawn he stood there in the doorway trembling and feeling slightly sick then he came to a decision and with feet that dragged he began to retrace his steps down the main street and into the village they were still drinking in the rising sun nobody could blame them for that but when you had a personal tragedy you instinctively resented the way life went on without so much as a hiccup only a few lights showed in the houses now bed was a good place to be and in your own house with the doors locked you felt safe you kept your feet under the sheets even on a hot night because that way nothing could come up from under the bed and entwine your ankle slither up you and bite you you still around there was sarcasm and resentment in pc aylotts voice as john price entered the office the constable was checking out a sheet of snake sightings ten of them inevitable but all figments of the imagination maybe some of them were hoaxes but they all had to be checked out there was a minority of the general public that was a bloody nuisance when any major crisis cropped up sensation seekers downright bloody liars and a sprinkling of idiots who overreacted elsie harrisons dead john thought his voice seemed to come from somewhere a long way away a whisper that echoed mocked dead dead dead the policemans expression altered his pale blue eyes narrowing thin lips barking one word a question how a snake johns ears were roaring his tongue felt dry and swollen she a snake aylott stiffened and his expression said you better not be lying laddie because ive got a whole sheet of reports here that are downright timewasting fucking lies it was only a grass snake the others voice was low but he had got it back under control got lost or maybe it was just curious there could be any one of a dozen reasons anyway it must have wandered into the house and and it gave my aunt a heart attack i see ken aylott stared at the wall beyond his visitor tried not to show his disappointment and anger this was all he needed a harmless snake adding to his problems the villagers would panic he needed to catch some sleep too you killed it no i threw it outside you didnt kill it there wasnt any point not even after it had killed my aunt how the hell was it supposed to know everybody would be scared of it when in all probability it was terrified itself ill come back with you and take a look aylott stood up sighed and kids like this got degrees for studying bloody snakes he reflected so what the hell am i doing working the clock round as a village bobby and cant even get promotion chapter keith doyle had overcome the depression of the unemployed this last six weeks no longer did he feel a reject tossed on to the scrap heap a leech on society every week when he collected his benefit you could sit around for ever waiting for something to crop up but if you had any bottle you got up off your arse and did what muhammad was eventually forced to do the idea of a gardening round appealed to him it was creative and you could see something for your efforts with two fulltime gardeners already in stainforth there didnt seem much chance of edging in but keith had already spotted both their weaknesses there was a niche awaiting the right man old fred stokes was an experienced gardener but he was a stubborn old bugger you took him on for ј an hour but he was the boss some folks liked their lawns cut short and kept that way but fred maintained that you needed a minimum of half an inch of grass growth at all times so that was what you got whether you liked it or not he did everything his way the evershams preferred their rose beds dug over twice a year but fred insisted on hoeing them instead because he claimed that digging damaged the roots of the bushes and if you sacked fred then you only had one alternative william unless of course you decided to look after your own horticulture anyway the evershams got rid of fred eventually because peter eversham was another guy who liked his own way william was big and strong approaching forty and as willing a worker as you would find anywhere a workhorse that toiled eight hours a day for ј an hour but he had difficulty in distinguishing weeds from flowers if in doubt pull it out was his motto he weeded laboriously but if he left a tuft or two of unsightly grass sticking up in the border then it didnt really matter if you wanted some planting done then you had to be sure to instruct william to weed the border first he had been sacked by the willetts because he planted the autumn bulbs straight into a weedcovered bed neither was he particular about raking where he had trodden so even if you got your border weeded it looked as if some of farmer masons cows had wandered in off the road and trampled it down for you so keith doyle struck a middle course for ј an hour you got the job done as you wanted it and tidily finished much to old freds chagrin keith took over up at the evershams and the recommendation of the wealthy company director fed to him getting regular weekly gardening jobs at four other executivestyle dwellings in stainforths commuterbelt with the summer at its height the weeds and hedges growing prolifically keith doyle was grossing ј per week it would slow down in the winter months of course but doubtless the likes of the evershams would be glad of a general handyman to do odd jobs about the place youre asking for trouble lurking about in weedcovered borders pc aylott had stopped him on his way to the evershams that morning and run a suspicious eye over the old vans tyres the snakes could be anywhere ill watch out for em keith smiled ran his fingers through his mop of unruly red hair and mocked the policeman with his clear blue eyes chop em in half with the hoe on your own head be it aylott turned away called back over his shoulder neither a hoe nor five a levels are much of a protection against pythons and rattlesnakes keith dismissed the policeman from his mind the other had a chip on his shoulder because he hadnt got sergeants stripes and thought the people of stainforth were a community of country bumpkins maybe the force were just trying to cool aylotts ardour by leaving him in stainforth didnt want him getting officious when promotion finally came his way and in the meantime he was getting up everybodys nose the young man turned in through the stonepillared gateway that was the entrance to the large black and white timbered residence where peter eversham and his wife lived the jag wasnt parked in front of the house so maybe the owner had left early for the city or else cynthia his blonde attractive second wife had persuaded him to take her to a hotel well away from stainforth until the snakes had all been shot that was ok by keith except that he would not be paid until they returned he parked his van opened up the back to get at his tools a good gardener always carries his own tools he told everybody not like fred stokes virtually demanding that his employers carry a full range of implements and that every one bore the spear and jackson trademark he pulled out a long threepronged hoe held it spearlike yes ill chop the buggers in half if i sec em now what was that ditty they used to recite at school about snakes oh yes he remembered it now chanted aloud old king nick had a sixfoot dick he showed it to the lady next door she thought it was a snake and hit it with a rake and now its only two foot four keith laughed snakes didnt worry him much because it was most unlikely that they would be hanging around the village they would be up on the moors he could hear a helicopter in the distance best of luck mate as he started work on the circular border adjacent to the large lush green front lawn a more serious expression had him pursing his lips he saw in his mind kirsten his twentyyearold darkhaired girlfriend kirstens father was a bank manager in the city a real snob and thought his daughter could do better for herself than latch on to a jobbing gardener even one with a string of a levels they were putting pressure on kirsten to finish with keith and keith had an additional problem one that might bring matters to a head make or break his relationship with the girl kirstens period was a week overdue and last night she had been almost distraught about it i could be pregnant she had sobbed on the verge of panic you know how regular i am as a rule it could be due to a lot of things he had replied but didnt give any reasons because he couldnt think of any youll probably start tomorrow and if i dont well the day after then a lot of help you are daddy will murder me you too you know how he disapproves of you just because i dont have a desk job and ive decided to work rather than just sit around on my bum like thousands of other unemployed youths he doesnt see it that way he says youre an embarrassment to him especially now youre doing the evershams garden because the evershams are important customers at his bank big deal keith felt icy fingers clutching at his heart kirsten being wrenched from him by parents who had dominated her all her life maybe your folks would like me to do their garden for them youre impossible she snapped anyway i dont think youre pregnant you dont think she almost screamed and what do you know about it but ill tell you this keith we continue going out together and if i let you have sex with me again youre going to wear something every time none of this not taking precautions a few days either side of my period if i have another period keith would have liked to phone kirsten this morning just to put his mind at rest or otherwise he could have gone into the house to make the call there was a key kept just inside the garage but he would have to think about it it was something that would require a certain amount of courage kirsten worked at the drapery shop in town and mrs holloway the proprietor was a peculiar old bird i dont like my staff having private calls during working hours keith decided he would leave it a bit think about it some more in the end he would probably wait until tonight meet kirsten down by the church if she came lately there were too many bloody ifs to everything he attacked the weeds a legacy from old freds days a marvellous tool the hoe cutting them all out you either left them to wither and die in the sun or else you raked them up and carted them away in the barrow keith did the latter ten oclock was baittime bait was a cup of tea out of a flask and a sandwich keith ate the rest of his sandwiches at half past twelve and by six he was ravenous for the cooked meal which his mother had on the table on his return home he had lived with his mother in stainforth ever since his schooldays his father had run off with a young village girl when keith was ten and they had not heard from peter doyle since keith was sweating profusely as he sat on the edge of the lawn sipping his tea he looked up at the sky a gunblue universe with not so much as a wisp of white cloud in sight the farming weather forecast on sunday lunchtime had predicted dry and hot for the whole week time to get going again he peeled off his shirt dropped it down on the grass he did not have the inclination to walk back to the van just take your time youve got all day and its going to get hotter the ground was hardbaked every weed required a good pull to free it toss it clear of the soil he wondered again about kirsten a lot of girls had had their futures ruined by this kind of class consciousness sheer bloody snobbery he would fight for her every inch of the way sod it she was twenty old enough to please herself an adult but when you were brainwashed indoctrinated age didnt matter some people got into the habit of doing whatever anybody told them throughout their entire lives he wondered what would happen if she was pregnant her old man would go up the wall but that wouldnt remove the baby from inside her unless god he wouldnt make her have an abortion would he legalised murder the bastard would keith knew he would and it made him angry had him chopping viciously at a clump of chickweed hed like a baby a son or a daughter he didnt care which one day he would have one in the meantime he needed the flat hoe on this chickweed he dropped the one he was using heard it rattle on the hard ground picked up the other the hoe rattled again it was some seconds before he looked round before he realised that the hoe should not have rattled a second time could not possibly have rolled and clanked again even then he did not spot the lurking creature right away and when he made it out amongst a thick growth of weed he could not be absolutely sure what it was unsuspecting he stood there just staring at it at first he thought it was a frog or a toad light coloured with dark markings giving it a kind of slimy slippery look in the bright sunshine he peered closer noticed that it tailed off back into the undergrowth that what he had mistaken for a frog was only its head that it had a body attached to it a long thick one that went on and on partially screened from his vision so that he could only hazard a guess at its length several feet for sure keiths mouth went dry and there seemed to be a constriction in his throat he met those eyes felt an inexplicable force boring into him numbing him a slight shifting of that lengthy body as it began to uncoil a noise that reminded him of a football rattle on the terraces when he went along to watch united play at home the sound broke the spell brought him back to reality a jumble of warnings pc aylotts curt sarcastic tones the snakes could be anywhere he leapt backwards landed on the lawn caught his feet in the shirt which he had thrown carelessly down fell extricated himself burst into headlong flight and behind him he heard that rattling angrier and faster now like faroff bursts of machinegun fire trying to gun him down running blindly anywhere his panic like a coronary attack thudding in his chest he heard his heartbeat his pulses thudding a roaring in his ears sweat lathering his naked torso he did not look back dared not waste a second off the lawn and on to the drive the van was too far away it would have to be the garage pull the shutter down as you go through oh jesus christ i hope its flush with the floor because if theres a gap then im trapped the reptile was close behind him he didnt look he knew he felt its vibrations like a sack of loose beads its malevolence and determination to overtake him an anticipation of pain as it struck an agony that would have him writhing and screaming on the tarmac drive helpless as it struck again and again its vile body close to his own those evil eyes watching his death throes almost there he reached up for the handle of the shutter as he ran beneath it tugged downwards with all his strength for one terrible moment he thought it had jammed or that perhaps for some reason peter eversham had fitted a locking device to stop kids from playing with it keith almost yelled his relief out loud as the shutter began to move almost silently on its oiled mechanism gathering speed downwards clattering only then did keith doyle look back had a momentary view of his pursuer before the shutter crashed down to the floor saw a reptile that was close on six feet in length lightcoloured with distinctive dark diamond markings looking like the personification of evil in serpent form it rattled viciously was still some yards from the garage keiths lead had been greater than he had dared to believe he had won by a clear length temporarily anyway one awful thought that the shutter might bounce back up or not close properly he anticipated a metallic bang as it hit the floor instead there was a welloiled click a mechanical sound as though levers had slotted into place the door locked held and there was not so much as a sliver of daylight showing beneath it he leaned back against the wall thought that he was going to faint and buckled his knees into a crouching position in anticipation of blacking out the feeling passed he closed his eyes could not shut out a mental picture of that rattlesnake saw again its anger and its hatred for man heard its deathly rattle sweat poured off him the bloody thing had been lying in wait for him amongst the weeds and if he had not decided to change hoes and thrown the first one behind him disturbing and frightening the rattlesnake as it waited to strike then he would not have forced it to give a warning rattle so close but he had been given those few vital seconds grace which was the difference between life and death jesus christ almighty ill chop em in half with the hoe if i see em like fuck you will you stupid bugger his nerves were calming his heart was not beating nearly so fast the roaring in his ears had lessened and he had almost stopped shaking he began to think logically that key it was up on the first shelf inside that tin of nails he stood up lifted the tin down and had to put pressure on the lid to force it off good the key was there a front door one oh shitfire and holy moses frustration anger he closed his hand over the yale key would have crushed it to a piece of twisted metal if he had had the strength he didnt so he flung it at the wall watched it bounce on the floor and land in a patch of sticky oil far better had there been no key hidden in the garage at all than this one that built his hopes and then destroyed them a few seconds later for this was a front door key and to reach the front door it would be necessary to go out across the drive where undoubtedly the snake still lay waiting the back door which was in the patio at the rear of the garage and could be reached without going outside was almost certainly locked so certain that it was a waste of time even checking it youre a cunt peter eversham doyle closed his eyes clenched his fists you might be rich and clever but youre a stupid prick a feeling that he might cry that he had only to let himself go and he would burst into a flood of unstoppable tears he nearly did but that like that key lying in the oilleaks from evershams jag was just another waste of time stop panicking and think logically first youre safe no way can that snake get to you second somebodys got to come looking for you eventually even if the evershams have gone to stay overnight somewhere then mothers going to get anxious come teatime shell give you half an hour then shell phone pc aylott they know youre here and your vans stuck out at the front so when you hear them youve only got to give a shout the rattlesnake will probably get bored with waiting and slither off somewhere you just have to sit it out and my flask and sandwiches are out there in the van he settled down on his haunches to wait wished that he could doze to pass the time but when theres one of the deadliest snakes in the world sitting guard outside your stifling prison sleep does not come easily he looked at his watch and groaned am seven bloody hours before mother starts to get worried it was some time before he noticed the tiny circular hole in the shuttered door about halfway up and the size of one of those spyholes which they manufacture for house doors so that the occupants can identify a caller before opening up a circle of daylight made to take the hook on the end of the rod standing in the corner an easy means of pushing up or pulling down the shutter and also a spyhole he went over to it put his eye to it restricted vision but he could see all he wanted to see or rather everything that he did not want to the rattlesnake had not gone away it had retired to the small low rockery which bordered one side of the drive and had curled itself up on a flat piece of stone a casual observer might even have overlooked it until it was too late the reptile appeared to be asleep basking in the warmth of the midday sun perhaps it was but keith had read enough about snakes to know that this one would be awake and poised to strike a lethal blow in a matter of a second no way was he prepared to risk making a run for it relax youve got a long wait ahead of you pm the rattler was still there on the rockery stone keith peeped out at it shuddered it seemed to see him but that was impossible the piercing eyes glared met his im in no hurry man i can wait a week if i have to youll either die of starvation in there or else make a run for it and take your chance with me why not give it a try see if you can make it to your van no way im ok in here and if eversham doesnt come back soon then the police will come looking for me theyll have guns theyll blast you to hell if youve any sense youll get the fuck out of here whilst theres still time well see the long body moved slightly settled into a more relaxed coiled position an air of permanence about it it might even have been asleep keiths thoughts moved back to kirsten oh christ he wanted to sec her tonight more than he had done any other night and that bastard out there was stopping him his gaze alighted on a shovel propped up in the corner and he wondered if it was any match for a western diamondback if nobody came then hed give it a try use it as a shield to keep the fangs at bay then a swift chopping movement for the kill he wondered what a beheaded snake looked like did the body keep on squirming like a worms when you cut it in half sever the head then chop the rest up into little lengths let them all wriggle together whatever he had to see kirsten tonight he must have slipped into an uneasy doze because suddenly he was sitting bolt upright eyes darting about the gloom of the stifling garage what was that that fucking rattler hadnt managed to find a way in for christs sake had he fear chilled his sweat had him cowering back against the wall he heard the rattle a steady clicking like slow castanets menacing no the bugger wasnt in here but it was certainly active outside even as he moved back to his spyhole in the shutters keith doyle heard the sound of an approaching vehicle the drone of a highpowered engine out on the road slowing almost stopping turning into the wide driveway and suddenly he wanted to yell his jubilation aloud theyre here you fucking snake bastard theyve arrived and youve left it too late youll be blasted to pulp a sudden cooling of doyles celebrations a foreboding that sent a warning chill up and down his spine oh my god they wont know the rattlers there ive got to warn them he watched waited until the approaching vehicle came into his arc of vision recognised the sleek white jaguar eversham at the wheel the blonde at his side puzzled expressions saying something to each other the gardener did not need to lipread to know what they were saying now who the bloody hells shut the garage up and whats doyles van doing here at this time of day keith thought for a moment they were going to swerve and pull up in front of the porch instead the car came straight on eased up to within a foot of the garage shutter and stopped with the engine ticking over the occupants were talking again obviously puzzled keith switched his gaze from the car to the large flat rockery stone the one on which the rattler had lain for the past seven hours the snake was not there any longer there was just the lump of rough stone with creeping plants growing all around it it might never have been this terrible day might have been just a sweltering feverish nightmare he had to force himself back to reality thrust away the role of spectator that diamondback was cunning it had slid off into the surrounding cover was lying there waiting to strike sensing easy prey the car door clicked smoothly open and keith doyle saw the powerful figure of peter eversham about to emerge chapter peter eversham was a stone overweight but disguised it with his height well built the hallmark of the affluent a slightly flushed complexion which he told everybody was due to his outdoor activities certainly not blood pressure sleek dark hair brushed straight back a neatly clipped moustache his suits handtailored out of a tweedish cloth to enforce his selfstyled country squire role and strengthen his claim to chairmanship of the stainforth parish council he rented the grouse shooting on stainforth moor fished for salmon in scotland and played golf on wednesdays and sundays he was president of the stainforth country club which was set in its own grounds two miles outside the village and had very little to do with stainforth eversham owned the eversham engineering company limited with its three subsidiary companies he had made his first million in and doubled that by whilst other businesses foundered eversham engineering appeared to flourish during the recession cynthia had insisted on accompanying him down to the sales conference in sussex she had her reasons her suspicions about those overnight stops of her husbands in brighton but nothing untoward had occurred even so cynthia was not fully convinced peter needed an eye kept on him there were too many rumours allegations for her liking and if they had not been founded on truth then almost certainly peter eversham would have sued somebody for slander he issued writs in the way that many people send greetings cards in the festive season cynthia told herself that if peter could have an extramarital affair with herself behind his first wifes back then he was equally capable of deceiving her they had read about the escaped snakes in the morning paper before leaving brighton on the way home they had listened to several bulletins on the car radio doubtless the media have blown it up out of all proportion eversham was in the fast lane doing watching his mirror in case a police car hove into view they had experimented using helicopters to trap speeding motorists some time ago and he was on the alert for those also with two endorsements already on his licence he could not risk a third the devil of it all will be the crowds of sightseers that will converge on stainforth the bloody place will look like butlins on august bank holiday but theres no getting away from the fact that there are snakes on the loose around stainforth cynthia eversham was tense more so today than she usually was when sitting in the passenger seat alongside her husband couldnt we have stopped over in brighton until next week whilst the cats away the mice will play he laughed i dont like leaving my business interests in the care of other people longer than is absolutely necessary you mean youre playing golf tomorrow she smiled cynically to herself she was at last beginning to understand the man she had married subtle selfish and above all ruthless they left the motorway picked up a sign for stainforth miles cynthias mouth was dry there was a churning in her stomach that was not wholly due to carsickness if there was one thing that repelled her it was the thought of snakes ugh she recalled that time when she was five and her parents had taken her to the zoo she had not wanted to go into the reptile house but shed had no choice those snakes they all looked the same slimy and squirmy and when one slithered up to the glass of the case she was staring into she had gone hysterical adults didnt understand her mother had grabbed her slapped her and told her not to be so stupid stupid even now she sometimes had nightmares about those vipers waking up in the middle of the night in cold fear certain that there were cold slippery serpents wriggling about in the bed home sweet home peter slowed had to take a wide sweep to negotiate their own drive entrance because a shabby old caravanette handpainted in a bilious orange colour was parked on the verge by the stone pillars several more vehicles were lining the village street the sightseers have arrived i see hey whats doyle still doing here at this time he finishes at five maybe he had a late start she replied uninterestedly and the garage shutters are down he was annoyed because he wanted to drive straight into the garage as i said you cant leave other people unsupervised for long the jaguar rolled to a halt in front of the garage eversham felt an urge to blast the horn fetch that gardener on the run from whatever he was doing ask him what the bloody hell was going on instead he eased open the drivers door began to swing himself out and that was when he heard the banging on the inside of the garage door the steel shutter vibrating somebody was shouting mr eversham mr eversham don i get out of your car theres a rattlesnake on the rockery peter eversham froze heard the words but their meaning did not sink in he recognised keith doyles voice but what the blazes was the stupid bugger doing inside the garage with the shutter down and another thing what the fucking hell was wrong with the car a noise as though the exhaust had suddenly come loose was banging and rattling on the underside but it couldnt the car was stationary peter cynthia eversham screamed panicked and grabbed her husbands arm overbalanced him back into the seat what the even as he fell he saw the snake a thing like a thick painted hosepipe darting out from beneath the jag its vicious strike missing him and pinging on the inside of the open door cynthia was yelling shrieking hysterically and then the car door obeyed the laws of gravity swung softly shut on the slight incline clicked jesus god it was a snake peter it tried to for christs sake shut up he pushed her away and in the same movement eased the handbrake off felt the car begin to roll slowly backwards and as it did so the occupants heard something happening beneath them that frantic rattling sound again interspersed with lashing noises as if a horse whip was flaying mercilessly on the underside of the car still rolling backwards cynthia screamed clutched at her seat saw that vile lightcoloured reptile with the black diamond markings thrashing frenziedly on the tarmac in front of them it wriggled tried to leap fell back squirmed and convulsed turned its repulsive head towards them as if mouthing insane reptilian curses but something was wrong with it even in her state of terror she saw its injury the lower part of its body crushed and flattened like the hose that time when doyle had washed the car for them and had left it lying on the drive and she had backed over it oh my god she was going to be sick any second peter youve run over it he jerked the handbrake back on halted the car then started the engine drove forward in a wide sweep that took him to the front of the house alongside doyles parked van he killed the engine glanced in his mirror the rattler was thrashing fiercely from side to side rattling and hissing its pain and fury but it wasnt going anywhere peter dont get out stay where you bloody well are he slammed the car door and ran for the porch fumbling for his key breathlessly he leapt up the stairs on to the landing into the bedroom fumbling under the bed pulling out a dusty legomutton leather gun case his trembling fingers scarcely capable of undoing the straps metal clinked as he fitted barrels and stock together slapped the wooden foreend into place to hold them together grabbed some orangecased bore cartridges out of a carton on top of the wardrobe spilling the rest on to the carpet back down the stairs loading the gun as he went almost slipping on the polished wooden blocks of the hall floor outside seeing cynthia still sitting in the car hands pressed to her pallid face in fear and anguish mouthing something at him shut up you stupid bitch the diamondback was still very much alive it was throwing itself from side to side manoeuvring a course towards the front door propelling its awesome body in spite of its terrible injuries malevolently rattling its hate for the man who had done this to it only one thing was uppermost in its paincrazed mind to kill peter eversham was trembling as he lifted the shotgun to his shoulder a biggame hunter suddenly faced with a charging wounded water buffalo its life or his there would only be one survivor he had his life in his hands ten yards maybe less he tried to draw a bead on the head but it darted from one side to the other dodged away from the shaking twin barrels as though it knew oh christ so different from driven grouse that couldnt fight back five yards he swung his sights on to the body the lower damaged part that dragged behind the rest took a trigger pressure a deafening blast and somewhere in the background he heard his wife screaming saw the snake jerk and roll seem to twist back on itself as though it was trying to view the damage at that range the concentrated shot charge was still strung together had cut through skin and tissue almost severed the lower body a slimy pulp streaked the tarmac and in that split second peter eversham finally got his bead on the head the left barrel leaden death obliterating the rattlesnakes head throwing it back into the morass behind its nerves twitching and then it was still it was dead eversham lowered the smoking gun opened the breech and the spent cartridge cases were ejected bounced on the drive he stood there experienced a euphoria that was only just beginning to make its heady impact on him a pose he was reluctant to relinquish the hunter looking down on his trophy awaiting the arrival of his bearers the garage shutters slid upwards and keith doyle emerged whitefaced eversham thought the gardener might spew up just to complete the picture cynthia still had her face covered look at it you two look at it its dead and i killed it me peter eversham theyve been hunting the bastards for two days but they didnt do any good until i returned well done mr eversham a cry of relief the young redhaired man having to hold on to the car swaying unsteadily on his feet it trapped me in the garage we better get the police i think this is them now peter eversham heard the beeboraf an approaching siren anticipated the white escort turning into the drive he shifted his pose slightly cradling the gun beneath his arm sporting style take a good look you guys i just did what youve failed to do send the press lets get the record straight nobodys stealing my thunder i got him he told pc aylott as the constable climbed out of the car its a rattler a western diamondback i know because i once saw a tv programme about them hes dead all right aylott approached the shotblasted mulch with some trepidation he is peter eversham still stood there holding his gun jesus christ where were the bloody newshounds they were quick enough off the mark when some randy vicar or other ran off with the vergers wife used rolls of film and gave it front page spread but when somebody shoots a dangerous reptile in an english village they dont want to know theres two rattlers the officer stepped back idve thought being a pair they would have stuck together search parties have spent two days combing the moors and the slopes without seeing so much as a good old british adder sunning itself in the heather then they were looking in the wrong place eversham just checked himself from speaking his thoughts aloud the snakes are hanging about the village right under your bloody noses and you havent twigged it yet a man with a gun who knows what hes about might have far more success than hundreds of police and soldiers ill have to leave this for the experts to come and have a look at aylott turned back towards his vehicle ill go and let the super know at once and not a bloody word of well done or thank you eversham reflected as he stood there watching the constable reverse out into the road cynthia was getting out of the jaguar trying not to look at the remains of the rattler doyle was back in his van eversham glanced down at his gun a holland and holland side lock royal the ultimate in english gunmaking a beautifully balanced and efficient weapon if you knew how to use it it killed every time grouse or snakes he looked up at the sky there were a good three hours of daylight left yet the perfect evening for a quiet mooch round the hedgerows bordering the barley and oilseed rape fields in the hope of a shot at an unwary rabbit or a deadly snake chapter peter eversham moved furtively along the straggling hawthorn hedge just inside the field of growing barley that was showing the first signs of ripening his every movement was that of the accomplished stalker one who wished to see and yet not be seen neither by the snakes he hunted nor his fellowmen his gun gave him a new sense of power one that he had not fully appreciated until now man was a hunter by nature but it did not end there he was a born predator even though civilisation had attempted to eradicate it from the species all part of a marxist plot to bring about a revolution they branded the hunting and shooting fraternity as upperclass barbarians overlooking the fact that thousands of ordinary working men enjoyed field sports use an emotive lever to prise the capitalist clique apart and the masses will join the ranks evershams lips curled into a contemptuous smile those opposed to killing ought to be here in stainforth right now and theyd soon change their minds he wondered how that fellow cousins who lived in the village and was always writing the predictable emotive antibloodsports letters to the papers was feeling at this moment cowering indoors doubtless listening in to every radio and tv bulletin to find out if the hunters had accounted for any of the snakes yet tallyho go get em you chaps and well forgive you so long as you dont go back to killing foxes when its ail over cousins was a convener in one of the factories in the city a troublemaker had instigated a strike only a few weeks back over some petty formality in his spare time he campaigned against blood sports and was anti anything that people enjoyed doing eversham had had his own brushes with the unions and on a couple of occasions he had dug his heels in and won if necessary he would shut his business down and take early retirement it suits me he had told a shop steward its you chaps wholl lose out i can sell my premises and machinery and put my feet up your chaps will just be out of a job please yourself now he was going to make the headlines again he paused alongside the overgrown hawthorn hedge took stock of his surroundings there was too much damned cover the barley waist high and reaching right up to the hedge a fox could sit and watch you from a few yards away and you would have no idea it was there or a snake he thought about moving on up to the grassland beyond but the reptiles were unlikely to be where they could be spotted easily they would be in the thickest cover maybe he should have fetched kell the springer spaniel from the kennels where he had been boarded whilst the evershams were away kell had a keen nose he was able to scent out a skulking shrew anything that breathed he found it was too late now eversham must play a lone hand he pondered on a plan of action assume that the snakes were in the barley in all probability they would not be found round the edge but would be deep in the stalky growth it was no good blundering through it they would hear him coming and either slink out of the way or else attack a sudden ambush yet there was a way modern farming methods and the use of poisonous chemicals caused barren patches of ground amidst the crops destroyed the vital minerals in the soil and created minideserts in the seemingly lush growth akin to clearings in a forest find one of these and take up a position there vision on all sides no chance of being attacked from behind and he trembled with excitement if he imitated a rabbit squeal from time to time one of those reptiles was sure to come on the run easy enough the same way that you fooled a fox on a summer evening you sucked the back of your hand noisily and it sounded like a wounded or snared rabbit squealing old kenning the gamekeeper had taught him how to do it now he would put that knowledge to good use peter eversham moved forward into the growing barley it swished loudly as it yielded a passage for him springing back into place swaying and rustling he was decidedly uneasy the shotgun held at hiplevel safetycatch pushed forward christ you couldnt see to shoot anything in here you wouldnt see a snake until dont think about it theyll probably be scared to hell if they hear you take off in the opposite direction or attack something moved to his right three or four yards away sent the ears of corn swinging oh god he halfturned had the gun to his shoulder in readiness beads of sweat forming on his forehead all in the imagination your nerves are stretched dont let em you are the hunter out here peter eversham you have a weapon far more lethal than the deadliest snake in the world he took another step forward and the corn rustled again a sound as if the wind was blowing yet heavier a small body crashing through the forest of stalks screened from his view he almost panicked and fired blindly ive got a gun you bastard dont you come anywhere near me then sudden relief a releasing of pentup breath lowering the gun whatever it was it was darting away in the opposite direction a rabbit probably or a hare now there was a sense of urgency about peter evershams movements crashing his way through the ripening crop searching desperately for a clearing somewhere he had gone about a hundred yards before he found one to his liking not quite as big as he had hoped possibly five or six yards in diameter but it would do he might blunder around all evening without finding exactly what he was looking for and time was not on his side he settled down on his haunches tried not to notice that he was trembling slightly and glanced up at the sky the sun was low in the west perhaps an hour and a half away from dusk hed give it an hour no more the last thing he wanted was to be walking back through that barley in the dark he waited five minutes time to let anything that had heard his noisy passage forget about it then he pressed his lips to the back of his hand and began to suck it wasnt easy but after several attempts he produced a fair imitation of the squeals of a terrified or injured rabbit dont overdo it rabbits dont squeal continually kenning had said give a call every few minutes eversham was desperate for a smoke he resisted the temptation until his keen memory churned out something he had read somewhere or maybe seen in a tv documentary something about wildfowl hunters in the fens during the last century carrying burning peat to mask any scent they gave off perhaps then a cigarette would be to his advantage and anyway didnt most of the old biggame hunters in africa always smoke a big foulsmelling pipe he put a cigarette to his lips flicked his lighter and inhaled the smoke gratefully come on you buggers im ready for you half an hour passed the sky was beginning to turn saffron and the only creatures which seemed to have located peter evershams hiding place were swarms of tiny midges their ploy was to hover incessantly over your head and whilst you were swatting at them a small detachment would come in from behind find a patch of exposed flesh and alight on it he blew smoke at them but it did not deter them and when finally they did decide to depart they left him scratching a number of itchy swellings on his neck and ears he tried the rabbit call again much better now it really sounded something like a distressed coney surely a snake in an alien environment wouldnt be able to tell the difference anyway probably had never seen or heard the good old english bunny in its life peter heard a helicopter coming down off the moor crouched low and ducked his head deafening the wind from the vanes wafting the corn flying at no more than twenty feet the machine passed just to his left and he raised his eyes to follow its departure it swung round headed back towards the village what a bloody waste of time he thought if they cant spot me in the barley how the hell can they expect to see the snakes boredom added to the discomfort of his crouched position he found himself studying the engraving on his gun marvelled at the intricacies the workmanship that made english guns the best in the world in the right hands with the right cartridge this gun would kill anything snakes were no exception he had proved that already and he would prove it a second time he had a feeling that he was not going to see the snakes tonight another few minutes and he would pack it in head for home one more cigarette and ill go he sucked his hand once more now that was the best rabbit call he had done all night enough to make a swishing of wings above his head made him start and he was just in time to see a diving sparrow hawk check jink and change direction hard luck you bugger eversham smiled to himself i must be good to fool you you thought you heard your supper squealing but you had one helluva shock the moral of that story is dont take anything for granted the tall corn was beginning to cast its shadows across the small clearing thousands of nodding swaying heads that were to be given a brief few hours rest from the labours of ripening a sunsoaked crop that could be part of mans winter food store grain for malting seed for poultry a source of life and death peter eversham started almost dropped his gun there was a snake directly opposite him its body partly concealed by the barley forest red black and yellow with white rings gaudy with all natures warning colours blended into its scaly skin a black snout eyes that watched unblinking fearlessly full of hate he had not heard its approach not so much as the disturbance of a barley stalk a hunter that had slithered silently in answer to that false cry of pain perhaps had not even been fooled by it had come in search of man a length of ash fell from the cigarette between peter evershams lips powdered on his shirt sweaty hands gripped the gun bring it up slowly dont make a sudden movement dont let it even guess what youre going to do he wondered what species the snake was how fast it was capable of moving right now it didnt look to be in any hurry probably thought it had him for the taking anyway he was trembling so much that he could scarcely draw a bead on the reptile the twin barrels quivering moving from side to side and still the snake did not move the gun bucked the heel of the stock hammering against his shoulder because he held it too loosely a vivid flash lit up the tiny clearing forked lightning that propelled leaden death a report that shattered the stillness went rolling across the landscape towards stainforth its echoes rumbling and dying when they reached the distant moorland the snake slumped forward a coil of bloodied rope that did not so much as twitch pulped unrecognisable harmless the gun was still at peter evershams shoulder he was aware of the pain where it had kicked him but he ignored it just stared in disbelief the patience of the hunter had paid off just when you thought nothing was going to show up your prey emerged you could never be certain of anything that was the spice of hunting what drove you on just when you had almost given up company director kills two of the escaped snakes he saw tomorrows newspaper headlines in his imagination a wad of papers on the desk in his office the sun mail express star television interviews describing how he went out and lay in wait lured it with his calling his expertise his knowledge of the ways of the wild but youll have to take the dead snake home to prove it his flesh crept and pimpled a shudder ran right up his spine and into his scalp beneath the deerstalker hat christ i dont have to touch that thing do i of course you do i cant you must else they wont believe you and if you dont take it now you might not find it again foxes might come in the night and eat it company director kills rattler claims he shot a second oh yeah he drew on his cigarette glanced around in the shadows looking for a couple of sticks wondering if somehow he could make a cradle out of them and carry it at arms length yuk but you dont often find sticks in the middle of fields of growing corn he didnt have a piece of string either with which to make a loop to drag over it pull it along behind him he didnt fancy the idea it would be like the creature was pursuing him in the dark swishing along behind him it might not be dead it might bite youre crazy just frightened everybodys entitled to a few fears when it starts to get dark arent they he stood up tried to get his bearings a landscape of silhouettes in the gathering dusk the village on his left the moors starkly outlined above them a mass of deep purple that would merge with the night sky before long and obliterate everything and all around him a sea of corn no distinguishing features christ on a bike ive got to get the fucking thing home somehow its dead it cant hurt you he steeled himself called on every bit of logic he could muster in a mind filled with the human revulsion for reptiles bent forward and stretched out a hand make sure you dont touch the head it wasnt slimy sort of dry and rough to the touch a limp thing that might have been a perished length of garden hose coils of it he could not even hazard a guess at its length as he dragged it out of the barley wondered how long it would take him to reach the village as soon as he came to the road he would drop his burden leave it there for some other bugger to fetch gun in one hand a loop of snake in the other he set off his progress was not easy the corn seeming deliberately to obstruct his passage once he tripped on a stone and almost fell cursed profusely and then without warning the pain hit him blinding agony that began in the calf of his right leg and travelled up his body had him arching his back staggering screaming it was as though every vein were filled with burning acid his limbs stretched to breaking point a fiery haze shimmering before his eyes like an electric storm lighting up the night he dropped the dead snake it fucking well wasnt dead after all oh jesus god its bitten me his brain could not grasp the situation a lifeless halfcoiled reptile thudded to the ground and in its place was a live vicious serpent a multicoloured assailant that thrashed and struck a berserk attacker in the falling darkness striking falling back striking again pursuing his shambling movements hissing its fury peter eversham still had the gun an unfired cartridge in the left barrel he tried to bring it round to bear on the snaking shadow but it was too close between his flailing feet wicked fangs darting upwards his abdomen seemed to contract then expand airborne with the force of the pain pulling that trigger in a last gesture of defiance he heard the report somewhere beyond the roaring in his agonised brain the noise receding rolling away into the distance falling he braced himself as the ground came up to meet him frothing through clenched teeth wideeyed and sightless rolling now prone aware of a constant movement a sharp needle that injected him repeatedly until his nerves were numbed and he felt no more trying to piece everything together but the fragmented logic eluded him a dead snake so how could it have bitten him it was dead all right hed seen it felt it it didnt make sense cynthia she wasnt around anywhere was she or doyle the gardener if doyle was around then why was the garden in such a fucking mess all overgrown like this then not thinking lying there stupefied oblivious to his pain and his injuries sprawled across the shotblasted corpse of a coral snake whilst its mate was trying to reach it the live snakes anger had subsided its killing fury gone as quickly as it had come now its agitation was caused by grief a disbelief that its mate was dead unable to understand rubbing itself on the mutilated body desperately trying to revive it failing peter evershams head fell back and the cigarette which had adhered to his lower lip was dislodged rolling and bouncing away in a shower of sparks coming to rest against a barley stalk fizzing the green growth smouldering giving off a pungent wisp of smoke that had the bereaved coral snake backing off in alarm the sparks were fanned by the faint night breeze burst into a little yellow flame that almost failed grew again and licked out at the next piece of undergrowth catching again spreading the dead mans clothes singed ignited gave off a stench of roasting human flesh death and instant cremation the surviving snake fled terrorstricken before the advancing flames its mate forgotten the strongest instinct of the wild taking over one that had been passed on to it by its mother in a faroff land across the atlantic survival only after that would its thoughts return to revenge chapter john price had remained in the bungalow after they had taken aunt elsies body away simply because he had nowhere else to go a little voice inside his head whispered its your bungalow now john you know very well shes left it to you in her will quite a nice little nestegg for you shut up im not interested oh god what a damnable thing to happen and he couldnt even hate the escaped snakes for it because it was nothing to do with them would have happened anyway elsie harrison had left the back door ajar an inquisitive grass snake had found its way in and as a result she had suffered a heart attack what bloody rotten luck he knew he would stay on in stainforth maybe for quite some time because now he had a home here even if he did not have work for the moment he had a job oh yes help us find these snakes before anybody else gets killed now a western diamondback rattler had been shot in the village and that was going to scare an awful lot of people up on the moors even on the grassy slopes was another world near enough to be interesting but when a rattler turned up in the village itself then folks really began to mess their pants john made himself a cup of coffee knew he had a lot of thinking to do somehow he and the rest of the police and army searchers had got it all wrong they had settled for the obvious the most wild and desolate place ok the rattler could just be one that had stayed behind or two because there was a pair of them according to the inventory so there was certainly another one not too far away he found himself glancing around the kitchen youre getting jumpy john price he had just sipped his coffee when he heard the first fire engine go by a few seconds later another followed in its wake more traffic a police car john price opened the door and that was when he smelled the smoke lifestifling fumes choking burning vegetation the sky was aglow a deep smoky red activity everywhere his eyes smarted it was surely a heath or woodland fire and this was the last thing they needed in stainforth with killer snakes on the loose so much for tomorrows carefully laid plans anything could happen now he closed the door went outside wherever the fire was the smoke could well drive the reptiles out from their hiding places disperse them in all directions and infuriate them being a single parent in a village like stainforth was both a source of embarrassment and bitterness as barbara brown knew only too well tall and lanky she was not badlooking as most of the youths in stainforth agreed but she wasnt the sort of girl you could get worked up over some boasted of having had her after youth club others kept quiet about it respectable parents worried about their sons associating with her to some she was just a joke the village boot as they referred to her but in reality barbara was no local whore merely an unfortunate and misunderstood girl who craved affection and could not find it she had been desperate for a steady boyfriend from the time she reached fifteen and she had grossly misunderstood the attentions of the teenage boys at youth club she genuinely thought that when one of them slipped his arm through hers and led her up behind the ramshackle nissen hut that had served as a youth club since the war ended it was because he felt for her loved her it took her a long time to cotton on to the fact that all the rough element of the local male population were interested in was their own pleasure and that was how it was for three years hopes built and dashed and no chance of a permanent relationship barbaras father had walked out on her mother when barbara was eleven he had an affair with a woman in the next town and he left home to go and five with her betty brown did not seem to care as long as she had enough money to buy forty fags a day every evening she went down to the pub and usually gotair the free booze she wanted there barbara remembered the time her mother brought a boyfriend home bill was several years older than her and unemployed and he used to stop overnight on occasions sharing bettys bed eventually he moved in permanently the young girl felt that she was in the way the hints that a lot of girls leave home and set up in a flat on their own hurt her she would have left if she had had the opportunity but with no money and no job the idea was little more than a pipe dream she was jealous of her mother too how was it that a woman of fortyfive got a steady boyfriend whilst she at seventeen was still searching for a relationship it was on the cards that barbara would get herself pregnant eventually some of stainforths youths had standing bets on it a quid shes got one in the oven before shes eighteen p its a boy and a fiver says its ted growsons but nobody would ever conclusively prove that it was teds because there were three or four of the younger men who would be reluctant to help with an inquiry concerning the fathering of the brown baby and even if they were willing it was very doubtful if anything could be proved conclusively barbara had her baby three months after her seventeenth birthday and it cost george rowley a quid tom sproson forked out p because it was a boy but that fiver was still unclaimed and ted growsons girlfriend had blacked his eye but that did not prove anything life underwent a drastic change for barbara brown after she returned to stainforth from the maternity hospital her own mother didnt want to know the baby if you get doin them kinda things babs then you gotta take the consequences for it betty mumbled from behind her cigarette you can stop ere but dont let that baby get makin a row in the night cause me and bill needs our sleep somehow barbara muddled through relied on inborn maternal instincts to help her in her own way she was happy she had somebody who loved her even if baby michael taxed her patience to its limits often in the night she nursed him to stop him from crying sat up in bed with eyes heavy from lack of sleep because if michael had a screaming fit bill would bang on the flimsy adjoining bedroom wall yelling shuddup but usually on fine days she could catch up on her sleep whilst her son slept in his secondhand pram in the garden overall everything worked out more or less yesterday she had kept him indoors because of the snakes warning they had kept doors and windows closed in accordance with the policemans instructions and michael had been restless crying for long periods and betty had lost her temper dont know what the bloody place is comin to she had screeched you cant go out cause they reckon theres snakes on the loose but i never seen none so we all stops inside and that flamin babby owls his bleedin ead off well we aint standin for this day after day it makes bill proper niggly and then e gets on at me you take it from me babs there aint no snakes in the village if there are any theyre up on the moors you put the babby out tomorrow e wont come to no arm there had been a big fire in the night robertas barley field ablaze the smoke pall hanging over the village so that the inhabitants of stainforth had to keep their windows shut anyway the smoky night air was filled with the demonic howling of fire engine and police sirens everywhere eerily aglow with an orange hue vehicles coming and going all night long by dawn the fire was out but the stench of burning lingered would hang around for days flaked ashes floating in the slight breeze like a black summer snowstorm it wont do michael no good out there barbara had said as she helped herself to the sawdustlike remains of a packet of cornflakes her baby held to her bosom with her free arm seemingly unable to make up his mind which breast he wanted to feed off first bill was still upstairs in bed he rarely put in an appearance before midday it wunna urt im betty brown screwed up her face into her usual expression of perpetual discontentment trouble with babbies today is theyre pampered if e lived in the town then hed have to put up with petrol fumes and the like and learn to like em a bit o smoke never urt nobody billll go mad if e as to put up with im indoors all day again today so with some misgivings barbara wheeled the pram out on to the square of grass at the rear of the council house found michael a patch of shade beside the single struggling lilac bush and secured the prams rickety brake you go to sleep darlin like a good little boy she fixed the hood pulled the stick of beads across for him to play with if he had the inclination and placed his rattle on the coverlet he looked like he might just go to sleep you have a nice sleepybyes my love and in a bit mummy will come out and move your pram so that the sun doesnt shine in it see you in a bit lovey michael gurgled but he did not start to shriek when she tiptoed away thank god for that after all that commotion last night she needed to sleep for an hour or two she turned back at the doorway for one last look silence from the pram maybe he was asleep already she coughed this smoky air wouldnt do anybody any good worse than smoking fags all day long like her mother did no good for the lungs there was a lot of activity in the surrounding area again today two helicopters flying back and forth on the hillside below the moors a steady drone that could be either soothing or get on your nerves depending on what sort of mood you were in cars up and down all the time she shrugged her shoulders went inside and upstairs there was no sign of her mother perhaps betty brown had decided to go back to bed and keep bill company the pair of them must get bored she decided with nothing to do all day except moan at somebody whose life was taken up looking after a baby barbara stripped off her clothes and lay on the bed christ it was going to be hot again today she hoped michael would be all right out there in an hour or so she would go out and check him she felt sure that the father of her baby was ted growson it could have been alun donnison but she thought the odds were in favour of ted because the time of the month had been right that sunday afternoon when she had gone up on to the moors with him it could just be aluns though not that it really mattered which of them had fathered her child because she would not want to be shacked up with ted or alun they were ok for an hour or two on a date but living with them would be like living with bill in the next room all booze fags and sleeping in late barbara wished she could get away from stainforth just walk out of the village pushing michael in his pram and never come back a fantasy because she didnt have any money nor anywhere to go so that was that and she would have to stay put bill had threatened to throw her out on occasions and that was something that really worried her in fact she had almost mentioned it to the health visitor last week but she didnt want to cause a rumpus her eyelids began to droop those helicopters up on the moor were soothing like the distant drone of bees on the heather the sort of sound that could send you off to sleep whether you were tired or not barbara woke with a start sat bolt upright knew instinctively that she had overslept she fought to focus her bleary eyes saw that the cheap alarm clock on the dresser said and it was always half an hour slow oh christ she leaped off the bed grabbed her crumpled dress and shrugged it over her head michael was overdue for his next feed it was a wonder he hadnt been screaming the place down with bill yelling shaddup you little bugger or jesus somebody go and throttle that babby she ran downstairs barefooted bill and betty must still be in bed or else they had gone down to the pub for a lunchtime pint that was one bit of bonus peace anyway michael had obviously slept right through which was fine except that in all probability he would not want to sleep tonight you couldnt win you were backing a loser whichever way you looked at it he must have just woken up as she stepped out of the back door into the hot charred atmosphere she heard his rattle clicking or it could have been the beads shooting from one end of the rod to the other theres a good boy she quickened her pace across the rough unmown grass hes ever such a good boy he knew his momma was tired so hes played with his rattle and let his momma get some sleep im going to feed you now my darling she grasped the handle of the pram pulled it round so that it was back in the shade of the lilac again and then she let out a piercing scream that filled the smoky stainforth air dung on to the pram in rigid terror michael was up in the far corner and it was quite obvious that he was dead his tiny pink face bloated and purplish head back eyes wide and staring tongue lolling lifelessly out of his open mouth in that instant barbara browns mind snapped she stopped screaming failed to wonder why michaels rattle was still clicking and clinking even though he was dead she reached across to grab him and at that moment the crumpled coverlet moved and from beneath it a living coil began to unfurl a lightcoloured creature with diamondshaped markings on its back a head with fangs bared rearing up a killer that had patiently lain in ambush beside the corpse of its fast kill it struck once twice thrice darting blows each one finding their mark on arms and face she screamed again fell back clutching at the pram toppled it over so that it threw both baby and snake to the ground she was doubled up with pain her brain unable to cope staggering blindly away falling once and picking herself up oblivious of her own safety the thoughts of a mother only for her baby refusing to accept that he was dead she ran but the snake did not follow it moved with amazing speed that could easily have overtaken her had it so wished turning and slithering away beneath the thick lilac bush eased its way beneath the hedge and into the undergrowth beyond barbara did not run back into the house no logical reason except perhaps that she had long ago given up asking her mother for help in any matter relating to baby michael instead she staggered down the front path through the open gate and out into the road the pain was unbearable anybody except a distraught mother still clinging to the hope that her offspring might be saved would have collapsed and succumbed to the writhings and convulsions usually caused by a rattlers bite somehow she remained upright staggering holding on to parked vehicles for support yelling insanely her lips blue and puffed swelling rapidly so that by the time a group of bystanders rushed towards her she was babbling incoherently she tried to wave an arm back the way she had come attempted to scream my baby save my baby from the snake but she only managed a groan and that was when her brain and body gave out and she slumped forward in the road in the crowd that had gathered somebody muttered i think shes dead chapter keith doyle had not been to work for two days not since his nightmarish experience in the evershams garage but he couldnt just sit at home doing nothing the snakes might not be caught for weeks and it could cost him hundreds of pounds in lost earnings now dont you get going out gardening his mother turned from the sink fixed him with a disapproving stare a pleading frightened look in her eyes we dont want any more trouble its a wonder i didnt have a heart attack last time ill sit here worrying myself to death if you go out of the house theres nothing whatever the matter with your heart he snapped irritably youre as fit as i am youre just using emotional blackmail to try and keep me at home youll be safe here she dried a plate vigorously sensed that she was fighting a losing battle decided to change the subject hows kirsten you havent brought her home lately is everything all right between you he bit his lip had to stop himself from snapping its none of your business mother he had not seen kirsten for three days now after his experience with the rattlesnake at the evershams he had spent the whole evening being interviewed by reporters eager for the latest snake story and when he had finally gone to meet kirsten she wasnt there she had probably given him up and gone home he should have gone to her house but he didnt diplomacy or was it just bloody cowardice the next morning he phoned the drapery shop in town and mrs holloways caustic voice informed him shes not in today that was all no reason no thank you for calling shell be in tomorrow later he had tried to phone kirsten at home but there had been no reply and the phone rang unanswered again yesterday all sorts of fears crammed his frustrated mind relegating escaped snakes to incidentals maybe the davis family had left stainforth for the time being were keeping clear until it was safe kirstens parents were like that the kind who would have fled to america at the outbreak of war they were the bloody cowards not him today he had to do something positive you two havent had a tiff have you oh christ mother was always so persistent never let anything drop of course not she mentioned something about they might be going to stay with relatives until the snakes were all caught then you dont have any reason to go out keith oh bloody hell im going up to yardleys all i have to do there is to cut the lawns i dont have to weed overgrown borders where where snakes might be lurking the lawns dont need cutting joan doyle was tightlipped clutching at straws now nobody wants their lawns mowing when the suns scorching up the grass day after day the lawn will die if you mow it itll grow long and straggly if i dont take the top off it very soon i wanted you to do a job for me today like what she hesitated for a second or two the garden shed needs a good tidy out i tidied it out last week or hadnt you noticed oh and the attics due for a turn out theres so much lumber up there now that there isnt room to put anything else in it youd suffocate up there in weather like this he said walking towards the door im going up to the yardleys i could be back midafternoon depends if she wants me to do anything else apart from mowing the lawns so dont you get fretting he stepped outside into the hot morning sunlight slammed the door behind him end of bloody conversation strewth it was going to be a bloody stinker again today it wasnt nine oclock yet and you could feel the heat building up he looked up into the clear blue sky tried to spot a wisp of fluffy white cloud somewhere but there wasnt one the weathermen had it easy they did not even have to rely on satellite pictures hot and dry outlook continuing keith reversed the van out into the road he was low on petrol the needle hovering on the red warning line at the bottom of the gauge but there was enough to get him up to the yardleys and back right now he did not have the inclination to go up to the esso garage on the main road as he pulled away he became aware at once of the absence of parked vehicles along the village main street the police had put roadblocks on the roads leading in and out of stainforth youve had your fun joe public now piss off and let us deal with the snakes there would doubtless be the usual outcry from those evicted a police state and all that balls the van missed picked up again it was due for a service keith reminded himself maybe tomorrow he would go up to the garage fill up with petrol and get them to service it there wasnt going to be much work available in the near future jesus christ fancy eversham being stupid enough to go out after the snakes in the barley the firemen had found his charred corpse after the blaze had been put out presumably the snakes had got him they had certainly killed barbara brown and her baby now everybody in stainforth was really looking over their shoulders keith wondered about going to the evershams again not just yet anyway cynthia eversham would not want to be bothered with the garden for some time another regular job gone overboard thanks to these fucking snakes she would probably sell up and go back down south to her family the yardleys lived in a modern detached house at the very end of the main street a stark box no taste as everybody in the village said a box and a quarter of an acre of lawn they had not even got any borders suburbia had come to stainforth with disgusting authenticity he pulled his van into the tarmac drive and the engine was only too ready to die climbing out aware of the stillness the absence of commuter cars backing out into the road heading east to the town wasnt anybody going to work today maybe everybody had moved out temporarily well come back when those awful snakes have gone eileen yardley appeared in the doorway of the house an expression of mingled disbelief and disapproval on her moonish face tall and thin any grey in her shoulderlength hair obliterated by a jetblack rinse she had a reputation for complaining she complained regularly to the council the electricity board the post office and wrote a good many more letters to the local newspaper than they ever published something else which she complained about at fortyfive she was reasonably attractive but her goal in life was a mystery to everybody who knew her she was in search of some level of status obviously and perhaps with her husband having failed in his attempt to secure promotion at the local council then she had to draw attention to herself a constant battle to get her own way against the system nobody really knew and perhaps she did not either youre not going to work today surely mr doyle a harsh accent that jarred the nerves of anybody within earshot not in this terribly hot weather and i heard youd had a most frightful experience up at the evershams grossly exaggerated christ he couldnt tell the whole story all over again but the lawns need cutting mrs yardley else that spiky grass will grow so that the mower wont take it i thought id raise the blades a bit just take the top off tidy it up a bit if you really want to she pulled the door another inch or two towards her she ought not to have it open at all its entirely up to you my husbands stopped over in town these road blocks waste such a lot of time and in the evening there is a queue almost to the motorway with any other woman id take that as an invitation doyle smiled wryly either george yardley was staying in town because he had a readymade excuse to be away from his wifes incessant complaining or else he was scared stiff of the snakes eileen wouldnt get up to anything whilst he was away she would simply brood and write more letters to the paper you do what you think best there was only a crack of open door now the darkhaired woman peering out from behind it ring the bell when youve finished and ill pay you your money he walked up to the garage could not help a shudder as he lifted the upandover door all so reminiscent of the evershams but like a racing driver who has walked out of a bad pileup he had to get right back behind the wheel if he wasnt going to lose his nerve the mower was a fifteenyearold atco you tugged your guts out until it fired and then dodged the cloud of pungent fumes keith had cleaned the plugs fiddled with the carburettor on more than one occasion but it made no difference age caught up with everything eventually the lawn was virtually a patch of uncut hay it really did not need cutting an excuse really the need to be doing something anything but whatever he did he could not get kirsten off his mind he had to know today what had become of her whether their relationship had finally tottered over the brink he could not stand not knowing any longer up and down that lawn cutting dead brown swathes that would need weeks of rain to recover emptying the grassbox on the pile behind the flowering cherry tree mowing again now hurrying because he wanted to get finished then he would go up to the davis household if they were not at home then perhaps the neighbours might have some idea where they had gone in the midst of his thoughts the engine stuttered cut out in a final puff of twostroke smoke an ageing monster that had finally given up its battle with life silence complete and utter you could not even hear the cars on the distant motorway it was like standing in the middle of a ghost village that stank of lawn mower fumes and burned barley the smell of death hi there keith doyle turned slowly saw the darkbearded young man roughly his own age coming up the drive towards him he nodded remembered having seen him around the village but could not quite place him a visitor one who had been before youre keith doyle the stranger extended a hand my names john price im staying down at mrs harrisons of course keith just checked himself from blurting out the old lady who had a heart attack when a grass snake got in the house youre the zoologist who is helping them hunt the snakes it all clicked into place thats right and not having much luck im afraid i heard about your own experience it must have been absolutely terrifying i had a near scrape keiths legs felt wobbly just recalling that flight from the border with the fattier hard after him once he reached the garage though he wasnt in much danger he had to keep consoling himself with that fact i had to come out and do some work today not just for the money but because id go bloody crazy if i stayed indoors me too john price began rolling himself a cigarette they dont need me at present he waved his free hand vaguely in the direction of the moors weve scoured the moors acres of barley have been devastated by fire and yesterday they hunted the remaining fields nothing at all the snakes seem to have disappeared totally you think they mightve moved on if so there have been no reports of their having been sighted i have my doubts meaning theyre still in stainforth reckon so right under our bloody noses but where i was hoping that as a jobbing gardener knowing the village and the gardens you might have some idea keith puckered his lips scratched his shock of unruly copper hair couldnt rightly say there are so many patches of wilderness i could name several gardens that i go to that could hide a hundred snakes and a lot more that i dont work in the authorities are worried now that the reptiles might actually be in the village price drew deeply on a crumpled cigarette inhaled the strong smoke theyre going to search every garden hedgerow and patch of wasteland in stainforth today they just asked me to stand by in case they need me for identifying any species they might be lucky enough to shoot the inhabitants arc scared already but thats nothing to what theyre going to be when gangs of armed searchers and dogs start invading their gardens the media doesnt help every morning theres a blownup picture of some deadly snake on the front page of just about every paper the police have booted out the sightseers sent em packing in no uncertain terms and sealed off the road im half expecting them to evacuate the village it would certainly be the safest thing to do ill keep my eyes peeled suddenly keith felt very cold standing there in the hot sunshine the last thing he wanted to see right now was another snake well i reckon this mower has finally had it so thats as good an excuse as any to pack it in for today fancy a pint the rising sun is remaining open regardless id like to keith shuffled his feet awkwardly in fact theres nothing id like better but i havent seen my girlfriend for three days shes not at work and maybe her parents have left the village for a time ive got to go and see whats happened john price nodded ill see you around then he dropped his gaze added with a hint of embarrassment i think that maybe two fellers moving quietly and knowing what theyre about might stand more chance of finding these snakes than a whole army of searchers beating hell out of the vegetation is that an invitation to join you in a snake hunt yeah i guess it is there was a long pause an uneasy silence before keith replied maybe i cant rightly say at this moment it all depends on my girl i got problems you see tell you what ill try and get em sorted out today and if everythings ok you and mell take a look around tomorrow i cant commit myself further then that at this moment fair enough john price dropped the butt of his cigarette on to the tarmac ground it to shreds with his heel you come down to my place mrs harrisons bungalow early in the morning and well see whats doing then keith watched the other walk back down the drive slow loping steps another man who had to be doing something or else he would go crazy and as he pulled the clappedout atco back up the drive to the garage the gardener was praying that the search parties might find the reptiles today and destroy them if they did not then he would be as scared as the rest of the villagers he hadnt promised to go on a snake hunt though but he knew that he would help john price to seek the killers out all the same as he drove out of the yardleys gateway he had to wait for a convoy of army land rovers to pass openbacked vehicles packed with men in camouflage clothing armed with shotguns slowing pulling into the side of the road beginning to disembark so sinister in the main street of an english village keiths flesh crept and his mouth was dry the kind of dryness that even a lager at the rising sun would not alleviate basic fear terror because there was no doubt in his mind that the snakes were right here in stainforth village hiding out somewhere and nobody would sleep easily in their beds again until every one of those killers was dead chapter im going to see kirsten mother not wholly a lie im going to try and see kirsten mother do my damnedest she wasnt at home earlier and the car wasnt in the garage and in all probability my guess was correct that theyve left stainforth for the present except ive got a feeling that theyll be back soon maybe im clinging to vain hopes but at least if i go down there and hang around im actually doing something i cant stay here and be interrogated all evening are you sure its all right to go out well ive been out most of the day gardening havent i and im ok liar you changed your mind and went for a pint in the rising sun after youd been to the davis house a pity you didnt go with that price feller in the first place still it had helped to fill the day in like i told you earlier keith the soldiers have been all through the gardens in the village today gave me quite a turn i can tell you men with guns on the lawns poking in the shrubs but they didnt find anything did they mother nooooo but they might have jesus christ there might be a nuclear war tonight and well al be blown to blazes dont you worry these snakes have probably hightailed it out of the area and in a couple of days stainforth will be declared safe and the roads opened up again maybe joan doyle resigned herself for the second time that day to the fact that there was no way she was going to stop her son from going out what time will you be back shouldnt be too late the only way he could end these conversations was by going out and closing the door she would sit up and wait until he returned damn it that was her fault he looked at his watch a quarter past eight he had not realised that it was as late as that nevertheless he had given the davis family plenty of time to return home if they were going to and if they hadnt then he might just go back to the rising sun again damnation he still had not filled up with petrol it was too late now the garage would be closed the needle had dropped into the red sector on the gauge but that usually meant there was half a gallon left in the tank or thereabouts a mile to the davis house and a mile back it should be plenty there were times when you had to be an optimist youre wasting your time keith doyle what else can i do i have to do something its all part of a parental plan by the davises take kirsten out of the environment work on her youre wasting your time on that doyle boy even if he has got a string of qualifications he hasnt got a job youve been in stainforth too long you havent widened your scope there are shoals of fish in the sea the snakes came in very convenient when you needed a seemingly bona fide excuse to whisk your daughter out of the clutches of a man you did not approve of oh yes they had come just when they were needed as far as jack and mary davis were concerned but if kirsten is pregnant that really throws a spanner in their connivings keith smiled to himself they would have to let her make the choice then or would they surely they would not force her to have an abortion army vehicles still lined the village street but there was no sign of the hunters they would keep at it until darkness fell he remembered that halfpromise about tomorrow i dont have to go with john price i only said id give it some thought and then he saw kirsten davis the sudden shock caused him to swerve bump against the kerb it cant be im having hallucinations the right place just past the church the time was right too except that their meeting had been arranged for three days ago the vans brakes squealed their protest the engine stalled and he was leaning across the passenger seat to pull the door catch down with a hand that shook kirsten was wearing a light blue dress almost a mini that showed her shapely legs off to perfection a lowcut neckline a cleavage that had you wanting to see the rest only her expression worried him palefaced eyes that were redrimmed from crying black pouches beneath them from lack of sleep distraught her hair was not as immaculate as it usually was as she swung herself into the passenger seat and slammed the door his hopes plummeted almost had him wishing that he had gone to the rising sun instead and kept on kidding himself that everything would be all right not knowing for sure meant that you still had illusions but eventually you had to face up to reality wed better go somewhere where we can talk her voice faltered and she stared straight ahead of her all right his stomach was churning hell that wasnt easy not only was he almost out of petrol but half a mile further on there was a police road block let me think i know the sandpit she nodded but did not speak the sandpit was a playedout sand quarry just to the rear of the churchyard it had not been quarried for twenty years and up until a few years ago the village bikers used to scramble there at weekends there had been complaints about the noise a petition and nowadays nobody went there except teenage courting couples who did not have transport to take them further afield a bridle path just wide enough to take a car led off from where the wall bordering the cemetery ended a hundred yards rutted and dipping sharply terminating in five acres of overgrown scrubland surrounded by high precarious sandcliffs thorn bushes and saplings somehow securing a hold and serving to create an atmosphere of dank loneliness even in the heat of summer it was cool in here it was obvious to keith that the snake hunters had beaten the place out thoroughly bracken and grass flattened even some of the lowgrowing bushes on the steep face had been ripped out at least there was no danger here he switched the engine off was aware of the silence the gathering dusk down in this desolate place the tension in the van wed better go somewhere where we can talk were here so lets talk well unless he said something they might sit here like this all night im pregnant she stifled a sob oh what dyou mean oh he didnt reply what the hell did she expect him to say what do other guys say when their girlfriends inform them theyre in the club youve had it confirmed no not yet its too early then how the hell dyou know i know her voice rose almost a scream of frustration girls know those sort of things long before theyre confirmed keith fell silent mixed feelings jubilation you cant walk out on me now darling apprehension because it was too involved even to start to comprehend at this stage im not running away his tone was low when he spoke at last ill stand by you you know that thats not the point kirsten was back on the verge of tears you havent run away but have what whatever arc you talking about mum and dad decided it was best if we left stainforth for a while at least until the snakes had been rounded up they insisted that i went with them as you know dad has a flat in the city and we all squashed into that they wanted to get me away from you thought that if i didnt see you for a bit and that if i was introduced to one or two of dads eligible bachelor business associates or their sons they could persuade me to finish with you oh god keith it was awful the pressure they put on me all snobbery she was crying shaking with constricted sobs and he slipped an arm around her i walked out on them this morning it was a couple of minutes before she was able to continue we had a fearful row at breakfast mum must have guessed something because she accused me of being pregnant so i stormed out caught a bus and walked the rest of the way i had a bit of bother at the checkpoint but in the end the police sent an army cadet to escort me home now im in a fine mess ive left home ive nowhere to go and ive also lost my job mrs holloway has sacked me for not turning in for work oh keith her tears came in a flood her face buried against his chest whatever are we going to do were going to get married he tried to keep the jubilation out of his voice sod your folks they can take a running jump then a sudden awful thought occurred to him and he added if you want to get married that is of course i do she squeezed his hand its just that it all seems such a frightful awful mess thats all silence again dusk had merged into neardarkness down in the quarry only by craning his neck could keith see the evening sky up above them the remnants of a summer sunset for some reason he remembered the date june the summer solstice the longest day this was one midsummer night he would never forget whats that kirstens head was suddenly erect listening whats what he didnt want to be in a hurry to go savour every second youll remember this night for the rest of your life i heard something she was staring into the sandpit darkness trying to make out shapes and silhouettes that would be gone in a matter of minutes like somethings round the front of the van probably rats he thought but you dont tell emotional girls that a rabbit maybe he sighed there are lots of them in here the sand is full of their burrows there it is again she was tense holding on to him t can feel it vibrating on the keith a piercing scream she was clutching at him almost hysterical there do you see it he saw it all right felt his stomach heave up tasted something sharp and sour at the back of his throat recalled a tv documentary he had once watched about snakecharming the way the snake came up out of a wicker basket a wriggling revolting creature mastering a vertical stance with a body that had no backbone and the snake was doing just that now rising up from somewhere in the region of the radiator grille uncoiling going up and up aware of the two humans inside the vehicle its tiny eyes fixed on them scenting their terror and mocking them with open jaws that seemed to laugh it cant get at us keith doyle whispered hoarsely no way were safe lets get away from here she pleaded shuddered and closed her eyes oh keith take me home no problem he laughed but it sounded forced and the fingers that rested on the ignition key trembled no problem at all we can swing round drive right back on to the road and if we dont dislodge this bugger on the way then there are loads of police and soldiers in the village who will be only too delighted to shoot it seconds later he knew that he did have a problem a very frightening one the startermotor whirred but did not fire vibrated hollowly beneath the bonnet he tried it again much slower this time they felt it groaning stopping a third time it would not even turn over keith kirsten was on the verge of panic he gripped her wrist hard was not taking any chances on her opening the door and trying to make a run for it he recalled his own flight three days ago he had only made it to the garage by the grace of god kirsten certainly would not make it back to the road dont worry he tried to sound convincing shell go in a minute but he knew it wouldnt because it had been reluctant to start even on these hot summer mornings it was the battery sure enough possibly the same one that was on this sregistered vehicle from new now old and tired dying maybe dead already there was just a faint chance that if they waited a few minutes it might fire a very faint chance the kind you only relied on when there was nothing else left the snake was on the bonnet now coils of it keith would not even attempt to guess at its length but in the fading daylight he was just able to make out its colouring a ringed body red black and white rings the fearsome snout jetblack colourful deadly its head only inches from the glass of the windscreen staring inside intently keith i dont want to look you dont have to close your eyes i cant its like ive got to look a thought crossed his mind one that would have been funny in any other situation except this you paid a quid or so to go into a reptile house and gawp at snakes through glass but this bugger was getting a closeup of humans in a cage for free jesus that was rich it kind of put things in perspective made you realise that when it came down to the law of the jungle man counted for nothing keith i cant stand it any longer hang on ill try the battery again he knew before he turned the key that it wasnt going to be any good this time the startermotor didnt even turn over the engine was as dead as the proverbial dodo and even if it hadnt been he wondered if there was enough petrol in the tank to get them out of there youre a stupid prick keith doyle the snake on the bonnet seemed to be laughing in agreement with him were stuck kirsten was sobbing again theres no way were going to get out of here dont be stupid were only yards from the village the main street ive only got to blow the horn and the soldiers will come on the run blow it then he pressed the klaxon button knew even as he did so that it would not even muster up the force of a good fart simply because the horn worked off the battery like everything else on a vehicle lights flashers the battery was the heart of a motor car determined whether it lived or died and keith doyles van right now was very dead ill think of something dont panic he leaned across her and locked the door as much to prevent her from leaping out as the snake from getting in it cant get to us its horrible i wonder what species it is talking for the sake of talking it certainly isnt a rattler because i know what they look like a joke that did not sound funny i dont care what sort it is she snapped i just wish it was dead along with all its mates it was dark now the two people inside the vehicle could barely see each others silhouettes even the dashboard lights were too faint to give off so much as a glow but there was enough light for them to be able to make out the shape of the snake that held them prisoner it had coiled itself up again settled down on the bonnet head up against the glass windscreen watching and waiting and the coral snake which had so recently witnessed the death of its mate at the hands of man was in no hurry vengeance was within its grasp and there was no way it was going to allow its prisoners to escape after it had killed them it would die because there would be nothing left to live for it would wait we cant stop here keith was relieved to hear kirsten speak fairly normally keeping her face turned away from the windscreen pushing herself back into the seat at the moment we cant do much else he answered he remembered that the rear doors of the van were not locked but it did not really matter no snake would be capable of turning the handle and in any case the lock only functioned from the outside dont think about it well just have to be patient somebody is bound to find us soon he did not add that it was unlikely to be before morning the searchers had called off the hunt for today it would be seven oclock before they recommenced he and kirsten were almost certainly there for the night it was going to be a long one chapter pc ken aylott stared around the small room that for the past two years had been his office it bore little resemblance to the neatly arranged room that had contained only a week ago two filing cabinets a desk with some wire trays on it telephone a noticeboard with warnings about such relatively harmless creatures as colorado beetles pinned on it dull and boring but at least it had been his whatever his resentment about this outoftheway posting he had had the small consolation of knowing that this was his pad and he was the boss now within the space of a few days all that had been taken from him the office was a shambles piles of untidily heaped papers that would in all probability never be sorted and filed a mountain of rubber boots in the corner discarded clothing if he had been in charge of operations the place would never have been allowed to get into this state damn it he had been relegated to the status of office boy stop here and answer the phone aylott radio us if anything important crops up your job is to hold the fort the super made it sound important like telling a child he was responsible for picking up his scattered toys do your best and well check it over when we get back youre not getting the chance to skive on outside operations not that aylott particularly wanted to be out there with every chance of a rattler jumping at you out of the undergrowth shirley his wife was asleep in the police house adjoining the official office block she didnt seem to be able to grasp that stainforth was a deadend job said quite calmly that she would be happy to stay here for the rest of her life buy one of those semis in the village after ken retired in another fifteen years fifteen years jesus wept ken aylott could weep if he stopped to think about it too long of course it was the raglan case that was the sole reason for his posting to stainforth a ballsup the classical clanger that a copper on a manchester beat should not have dropped hed picked up raglan the man who had committed a dozen horrific sex murders and questioned him he should have held the bastard but at the time the mans story seemed genuine enough the policeman had fallen for a false name and address and a volume of lies thrown in a few scribblings in his notebook that he had not thought worth the paperwork so hed let it go at that and raglan too three months and six corpses later the cid had nailed raglan and everything came out you could have saved us millions of pounds and six lives as well copper if you had done your job properly on the night of january every rookie makes a mistake some bigger than others this will go against you it wasnt your fault shirley had said she had stuck by him as she invariably did in everything they cant blame you you werent to know kick pc aylotts arse hard if it hadnt been for an acute shortage of manpower due to the police commitment on manning picket lines ken might well have had his arse kicked even harder right out of the force he spent weeks away from home in the daily turmoil of shoving yelling crowds had a week in hospital when he was unfortunate enough to have a halfbrick land on his head and then within a fortnight of the settlement of the long dispute he received the stainforth posting they even tried to make a meal out of that this is your big chance copper your opportunity to prove yourself there was the odd case of sheepworrying by dogs threatening to nick the rising sun because one night there were half a dozen in there drinking after eleven keeping an eye on one or two suspect vehicles that might not get through their mots and could just be used on the roads when their owners were in possession of a failed certificate oh mother of god big deal it wasnt ken aylotts week on nights but he clicked for it just the same they had taken the two boys from the town off the night shift they should have covered stainforth from pm to am because they needed them on days to man the roadblocks itll help if youll cover the night shift ken there wont be much happening there never bloody well was that was the trouble keep on your toes copper this is your big chance ken lit a cigarette sat looking at this pighole of an office even thought about tidying it up restoring some semblance of order hed get a bollocking from the super for sure if he did that you seem to think this is jour office constable he halfconsidered jacking it all in typing out his notice and leaving it on the desk for burlington to see when he arrived in the morning stick that where the monkey sticks his nuts i finish on saturday week but he didnt and not just because shirley was expecting their first baby and the monthly jobless tally according to the television last monday had risen by another in the month of may that alone wouldnt have stopped him it was his personal pride that did you failed copper so you threw in the sponge hadnt the guts to see if you could make it all the way back claw yourself out of demotion and stainforth you took the easy way out didnt you but how for christs sake tell me how he knew the answer without waiting for it to echo back off those four walls in taunting whispers you know how copper go out and find those snakes nobody else has so far youll be a national hero theyll have to give you your stripes then because if they dont the people of stainforth will petition for your promotion like bloody hell they will the villagers dont petition for anything except against somebody making too much noise on a sunday itll still count for a lot yeah maybe youre right but i dont stand much chance not in the dark you wont get your opportunity in the daytime you know that stop here and mind the phone constable radio us if theres anything really important ken aylott was sweating just at the thought of going out there he could smell his own body odours a sour stench that highlighted his fears stopped him from kidding even himself that he was not afraid a good coppers one who does his duty even though hes scared to hell only fools and liars kid themselves he looked at the clock on the wall twentyseven minutes past twelve he took a swig of lukewarm coffee lit another cigarette it was no good just rushing blindly out there into the night he needed to work out some plan of campaign look what happened to that clever bastard eversham dont think about him or you wont go or barbara brown youre different ken aylott youve got a tidy mind you plan all the facts pointed to the snakes being somewhere in the village well if the fuckers werent on the moors or in the fields and hadnt gone elsewhere then they had to be still in the vicinity every garden in the village had been searched the sandpit and the churchyard so logically there wasnt anywhere else left its just a bloody waste of time youre fooling yourself coward you wont know for sure if you dont go out there and look and if theyre not around you wont be in any danger will you you will have been seen to have done something positive not just sat here all night on your arse as youre perfectly entitled to do well done constable you didnt find the snakes but at least you did your best a fraction of the way towards getting your stripes ken aylott swallowed the rest of his coffee at one gulp and stood up hed better take a pair of those rubber boots off the heap in the corner size nines just to make his feet sweat and stink a torch too he thought about a shotgun out of the armoury in the back and decided against it too many complications if anything went wrong the police werent allowed to arm themselves except on written instructions from the chief constable i was hunting snakes sir all the other officers carried guns in the daytime in the daytime constable but you had no right to be prowling about the village in the dead of night with a gun it amounts to armed trespass for which you will be disciplined bloody hell better leave the gun and play safe im not out to shoot the snakes or enrage them like eversham obviously did im only going to try and locate them ive discovered their lair superintendent theyre in the ken could not for the life of him think where they might be it didnt really matter suffice it that he had had the guts to go out there in the dark prove himself to himself the occasional streetlight broke up the pitch blackness of a summer night created its own atmosphere of gloom eerie the night was nowhere near so balmy as it had been a short time ago insects divebombed a lamp seemed intent on kamikaze attacks aylott looked upwards was aware of a myriad of stars searched for the moon and detected a silver sliver barely discernible a full moon would have been helpful with a torch you felt so vulnerable gave your movements and position away further down the main street he had to use his flashlight now why the devil hadnt they continued with the streetlighting down here the houses were more isolated now modern dwellings erected after the line of stonebuilt cottages petered out but the council had not yet got round to providing full amenities for the occupants he shone his beam on the towering rickety church lychgate it was a wonder that it had not collapsed years ago rotting and broken timbers a halftorn notice of church service times hanging on by a single drawing pin when the winds and rain came again it would be whipped away to lie rotting in the bottom of the cemetery hedgerow he decided to check the church no real reason except that it seemed the logical place to start he walked slowly up the weedcovered track shone his torch from side to side a wilderness even the most recent graves that had not yet had their tombstones erected were becoming hidden behind a screen of seeding wild willow herb there was room for maybe another twenty graves and then the church would have to blow the whistle on burials here unless they obtained permission to dig up the roadside verge full up book your plot now he smiled in the darkness at his humourless joke but all the same he wondered where they would go next stainforth had filled two graveyards in three centuries the church authorities would have to find another tract of consecrated ground or else resort to cremation there were hundreds more people still left to die in the village the snakes could speed up the death toll considerably there was no mistaking the four newly dug graves he smelled the damp soil that had not yet had time to dry out sheets of artificial grass vainly trying to hide the morbid excavations the day after tomorrow was funeral day four one after the other elsie harrison barbara brown and her child eversham what was left of him therell be more if you dont find the snakes soon copper shut up dont think about it the church doors were locked as they should have been but it was second nature to a policeman to try them the wroughtiron latch rattled like the bones of longdead skeletons turning restlessly in their coffins echoed inside the church aylott felt uneasy churches were always disquieting to him associating them with funerals and with the victims of murderers and road accidents and snakes he would make sure he was confined to his office on the day of the funerals for once not objecting to being the forces stooge the human telephone answering service for operational headquarters you said i was to stay here and look after things sir i dont mind at all there would be a big turnout for the burials the whole village plus press and tv the media would make a big thing of it get your head down over some paperwork boy catch up on all that formfilling and by the time youve finished it will all be over until the snakes strike again perhaps he should have attended church regularly in his youth and then he would not have had this secret disquiet about them it wasnt just death that was routine to a policeman whether it was a nice peaceful pensioners passing or a gory traffic accident it was what happened afterwards the unnecessary morbid ritual some claimed it was a form of therapy designed to ease the grief of the bereaved aylott believed it was a climax to horror brought those left behind face to face with the grave this is the end theres nothing else no matter what they try to tell you he had never had any time for the reverend philip emsworth stainforths parson overweight pinkfaced a flabby handshake and a condescending voice a hypocrite if ever there was one a scrounger of sunday lunches and afternoon teas who dodged reality by erecting a pseudospiritual barrier had found his niche in this outoftheway village but comforting words were no defence against killer snakes pc aylott made a slow tour of the cemetery shone his torch from one mosscovered tombstone to the next christ some bugger even had a serpent engraved on his stone a depiction of the garden of eden thats all i bloody well need he shivered the night air had turned very cold well the reptiles certainly werent lying out in this jungle of an unkempt cemetery the constable reached the furthest boundary saw a dilapidated wicket gate that leaned over into an adjoining section of rough ground the original graveyard it was no more than a couple of acres at the most triangular bounded by a tall straggling hawthorn hedge that had last been pleached in and had not been touched since most of the graves went back to the last century their indecipherable headstones having either been laid flat or fallen over and left that way because in the days when stainforth parochial church council was able to afford a fulltime verger it made mowing easier then came drastic economic cutbacks in the s and both verger and mower were made redundant emsworth took it upon himself to let the old graveyard revert to nature the hedge untidy as it was screened the worst of the wilderness and as the majority of those buried in there had no living relatives left few were likely to complain if you cant clear up a mess hide it was one of the clergymans many mottoes aylott did not fancy going in there he stood by the remains of the old gate swinging his torch beam in a wide arc noted the flattened tangled growth where the police and army searchers had trodden it down there really was not much point in going in there for a second look now was there not really but if youre going to check out the sandpit at the far end youll have to unless youre going to go back and all the way round by road you dont really want to go and shine your torch in those open graves again do you because if you walk by them youll be compelled to the first ones for elsie harrison the second for he negotiated the leaning broken gate snapped another rotten strut with a loud crack if those snakes are around they will have heard that for sure but they surely arent because they would have been found by now if they were that was the best piece of logic he had come up with all night and it made him feel an awful lot easier in his disturbed mind through this wilderness that used to be a cemetery out into the sandpit and back along the road to the station sorry operational hq i went out on my own and looked sir but im certain the snakes arent in stainforth theyve moved on unseen and well just have to wait until they turn up somewhere and somebody else gets killed it was not easy walking in there the trampleddown grass and weeds screening large stones that you only found when you either stubbed your toe against them or trod on them and wrenched your ankle a hidden indentation in the ground threw pc aylott headlong he cursed picked himself up had to retrieve his torch which had rolled away now this is bloody stupid youre not proving anything either to yourself or to anybody else youre pandering to guilt trying to convince yourself that youre not the bloody coward you thought you were and all the time youre shitscared the sandpit could not be far now the hedges were beginning to angle towards the apex of the graveyard triangle and where they met there would be a brokendown stile and a slope beyond which he would have to negotiate very carefully then it was but a hundred yards or so back to the road and safety his foot rested on something flat and smooth beneath the grass one of those old tombstones lying horizontally no doubt he rested his full weight on it and felt it tilt like a paving slab that had been placed on uneven ground well it was hardly likely to have been laid with a spiritlevel was it it ken aylotts brain could not cope with what happened next a feeling like vertigo a loss of balance and coordination a sensation akin to stepping on to a hinged trapdoor aware of it tilting downwards beneath his feet his logic screamed at him to jump sideways before it was too late but his body refused to heed the warning falling a rush of stale cold air came up out of the ground to meet him and he gave a strangled cry of terror clinging on to his torch instinctively he hunched his body anticipated the bonejarring fall a kaleidoscope of terrors jamming his crazed mind a childhood fear of the dark was instantly released from that corner of his brain where it had slumbered for three decades had him screaming in infantile terror a cloying stench filled his nostrils the putrid suffocating smell of an airless place and then came impact and pain the agony of breaking bones gasping for air that was putrid lying in a crumpled heap on sharp stones and doubting whether he would ever be able to move again crying gasping with sheer terror because he could not manage a second scream he lay there his body crunched up into a tight ball racked with pain subconsciously he knew what had happened an old crypt the kind that were popular in the last century when entire families were interred in the same grave a broken or loose stone that had acted as a trapdoor to catapult him down into its depths oh merciful god this was a place of the dead hideous skeletal remains somehow he was still clutching his torch but he did not want to look it was still on miraculously but he closed his eyes in case he saw he tasted blood not a lot so perhaps he had just bitten his lip or tongue in the fall but his leg was broken for sure possibly both of them because he could not move them he gasped for breath and it hurt like hell broken ribs if he tried to get up he might puncture a lung ive got to get out of here a haze of pain a red curtain before his eyes i mustnt faint if i pass out i could lie here until i die somebody will surely come looking for me when the day shift takes over but they wont know where to look will they he tried to move his head attempted to look upwards desperately searching for a glimpse of those glittering stars or that sliver of moon anything that meant that there was open sky up above pleasejust one star but there were only streaks of shimmering red to be seen in the total blackness where there should have been an open square directly above you mustnt panic rest a bit try to think he felt at his legs bare bleeding skin where his trousers had been ripped and torn asunder theres broken bones definitely oh god suddenly he got an awful feeling that he was not alone beginning with a prickling of the hairs on the back of his neck dont be bloody stupid if theres anybody else in here theyve been dead a very long time a heap of old bones but they cant move or hurt you something definitely moved dislodged a trickle of small stones close by he jumped wanted to shine his torch in the direction of the noise but he did not dare if theres anything there then i dont want to see it rats thats what it is rodents are bound to use these old crypts repulsive but not dangerous his arms seemed to be virtually unscathed perhaps if he could secure a grip on something then he could pull himself up reach the slab above open it enough to give him air a gap through which his shouts for help might be heard new hope desperation breeding determination groping behind him feeling with ms fingers and that was when he touched something it should have been cold rough stone hard and inanimate instead it was rough and soft breathing and moving he snatched his hand away with an inarticulate cry could not help himself from swinging his torch round a dazzling white beam that reflected a pair of tiny glittering eyes a long thick body that ended over in the shadows some yards away eyes watching him from every corner pinpoints of unwavering evil ken aylotts reason almost snapped hovered precariously on the brink between sanity and madness youve found em copper the snakes everybodys been searching for holed up in a derelict crypt in a disused churchyard no they werent real they were a fevered nightmare brought on by the pain from his injuries if he closed his eyes and then opened them a few seconds later they would be gone evaporated if theres anything there its only rats and ive got snakes on the brain they bloody well arent snakes he sensed them moving heard their bodies dragging across the uneven floor slithering towards him no they dont exist they dont sudden agony in his leg his whole body jerking up pain that in no way could have come from his fall like a heated bradawl had been bored into his flesh gouged a burning hole right down to the bone the policeman managed one long shriek of pain and terror almost succeeded in standing on his fractured limbs then fell backwards the torch bounced from his hold rolled and shone its light back on the awful scene cruelly showed ken aylott everything he did not want to see a d horror show in which he was the principal actor they were everywhere long ones fat ones thin ones dazzling deadly colours shimmering in the harsh artificial light sliding up to the convulsing human body striking at the exposed white flesh fangs that dug deep and tore mercilessly drew blood and hungered for more darted flicked speared him with their poison ken aylott watched his own flesh swell bloated veins pulsing with deadly venom reddening purpling the snakes slid over him obscene attacks savouring this victim that had dropped obligingly into their lair he felt their coldness gave up any thoughts of escape how long did it take a man to die from a snakebite it depended upon which species bit you he didnt have a chance just wanted the end to be quick i found em sir when everybody else failed didnt i and i wont get promotion not even a posthumous award theyll always remember me as the copper who fucked up the raglan case the snakes were backing off him a sudden withdrawal that puzzled the dying policeman even in his paincrazed state the bastards wanted to gloat to watch him die listen to his pleadings theyll get you make no mistake about that youve fooled us all for the moment but theyll find you theyll come with guns and blast hell out of you he could barely breathe now as if his lungs had given out collapsed his eyes were swelling restricting his vision but he saw enough enough to topple him down into that abyss of madness even had him trying to laugh he had wondered where the big fucker had got to the twentyfoot python that should have found it impossible to hide out in any tract of english countryside well it was here now must have been gorged and sleeping off some feast in the shadows had missed out on the action now it was here which was why all the others were keeping their distance a giant amongst reptiles a goliath of evil driving the others back to skulk in their corners watching them slink away aylotts eyes were just twin slits now but the fear and the pain were gone ive been looking for you feller theres a warrant out for your arrest youd better come quietly without any bloody fuss come on now no nonsense im a police officer damn you dont you understand im a police officer and im placing you under arrest anything you say may be taken down and used in evidence against you the python was angry because its victim was dead but all the same it lashed the corpse mercilessly struck with an incredible speed for its size vented its fury on the human body there was no need to entwine itself around the corpse encircle the broken body and crush those frail bones but it did so because that was its nature and it was very angry tightening squeezing feeling its prey crunch and begin to pulp blood oozing out across the dry floor finally it relinquished its grip reared up and looked down on the mangled form its fury was vented and now hunger took over its body expanding so that it might consume the morass swallowing it whole almost noiseless reptilian gluttony the other snakes were forgotten hidden in their various corners afraid because circumstances had forced them to share their hideout with a king amongst reptiles a kind of temporary peace pact because they were the hunted in an alien land reptilian guerrillas compelled to band together for survival man was their common foe and thus they were united in a single cause down here in this dark underground place they felt safe they would remain here as long as possible for even the keenscented dogs which had hunted the ground above had not smelled them out they had food rats and mice an abundance of voles the king too had fed but every one of them was a killer tomorrow or perhaps the next day their very nature would drive them out again to kill chapter a summer dawn was beginning to infiltrate the night sky by the time sheer exhaustion finally claimed keith doyle and kirsten davis brought brief respite from the sheer horror of the past few hours all around the birds were beginning to twitter and sing but they did not hear them as they slumbered restlessly in a cramped position bodies entwined breathing easily it was the numbness in his left arm which finally had keith stirring wakefulness coming slowly his brain gently easing him slowly back to reality he thought at first that they were in a bed together like the time kirstens folks had gone away for a long weekend and the couple had crammed into the girls single bed spent a blissful uncomfortable night together an experience which they would hold dear for the rest of their lives it had happened again a thrill began to course through his body then died as quickly as it had begun oh christ the horror was back he stiffened didnt turn his head to look out of the windscreen because he knew the snake would still be there on the bonnet a revolting length of colourful coiled death just watching them kirsten was still sleeping her face pallid crumpled dress and hair awry hunched up in a position in which no human could have slept unless totally exhausted keith recalled a remark his father had once made a disparaging reference to his wife before you marry a girl you want to see what she looks like first thing in the morning she can tart herself up for the rest of the day but its when she wakes up you know what she really looks like not that im condoning premarital sex though just a piece of advice kirsten looked beautiful he decided a queen amongst young girls he would always remember her this way but it did not alter the fact that their priority was to get away from here all the same he could have stayed here just gazing down at her for ever he felt her stir her breasts rubbed softly against him her eyelids began to flicker damn it ive woken her up just when she needs all the sleep she can get what time is it she tried to stretch pushed her feet against the old van heater the one that had no means of being switched off roasted you in summer and did not work much at all in cold weather ten past four he murmured adjusted his embrace no hurry sleep on as long as you like no hurry ill be late for oh god its all right he kissed her softly were safe a bit uncomfortable but everythings all right is it still there dont look she struggled with him twisted her head round the terror back in her wide eyes then she gave a cry of mingled relief and amazement euphoria keith its gone he didnt dare to look where kirsten had looked barely comprehended her words it hasnt it cant because it wont go away whilst its got us trapped in here you could tell that by the look in its eyes keith look i tell you its gone he turned his head slowly she was right the snake was no longer on the bonnet of the van we can go then she was halfcrying fumbling for the door catch when he caught her wrist just hold on we have to be sure kirsten of course its gone we dont know for certain and until we are certain you dont get out of this van how do we find out then she was becoming angry i say its gone and wed better make a run for the road before it comes back keith began to ease open the drivers door just a couple of inches enough for him to see outside scrutinise the ground on the offside of the vehicle clumps of grass that were dying from lack of moisture stunted growth that should have been luxuriant towards the end of june sparse hardly room enough for a mouse to hide just here the drought was beginning to bite well she said craning her neck trying to see past him what did i tell you its got fed up with waiting and cleared off he did not reply opened the door another few inches remembered what had happened outside the evershams garage how the rattlesnake had lain in wait underneath peter evershams jag what are you doing keith he pushed the door and held it at arms length lowered his head and shoulders ready to draw back at the first sign of danger his long copper hair flopped down felt below the sill almost afraid to look but he had to god keith doyles whole body recoiled like a whiplash slamming the van door in the same motion as he fell back into kirstens arms what is it it isnt yes he sighed closing his eyes our friend of last night is lying stretched full length under the van patiently waiting for us to emerge kirsten instinctively raised her feet up off the floor felt physically sick did not waste her breath asking what they were going to do that was obvious they stayed right there hoped that eventually somebody would come at least we can shout for help she said at length well try in a bit when people are up and about he replied remembered how this sandpit was virtually soundproof that was the argument the local bikers had used in the big row a few years ago claimed that the pit deadened the sound of their motorbikes had almost convinced the local authorities but he did not tell kirsten that because her nerves were already at breaking point they sat there pressed up against each other watched the first rays of the morning sun turn the vegetation on the top of the quarry a rich golden colour anywhere else they could have appreciated the beauty of natures splendour here it was horribly threatening and in a few hours it was going to get very hot the temperature inside the van would rise become unbearable i ill have to go somewhere she blushed had probably fought against the physical urge for some time well you cant go outside damn it this was unnecessarily embarrassing ive got to theres a gardening bucket somewhere in the back amongst all this clutter he turned round rummaged behind the seat until he found it pulled it out you can use that keith i youll have to he tried to sound sympathetic knew that he would have to urinate too very shortly im going to use it myself in a minute she struggled with her inhibitions finally crawled over into the back what wouldnt i give for a nice cup of tea he said keep talking dont make an issue out of what well both have to do several times before somebody finds us some toast too dont you make me feel hungry she rejoined him in the front do you think we could try shouting yet wed better leave it a bit no use exhausting ourselves every hour from now onwards is going to take it out of us if i know my mum shell have raised the alarm by now we can keep the windows open an inch or so and listen as soon as we think we hear anybody well yell our heads off but there was only silence just the buzzing of insects in the surrounding undergrowth they might have been a thousand miles from civilisation marooned on a driedup waterhole in the middle of some vast arid desert keith had dozed suddenly he was awoken by a movement jerking him back to reality not the restless stirring of his companion but a sudden surge by kirsten the click of the catch on the passenger door the creaking of rusty hinges he moved fast grabbed her shoulder with one hand reached across and slammed the door with the other locked it stop it she let out a scream struck at him with clenched fists her features were screwed up into a mask of panic and desperation her voice shrill with rising hysteria let go of me keith youve no right to keep me here against my will im going to jump out run for the road youd maybe get ten yards he snatched her wrists held them in a strong grip if that you bloody stupid girl you wouldnt have a chance your only hope is to stay here she struggled frantically tried to bite him was twisting her body round in order to free her legs so that she could kick him let go of me you bastard you brute ill that was when he hit her released his hold on her and in the same movement brought the flat of his hand hard across her face threw her head back she screamed but her struggles stopped and then she began to cry uncontrollably im sorry he pulled her to him kissed her tenderly believe me kirsten im so sorry and im sorry too she replied after a while squeezed his hand i must have been mad i dont know what came over me only that i felt id go crazy if i stayed in here a second longer i promise i wont do it again i hope not he reached under the seat came out with a hammer placed it in the glovebox stail sticking out see that whats that for to hit the snake over the head with for you to hit me over the head with if i suddenly try to make a break for it just hammer me good and hard lay me out there were times when you had to make a joke out of a crisis they both laughed then it was back to waiting and praying for once joan doyle had not waited up for her son to come in hed be all right hed only gone down to the davises and you could not really expect a man to be home prompt from courting at eleven oclock she made herself a cup of tea and sat and drank it in the kitchen it was one of those evenings when she found herself indulging in reflections a nostalgic mood brought on by her sons courting she hoped that he would marry kirsten in a way it would be like getting married herself all over again reliving their happiness remembering how things had once been between herself and bob she knew that she could be very attractive if she took the trouble to make herself up fortyfour was no age really there was plenty of time left to find herself a man start all over again no definitely no it would not be the same the second time round far better to grow old with the memories she already had just remember that one chunk of her life from twenty to thirtytwo the best years all the same sometimes she despaired at the thought that in all probability she would never ever enjoy a physical relationship with a man again the thought could age one prematurely turn you into a kind of maiden aunt if you let it she felt guilty about the things she sometimes did to herself in the solitude and privacy of her own bed on those nights when the urge got too much for her a flood of guilt just confessing to herself that whatever would keith think of her if he ever found out the shame of it all but he wasnt likely to there was no way he was going to know unless she told him and she would never admit to that even with her dying breath the mood was coming on her tonight and she knew she could not stop it that was one reason why she wasnt going to sit up and wait for keith she found all kinds of other excuses but she knew the real one and it made her feel guilty she left the hallway light on and went upstairs keith would be all right joan doyle studied her nakedness in the fulllength wardrobe mirror experienced a glow of selfsatisfaction her figure was still passable her breasts were still firm and had not sagged just a few wrinkles on her stomach and a couple of stretch marks she would not be ashamed to let a man see her nude that in itself was an exciting thought her inhibitions always disappeared when she put the light out it was as though she stepped into another world she tossed the sheets aside and lowered herself on to the bed smoothed her fingers sensuously up and down the insides of her thighs escalated her feelings she was quivering all over trembling with anticipation determined to take her time and enjoy every second of it goodness it was ages since she had been in a mood as strong as this if a man had walked into the bedroom right now she would have let him have his way pleaded with him to do it if necessary seduced him thrown herself at him a thought crossed her mind she wondered if keith and kirsten did no she didnt want to think about it just herself the time that soldier had dated her the year before she had met bob had walked her across the fields and down to the meadow by the river she had told him no over and over again but finally she had said yes and they had not got home until well after midnight she couldnt hold off much longer her slender fingers going to places she had been determined to keep them away from for a while yet moving faster and faster and faster her whole body was caught up in a maelstrom taut as a bowstring and then everything seemed to give she thrashed and writhed rolled from one side of the bed to the other and back again over on to her stomach crying her joy into the pillow the aftermath was so relaxing like floating in a warm bubble bath without a care in the world savouring the drowsiness trying to hold off sleep as long as she could was that a door closing downstairs she couldnt be sure but anyway it was a good job that keith was late home because he might have heard her otherwise she would have to be careful in future but it would be a long time before she got in a mood as strong as that again her fantasies and memories followed her into sleep bob tall and strong on their wedding night she had lied and told him she was a virgin she couldnt have done otherwise without admitting to having gone with alistair that evening and shed never do that in the darkened councilsemi nuptial chamber she was aware of her new husband alongside her of his efforts at marital seduction secretly she was crying out for him to roll on top of her those rough hands of his a brickies callouses scraping their way up her legs she eased her thighs apart an invitation to him to feel in between them go on bob touch me there he did but somehow it was no longer sensuous his roughness abrasive to her own sensitivity a cold hard probing finger when it should have been soft and warm another movement that hurt her gouged her soft moist flesh catapulted her back into wakefulness if it was an erotic dream then it did not vanish with waking the hand feeling her was still there clumsily manipulating female organs that shut off instantly she sat up wanted to push it away and at that moment she saw it a long dark shape like a trailing length of rope starkly outlined against the white background of the under sheet draped from the foot of the bed right up on to her unclothed body moving wriggling a squat head erect and looking down at her she did not scream she was incapable of doing anything except lie there and watch with terrified fascination and loathing its very touch robbing her of all her powers her mind was a total blank clinging to disbelief seeing it move nearer and nearer the reptilian intruder struck with a lightning lunge of its head buried its fangs into the soft flesh of a breast the terrified woman arching upwards with sudden pain her spinal cord cracking under the pressure her body was on fire a burning sensation spreading out in all directions flaying arms and legs slapping and kicking and trying to dislodge the creature that was now entwining itself around her so cold so strong so dominant in an obscene simulation of reptilian and human copulation joan doyle screamed just once before she died subconsciously tried to check that cry of terror in case it brought keith rushing into the room she felt her life being squeezed from her an expulsion of air and vomit bursting like a balloon filled with water might have done and after it had feasted for the second time that night the african rock python left by the way it had entered out through the open window negotiated the drainpipe with ease and slunk away in the direction of the old graveyard man was easy prey if you were cunning enough to single out an unsuspecting victim now it would sleep the daylight hours away in the safety of that underground lair chapter john price was knocking on the door of the doyles council house shortly after seven oclock the next morning an air of urgency and frustration about him where the hell was the guy his van was not parked in the short drive perhaps keiths mother could give him some information god was she bloody well deaf in the end he gave up turned away and headed back towards the police station christ alone knew where they were going to search today there werent many places left he slowed his step halted no reason except a kind of premonition his thoughts going back to the doyles keith was hardly likely to have left for work at this hour of the morning so where had he gone none of your bloody business john price and his mother gone with him probably the zoologist stood there his forehead creased he felt a nagging concern in all probability there was a simple innocuous answer to those questions at any other time yes but with the occupants of stainforth hiding behind closed doors and windows nobody went out much at all except for absolute necessities mrs doyle was probably still in bed and keith had not actually promised to help him hell he didnt need him yes he did he needed company somebody to talk to to pool a few ideas maybe throw a different angle on the whole thing slowly john began to retrace his steps towards those few council houses his uneasy feeling growing stronger by the yard there had been horrific deaths nobody was safe you got to believe that almost anything could happen to anybody including yourself he knocked on the door again louder this time thumping it so that the woodwork rattled no answer he walked round the side of the house for some reason councilhouse dwellers seldom opened their front doors everybody using the rear entrance a sort of tradition that dated back to wartime days he tapped on the glass panel of the back door did not expect any answer he could see into the small kitchen through into the hallway a light was burning and that was damned odd he got a peculiar sensation in the pit of his stomach an apprehension that was manifesting itself theres something terribly wrong here john price he tried the door it was unlocked swung right back on its hinges youve no business opening peoples doors or going inside but all the same he stepped over the threshold you could find yourself in an awful lot of trouble you ought to go and fetch pc aylott or one of the other policemen mounting the stairs his feeling that all was not well escalated with each step and then when he was almost at the landing the stench hit him a vile odour that brought back memories of those hours he had spent in the laboratory at university carrying out experiments on dead creatures steeling himself to the stink of dissected bodies intestines blood offal god this place stank i dont know what the hells happened maybe i should go for the police you might as well check first he recoiled in the bedroom doorway had to lean against the wall for support heaved and almost threw up wanted to turn and flee and would probably have done so had his legs not suddenly weakened until they were scarcely able to support the weight of his body the crumpled bed sheets were soaked in blood which had saturated the mattress and dripped right through to form a pool on the carpet beneath the wails were splashed and streaked with crimson and a vile slimy matter which he recognised instantly as human intestines adhered to the flowery wallpaper in places hanging down in strings a human intestinal explosion had taken place whoever had been in this room had been crushed with such force that they had burst and then disappeared the remnants of the corpse vanished completely it was the python of course even in his state of dazed shock john price read the scene as others might read a book the constrictor had entered by the open window had scented a victim inside and scaled the wall by means of a convenient drainpipe no trouble at all then having devoured its prey it had returned whence it had come and that was what was eluding everybody the whereabouts of the snakes lair he went back downstairs holding on to the stairrail the whole way shaken repulsed he vomited outside on the drive if mrs doyle was the victim then where was her son the operational hq had an atmosphere of confusion about it groups of police and soldiers clustered outside around the vehicles a meeting of some kind was being held in the small office john recognised burlington colonel marks chief inspector watts and several others through the open window caught a buzz oflow voices you cant go in there sir a uniformed sergeant barred his path to the door i have to im sorry sir theres been a killing another death the officer puffed his cheeks out closed his eyes opened them again who where his voice was low tired the council houses the doyles im not sure which one mrs doyle probably it was the python well get somebody up there right away the sergeant gave some instructions to another officer in the doorway turned back to the zoologist theres problems this morning pc aylott vanished during the night shift we dont think its the snakes he just appears to have walked out his nerve might have cracked we dont know anyway its not up to me to say where are we going to search today john was still shaking from his experience the last thing he wanted was another day in the burning sun bashing out thick undergrowth well be told soon the policeman replied until then youll just have to hang around like everybody else it was another ten minutes before the superintendent emerged from the building those lines in his features etched even deeper his voice husky as though he had done a lot of talking and his vocal cords were on the verge of packing up there is the possibility that we have another snake casualty he addressed the crowded driveway commanded an instant silence the listeners felt the tension the sudden change in those around them we cannot be sure at the moment but it seems that way also we have one of our officers missing but again we do not know if that is directly linked to the current crisis we must therefore for the safety of this community assume that the snakes have not left the area we have searched for them diligently and for that i thank every one of you but now the time has come when we must change our tactics we shall not let up on the offensive but priority has to be given to the defence of this village we must guard every house hours a day leaving just a small band to continue the search no more lives must be lost let us hope that we can conclude this terrible business in as short a time as possible john price moved away back out on to the road they would not be needing him today maybe not again the searches over the last few days had yielded nothing he had not come up with a magical formula for finding the serpents hidden lair so he had not been much use after all they could dispense with him now the authorities resented civilian help you could sense it even if they did not put it into words they used you just so long as you were useful to them he had the rest of the day to kill somehow the rest of the week month year except for aunt elsies funeral tomorrow he had no plans that was when being unemployed hit you you had no plans nobody had any for you just hang around john price the game of eternal waiting building up futile hopes a police van passed him it would be going up to the doyles he grimaced he wondered again where keith had gone and aylott there were a lot of disquieting unexplained mysteries right now something interrupted his thoughts a movement breaking into his morbid reverie a small creature darting across the road long body reddish brown fur streamlined a halfjar on his nerves alarm bells starting to ring in his system and then cutting out because it was a false alarm these days everything that moved had to be a snake until proved otherwise he identified the animal just as it was disappearing into the overgrown verge on the opposite side of the road a stoat the fiercest of all british mammals for its size a predator a killer of his brain was beginning to click a human computer assimilating facts processing data a killer of snakes certainly but only small ones grass snakes like die one that had caused his aunt to have a heart attack adders not big ones like those that had escaped but family mustelidae comprising stoats weasels otterspine martens polecats and his pulses were beginning to race his computer was coming up with the answer had already given it to him but he was barely able to accept it in his excitement family mustelidae the ferret family and the big daddy of them all the mongoose jesus christ almighty why hadnt he thought of it before the one creature that was the nemesis of all snakes at one time imported from india to latin america to control a plague of reptiles rikkitikkitavi the mongoose hero invented by rudyard kipling the creature that fought and overcame a cobra and a krait it was the answer the only solution to the crisis in stainforth juvenile excitement took him over almost had him sprinting back to the station superintendent ive hit on the answer all we need is a pair of mongooses theyd find the snakes kill em too the whole thing could be over in an hour or two youre crazy laddie we cant go loosing more wild animals into the countryside contravening the wildlife and countryside act of look what happened when a few mink escaped and bred the scourge of domestic animals poultry rivers and weve never got rid of the ratlike grey squirrel since some bloody idiot thought it would be great to have a few of them in the suburban parks and gardens it wouldnt work we wouldnt allow it you wouldnt allow it but it would work as far as the snakes are concerned isnt human life more important than ducks and geese and trout in the rivers it was a matter of conscience not a decision to be taken at a desk somewhere far removed from the danger his decision he stood beneath the shade of a leafy oak tree rolled a cigarette with unsteady fingers he needed a few minutes to calm himself to think clearly if you jump in do it with both feet no half measures in other words dont fuck it up go the whole hog and be prepared to take the consequences his tidy mind began to put everything in order formulate a hypothetical plan of action if it was to be mongooses then they had to be brought here secretly and released under the cover of darkness point number two where in hell do you find a mongoose bill arkwright might still have one john prices pulses pounded again bill had been at university with him had got his degree and gone back to scotland to work on snakebite serums had his own private collection of reptiles had had the necessary licence to keep dangerous animals granted on research grounds arkwright had kept a pair of mongooses as pets john remembered that rumpus with the rspca when some busybody had written and claimed that bill was organising mongoosesnake fights and was taking bets on the outcome the case was disproved and it had all died down john wondered if bill still had his place up in edinburgh if he still had those mongooses and if he would be prepared to help all bloody ifs again but there was only one way to find out aunt elsie really should have had a telephone installed she might have been alive now if she had had some means of summoning help and john price would have been able to sit down in comfort and privacy and attempt to track down bill arkwright as it was he found himself in the ovenlike telephone box on the green keeping the door propped open with one foot whilst he tried to persuade a directory enquiries operator to locate a mr w arkwright in edinburgh no im afraid i dont know his address but i cant tell you how urgent it is normally we dont look for numbers without an address sir but on this occasion he hoped three pounds worth of tenpence pieces would be enough another few hours and it would have been a lot cheaper there was a saying that time was money it was also lives arkwright speaking bill this is john price who bleep bleep bleep it took him another ten pence to establish his identity why john of course how are you look old boy let me ring you back or well never put two words together without that bloody thing interrupting briefly john told arkwright the story most of which the other had read in the newspapers anyway his own involvement the death of his aunt what you need is a bloody mongoose to hunt em out johns hopes soared as bill came back at him with his own theory soon sort the buggers out thats what im ringing you about bill you mean have i still got rick and tick and can you borrow them sure i have and if you take the responsibility and fetch em youre welcome to em i still get the ruddy rspca poking round from time to time to check that im not snakefighting with them youll have to fetch em though and if you get caught with em theyre not mine oh sure john did some mental calculations a round trip of something like four hundred miles twelve hours in the mini if she didnt play up back in stainforth before dark ill see you early afternoon then he replaced the receiver stepped gratefully outside into the hot sunshine twelve hours driving in this bloody heat twelve twentyfour thirtysix hed do it if it meant death to the killer snakes and tomorrow afternoon as he sat head bowed in the cool of the church at aunt elsies funeral he would have the secret satisfaction of knowing that he had made the snakes pay for their killings he would never have believed during those long years of studying for his degree that he would ever come to hate reptiles the way he did now twenty minutes later he was in the old mini both windows wound down in the hope of a cool breeze driving out of stainforth down past the church past the track leading to the old disused quarry where he used to play on his visits here as a boy he wondered if it was still there probably partly filled in by its own avalanches and overgrown with vegetation he would not have any regrets about that remembered the time when he had gone there after butterflies for his collection had scaled one of the steep sand walls in an attempt to catch a red admiral and had fallen fifteen feet fortunately the soft sand in the bottom had broken his fall otherwise he might have broken a leg or worse it used to be a damned dangerous place his thoughts returned to keith doyle somehow he did not believe that the gardener had left stainforth and that made it all the more worrying because pc aylott had vanished into thin air also john price filtered on to the motorway moved into the middle lane and jammed his foot down on the accelerator as far as it would go suddenly he was aware that he did not have that unemployed feeling any more chapter were baling that sandpit field today no matter what the army the police or any other bugger says jack jervis informed his son when he came in to breakfast after doing the early morning round of the stock field you cant waste bloody weather like this and i wont be happy till all that hay is under cover blimey dad said sam jervis splashing milk on to his cereals knowing that his earlier suspicions were correct and that the old man was in one of his moods it aint goin to rain for weeks if it ever rains again not just a bad mood a very bad mood we cant chance it jervis senior chewed noisily took a swallow of tea to help the stringy bacon down we cant just sit around doin nowt this bloody nonsense could go on for weeks i dont like the idea o you and sam goin up there dora jervis shuffled across the room deposited a plate of toast on the table them snakes are dangerous silence just a smacking of greasy lips as the jervis family meditated on the perils of snakes jack and dora had rented their scattered smallholding for the past twenty years a kind of gettingawayfromlorrydriving move it had been a messy venture made all the more disorganised by the fact that their rented land was scattered around stainforth fifteen acres of meadowland that phil burton was only too pleased to find a tenant for rough tussocks of unpalatable grazing two more tracts of eleven and nine acres and finally the sandpit field leased from the council all run from their existing tumbledown dwelling and the few acres that they actually owned in the beginning jack had had to rely on casual farm work to make ends meet rumour had it that his capital investment had come from equipment stolen from his various employers nothing serious enough to warrant police investigation a roll or two of sheepnetting from one place a few stakes and staples from another jacks mechanical knowledge from his haulage days came in handy enabled him to keep their old ferguson tractor going and with some very untidy improvisations they managed to scrape a meagre living sam was an accident set them back a bit but they got by in their own slovenly fashion their shortcomings were many but all were agreed that the one thing they did not shirk was work sam was not at all keen on the idea of lugging the bales off the sandpit field but if the old man said that that was what they were going to do today then that was what they would do he had learned many years ago not to argue with his father dora watched the two of them file out of the room and sighed loudly jack worked the boy too hard never gave him any time off sam was a hired labourer on a pittance of a wage not a son the boy was bright enough would in all probability have done well at school if jack had not persistently kept him at home to help with the harvest the lambing every seasonal job as it came round tell em youve ad the eadache boy he would say at every period of absenteeism from school sometimes it was the bellyache just to ring the changes sam might have gone on to sixthform college if his school attendances had not been so inconsistent but jack jervis wouldnt have stood for that work is what you do with yer ands boy not sittin at a desk thinkin about it she began to clear the table sam would end up an ignorant pig just like his father she couldnt change either of them so she might as well go along with them they would still be scratching for a living in another twenty years time work was a way of life to sam jervis seven days a week days a year he did not expect anything else on a holding like this one you did every job yourselves spent as little money as possible a cycle that you began again as soon as the old one ended this bloody heat was a bit much though he wondered how the old man could stand not just a shirt on but a woollen waistcoat worn over it trousers and heavy boots too all sam was wearing was a pair of denim shorts hacked from his old working jeans when the lower legs became threadbare and a pair of scuffed pumps the routine was always the same dad drove the tractor and trailer sam rode on the back then between them they loaded the trailer with bales stacked high and precariously and trundled back home where they unloaded them into the barn they managed three loads before lunch and estimated that there were probably another five left they would finish around teatime a late tea the upright exhaust belched black fumes as they drove past the church sam glanced idly at the track leading into the quarry the old sandpit was technically theirs its acreage included in the rent they paid the council each quarter for the field now that was a bloody waste a piece of ground that you could not plough up would not hold stock he wondered if there was any way of filling it in levelling it up to the field that surrounded it the ferguson struggled up the steep incline shuddered to a halt by the first stack of eight bales jack jervis leapt down shouted at sam to hurry we aint got all bloody day boy eight bales loaded drawing up to the next pile another eight layered on top of those now it was sams job to clamber up on to them take the bales from his father as the old man hoisted them up to him on the prongs of a pitchfork jesus the old man would have a heart attack if he didnt slow up working in a nearfrenzy in this bloody heat it had to be ninety in the shade today one day the silly old fucker would drop in his tracks just like that and ill bloody well load him up on top of the hay and take him down home and it wont spoil our tea either hay bales were coming up on to the trailer as though they were on a mechanical conveyor belt ease up you daft bat suddenly sam jervis stopped ignored the bale that had just bounced against those he was trying to stack toppling them in a heap above the drone of pollenhunting bees he detected the sound of a human voice a muffled cry he listened hard and it came again help it was difficult to discern just where the shout had come from either it was muffled or else it was a long way away even as far as the village it could on the other hand be as close as the sandpit a few hundred yards down at the bottom of this sloping field what the bloody hells happening up there you bloody well fallen asleep another bale flew up bounced off the fallen pile and rolled off the trailer thudded on to the ground ten feet below listen sam snapped back just shut up and listen for a second what the hell are you on about boy just listen a minute will you dad help the cry came again weaker this time as though the caller was growing tired but it definitely came from the sandpit there you are you heard that didnt you dad sam peered anxiously over the bales saw his father retrieving the fallen one spearing it with the pikle lifting it up to throw it back up again dont tell me you didnt hear that i heard bloody nothin sam jervis grunted his red face perspiring freely youre paid to work not to sit about listening for things i tell you dad somebodys in trouble and it sounds like theyre in the sam broke off as the flying bale hit him caught him off balance and sent him staggering back to sprawl amongst the pile of bales you silly old bastard theres something happened to somebody sam jervis screamed a shrill cry of pain that daft old fucker had tossed the pitchfork up at him caught him on the leg he bounded up with a roar of rage that turned to a shriek of terror all around his feet were little black wriggling things like burned sausages slithering to and fro and amidst them was a much larger one somewhere between a foot and eighteen inches long a furious creature that whipped and lashed him struck at his legs with its venomous fangs adders he tried to flee but a heap of bales prevented him theres fucking adders up here at least sam thought they were adders they looked like the ones hed seen before except that they were much darker in colour he didnt care what species just that they were snakes and everybody in stainforth was hiding from them jack jervis moved with surprising agility clawed his way up on to the trailer clambered over the mountain of bales a stubby unlit pipe clenched between his teeth the pitchfork in his hands his son was lying on a bale directing a series of futile kicks at the snake which was attempting to wriggle up after him and down below the smaller snakes were milling in a heap like maggots that had fallen from a piece of putrefying meat black bloated worms get yer fuckin legs outa the way the farmer hissed poised his pikle as though he was about to hurl a javelin and struck savagely downwards his aim was true a prong speared the enraged reptile and he held it up it thrashed furiously but could not dislodge itself got you you bugger sam closed his eyes the pain in his leg was making him feel faint and he certainly did not wish to be a spectator to a bout of his fathers cruelty old jack jervis was going to have a field day enjoy every second of this massacre just as he had gloated over that sheep he had killed for the freezer last autumn he had cut its throat and stood there and watched its lifes blood spout all over the yard come and watch this boy or ell be gone waste o time and effort stunning em first with a deft twirl such as an accomplished spaghettieater might have used to unfurl a length from his fork jack sent the mortally wounded adder flying through the air es as good as dead he turned to the nest of young and began jabbing and chopping piling wrigglers up the prongs of the pitchfork one after another seven in all in as many seconds look at them lot boy there was a note of pride in his rough voice black adders aint seen no black ones for years not since i was your age but they die just as easy as the brown uns sam sprawled with his back against a bale his vision darkening clinging to some taut baling twine in case he blacked out arid fell from the trailer his leg was beginning to swell up the pain coursing upwards oh christ and all that stupid old bugger thought about was killing ahha a grunt of triumph from jervis as he held the spiked snakes aloft just look at that lot the little devils never dreamed theyd meet up with old jack when they got caught up in the baler thatll teach em a forward motion with the long fork sending the baby adders hurtling into the air frantic death wriggles as they hit the ground beyond the tractor thatll bloody teach em dad sam was clinging on to that bale trying not to spew now whats the matter with you son stupid old fucker ive been bitten my leg jack jervis laid the pikle down turned towards his son saw the puffy blotched patch just above the ankle on sams exposed leg twin pinpoint pricks that oozed a trickle of blood old easy the farmer dropped on to his knees felt in his pockets and produced a bonehandled penknife nowt to worry about it wont be the first adder bite ive dealt with took one out o meself on more than one occasion when i was a boy there used to be adders aplenty in those days dont hardly see em at all today now lets get this done sos we can get on sam bit his lip knew only too well what his father was about to do please god let me faint first old still then dad take me to the doctor it was a long time since he had last pleaded with god or his father and it appeared that neither were prepared to listen to him in olden times they gave you something to bite on a swig of rum you wouldnt get either from dad they took time and cost money he yelled and writhed as the knife blade made an incision tried to faint but failed he guessed what the dirty old bugger would do when hed cut into the wound ugh sam threw up but could not shut out the slurping sound his father made as he sucked the venom out of the wound the same noise he made when he drank his tea spitting that was another of his habits a blob of phlegm and venom youll be ok now boy sam opened his eyes stared at the mess of vomit dripping off the bale by his head it reminded him of the canned potato salad that his mother sometimes bought whats the matter with you now annoyance a reprimand because he had not leaped straight up and begun restacking those hay bales you should be bloody grateful to me boy lucky i was here to get the poison out for you im in bloody agony thats what god hedve punched the old bugger if hed had the strength i need to see the doctor get something put on the bite maybe an injection youll be all right we got too much work to do without wastin time goin to the doctor and a lot o bleedin good e is anyway sam managed to stand leaning up against the bales everything was topsyturvy spinning round but he did not think he would faint now unless he looked down at his leg tell you what there was a sarcastic condescending tone in his fathers voice spittle trickling down his bristly chin ill stack these bales up and you can have a nice lazy time sitting on em on the ride back down then by the time we get home youll be feelin well enough to offload em every bone in sam jerviss body jarred on the slow ride down the sandpit field and out on to the road and his leg hurt like hell it was bleeding quite a lot he did not dare look but he could feel the sticky warm blood seeping down into his shoe a cloud of black flies swarming on it settling to feed buzzing loudly they were in the yard now reversing up to the bay sam opened his eyes everything was going dark like dusk had come several hours early the tractors engine died and his father was bawling for him to get up and start throwing those bales off shaddup you old goat come on then stop playing up i need a doctor wheres mum something i got to tell her oh yes theres somebody in trouble in the sandpit those shouts got to let somebody know he started to struggle up get slingin them bales off come on we aint nowhere near finished yet theres nowt bloody wrong with you now sam jervis had been indoctrinated by his father for far too long to give an outright refusal he was on his feet letting go of his support the barn in front rocking steadily from side to side and then upturning completely dad in the sandpit a hoarse whisper that took everything he could put into it im bleedin waitin boy sam jervis took a step forward and then everything went black he fell rolled off the top of those bales and hit the yard with a sickening thud and in the open doorway of the house dora jervis began to scream chapter the snake was back on the bonnet of the van keith doyle had not been aware of its return only saw that it was there again coiled up and watching them intently he twisted round to look at his watch noted that it was almost nine oclock christ what a bloody day that snake had been the lucky one it had been able to take advantage of the shade beneath the vehicle during the hottest hours whilst he and kirsten had roasted and suffocated inside kirsten was still in an uneasy sleep moving her head restlessly from side to side her cracked lips had a bluish tint and were slightly swollen her dress saturated with sweat clung wetly to her shapely figure any other time or place it would have been a turnon for him right now though he just felt weak and ill but most of all he was worried about her no way could either of them last another day that spell of shouting for help had robbed them of their last reserves of strength swollen their tongues and brought their thirst to a peak they had spent hours listening occasionally caught the faint hum of a passing car back on the road kirsten had commented how far away the traffic seemed and eventually it had dawned on her that if they could only just hear vehicles then anybody on the highway stood little chance of hearing them shout there had been a look of despair in her eyes at this realisation and keith had attempted to reassure her he did not think that he had succeeded then they had heard a tractor close but still muffled it was no good shouting whilst the farmer presuming it was a farmer had his engine running and so they waited eventually there was silence and they had yelled until they were hoarse until they had spent themselves mentally and vocally some time later it seemed hours they heard the tractor start up again and drive away it did not come back that was when kirsten broke down and sobbed again cried herself to sleep in keiths arms the day wore on and towards evening the atmosphere cooled somewhat keith experienced nausea and thirst a terrible combination that resulted in a desire to vomit only he did not have anything left to throw up neither of them had used the bucket since midday and he knew they were beginning to dehydrate he had been tempted to open the door a few inches and take another look beneath the van perhaps the snake had tired of waiting had slunk off somewhere surely it too had to sleep sometime but even if it was not in sight he would not know exactly where it was it was cunning enough to try to trick them lull them into thinking that it had gone away and then when they emerged ambush them from the thick cover which grew luxuriantly all along the track leading to safety there wasnt much point in seeing if it was still beneath the vehicle it could be anywhere within a few yards of them he knew they could not last another day in here certainly kirsten could not whatever the outcome he would have to try and go for help he calculated mentally his weaponry in the back a spade a fork a hoe a sickle possibly the latter was the most suitable he had honed the blade to a razor sharpness only two or three days ago it was capable of cutting that monster out there in two provided it did not get him first if nobody had found them by morning he would make the attempt just thinking about it sent little shivers up and down his spine his imagination giving him a frightening preview of what might happen no sign of the bastard getting out slowly carefully trying to stop that door from creaking a quick look round now running the gauntlet of undergrowth that tore at his legs tried to bring him down low branches whipping his face always the fear that the next tuft of long grass might suddenly unfurl a coloured serpent a devil that moved too fast for the eye to follow not this one then maybe the next nearly crazy with fear exhausted his reflexes slowed down worried about what would happen to kirsten if he did not make it he wondered again what species it was and how deadly was its bite even if it inflicted its venom into his body surely death would not be instantaneous he would be able to make it to the village and raise the alarm before there was no way of knowing what might happen until he actually made the attempt he closed his eyes and felt his body starting to relax sleep if you can youre going to need all the energy you can muster and now the snake was back on the bonnet again he looked at it studied its colourful markings those red black and white rings through the thick glass of a cage in a reptile house you would find yourself marvelling at its colourings through the windscreen of an overheated van which you had not been outside of for the last hours your appreciation was somewhat diminished you just wished the fucking thing did not exist or else that it was dead you wanted all snakes extinct he marvelled at its motionless posture there was not so much as a blink from those cold penetrating eyes but you knew that it watched your every movement hypnotic in an awesome way go on make a run for it ill give you a fiveyard start no way not yet its still around then he was amazed at the relaxed tone of kirstens voice worried too because this heat might cause you to react in a number of ways hallucinations disorientation anything that might put you at risk you didnt even trust yourself at least we can see it we know where it is he replied try the starter again she said its just a waste of time after this length of time the battery will be completely dead well weve nothing to lose go on keith give it a go all right he fumbled for the key but dont get raising any hopes because it wont the startermotor shuddered turned suddenly had life back in it and fired keith its going to go kirsten yelled she pulled herself upright the fatigue the exhaustion suddenly falling from her we can leave hold on were not out of the wood yet he pumped the throttle got the revs and kept them anticipated the engine fading any second it didnt it was running sweetly for one that had nearly miles on the clock the chassis vibrating rattling the tools in the back it was a dream a cruel nightmare one of those where you found yourself unable to run any further just as you took flight from some unmentionable horror or else you lost your way and never found it again maybe it was himself who was having hallucinations not his companion what are you waiting for she had her voice back yelled at him we can go im waiting because i dont believe it the snake moved seemed to shift its entire body into a tighter coil pressed itself up against the windscreen as though it knew the van was about to move and was settling itself into a secure position so that it would not be dislodged when they bumped their way back down the track here we go he shouted back at her at the top of his voice full speed ahead for stainforth keith crashed the lever into bottom gear felt the van move forward bumping over rough ground there was room enough to swing it around in a circle and drive straight out much easier than trying to reverse all the way back through the overhanging trees and undergrowth two minutes probably less and well be out on the road this euphoria was an unforgettable experience suddenly everything had come right they did not have any more worries if the snake stayed on for the whole way then that was fine the police or the army would soon deal with it they bumped their way over more stones and deep ruts keith now going into a lefthand circle hard over on full lock degrees and now they were facing in the opposite direction gathering speed so that he had to change up to second gear the exit from this place of terror looming up in front of them he would take it at speed go like hell all the way and that was when the engine suddenly coughed lost its momentum hiccupped again and petered out oh no kirsten cried and buried her face in her hands as the van slowed rolled to a halt they sat there saying nothing because there was nothing to say staring at the red ignition warning light on the dashboard hating it blaming it keith reached for the key switched it off what happened kirsten asked at length were out of petrol an admission of guilt was in his tone a resignation to their plight an apology and the snake on the bonnet seemed to grin at them through the glass i was nearly empty yesterday i should have filled up but i didnt im sorry kirsten then the battery wasnt fiat after all i guess not probably a dicky lead or some dirt under the terminals what the fuck does it matter what it was were back to square one in almost exactly the same place except that were facing in the opposite direction if the batterys working again now then then perhaps the horn will work we can blow it attract attention the horn did work a piping squeak rather than the expected klaxon blast the sound came back at them off the quarry walls hurtful to the ears remonstrated with them for breaking the silence keith stopped after half a dozen goes it was futile no louder than their shouting some hours ago he did not look at kirsten im sorry darling i wish the engine had never started up at least then we knew what we were up against i gave you hope and immediately destroyed it were going to die arent we she said at length her voice steady not crying staring out of the side window i dont know he could not lie to her not if i can help it look im going to try and make a break for it no not with that monstrosity perched out there waiting not immediately he smiled probably in the morning when it gets light theres a sickle in the back the blades like a razor it would cut that snake in two at one stroke unless it bit you first she clutched his arm afraid that he might suddenly decide to make a run for freedom now thats a chance ill have to take better that than both of us dying in here and anyway even if i do get bitten i probably wont die it isnt a python it cant crush me ill make it to the village send help back to rescue you you can bet your life that doctor brennan has at this moment got every available type of snakebite serum handy in his surgery of course there were certain snake poisons that had no known antidote he didnt tell kirsten that just hoped that the creature on the bonnet was not one of those i want to come with you she said dont be bloody silly theres no point in us both getting bitten i suppose youre right she sighed but if im asleep wake me up before you go i promise he leaned across kissed her oh and theres something else she murmured not that i suppose it makes any difference now whats that im not pregnant a sudden pang of anxiety had him asking but you will marry me wont you of course i will she smiled brushed her lips against his i was always going to anyway it was just that my folks made everything so difficult for me i guess it took these last few hours to make me realise that i dont have to do everything they say so some good has come out of it dont spoil it all keith dont let that snake bite you ill be ok he kissed her again id say right now its numbers up if its foolish enough to get too close to me he felt lightheaded euphoric wanted to open die window shout out loud that everything was fine that kirsten davis was going to marry him no matter what her folks said there was only one thing marring his happiness that snake coiled up on the bonnet of the van primed to kill chapter the snakes were becoming restless down in their underground lair they had slept throughout the heat of the day and now with the coming of night they were stirring they were hungry they were afraid but that was not all the inborn hatred of different species for each other was beginning to manifest itself above all most hated the huge african rock python that dominated them ruled over them natures pecking order it existed in every form of life im the biggest the boss so i can kick you but you can kick the next smallest and so on the python had stolen their prey the man that had dropped into their lair it had driven them from him so that it could feast it had also made a foray into the open under the cover of darkness and they knew it had eaten again it was capable of killing them too throughout the day it had slept curled up on a wormeaten coffin in the far corner the ancient wood creaking beneath its weight asleep but alert aware of every movement the others made there were five of them clustered together down in that tomb a russells viper a cobra an african mamba a western diamondback rattlesnake and the python the coral snake had gone off somewhere and had not returned possibly it had been killed as its male had been none of them were concerned for anything but themselves for this was a forced uniting soon they would all go their different ways seek out their own territory they had been too long in this place cooped up together they had been cunning enough to fool the hunters it was the python who had found this place dislodged the flat stone with its weight and they had followed it down entered into a kind of truce which was now coming to an end tonight they would all leave but they would not flee like a defeated army because their anger and their pride would not allow it they would become individuals again hunt and kill in their own way they knew all about the village man was easy prey except that he was not food except for the python they would kill before they left strike in the only manner they knew swiftly and silently under the cover of darkness moving from one victim to another taking their revenge for a lifetime of incarceration inflicting terror and pain on those who had come to mock them in their prisons in the beginning the snakes had been afraid bewildered at finding unexpected freedom in a land where they became the hunted but now they had adapted their terror was gone the python was the first to leave sliding off the coffin and easing its long body up through that hole in the roof the heavy stone pushed to one side so that the others might follow the darkness swallowing it up it was gone no longer their leader each one on its own once they were in the open this was the parting of the ways the russells viper followed the mamba close behind it separating in the overgrowth their ways diverging the rattlesnake left some time later and then the cobra which had been sleeping heavily vacating that place below ground which stank heavily of death and decay they took various routes but all headed back towards the village where their enemy slumbered they moved silently barely a rustling of the sunscorched undergrowth denoted their passing following the hedges skirting the hard road picking up the rancid stench of man in the warm atmosphere and becoming angry the young corporal had taken up his position in the porch of the rising sun at ten oclock all the others policemen and soldiers envied him but it would have been more than his stripes were worth to go into the bar anyway he did not need to there was a pint awaiting him on the step when he arrived two fillups before closing time and when the doors were locked the landlord left a couple of cans of export within easy reach he was a hero without having done anything to warrant it and probably would not have to do more than sit there until dawn with a doublebarrelled bore loaded with bb shot across his knees life was a doddle an army career was like a lottery you drew your ticket and took what they gave you now take charlie ford he reflected hed had a belfast posting was currently lying on a hospital bed because a snipers bullet had chipped his spine probably would never walk again you had to take what lady luck dished out to you the money was no great shakes but they fed you clothed you gave you a home and your pay cheque was just spending money the snakes were a welcome diversion a week ago he had been on a commando training course in a remote area of wales they put you through it tried to find your limit of endurance the corporal had almost broken but the snakes had saved him the orders came through and twelve hours later he was sitting on his backside drinking beer in a village hed never even heard of before they wouldnt find the snakes of course they bloody well wouldnt but they had to be seen to be doing something about it or else there would have been a public outcry the whole business could have turned into a political issue a squabbling match in westminster the snakes would not be seen again the poor buggers were probably scared to death lost in a strange land with nothing to eat ok so a few people had been killed there were some funerals tomorrow but that was because the frightened snakes had panicked in all probability the reptiles had now crawled away somewhere to die people were getting killed all over the world every day of the year and always would be a single streetlamp cast a circle of orange light across the road and into the small car park that was handy you didnt have to keep straining your eyes in the dark he was paid to do a job and he would do it you got lazy if you didnt the soldier popped another can of export took a long drink and set it down on the stone step beside him his eyes dropped to the shotgun across his knees funny things shotguns he had never handled one before let alone fired one to a professional they seemed amateurish nothing technically complicated no rangefinders or anything like that you didnt even have to sight them just pointed them at your target pulled the trigger and blasted whatever you wanted to blast clumsy he thought no marksmanship required a spread of shot that couldnt miss thats why these sportsmen used them because they wouldnt bloody hit anything if they used a rifle the company had had a briefing from the co on the use of shotguns swing with your target and keep on swinging even after youve fired keep both eyes open the soldier supposed they had to say something couldnt just dole out weapons and leave you to find out for yourself how to use them hed read somewhere that the raf used them for claypigeon shooting some kind of training exercise more like a bit of sport for the toffs the corporal checked that the safety catch was on dont want the bloody thing going off and demolishing the pub else ill be on my way back to wales tomorrow christ you could still smell that field that had burned the stench of charred undergrowth wafting on the faint breeze some fire that had been he wished he had been here to see it it had been virtually out when b company had rolled into stainforth just a dampingdown operation left for the firefighters idly he wondered why the firemen had left that hose lying across the road bloody careless of them it was all right for cars they could bump over it but it might unseat a cyclist even a motorcyclist if he was going too fast the soldier decided he would report it to the major in the morning theres a hose left lying across the road by the rising sun sir a potential hazard to motorists and cyclists see how alert ive been i havent been kipping like some of the boys have he drank some more beer checked the time again another hour and a half and it would be starting to get light his duty finished at seven and he had the rest of the day off until pm hours in military terminology he wondered what the birds were like in this place country bumpkins probably it might be better to take a bus into town the trouble was with night duty you never stood much chance with birds in the daytime most of them were at work see you tonight soldier boy sorry im on duty but you couldnt have it both ways he could be lying in a hospital bed flat on his back with no chance of ever walking again like charlie something was wrong he did not quite know what it was something his trained senses had picked up and said hey boy thats not quite right check your foreground and background log every detail in your mind listen look for something out of place movable camouflage bushes creeping in on you that bloody hose that was what it was the bugger was lying on the edge of the car park now and the road was clear sorry sir i made a mistake it wasnt on the road after all now how the fuck did that get across there somebody mustve oh jesus on a bike its moving he stared in horrified fascination as the long length eased itself across the shale as though somebody had an invisible wire attached to it was pulling it along some kind of joke the local yobbos taking the piss out of the soldiers trying to scare them with makebelieve snakes it was a snake a bloody big one the corporal instinctively retreated up a step knocked his beer over sent the can clinking and rolling across the sloping forecourt leaving a trail of frothy fizzing amber liquid in its wake and that was when the advancing snake saw him stopped reared its fearsome head a foot or so off the ground it was a boaconstrictor of some kind you didnt need a university education to know that god it had to be all of twenty feet long and as thick as your leg the corporal went cold wished to christ he had his rifle instead of this scattergun but youll have to shoot else itll get you cause it was trying to sneak up on you in the first place he raised the gun to his shoulder never mind what they tell you about keeping both eyes open and all that crap get a sight on it and blow the fucker to smithereens the force of the blast knocked him back against the door he crouched there trying to see oh fuck the bastards still coming how in hell did i miss on the verge of panic he fired the second barrel saw the python go down it flopped rolled squirmed and came back up the corporal fumbled to extract the spent cartridge cases from his gun unfamiliar with manual loading feeling in the pocket of his combat jacket for live shells the snake was moving fast throwing itself forward in a series of flops like a landed sealion hissing its fury oblivious to the pain where a scattering of bb shot had caught it just below the head pumping blood as it charged the corporal pushed fresh shells into the breech snapped the barrels shut but he was too late its vicious lunge a hurtling forward of its dragging body sent the gun spinning from his grasp its fangs fastening in his throat cutting off his scream as it tore out the flesh blinded itself temporarily in a fountain of human blood its instinct was to wrap itself around the body of its prey crush it to a mulch but it sensed that it no longer had the strength time was running out it flopped back ignored the fallen convulsing human who still jetted scarlet blood from his throat wound lay there and felt the pain from its own injury knew that it the king of the snakes must flee only its supreme strength enabled it to turn to head back the way it had come its frantic slithering slowing with every yard bright lights blinded it it heard the roaring of engines the frantic shouts of men who saw it knew that it was fatally wounded yet kept their distance if it could only get back to that dark hole in the ground it would be safe the land rover had stopped on the road the mobile searchlight on the cab focused on the twitching python three soldiers ran forward fanned out into a semicircle browning shot automatic shotguns at the ready the corporal was dead the big snake had almost had it but they were not taking any chances a volley of gunfire shattered the stillness of the summer night each soldier emptying his magazine into the african rock python dissecting it decapitating it cutting it into segments splattering the reptilian body across the forecourt reducing it to an unrecognisable mulch later the experts would scrape up the remains cross it off their list another one down five to go the king of the snakes was dead chapter john price had lost valuable time on the a just outside dumfries the petrol pump was playing up cutting out every few miles bringing him to a stop he pulled into the side of the road waited a few minutes and the engine started again a spasmodic fault that would worsen over the miles disconcerting on the motorway always the nagging fear that it might stop you in the middle of the fast lane in all probability the car would get him back to stainforth in stages there was no time to stop and get it fixed sorry sir we dont seem to have a pump in stock but we can phone and get one sent out from glasgow no more than a couple of hours at the most he decided to chance it the last thing he wanted was attention drawn to that battered suitcase on the back seat with a number of holes punched in the scuffed leather some busybody of a mechanic poking his nose into what did not concern him theres something alive in that case mister yes its ferrets i do a bit of rabbiting now and then thats odd i keep ferrets myself mister but you cant ferret rabbits at this time of the year theyre breeding your ferrets will lie up eating the baby rabbits and youll never get em out of the warrens mind your own fucking business ill ferret whenever i want to john could not chance anybody seeing those two animals that were lying asleep in the cramped suffocating suitcase rick and tick a pair of mongooses at first sight the layman might mistake them for ferrets but their size would give the game away about a metre in length with brownish grey fur short legs pointed muzzle and a long bushy tail domesticated up to a point until they scented snakes and then they reverted to their wild instincts at least john hoped they would the safety of the people of stainforth depended upon it it was like that experiment that the forestry commission were conducting importing a predatory insect from sweden in an attempt to eradicate the larch beetle from the forests of wales they could not be sure whether or not it would work a process of trial and error once he hit the motorway he kept to the slow lane joined a milelong convoy of heavy transport lorries twice the petrol pump faltered and he glided on to the hard shoulder waited resumed his journey as long as some bloody police motorway patrol car doesnt come along trying to be helpful ill be all right he decided they didnt they were too busy policing the fast lane he estimated that it would be midnight before he reached stainforth began to rethink his plan of action realistically an hour or two did not make much difference so long as he released the creatures under cover of darkness nobody would be any the wiser he just hoped rick and tick would keep clear of soldiers and police would not get shot by some triggerhappy rookie it was when he pulled up at the roadblock on the outskirts of the village fortunately the soldier on duty recognised him waved him through he drove on steadily through the village noted the land rovers and trucks parked at intervals knew that armed police and soldiers would be stationed nearby in the shadows waiting he parked outside aunt elsies bungalow carried the suitcase up the short drive and round the back laid it down adjacent to the aluminium coalbunker he was trembling trying to peer into the shadows expecting an armed figure to emerge at any second what you got there son releasing wild animals into the environment eh ill have to report it and in the meantime ill hang on to those creatures but nobody came there was no sound to be heard anywhere stainforth might have been any one of a thousand english villages on a hot summers night its inhabitants fast asleep in bed except that john price knew different he was sweating heavily he unfastened the straps lifted the lid cautiously made out the silhouettes of two ferretlike bodies heads upraised enquiringly thank christ they were still alive it had been stifling in the mini this is it rick and tick he spoke softly let the lid of the case rest back against the bunker its up to you now go and do your stuff and when youve finished the case will be here for you to come back to they dont understand but you have to talk to animals gain their confidence just let em go and roam until they get a sniff of snakes the two mongooses just lay there made no attempt to leave their temporary home he thought about lifting them out but decided against it it was their show they would have to do it their way without his interference just leave them to get on with it he tiptoed away retired to the back door stood just inside with the door ajar watching intently but the snakekillers appeared to be in no hurry they were confused they might still be there in the morning it was asking a lot of them he went inside closed the door and stretched himself out on the settee he needed to rest a burst of gunfire jerked him out of a deep sleep a volley of shots that were still echoing across the village by the time he made it to the back door people were shouting vehicles were on the move something had happened and when he checked on that old suitcase outside it was empty the mongooses had done what he had wanted them to do slunk off into the darkness of a village that was alive with the threat of reptilian death it was the second night in succession that cynthia eversham had heard the rattlesnake in her dreams like a bag of witchdoctors dried bones being shaken frantically a sinister background noise that got louder and louder until it woke her up brought her upright in bed her naked body shiny with sweat a scream forming on her lips this time she screamed because she knew it was not a nightmarish figment of a bereaved and tortured mind it was real she stared about her in the darkness feared for one terrible moment that the reptile was in the room no it was outside somewhere down below on the drive she didnt want to look never wanted to see a snake again as long as she lived but she had to check make sure cynthia climbed out of bed crossed to the window parted the curtains she had taken to leaving the exterior light on all night since peters death a watt bulb which illuminated almost the entire driveway and now there was no doubt in her mind that it was a snake that was making the noise reality no dream a sixfoot length of diamondcovered death flinging itself insanely at the door the thing was mad crazy with anger obsessed with a desire to force an entry throwing itself at the polished oakpanelled woodwork falling back trying again a whiplash of fury that had only one thought in its poisoned mind to kill to take revenge on those who had slaughtered its mate it knew you could tell knew that this was the place cynical vengeance it would take the life of the mate of he who had slaughtered its own mate but it could not get inside the house or could it cynthia clutched the window sill her terror mounting not through the door certainly but perhaps there was a ventilator somewhere through which it could pass by contracting its vile body or a window left open when your husband was three days dead you could not rely on yourself to attend to detail she was safe though all she had to do was to ensure that the bedroom door was shut pick up the bedside phone and call the police they would come with guns shoot the snake even as she was turning away to check the door something out on the drive caught her eye had her peering intently a cat or something a creature which travelled in furtive darting movements crouched low the snake will kill it she wanted to tap the window shout warn it before it was too late but she could not move just stood transfixed it was no cat it was too large had a bushy tail like a fox but it certainly was not reynard it was chattering a sound that reminded her of a flock of birds feeding hungrily on a birdtable in winter the rattler had stopped hurling itself at the door had fallen back and there was no mistaking the fear in its posture to flee or to stay and fight the serpent body was tense head raised looking about it as though seeking an avenue of escape it made a move to flee covered no more than a yard before the furry streamlined creature was upon it jaws moving with incredible speed seizing the rattlesnake by the back of its head the attacker rose up on its hind legs its prey still gripped in its teeth shaking it biting it rattling it death rattles that were frantic at first like a childs marbles box being shaken dying away to the odd click and then silence cynthia watched as the ferocious fourlegged animal cast the snake to one side a limp harmless corpse sniffed at it as though making sure that there was no life there then it bounded away hurrying as though it had an urgent appointment somewhere a purposefulness about those jerky movements until the shadows beyond the bright artificial light swallowed it up cynthia eversham was still standing at the window when the eastern sky began to lighten she had not phoned the police she had no intention of doing so now because the rattlesnake was dead and she was in no danger today was going to be a severe test for her as it was for any woman who had to face the ordeal of a husbands funeral at first the mongooses had kept together travelling side by side picking up the fresh scent in the disused churchyard gone was their domestication they were back in the land of their ancestors where snakes were an everyday prey to be hunted down and killed had cast off the mantle of captivity they found the russells viper first the faint starlight glinting evilly on its greenish scales as it crossed the open tract of land in front of the church one of the most feared snakes of india and burma it instinctively smelled its hated foe in the vicinity turned its toadish head showed its halfinch fangs fear but that would not stop it from fighting giving a good account of itself sometimes a viper overcame and killed a mongoose this could be one of those occasions it saw its pursuer turned and waited come and get me mongoose the mongoose stopped began chattering loudly danced in the manner which stoats sometimes employ in order to create a gathering of curious birds first one way then another always just out of reach of those terrible venomous fangs a macabre ballet the vipers head darted followed every move just a little closer mongoose and you will be dead intent oblivious to all else which was why the russells viper was unaware of the approach from behind of the second animal until the fangs of tick the female sunk deep into the back of its head dragged it flaying and lashing from the fray allowing rick to move in for the death blow they left the mangled vipers corpse draped across the church steps moved on with haste for this was to be a rare night of carnage the like of which they might never see again they heard gunfire made a detour of the rising sun even though the night air was heavy with the stench of snakes blood and then they split up each following a different spoor pointed noses close to the ground where reptile bellies had flattened and soured the dry undergrowth tick came upon the african mamba in a shrubbery surprised it and struck quickly hurled the dead greenish body from the branches where it had been curled heard it slump on to a bed of dead dry leaves roll once and lie still not even twitching rick had the longest battle of all for the cobra was a large male eighteen feet in length its dark colour a perfect camouflage in the gloom of a silent garden only inbred mongoose instincts and reflexes saved him from the lunging bite which is capable of killing an elephant in a few hours the head as large as a mans clenched fist missed by a fraction and for the next few minutes rick was on the defensive dancing another ballet of life and death chattering ferociously trying to lure his adversary into a headlong rush possibly its lifetime of confinement in a zoo cage had robbed the cobra of that extra bit of cunning which would have swayed the outcome of this battle in its favour had it been jungle bred and born it may well have hung back for an extra minute or two awaited an opening an achilles heel in the bounding cavorting creature that confronted it but all it knew was blind hatred and it struck viciously missed a second time enabling the mongoose to secure a hold on the underside of its hooded head rick played his foe as a fisherman might play a fifteenpound salmon holding on letting the other tire from its efforts and its wound keeping his teeth firmly sunk in the reptilian flesh until at length the cobra began to tire it took the mongoose twenty minutes to overcome its enemy and when it was all over rick lay exhausted panting chattering softly he waited and in due course tick joined him and the deadly partnership was complete again they sniffed at each other their way of checking to see if either had suffered wounds asking questions and receiving answers in the manner for which nature had equipped them then they were lusting again for the blood of their hated foe disappearing into the darkness for this night of snake death was not over yet chapter it was starting to get light keith doyle stretched his aching and cramped limbs was aware of the knotted fear in the pit of his stomach his thirstswollen tongue threatening to make him throw up or choke him he was cold shivering wondered if he had caught a chill but that was a minor inconvenience when compared with the ordeal that was to come the gauntlet of death which he had to run this was it the moment that could not be put off any longer he reached over into the back picked up the sickle sharp as its blade was it felt puny a mere token weapon against the multicoloured length of death that was coiled up on the bonnet watching him with unblinking eyes the bloody thing guessed knew what he was about to do you could read the sadistic glint in its baleful glare come on man youve kept me waiting long enough youll soon be dead your girl too hurry up im bored keith no i dont want you to go kirsten clutched at his arm her fingernails gouging his sunburned skin please lets give it another try see if someone comes we cant we wont make it through another day she closed her eyes knew that he had to go that it was their only chance of survival and that she had to stay here and wait ill go through the back doors he muttered the snake moved unfurled a foot or so of its coiled length damn it the bloody thing had heard him understood not only that it read your thoughts knew what you were thinking that he was going to crash the back doors open jump as far out as he could then run like hell if his legs would move ever since they had been trapped in here he had been shifting his position every so often trying to stop his limbs from going to sleep he wondered if he could even stand wish me luck he kissed her felt how she trembled she did not say anything there wasnt anything to say just close your eyes and pray i darent watch keith see you then he eased himself over into the back with some difficulty his body cumbersome stiff and weakened dont look back or else you wont go sickle in one hand he felt for the door lever with the other the catch was stiff always had been in fact he had never operated it from the inside never had to he had to force it a screeching and grinding of metal a noise that seemed to vibrate on his teeth the way it always had in his boyhood days when some of the kids ran their fingernails along the paintwork of the school bus but he did glance backwards he could not stop himself he saw kirstens pallid frightened features switched his gaze to the bonnet the make was gone had read his movements and slid away to lie in wait for him he crouched tensed himself for the leap knew what an ungainly turkey poult perching for the first time felt like sensed that his leg muscles were flaccid useless a parachutist on his first leap holding on afraid to let go now if he had not leapt out then he would never have done a froglike hop a longjumper striving for length he hit the ground staggered went over twisting an ankle as he fell awkwardly a combination of pain and fear swamped him jerking his head round trying to see the snake was underneath the van seemingly a coloured extension of the exhaust system stretched full length and poised about to propel itself at him and oh christ the van doors were still wide open kirsten staring out after him in shocked horror close the bloody doors he yelled because thats your only chance im done for the coral snake edged forward a foot or so mocking him with that same cold merciless reptilian expression so sure of itself not hurrying knowing his terror and wanting to make him suffer the agonies of hell damn it kirsten had not moved was just kneeling on the front seats staring at him wondering why he did not scramble up and run keith saw the strike coming the raised head the snakes body tensed for the rush which would take it to him he closed his eyes knew there wasnt a jackdamned thing he could do about it they had suffered the agonies of heat thirst hunger terror he had planned this doordie rush for freedom with such precision and now he was going to die kirsten too they might as well have given up and died at the very outset he had failed he heard it coming felt the vibrations of its thrashing body its hissing he braced himself in readiness but nothing touched him no revolting rough cold scaly skin no agonising stabbing of poisonous fangs nothing but the sound of its flayings and hissing interspersed with a rapid chattering noise which he thought might be distant machinegun fire he forced his eyes open did not for one moment believe what he saw his mind had snapped it was delirium brought on by snake venom whatever it was it could not be happening the coral snake was writhing its lashing tail striking the van doors pinioned to the ground by two brownishgrey creatures which had a secure hold on it clasping it by its evil head biting deep into the tough skin bleeding it to death like a helpless calf in a slaughterhouse the snake was growing weaker its efforts now only a token resistance whipping faintly with its tail its hate and fury spent then going limp and dead the mongooses backed off stood there watching keith inquisitively wary was it permissible to kill snakes they did not know they were not taking any chances next second they were gone diving back into the undergrowth only the swaying stalks of seeding wild willow herb and bracken fronds marked their exit kirsten was out of the van struggling to help keith to his feet crying holding on to him the relief the sudden turning of the tables was too much for her what were they she asked well they looked like mongooses to me he winced tried to put his weight on his injured foot and decided against it cant be sure but im not going to argue the snakes dead but there might be more of em around come on let me lean against you and between us we ought to be able to make it down to the road staggering holding on to each other they set off down the track to freedom their course erratic as they skirted dense clumps of vegetation that could have concealed a lurking snake their flesh crawled their pulses raced and the effort was almost too much for them but not quite they made it out on to the road chapter the packed church created an atmosphere that for john price transcended sadness more than just the death of a fond relative a tragedy a horror a waste of life somebody who was about to embark upon a journey prematurely had not had a chance to say her farewells every pew was crammed full and outside crowds thronged the driveway from the church doors to the lychgate spilled out on to the road and lined the pavement tv cameras trained on the cortege the climax to a drama which the whole nation would watch tonight had been following in instalments for days john fought back the tears which welled up behind his eyes knew that they had the cameras on him in closeup during the slow walk back from the graveside an interval of fifteen minutes just for respectability and then it was the turn of barbara brown and her child then eversham later in the week it would be joan doyle that corporals body had been taken south to be buried in his home town and they still had not found pc aylott the media were highlighting johns role in the whole bloody business at least rick and tick were safe back in that old suitcase now hidden inside the coalbunker tomorrow or the day after he would smuggle them back up to scotland he must get the petrol pump on the mini fixed first though you had to think of mundane things like that to convince yourself that it was all real the mongooses had been seen and recognised but nobody knew any more than that maybe burlington suspected john thought he might be questioned later but what the hell the snakes were dead accounted for they had found the corpses the mongooses would just disappear not to be seen again if people wanted to hunt them let em they had never found that puma down south and that was all of twentyfive years ago nor the cat beast that had ravaged flocks of welsh sheep more recently john made it back to the main street all eyes still on him thats john price he knows all about snakes got a degree in em ugh a news reporter stepped out of the crowd barred his way a microphone thrust at him like some threatening weapon where do you think these mongooses came from mr price i havent a clue liar you read it in the others eyes the implication in his tone of voice do you think all the snakes are dead the million dollar question have we got em all mongooses are pretty thorough hunters he chose his words carefully they just live for hunting snakes if there are any left theyll surely get em he pushed his way past the reporter increased his step until he reached the bungalow are all the snakes dead maybe maybe not that initial inventory of the escaped reptiles was compiled by a process of elimination from the intended recipients of the reptiles not from that cowboy zoo nobody really knew only time would tell
