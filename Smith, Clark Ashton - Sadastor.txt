sadastor clark ashton smith listen for this is the tale that was told to a fair lamia by the demon charnadis as they sat together on the top of mophi above the sources of the nile in those years when the sphinx was young now the lamia was vexed for her beauty was grown an evil legend in both thebais and elephantine so that men were become fearful of her lips and cautious of her embrace and she had no lover for almost a fortnight she lashed her serpentine tail on the ground and moaned softly and wept those mythical tears which a serpent weeps and the demon told this tale for her comforting long long ago in the red cycles of my youth i was like all young demons and was prone to use the agility of my wings in fantastic flights to hover and poise like a giereagle above tartarus and the pits of python or to lift the broad blackness of my vans on the orbit of stars i have followed the moon from evening twilight to morning twilight and i have gazed on the secrets of that medusean face which she averts eternally from the earth i have read through filming ice the ithyphallic runes on columns yet extant in her deserts and i know the hieroglyphs which solve forgotten riddles or hint eonian histories on the walls of her cities taken by ineluctable snow i have flown through the triple ring of saturn and have mated with lovely basilisks on isles towering leaguehigh from stupendous oceans where each wave is like the rise and fall of himalayas i have dared the clouds of jupiter and the black and freezing abysses of neptune which are crowned with eternal starlight and i have sailed beyond to incommensurable suns compared with which the sun that thou knowest is a corpsecandle in a stinted vault there in tremendous planets i have furled my flight on the terraced mountains large as fallen asteroids where with a thousand names and a thousand images undreamtof evil is served and worshipt in unsurmisable ways or perched in the fleshcolored lips of columnar blossoms whose perfume was an ecstasy of incommunicable dreams i have mocked the wiving monsters and have lured their females that sang and fawned at the base of my hidingplace now in my indefatigable questing among the remoter galaxies i came one day to that forgotten and dying planet which in the language of its unrecorded peoples was called sadastor immense and drear and gray beneath a waning sun farfissured with enormous chasms and covered from pole to pole with the neverebbing tides of the desert sand it hung in space without moon or satellite an abomination and a token of doom to fairer and younger worlds checking the speed of my interstellar flight i followed its equator with a poised and level wing above the peaks of cyclopean volcanoes and bare terrific ridges of elder hills and deserts pale with the ghastliness of salt that were manifestly the beds of former oceans in the very center of one of these oceanbeds beyond sight of the mountains that formed its primeval shoreline and leagues below their level i found a vast and winding valley that plunged even deeplier into the abysses of this dreadful world it was walled with perpendicular cliffs and buttresses and pinnacles of a rustyred stone that were fretted into a million bizarrely sinister forms by the sinking of the olden seas i flew slowly among these cliffs as they wound ever downward in tortuous spirals for mile on mile of utter and irredeemable desolation and the light grew dimmer above me as ledge on ledge and battlement on battlement of that strange red stone upreared themselves between my wings and the heavens here when i rounded a sudden turn of the precipice in the profoundest depth where the rays of the sun fell only for a brief while at noon and the rocks were purple with everlasting shadow i found a pool of darkgreen water the last remnant of the former ocean ebbing still amid steep insuperable walls and from this pool there cried a voice in accents that were subtly sweet as mortal wine of the mandragora and faint as the murmuring of shells and the voice said pause and remain i pray and tell me who thou art who comest thus to the accursed solitude wherein i die then pausing on the brink of the pool i peered into its gulf of shadow and saw the pallid glimmering of a female form that upreared itself from the waters and the form was that of a siren with hair the color of oceankelp and berylline eyes and a dolphine shaped tail and i said to her i am the demon charnadis but who art thou who lingerest thus in this ultimate pit of abomination in the depth of a dying world she answered i am a siren and my name is lyspial of the seas wherein i saw and sported at leisure many centuries ago and whose gallant mariners i drew to to an enchanted death on the shores of my disastrous isle there remains only this fallen pool alas for the pool dwindles daily and when it is wholly gone i too must perish she began to weep and her briny tears fell down and were added to the briny waters fain would i have comforted her and i said weep not for i will lift thee upon my wings and bear thee to some newer world where the skyblue waters of abounding seas are shattered to intricate webs of wannest foam on low shores that are green and aureate with pristine spring there perchance for eons thou shalt have thine abode and galleys with painted oars and great barges purpurealsailed shall be drawn upon thy rocks in the red light of sunsets domed with storm and shall mingle the crash of their figured prows with the sweet sorcery of thy mortal singing but still she wept and would not be comforted crying thou art kind but this would avail me not for i was born of the waters of this world and with its waters i must die alas my lovely seas that ran in unbroken sapphire from shores of perrenial blossoms to shores of everlasting snow alas the seawinds with their mingled perfumes of brine and weed and scents of ocean flowers and flowers of the land and farblown exotic balsams alas the quinquiremes of cycleended wars and the heavyladen argosies with sails and cordage of byssus that plied between barbaric isles with their cargoes of topaz or garnetcoloured wines and jade and ivory idols in the antique summers that now are less than legend alas the dead captains the beautiful dead sailors that were borne by the ebbing tide to my couches of amber seaweed in my caverns underneath a cedared promontory alas the kisses that i laid on their cold and hueless lips on their sealed marmorean eyelids and sorrow and pity seized me at her words for i knew that she spoke the lamentable truth that her doom was in the lessening of the bitter waters so after many proffered condolences no less vague than vain i bade her a melancholy farewelland flew heavily away between the spiral cliffs where i had come and clomb the somber skies till the world sadastor was only a darkling mote far down in space but the tragic shadow of the sirens fate and her sorrow lay grievously upon me for hours and only in the kisses of a beautiful fierce vampire in a faroff and young and exuberant world was i able to forget it and i tell the now the tale thereof that haply thou mayest be consoled by the contemplation of a plight that was infinitely more dolorous and irremediable than thine own
