vi contents chena scramble mpd prosecution defense verdict authors note problem it was a nice castle with high turrets solid walls a deep moat and an elevated office suite whose picture window overlooked the nearby community of nymphs fire cracker plants grew around the wall useful for starting fires in the mornings and the crackers tasted good too the con nected orchard had pie trees of the most sinfully delicious varieties the mistress of the household was exactly as beau tiful devoted and accommodating as her husband desired a man could hardly ask for a better situation except for one or two small things where is your worser half veleno muttered looking apprehensively around dont worry the demoness metria replied with a smile as her scant clothing shimmered into nothingness i sent mentia off to see the demon grossclout about our other problem other problem piers anthony she pretended not to hear grossclouts such an intrac table cuss that it should take her days to pry any kind of an answer from him thats a relief he said looking more than relieved its not that i want to be critical but but mentia is slightly crazy metria finished and you married me not my worser half but because she did fission off from me being disgusted by my new goodygoody atti tude after i got half your soul we cant keep her away shes the half of me you naturally dont likethe soulless half dedicated to making your life halfmuled halfwhatted horsed equined donkeyed asinined he kissed her i think i could fathom the word if i con centrated lets make hay while the sun shines she looked perplexed hay i thought you had something else in mind a tantalizing wisp of strategically placed clothing appeared i love it when you tease me he said picking her up and carrying her to the master bedroom she assumed the form of a nymph eeeeek she cried faintly kicking her marvelous bare legs in the nymphly way whatever am i going to do youre going to make me deliriously happy you lus cious creature she inhaled enhancing what hardly needed it sigh how can i escape this hideous fate she wailed cutely kiss ing him on eye ear nose and throat they fell together on the bed in a tangle of limbs faces kisses and whatnot you are the best thing that ever hap pened to me veleno gasped around the activity youre just the most wonderful beautiful lovable exciting fantastic person in all xanth you damn me with faint praise she muttered clasping him with such ardor that description would be improper another demoness popped into the chamber oh there you are metria she exclaimed no wonder i couldnt find roc and a hard place you around the grounds i have brought you what you most vitally need veleno stiffened but not in the way he desired oh no metria looked up from what was occupying her at the least opportune time of course do you mind worser half i happen to be busy at the moment mentia peered closely oh doing what making my husband deliriously happy of course as only a demoness can when not being annoyingly interrupted veleno mut tered mentia peered again sorry i thought that was a grimace of pain on whatshisnames face are you sure you are doing an adequate job better half of course im sure metria said indignantly he has not complained once in seven hundred and fifty times during the past year oh what about that groan he groaned just now that was when you appeared well if you feel that way ill just depart with what i brought and never never return oop no metria cried with alarm i need it her husband somewhat bemused by the interruption put in two more words need what never mind metria said its a soldier matter a what matter he asked secluded cloistered isolated remote detached ob scure private whatever she agreed crossly but what could be private from your husband he asked somewhat querulously yes whatever could you be suspiciously concealing from your trusting spouse mentia echoed cant we have this discussion some other time metria demanded frustrated piers anthony of course dear mentia agreed ill pop back in dur ing the next century she began to fuzz out no wait metria cried now will do after all why how nice mentia said smiling with something more than good nature but dont you think you should introduce us first whatever for he knows who the mischief you are from ever since you returned from that madness with the gargoyle yes but he may have forgotten ive been away a whole hour you know that long veleno inquired with resignation metria gritted her teeth there was nothing half so annoy ing as half a demoness but she knew her worser half would not give over until she had her halfbaked way veleno this is the demoness mentia my soulless worser half who represents what i was like before i got halfsouled except that she has no problem with vocational with what idiom language speech expression locution utterance articulation words whatever instead shes slightly crazy yes its my talent mentia agreed proudly and mentia this is my husband veleno formerly a nymphomaniac but he hasnt touched a nymph since i mar ried him and took half his soul yes but hasnt he looked at nymphs out the window with a glint in his pleased to meet you veleno gritted drawing free a hand and extending it now will you begone charmed im sure mentia said forming a pair of pin cers on the end of her arm ixnay metria murmured wamingly mortals are pro tected from harm in this castle oh thats right mentia agreed disappointed the pin cers became an ordinary hand which shook velenos hand that was one of the conditions of the restoration well roc and a hard place now that your mortal man and i have been properly intro duced i will give you what you most need metria at last but metria still wasnt easy about this veleno dearest why dont you take a little snooze for the moment metria suggested dulcetly covering his eyes with her hand but what could you need that i have not provided he asked frowning yes im sure he will be really truly interested in this very important secret matter mentia said sitting on the edge of the bed so that her thigh touched veleno oh all right metria said really crossly have no concern dear i will explain it excruciatingly clearly mentia said what i bring is information to help abate your incapacity so you wont be a failure anymore what incapacity veleno demanded my wife has made me deliriously happy almost continuously since we married that is the problem mentia said she has helped you with the chore of summoning the stork seven hundred and fifty she peered again and a half times this year and more times during the prior year when i was too busy to be with her unfortunately and yet the stork has not gotten the message she is clearly inadequate in this department veleno pondered slowly realizing the truth of this state ment that hadnt occurred to me he said i was too delirious to think of the stork but how could it fail to get the messages that is precisely what metria wants to know mentia said whatever could be wrong with her to bomb so badly in so many attempts whatever could make her such a sore loser especially when i could so readily have nuhuh metria and veleno said together so she sent me toask the most intelligent creature she knows the demon grossclout for advice mentia contin ued without concern and he instantly delegated me to con vey that essential advice to her naturally i delayed not half a whit to honor that stricture her failing is simply too serious to permit any delay piers anthony thank you so much worser metria snarled you are so welcome better i knew you would want to attend to your washout without delay mentias form fuzzed and assumed the likeness of a giant lemon then a cooked turkey i am thrilled to have been of so much help you havent been of much help yet metria said grimly what did grossclout say oh that he says you should go ask good magician humfrey but humfrey charges a years service for a single an swer metria protested i dont want to pay that thats why i went to grossclout grossclout did add a few words mentia said i be lieve those words were mushhead cheapskate and serve her right thats grossclout all right metria agreed he still holds a grudge just because i chose to sand my nails in his dull magic classes at demon u actually that was i who did that mentia said smiling reminiscently back when we were inextricably bound to gether as alternate aspects of a single demoness those were the days but i did not see fit to remind the professor of that she paused reflectively i might be able to remember a few more of his words if its really important she offered helpfully thank you so much no metria said i think i have fathomed his altitude his what manner disposition temperament bent inclination pen chant attitude veleno inquired whatever metria said crossly from the height of his eminence mentia agreed well if you need no further assistance or advice on tech nique none metria said too bad mentia faded out roc and a hard place you want the stork to deliver a baby veleno inquired as metria resumed activity yes its what married couples do raise children but demonesses dont get babies unless they want them precisely i want one she looked away i suppose i should have told you and i cant blame you for being an gry but im not angry you arent but it might interrupt the delirium and give you the solid obligation of raising a child exactly i want a family now that it occurs to me metria gazed at him with adoration tinged substantially with relief wonderful now he was thoughtful the stork must figure that our signals arent serious which is ironic considering how strong we have made them ive just got to get the storks distention the storks what observation mindfulness notice focus application attention whatever what do you think i should do he considered i think you should go to ask the good magician but then i would have to leave you alone for a year surely you could return on occasion it might mean you could make me deliriously happy only three or four hundred times in that year but i think i can survive that deprivation after all i want you to be happy too you dear wonderful man she exclaimed and pro ceeded to do the impossible to make him twice as delirious as before but before she went she checked around the premises de bating with herself because her worser half had decided to unify for the occasion now that there was a chance her life piers anthony would become interesting again do i really want to do this metria asked herself why not it isnt as if you have anything important to do around here mentia had fissioned off in disgust when me tria married got half a soul and fell in love in that order her worser half claimed to have been on a grand adventure with a gargoyle and helped save all xanth from madness but that was surely an exaggeration she had merged as soon as metria stopped being nauseatingly nice to her husband if you had half a soul you would have a different aiti attitude praise the demon x h that i have not been corrupted with any portion of a soul mentia agreed their dialogue was silent because it was internal no one else could overhear it she pointed with their left hand theres a sand worm step on it i will not metria retorted that wouldnt be nice she lifted the worm carefully with their right hand and inspected it it was of course made of sand if direct sunlight or water touched it it would powder or dissolve away so she put it back in a dry shaded section and watched it wiggle off disgusting mentia remarked to no one else in particular but you can redeem your demonly nature by squishing that june bug no way kill a june bug and the year loses its most ro mantic month mentia grimaced with the left side of their face id rather have you halfbottomed than halfsouled she looked around using metrias left eye i see that goquat tree is fruiting so is the comequat tree metria agreed veleno likes them when hes coming and going which is he doing when hes alone with you the opposite of what he wants you to be doing but mentia could not be shamed here is my favorite the grapes with an attitude sour grapes metria agreed your kind roc and a hard place so why are you dawdling around here instead of getting moving to the good magicians castle im just not sure its right to leave my husband on half rations theres all the food he needs growing right around the castle here half rations of delirium oh mentia looked around again until the left eyeball was oriented completely to the side lets make it easy then see that winged nut tree the right eye swiveled of course the nuts are almost as nutty as you are if the right wing nut flies first we stay right here if the left one flies first we pop over to see the good magician that would be a crazy way to make such an important decision precisely agreed metria sighed it was as good a way as any agreed they watched the two nuts quiver the right one spread its wings then suddenly the left one lurched into the air and flew across to the nearby bolt tree how romantic mentia said amused by what the boldest bolt did with the nut why dont you find it romantic when veleno and i once is amusing seven hundred and fifty times is droll not when youre in love im glad ill never be in love lets be on our way metria couldnt dawdle any longer even if it did seem somewhat nutty or screwed up the good magicians castle looked ordinary its wall and turrets were set within a sparkling circular moat which in turn was inside a ring of mountains neither would be any problem for a demoness to pop across but metria was unable to pop across when she tried she bounced off an invisible barrier dam i forgot she swore the old fool has a shield against demonly intrusion piers anthony thats what you consider swearing thats not even wor thy of the juvenile conspiracy worse she was unable to fly or dematerialize in this vi cinity obviously the good magician had improved his de fenses in the past century or so well have to plod across the way mortals do metria plodded as she approached the ring of mountains she saw that they were in the shape of huge loaves of sugar fortunately the slope was not too steep to prevent her from climbing it was a pain having to leg it instead of pop or float it but she wasnt going to let it balk her she crested the mountainand abruptly lost her footing and slid helplessly down toward the moat here the sugar was loose and granular offering no purchase soon she was unceremoniously dumped into the moat and promptly booted out again she sailed back over the mountain and landed on the ground beyond the grass hopped out of the way before her derriere struck it was the grass hopper variety thats boot rear she exclaimed aloud the moat is filled with it i think i begin to see a pattern here mentia remarked i think ill leave you to your challenges oh no you dont metria retorted you talked me into this nuisance youll help me see it through besides i dont trust you with my husband while im away you might promise him heaven and give him hell and id get the blame curses foiled again metria tackled the mountain again from the outside it was solid sugar easy to climb as she approached the crest she trod extremely cautiously but found no break in the steep sandy slope the moment she stepped on that she would be dumped into the moat with a kick this was definitely a challenge that meant that not only would she have to struggle to find her way past this one roc and a hard place there would be two more beyond it what a pity she swore in frustration what a pity her worser self mimicked that half soul has denatured you so it made me into a nice person metria retorted so whats wrong with that its undemonly ill bet you cant even say poop of course i can say peep point made well if youre so demonly how do you propose to get us across this sweet mess mentia considered the mountain is sweet but the moat isnt it likes to kick donkey so it boots rear thats its nature tell me something i dont already know metria rubbed her booted rear if she werent a demoness that would really be smarting along about now maybe if we made it sweet it wouldnt have so much of a kick make it sweet but how then metria saw the point lets get busy she formed her hands into scoops and began scooping loose sugar down the slope soon she managed to start an avalanche sugar slid grandly down and plunged into the moat after she had scooped as much of the mountain into the water as she could she found that she was able to descend without sliding shehad taken the edge off the slope she went down and stood at the bank of the moat which now looked somewhat soggy she poked a finger into it and tested a drop of soggy water on her tongue there was only a little bit of tingle sure enough she had pretty much de natured its kick however the moat was now a mass of sickly sweet muck the mere touch of her feet ift it was enough to make her feel somewhat sick as if she had overeaten or overimbibed since demons neither ate nor drank she knew this was more magic piers anthony she would be very uncomfortable if she waded through all that even if she didnt get her rear booted out so she walked around the edge until she came to the draw bridge which was in the down position she had not been able to reach it before because the steep slope had dumped her where it chose to in the moat but now it could not stop her from reaching it she had surmounted the first challenge this becomes dull mentia said im going to take a nap you handle the next challenge and ill handle the third okay okay metria agreed she wasnt concerned about her worser self as long as she knew where mentia was she set foot on the planks of the moatand something buzzed up before her barring the way it seemed to be two dots like an incomplete ellipsis except that they were up and down instead of across what in tintinnabulation are you she demanded i dont understand what in what the dot formation asked bells ringing music jangle discordance melody try again none of those words make sense the dots said angrily damnation hell abyss underworld hades inferno per dition let me guess tarnation whatever she said crossly you think youre cross the dots demanded youre positively sweet compared to me im as angry as anything gets she peered at the dots just exactly what are you bb brain im an angry punctuation mark an irritated colon the dots said and i am going to make you pause before you continue how long a pause just this as long a pause as it takes as it takes to what to refresh roc and a hard place i thought youd never ask as it takes to make you give up and go away i get it youre another challenge too much of a challenge for you give it up metria tried to walk around the nasty colon but it moved over to shove her into the moat she tried to jump over it still being unable to fly but it sailed up to intercept her its dots glowing fiercely she tried to crawl under it but it dropped down and made a pooping sound that warned her back there was just no telling what it might do she tried to push straight through it but it got positively spastic and she had to desist how am i supposed to get past you she demanded annoyed either go away or bring me some relief those are your options relief she asked blankly from my syndrome i am not irritable by choice you know but how can i bring you relief this is for you to figure out cogitate you infernal crea ture do what think ponder consider contemplate reflect work it out yourself demoness metria thought pondered considered contemplated re flected and cogitated though that last made her a bit queasy but it baffled her its an edema to me she confessed speak plainly demoness a what puzzle maze riddle conundrum mystery paradox poser problem confusion obscurity it didnt sound like any of those things to me try again what did it sound like to you enemy energy eczema enervate edam enough of this nonsense enema she inquired sweetly piers anthony whatever it hardly matters then the colon did a dou ble take its dots vibrating enema maybe thats the an swer it flew off to a private place to seek relief metria quickly marched across the bridge she had con quered the second challenge your turn worser she told her worser half good thing you couldnt think of the word enigma sweet dreams better demons dont dream i was being facetious being what humorous droll amusing comical funny i was being funny too idiot metria snapped and retired from the scene mentia stepped off the bridge and came to a pile of blocks what are you we thought youd never ask they replied we are building blocks they moved clomping along to form a square around her then more blocks climbed on top of the first ones and others climbed on top of those what are you doing mentia asked bemused by this activity we are building blocks of course we are building a building for you but i dont want a building im just passing through thats what you think the blocks chorused as they reached a level above her head then started crossing the top forming a dome hey wait a minute she protested construction waits for nobody blockhead who are you calling that she demanded indignantly im an airhead not a blockhead her head fuzzed into vapor but the blocks were silent they had shut her in she realized belatedly that this was the third challenge first the boot rear moat then the irritable colon now the building blocks she had to get out of this sudden chamber roc and a hard place she pushed at the wall but it was firm the blocks had locked into place she checked the ground but it was hard rock ordinarily nothing like this could inhibit any demon but the ambient spell around the castle made her resemble an mortal she discovered that she did nbt have a lot of experience handling purely physical things but her mem ory of being sane and sensible in the region of madness the year before gave her the assurance that she could adjust to this problem too she explored all around the chamber dim rays of light filtered in through the crevices between blocks so that it wasnt completely dark she tried to squeeze through a crev ice but she lacked even this power now it was most frus trating i wonder what gary gargoyle would have done she asked herself he was a massive powerful stone creature who was transformed to a weak fleshly man for his adven ture so he had a real problem will you be quiet while im trying to rest metria de manded crossly mentia thought pondered considered contemplated re flected and cogitated as metria had and finally came up with a feeble notion maybe she needed to think differently she knew there was always a way to handle the challenges and usually it required ingenuity rather than strength so she should use her mind rather than her body but that was what she had been trying to do without get ting far what use was it to think endlessly if the only notion it produced was to think some more not more differently she reminded herself she considered the chamber again she had pushed at one block and it was firmbut maybe there were others that were loose she might push one out and crawl through the hole she put her hands on one block near the bottom it was firm she tried another it was firmer poop on you she said berating it but the block wasnt fazed piers anthony she continued to check but all the lower blocks were firm this evidently wasnt the answer she remained completely sealed in she sat down leaned against the wall and gazed at the dust motes dancing in the thin beams of light the motes seemed to have a current moving across the chamber where were they going she focused closely forming a very large and powerful eyeball and traced their progress beyond the rays of light but her effort was wasted they didnt go any where they just brushed up against the wall and slowly settled down toward the floor then she had a brighter notion the question wasnt where the motes were going but where they were coming from what was making that gentle draft she traced that way and discovered that the air was coming from one of the blocks in the ceiling dome how could that be she put her hand up to that blockand her fingers passed right through it without resistance it was illusion she had given up too soon had she pushed against every single block she would have discovered that this was the way out she put both hands up into the hole then hauled herself up in a moment her head was outside the building she scrambled and got out then rolled head under heels to the ground she had navigated the third challenge why hello d mentia a voice said startled mentia got to her feet there stood a rather nice young woman do i know you i think so you brought gary gargoyle here last year im wira humfreys daughterinlaw but i never came up to the castle mentia protested how could you have seen me wira laughed not with my eyes of course but gary spoke well of you mentia felt that she was getting in over her depth metria wake up were in the castle roc and a hard place metria joined her just like old newspapers she re marked looking around like old whats ages eons epochs eras centuries times whatever it has been nigh ninety years since i managed to sneak in here hello d metria wira said both of them jumped how did you know me metria demanded father humfrey said you would be arriving with your other self now i will show you into the castle that girls eerie mentia muttered she must have developed other senses metria agreed true wira agreed the two selves ceased their dialogue and followed the girl into the castle there they were met by a woman of indeter minate age mother mareann here is the demoness metria and mentia wira said mother mareann one of them asked silently i am humfreys fifth and a half wife the woman ex plained i am taking my turn with him this month i was his first love and last wife because of a complicated story that wouldnt interest you my husband will see you now wira will take you up to his study maybe a half wife was like a half soul enough to do the whole job this way please wira said showing the way she moved up a narrow winding stair without faltering obviously she knew the premises well the study was a gloomy little chamber crowded with books and vials this hasnt changed a bit in ninety years metria remarked of course it hasnt demoness humfrey grumped from within neither have you except for that split personality you recently developed nice to meet you too again magician metria said piers anthony you dont look much more than a day older either of course she knew he had elixir from the fountain of youth which he imbibed to keep himself about a century old enough of this politeness ask your question how can i get the stork to take my summons seriously that will be apparent after you complete your service go to the simurgh go where your mind may be addled demoness but not your hear ing begone now just a urinepicking instant magician you cant just please dont argue with him wira whispered that only aggravates pea humfrey said i certainly will not metria declared demonesses dont have to and even if i did i wouldnt as in vegetable wira said peapicking now please but he hasnt answered me metria protested and no one can fly to the simurgh not even a demoness i de mand a proper answer after the service humfrey muttered turning a page of his giant tome mentia made a sudden internal lunge and took over the body yes of course she said and followed wira out of the study youre so much more sensible mentia even if you dont have half a soul wira remarked i am more sensible because i dont have half a soul mentia replied my better half is befuddled by love and decency i am practical especially in crazy situations like this well just have to walk to mount parnassus and see what the big bird wants but she isnt there mareann said overhearing them as they reached the foot of the stairway thats just her sum mer retreat when the tree of seeds is fruiting roc and a hard place but then we dont know where to find her ah but i can summon an equine who knows the way thats her talent wira explained she summons any thing related to horses except for unicorns why not unicorns mentia asked she once could summon them too but when she went to hell and married humfrey she lost her innocence wira blushed for it was indelicate to refer openly to matters shrouded by the adult conspiracy there might be a child in the vicinity now they ignore her its very sad mentia had little sympathy my better half never cared about innocence until she got halfsouled she cant get near a unicom either so summon a horse who knows the way mareann led the way out of the castle and across the moat which now looked quite ordinary she stood at the edge of an ordinary field that was where the sugar mountain had been already a group of things were galloping across the plain mentia stared there were four creatures each with only one leg two had narrow heads and two had thin tails their single hoofs thudded into the dirt in irregular order clop clop clopclop stirring up clouds of dust behind what are those quarter horses of course mareann said then to the horses whoa the four clopped to a halt before her each quarter had a silver disk on the side with ribbed edges on the front two disks heads were inscribed on the rear two big birds with halfspread wings fall in mareann said the four creatures fell together and suddenly were re vealed as the four quarters of a regular horse now complete wira stepped up to pet him and he nuzzled her hand until she produced a lump of sugar too bad you cant ride eight bits wira remarked thats his name mentia asked she was a little crazy herself but this was more than a little crazy why not piers anthony because he doesnt trust strange adults he just falls apart and scatters to the winds four quarters but he does know the way so you can follow him maybe he should just tell us where to go and well go there ourselves mentia said no he cant speak mareann said he can understand simple directions but thats the limit anything more puts a strain on him and he falls apart mentia finished resigned to a tedious journey but metria pushed to the surface no theres a better way how does eight bits feel about children oh he likes children mareann said especially if they are a quarter the size of adults but metria dissolved into smoke then reformed as the cutest sweetest waif of a child anyone ever beheld even wira was surprised realizing that something was different i know mentia and metria but who are you i am woe betide the waif said i have a quarter soulhalf of metriasand i love horses and i will just be so pathetically sad if i cant ride this one that ill dissolve in pitiful little misery she wiped away a huge glistening tear with one cute sleeve mareann exchanged half a glance with wira because it was one way the sightless young woman had no half to return maybe so she agreed she lifted the tyke to the fourquartered horse oh goodygoody woe betide exclaimed clapping her sweet little hands together lets go but wira wasnt sanguine about this we shouldnt send a little child on such a wild ride alone she said im not really a the tyke began but then one of her selves stifled her before the horse could hear the rest mareann nodded perhaps we can find an adult com panion for her i think there is a demoness who also knows the way who still owes humfrey part of a service roc and a hard place a demoness woe betide exclaimed they arent trustworthy again half a glance was exchanged you are surely in a position to know mareann agreed but when performing a service a person is bound to do it properly she will not be released until you are safely there the childs face made a cute grimace of resignation oh all right who is it helen back helen back the child cried woe betide me shes the worst creature in demondom do you know what she does yes mareann agreed but she will be bound not to do it for this mission i hope youre right the child said looking truly woeful mareann snapped her fingers and smoke formed it swirled before her am i released it inquired after you accompany horse and rider safely to the si murgh wira said the smoke oriented on the pair thats no horsethats four quarters and thats no childthats woe betide mareann and wira said firmly together the smoke sighed mistily so its like that okay lets hit the trail woe betide squeezed the horses sides with her precious little legs go eight bits she said and suddenly they were off in a cloud of dust that left the two standing women coughing simurgh the quarter horse ran like the wind but there was ev idently a long way to go the land of xanth whizzed by in the manner land did moving back magically fast nearby and slowly farther out because distant regions felt less urgency about such things woe betide didnt know enough geography to tell what direction they were going and was too young to really care i wish i had a lollipop she said the cloud of smoke appeared floating beside her and keeping the pace what flavor mustard gas a hand formed bearing a yellow pop that was giving off vile yellow fumes done the child snatched it and sniffed its fumes she coughed and retched and her darling little face turned blotchy purple roc and a hard place perfect she wheezed this stuff would smother an army so what did you ask the good magician the cloud inquired not that i care how to make a signal the stork will heed woe betide said as her voice crept back into her ravaged throat the horses ears twitched fracture lines appeared along his body as if he were about to come unglued because when i grow up in an umpteen million years ill need to know woe betide exclaimed of course right now im still a cute innocent little child so am protected by the adult conspiracy and wouldnt ever even dream of knowing anything like that so the good magician hasnt answered me yet but when the time comes he will eight bits relaxed and the fracture lines faded all crea tures of xanth knew the importance of maintaining the adult conspiracy no child could be allowed to leam the secret of summoning the stork so that it would bring a baby or the words of evil power that would scorch vegetation and bum maidenly ears red or anything that was too interesting for a childs own good of course children didnt much like the conspiracy but such was the magic of its nature that the instant they grew up they joined it demons honored few rules of decent behavior but they liked conspiracies the cloud of smoke that was helen back seemed to find the situation amusing are you sure youre a child she inquired it seems to me that i almost remember you in some other form much older and what did you ask humfrey woe betide asked quickly where to find a summer salt helen answered i col lect exotic salts and i have winter spring and fall salt but could never find summer salt i looked all over from here to she paused but of course i cant use that word before an innocent little child and metria couldnt reveal her true status while riding the piers anthony quarter horse lest he sunder into fourths the demoness was teasing her as only such an infernal creature could trying to trick her into betraying her age fortunately she already knew about such travels the demoness had gone from here to helen back and she always brought what was most needed at the least opportune time or what was least needed at exactly the right time woe betide had tried to mess that up by asking for a horrible flavor of lollipop but it hadnt worked and she had had to eat the awful thing so after you finish with me the good magician will tell you where to find that salt woe betide said then you can sit below the salt and be a creature for all seasons something like that helen agreed a face formed in the cloud you certainly seem mature for an itty bitty in nocent child its all illusion im not what i seem helen couldnt argue with that they continued for a while in silence as the scenery went by far mountains shifted grandly showing first one side then another forests sprang up grew tall then quit for a while they followed a paved road every time it came to an intersection with another road it puffed itself up into double the size trying to impress them but it didnt work because the other roads did the same sometimes the crossing roads contested for power throwing out masses of curving lanes the object seemed to be to touch the other road where it couldnt touch back but evidently the roads had been at this contest for a long time because every lane connected some intersections looked like diamonds and some like cloverleaves and some like masses of spaghetti sometimes a road chickened out and tunneled under the other or bridged over it but often there were still confusingly outflung lanes trying to score helen got bored with this so resumed dialogue what does the good magician have to do with the simurgh wish i knew where exactly does she live i thought youd never ask she lives in oaf woe betide was puzzled in what roc anb a hard place oaf its a mountain range that encircles the earth a mountain of earth not exactly its made of a single emerald its pretty i suppose so the simurgh must like pretty things the stmurgh likes the whole of everything but since she already has everything she needs or wants what could you do for her i wish i knew woe betide admitted maybe shes getting ready to replace the universe again now the cloud was startled whatwith all of us in it well maybe it gets dull for her after a while or dirty she might prefer a fresh new one but what would happen to all of us maybe wed all be squished into nothingness does it matter helen considered probably not but the human folk might mind then the cloud stretched im going to take half a snooze wake me if anything interesting appears the cloud settled into a featureless blob woe betide was left to her own thoughts this really was a pretty easy trip in fact it hadnt been all that hard to get into the good magicians castle true humfrey had grumped at her but he had always been grumpy had it been too easy the more she pondered the more the suspicion grew humfrey had wanted her to get in to ask her question be cause he had something for her to do maybe he owed the simurgh a favor maybe the simurgh had asked for the ser vices of a demoness so metria was it she sighed so be it she would do what she had to do so she could prevail on the stork to deliver a baby to her it was probably a fair deal the horse slewed to a halt there was a massive chain across the road so that they could not pass woe betide was tempted to float over it but feared the horse wouldnt un derstand so she dismounted and stepped forward to inspect the nearest links piers anthony each one was in a flat oblong shape with printing on it in fact each had a single letter of the alphabet woe betide walked along beside the chain reading the letters they spelled out this is a chain letter it has been three times around the world break the chain and you will be sorry joe schmoe broke the chain and next day he came down with crottled creeps jane doe preserved the chain and she won great wonderfuls remember you must pass this chain mail on within hours or else woe betide considered was this interesting enough to wake helen for the demoness would be really annoyed if she missed something good this seemed good so she de cided to let helen sleep still she needed to get past this chain she didnt have anything against it but it was in her way and she had a mission to attend to could she go around it she looked to either side but the chain extended as far as she could see that was because it went around the world three times could she climb over it maybe so but eight bits couldnt could she squeeze under it again she might but the quarter horse would probably fragment with the effort she shrugged she doubted that a chain belonged across the road anyway whatever it might claim she also doubted that this was one of the good magicians challenges it was probably just routine mischief so she would break it she formed her little hands into big firm pincers and clamped them on half a link she concentrated her demon strength the key was to use the magic of narrowness a really thin edge could cut through the most solid substance if pushed hard enough the letters on the links changed now they said ooooowww but she continued her pressure until she crunched through her link then she went after the other half link it tried to wiggle away but she cuffed it hard enough to stun it cuff links roc and a hard place she remembered that advice from somewhere she set her pincers and started crunching youll be sorry the letters spelled who breaks the chain is doomed aaaaaahh the half link snapped and the chain fell apart the way was clear whats this woe betide jumped there was the cloud with a horren dous head of hair on it nothing interesting she said what are you wearing my hell toupee of course i picked it up on one of my trips tonever mind i saw what you did you broke the chain you had better put on protective headgear too before that chain gets organized to dump a centurys worth of bad luck on you what kind of toupee the child inquired interested the cloud did a hasty reconsideration a heck toupee thats what i said im sure lets just get out of here woe betide said knowing she had put helen on the defensive as long as she remained in this child form the other demoness was at a disadvantage that was wonderful she mounted eight bits and zoom they were off again she glanced back and saw the chain writhing angrily but it couldnt catch up with them she had broken the chain and gotten away with it that gave her demonly satisfaction they passed a big fisin plant by a river surrounded by electrici trees the plant was busy hauling olddim and nu clear fish from the river and using them to fertilize the trees some of the trees extended out across her route so she slowed they hummed with power and that made her a bit nervous what were they up to she saw a huge fat boxlike creature trundling along be neath the trees she sought to guide her mount past it but it blocked her way child you are too small to be riding a big horse like that it said from its monstrous pegtoothed mouth you should go home piers anthony why dont you go home woe betide asked boldly because there was something about this creature she didnt much like because i never follow my own advice im a hippo crate i tell others how to run their lives but none of that applies to my own life that confirmed her dislike she wanted to get away from the creature but it still balked her then she saw a smaller animal hopping along it had long legs and was extremely furry she recognized it as a hare they were very popular with bald folk so she extended one arm infinitely long and grabbed it she plopped it on her head so that it made her aspect entirely different in fact it made her look like a hairy little troll the hippocrate had been looking around now it looked back at her and did a double take what happened to the innocent little girl i was lecturing it asked how would i know im not innocent disgruntled the hippo waddled off looking for the child because it was much easier to tell children what to do than trolls she was free to ride on after a further interminable ride and float they came to a huge green mountain it rose from the plain in a series of faceted cliffs each one glinting brightly well this is it helen said qaf climb to the top and there will be the simurgh ive done my bit and will be gone the cloud vanished in a dirty noise woe betide dismounted she went to inspect the surface more closely it did indeed seem to be pure emerald the mountain was one big jewel the sun came out from behind a cloud suddenly all the facets reflected dazzling beams one struck eight bits the horse startled fragmented into quarters and the quarters gal loped off in at least four directions woe betide sighed she was on her own she pondered and concluded that since she no longer had roc and a hard place the quarter horse she could resume her adult form she puffed into smoke and reformed as metria she could simply pop up to the top of the mountain but she suspected that the simurgh would not appreciate that the same went for flying up there in xanth the simurgh forbade all flying in her vicinity and it was probably the same here so the ascent would have to be done the tedious way metria formed her hands and feet into big sucker disks then she applied these to the flat surface of the nearest facet and began to climb the suckers popped as she pulled them free and squished as she placed them higher it was another type of magic suckers clung to polished flat surfaces at this rate a few hours would get her to the top then she would find out what all this was about she heard a rumble she extended her neck making it swanlike and rotated her head to look backwards there was a floating shape and it didnt belong to helen back it was fracto cumulo nimbus the worst of clouds she knew this was significant mischief practo was a de mon himself who had specialized in meteorology and had a sure nose for trouble if someone had a nice picnic fracto came to wet on it if someone had an important mission requiring him to travel rapidly fracto came to turn the forest trails to slush ruts if someone camped out on a warm night fracto came to bury the landscape in colored snow and if someone happened to be climbing a sheer emerald cliff fracto came to make the surface slippery and blow that per son away of course there were ways of dealing with the evil cloud and metria understood them well she could become a cloud herself and float impervious to the weather she could even generate some lightning bolts of her own to shoot back at him but she wasnt sure that wouldnt count as flying which would annoy the simurgh fracto of course didnt care whom he annoyedor rather did care so as to be as an noying as possible but he wasnt here to ask any favors of piers anthony the big bird so that was out once she had turned herself into a stink horn which had exploded in fractos midst ren dering him even more insufferably stinky than usual but again that would require her getting into the air and it didnt seem to be worth the risk she could avoid the storm entirely by becoming so diffuse that she could float through the substance of the mountain but again that might be construed as a type of flying so the safest course seemed to be to stick to what she was doing laboriously climbing the slope hoping she could hang on despite the clouds worst efforts fracto was happy to accept this challenge knowing that she was pinned he puffed up voluminously crackling with lightning and thunder his center turned so dark it was like swirling midnight and his edges swelled outward like gross blisters the whole of him was like a giant face with two patches of glowing eyeclouds and a huge round mouth which blew out icy drafts liiiive gooot yoooou he howled blowing smoke at her rain splatted on the cliff and water coursed down past her it was cold and soon would turn icy her sucker hold was firm but how would she be able to make any progress up the slippery rest of it now fracto huffed and puffed and blew a gale at her it was tinged with sleet she pulled in her head so as to protect it but then couldnt see where to go this was no good before long practo would succeed in dislodging her and then shed be falling and she would ei ther have to fly or crash she couldnt actually be physically hurt by a fall but it would be an embarrassment that would hardly be kind to her pride she had to find a way to nullify the ill wind she glanced again at the inky depths of the center of the storm and got a notion what she needed was a lighta night light the kind that folk used when they wanted to conceal their nefarious activities she extended her head and formed it into a lamp with a roc and a hard place dark bulb she turned on the bulb and darkness radiated out from it her night light was in operation she turned up the power the darkness expanded soon it covered the entire facet of the mountain she was on she was hidden within its obscurity fracto realized what was happening the storm turned fu rious but fracto could no longer see her so didnt know precisely where to blow most fiercely oh he was getting frustrated the cloud tried another ploy he turned the draft so cold that the coursing water became a sheet of ice overlaid by slush but under the cover of her night light she formed her nose into a prehensile snout similar to that of the mythical mundane elephant monster and made a hard hammer at its end she tapped at the ice and cracked it away making a clear place for her sucker foot now the wetness didnt hurt in fact it made the seal secure the cloud couldnt hear her tapping because of the almost continuous rumble of thunder she made it to the edge of the facet and crossed the slight bend to the next the storm still raged but her night light protected her when a gust of wind touched her she hunkered down and waited for it to pass then resumed her tapping and moving fracto could not stop her at last the evil cloud got disgusted and stormed away she had beaten him again and it was just as much of a pleasure as ever she dissolved her night light into smoke and re sumed better progress the sun ventured to show its face again no longer fearing the wrath of the storm the emerald mountain dried forming pretty mists all around it they rose like unicorn tails shining in the slanting sunlight of the closing day she paused to appreciate the beauty of the scene and realized that before she got halfsouled she had never had that experience now she could enjoy things for their art instead of for what she could use them for if i could get rid of my soul right now she said aloud i wouldnt do it and that was one remarkable confession for a demoness she felt wonderful piers anthony disgusting mentia muttered awakened by the feeling coursing through her then she tuned out again the peak turned out to be a mere foothill part of a larger mountain and amazingly the larger inner segment of the mountain wasnt green it was light blue definitely a distinct shade beautifully complementing the green rim she had un derstood that the whole thing was emerald but either she had misunderstood or those who said it was all emerald hadnt seen the inner mountain aesthetically this was even better so she wasnt complaining metria had to work her way down into the cleftvalley between peaks before starting up the next and there she paused she had heard something more mischief no it was a woman or a girl a human being lying be tween the slanting green and blue facets of the cleft she had groaned faintly metria considered though she had used the night light she preferred to climb by daylight and there was not a whole lot of day left should she get involved with this human being and perhaps get delayed too long of course not mentia said you have already wasted enough time discouraging fracto you dont have all day left you know that decided her if her worser half was against it it must be the right thing to do she walked over to the woman can i help you she inquired the woman lifted her head long dark hair framed a lovely face i hope so she said wincing i sprained my ankle and dont think i can walk alone i knew it shes an albatross if you help her youll never get to the top of the mountain metria ignored her worser selfs objection with an effort maybe i can help you get home who are you and where do you live she put her hands on the womans shoulders and helped lift her to her feet thank you so much im mara i was out birdcalling and got lost in a storm and some sort of weird darkness i roc and a hard place fell and couldnt get up and when it clearedwell i dont know where i am now so it had been metrias fault because the storm had been after her and she had used the darkness to oppose it she certainly had to help mara find her way home her con science would allow nothing less if you hadnt gotten halfsouled you wouldnt have a conscience mentia griped maybe i can help you cross this green foothill mountain so you can be on the plain metria suggested im a de moness you see and a demoness mara cried affrighted dont worry i have half a shoe half a what mara inquired looking down at metrias feet footwear leather tongue she paused i mean es sence characteristic quality animation spirit soul whatever she said crossly mara was reassured ohthen you have a conscience and can be halfway trusted yes if i were an unsouled demoness i wouldnt have bothered with you at all true whats your name metria d metria mara extended her hand i am glad to know you de moness metria but i dont live on a plain so i dont think going over that green mountain will help i normally do my bird calls in the forest and glade where they are comfortable thats my talent you know fat lot of use doing bird calls is here mentia sneered metria made another effort to ignore her then maybe if we walk along the crevice here i suppose mara agreed dubiously but im sure i didnt walk far before i hurt my ankle metria supported mara enabling her to walk reasonably if wincingly well they followed the cleft around the slow piers anthony curve of the mountain but all they saw was more mountain i dont think this is the way metria said i think youre right mara agreed sadly i dont know how i came to be here i must have gotten caught in a mag ical vortex or something maybe you had better leave me and go on about your business take her up on that no that storm and darkness were because of me so i should help you get unlost all i can think of is to bring you with me to the top of the mountain maybe the simurgh will help you the simurgh isnt that the big bird who has seen the universe die and be reborn three times the same i have to perform a service for her so if you dont mind coming with me oh i dont mind id love to see the simurgh itwould be the experience of my life but there is always a but but youll have trouble climbing metria finished lets see what i can do about that suppose i form myself into a long ladder against the slope could you climb that i suppose if didnt have to hurry so i could favor my ankle i knew it mentia said silently this will take forever minus half a moment metria feared she was right but her half conscience wouldnt let her go she formed herself into an extendable ladder and extended herself up the sloped blue facet until she reached a ridge she could hook on to she formed a mouth at the foot im anchored come on up mara put her hands and good foot on the rungs taking hold then she tried her weakankled foot winced again but was able to put some pressure on it her hands took up enough of her weight to make it feasible fairly reasonably soon mara reached the top and looked around why this is just another foothill she exclaimed theres a yellow mountain beyond roc and a hard place startled metria formed an eyeball on a stalk and looked it was true this was just another crest higher than the green ridge but lower than the yellow one ahead she formed a mouth and sighed hold on she drew up her latter section and extended her fore section so that the ladder disappeared behind and appeared before leaving the top section where mara perched un changed when she reached the blueyellow cleft mara turned around and made her way down the rungs then me tria shrank the ladder and got ready to extend it up the fac eted yellow slope it was now getting close to dusk well never make it up before nightfall mara said you had better leave me and go alone listen to her dope no it wouldnt be right then metria had a notion suppose i make an escalator a what a moving structure automatic increase dangerous clause elevator substitute forming steps stairway whatever so you could ride up faster why thats a wonderful idea but do you have the strength to carry me like that i think so its just a matter of leverage so metria extended herself to the next crest hooked on and mara got onto the bottom of the ladder then metria moved her rungs up and hauled the woman fairly rapidly to the top this is almost fun she exclaimed but when they looked from the top there was another mountain ahead this one was pink it was very pretty but dusk was closing they got more efficient this time metria simply whipped her rungs over the top and mara almost slid down the other side then they mounted the pink slopeand encountered a white almost colorless one beyond i hope this doesnt go on forever mara said i fear piers anthony i have become a real burden to you maybe you should just listen to her no metria said firmly this would have been as long a journey alone were much higher than we were indeed they could see the yellow blue and green ridges below like so many shelves though they hadnt been able to see the higher ridges from below it has to end somewhere you are very kind you are very foolish they went on beyond the white ridge was a deep red oneand this was the final one because they could see its rounded peak atop which perched a giant bird silhouetted against the fading light the simurgh at last they escalated down the white slope and up the red one but as they came within hailing distance of the big bird the bird spread her wings and flew to an adjacent peak rising from what they now saw was a very long mountain range of course it had to be to circle the world the simurgh had never even noticed them metria focused an extended eyeball on the distant bird then she looked down at the endless colorific ridges below it would be an awful job to descend and traverse all those and then to ascend to where the bird now perchedand what guarantee did they have that the simurgh would wait for them to her they were just insects maybe if i did a bird call mara said oh great now well just serenade the birds well whatever you wish metria said dispirited she seemed to be on an impossible mission because she couldnt even get the attention of the one she was supposed to perform a service for had humfrey sent her on a wild swan chase wild what mentia asked waterfowl heron egret gannet crane albatross canvas back duck gander whatever roc and a hard place meanwhile mara did her bird call she made a series of melodic sweet piercing chirping sounds she was really quite good at it it sounded just like some exotic bird the simurgh took wing and flew directly toward their peak who calls me her powerful thought came metria formed a mouth so it could drop open in amaze ment maras talent wasnt to imitate bird calls but to call birdsand she had just called the simurgh herself uhii mara began yes of course begone mara vanished hey metria exclaimed that isnt right shut up fool by what definition demoness now the giant bird loomed close her feathers were like veils of light and shadow and her head bore a crest of fire the beats of her enormous wings were like waves of mist she was an over whelming presence metria was seldom cowed by anything in the natural world but this was supernatural she dissolved into smoke and reformed in her approximately natural approximately human shape i was trying to help her you have no right to banish her just like that i dont care who you are it isnt right you question me now the great bird came to light on the tip of the red peak her mighty talons digging into the glossy stone as if it were wood let it go idiot yes bring her back there is no need silence imbecile shell destroy you yes metria cried responding to both the simurghs query and her worser halts warning the enormous head turned one eye bearing on her be at ease good demoness i accept you for service the good magician chose wisely last chance stupid stifle it piers anthony but metria was beyond sensible restraint well im not ready to give service not to any creature who does that to an innocent person mara never harmed you she wanted only to go home i was trying to help her because the simurgh twitched one wingfeather suddenly mara was back exactly as she had been before let it be metria im done here youre safe metria asked halfstunned mara smiled as safe as a figment can ever be she vanished again see she doesnt really exist you irritated the big bird for nothing moron not so worser self the simurghs thought came this time stunning mentia who had thought her thoughts were hidden her conscience has served her well parts of this were beginning to settle into haphazard place this was all aa test the woman the storm the chain like the good magicians castle he gave you token challenges because he wanted you to perform this mission i verified your fitness in my own fashion as you now understand i require a personage who is inventive determined and compas sionate metria worked it out first a mere physical obstruction or two of no particular consequence then a personal threat that needed to be dealt with then a small trial of conscience just to make sure i could do the service you require exactly good demoness i am careful about those to whom i entrust important tasks i require one with the powers of a demon and the conscience of a souled person you will do do you have any questions before commencing dont ask any dunce this mountaini thought it was supposed to be one big emerald but you are observant good demoness it is emerald or roc and a hard place more correctly beryl the type of stone of which em erald is but one shade the white is ordinary beryl the blue is aquamarine the yellow heliodor the pink morgantte and the red bixbyite the rarest but for one one metria asked somewhat stupidly black beryl the simurgh twitched her head and a bag appeared in her beak take this the bag dropped to me trias involuntarily outstretched hands she opened the bag it was filled with glistening black disks what am i supposed to do with this these are summons tokens you will serve one on each person or creature or thing named and will guide those who need it to the necessary site metria had never felt so stupid in her existence neces sary site the nameless castle that is where the trial will be trial she still had not caught her mental balance roxanne roc has been indicted and will be tried be fore a jury of her peers a fortnight hence you will serve summonses on all participants trial personnel witnesses jury you will see that they are present at the correct time that is your service to me but roxannes a decent bird what did she do that will be made evident in the course of the trial and how do i know whom to serve the summonses on each bears the name of the summonee but suppose they dont want to come that will not be a problem each person must know ingly accept the summons and acknowledge this to you before you depart but give it a rest dope you are trying her patience true worser self the great eye oriented on metria again your information is now sufficient perform your service good demoness piers anthony metria realized that she had been dismissed she started to change into her ladder form you may pop across to xanth thank you she said relieved and popped off carrying the bag of tokens mystery metria popped across to xanth to her home castle where she made her husband deliriously happy enough to leave him in a trance for several days then she considered she realized that there could be a good many summons tokens in the bag and it might take time to use them all up so she had better get them efficiently or ganized she opened the bag and spread the glistening black beryl disks on a table sure enough there were thirty tokens and each was in scribed with a name most of the names were familiar but some were obscure and some amazed her for example her old nemesis demon professor grossclout was on a chip what in xanth could he have to do with this she turned over the disk and on the other side it said judge oh of course that was the perfect role for him another chip bore the name of the simurgh herself on the back it said witness piers anthony she could have served that token at the outset saving herself a difficult trip then she reconsidered she might need to consult with the simurgh if she couldnt find one of the peo ple to summon so she should save the simurghs own token as a pretext for that occasion so she put that one at the end of the line one token was blank that was interesting whom was it for or was it a mistake then she got marginally smarter and turned over all the tokens classifying them by assignment there was one for prosecutor and another for defense and others for bailiff special effects and translator translator she turned that one over it was grundy golem that figured he could trans late anything spoken by any living thing including plants who was special effects the sorceress iris mistress of illusion that figured too someone had chosen these roles well since it must have been the simurgh herself who marked the tokens this was no surprise she was after all the wisest creature in all xanth but why did she want roxanne roc put on trial metrias limited direct experience with the simurgh suggested that she was a fairminded creature and roxanne was a good bird quite loyal to her mission in fact she was doing a service for the simurgh herself in the nameless castlewhere the trial would be was this the way the simurgh rewarded her that didnt seem to make sense well there was one fast way to find out she would serve roxannes summons first and ask her then she would go after the other important participants in the trial and finally the jurors who were the biggest category and would prob ably be a nuisance to run down her schedule was coming clear she put the tokens back in the bag and formed a knapsack to hold the bag then she popped over to the nameless cas tle this was a quaint medieval edifice begirt with towers par apets turrets battlements embrasures moat glacis pen roc and a hard place nants and all the standard accouterments there were only one or two things different about it it was made of solidified vapor and it floated high in the air in fact it was built on a cloud which seemed like an island in the sky from the ground it looked just like an ordinary cumulus for some reason few folk knew of it she walked up to the main entrance and knocked on the door because it wouldnt be polite to enter unannounced and besides there was a spell that prevented unauthorized demon entry in a moment there was a loud questioning squawk from the interior im the demoness metria she answered here on business the door creaked open and she walked in the interior hall was elegant in the usual manner with finely set cloud stones for the floor and carpets hung on the cloud walls though the nameless castle was made of vapor it was sur prisingly strong and could withstand all the things a castle was expected to withstand enchanted cloudstuff was light not weak she came to the vast central chamber there was an enor mous nest of marbled granite and on the nest sat roxanne roc a bird so big she could swallow a normal human person without chewing just about the simurghs size in fact but not as authoritative or beautiful in plumage roxanne was mostly shades of brown she had been assigned by the si murgh several centuries ago to hatch a special stone egg and was still at it metria floated in roxanne i have a summons for you she said but fd like to know the big bird opened her beak squawk oops she couldnt understand rocspeak she could give the big bird the token but that wouldnt satisfy her she wanted to know what this trial was all about how could she talk with the roc the question brought the answer grundy golem his name was on a token as translator so she should summon him and use him to translate for the roc piers anthony be right back she said and popped off to the golem residence grundy golem rapunzel and their sevenyearold daugh ter surprise lived in a tree house actually a cottage industree they were a small family because grundy could be picked up in one ordinary human hand and rapunzel could assume any size she wished so preferred to match him surprise did too for now so metria matched their scale so as to fit in their residence why d metria rapunzel exclaimed spying her ex actly as if glad to see her the truth was that just about nobody was glad to see a demoness but rapunzel was beau tiful in body and spirit an ideal complement to the mouthy golem her distinguishing trait apart from her niceness was her infinitely long hair which assumed various colors as it coursed down across her body toward the floor to what to we owe the pleasure of this visit rapunzel had succeeded in doing what was almost im possible she made metria feel guilty so she hedged um could i talk to grundy of course rapunzel lifted her long hair out of the way and called dear theres someone here to see you grundy walked into the room he was a fully living crea ture but still bore the aspect of his origin as a rag and wood construction he spied metria thats not someone he snapped thats metria the most mischievous nuisance in xanth who cant even get a word right this was more like it metria affected a serious mien grundy golem i have an enjoin for you a what you ludicrous excuse for a spirit bid request invitation proposal solicitation petition demand summons whatever she said smiling as she handed him his to ken take that you little crawl this time he chose to ignore the miscue what am i being summoned to roc and a hard place the trial of roxanne roc that big bird the worst thing she ever did was annoy the simurgh by innocently flying too close to parnassus why is she on trial that is what i would like to know come with me and well ask her grundy nodded not really annoyed by the situation bound to be an interesting story here he said it should be fun translating for whatever weird creatures get hauled in but what about my wife i dont like leaving her out of it i have a disk for her too metria said producing it shes up for jury duty she handed it over but what about surprise rapunzel inquired as she studied her token shes not on my list maybe this concerns something adult and shes underage but i could become overage the little girl said brightly if i had to no dear rapunzel said immediately you must save your magic for when its really needed and not waste it for something that would probably bore you you can stay with tangleman while were gone goody the child agreed tangleman had originally been a tangle tree transformed into a jolly green giant man in the course of a censored chapter his vegetable mind was somewhat simple so he got along well with children actually the trial is a fortnight hence metria said so the jurors dont have to report to the nameless castle until then but id like to have grundy come to help me talk with roxanne now you got it demoness grundy agreed enthusiastically say didnt you get married or something why are you involved in this i got married got halfsouled and fell in love in that order metria agreed now im trying to get the storks attention but humfrey sent me to the simurgh and shes piers anthony requiring me to do this i pop back home every so often to make my husband deliriously happy i know how that is grundy said glancing briefly at rapunzel whose hair formed momentarily into a heart shape framing her body as she winked back at him well lets get a wiggle on take me to bird brain metria picked him up and popped back to the nameless castle in the sky she could do this now because the castle door remained open making a small hole in the protective spell they arrived at the same spot she had vacated in the central chamber before the nest roxanne roc i have come to serve you with a sum mons metria said formally as she spoke grundy squawked actually he didnt need to because roxanne understood human talk it was others who couldnt understand her the rocs near eye widened she squawked back she says she cant go anywhere grundy translated she has an egg to incubate and mustnt let it get cold it is due to hatch any year now simurghs orders this summons is from the simurgh metria said and grundy squawked she nipped it at the huge bird roxanne caught it in her beak displaying surprising dex terity she set it down on the rim of the nest before her and focused one eye on it then she used one monstrous claw to flip it over and perused the other side she squawked whats this about being the defendant grundy trans lated she says she hasnt done anything wrong in fact she has hardly been out of this room in almost six hundred years and has guarded the egg faithfully throughout is this a cruel hoax demon smoke all that with one squawk metria asked bemused those were her exact words well i sanitized what she called you it was actually never mind metria was familiar with the golems pro pensity for stirring up trouble roxanne had probably spoken roc and a hard place politely you mean she doesnt know why shes to be as sayed shes to be whatted attempted endeavored ventured exerted wielded judged tried fogbrain whatevered it must be something horribly serious to get the simurgh herself involved doesnt she have any hint there was an exchange of squawks no hint grundy reported she has been here just doing her job as she said there must be some mistake the simurgh didnt act as if there were any mistake metria said remembering what the most knowledgeable bird in all xanth had thought to her and the words on the token are clear roxanne will be put on trial here in a fort night grundy translated the roc shrugged remaining perplexed she would be here because she would not desert the egg regardless so metria walked out closed the door and popped back to grundys home ill fetch you next time i need you she told him just make sure you and rapunzel are there for the trial we will be grundy agreed rapunzel will make her self tall enough to reach that cloud and put me on it and then ill haul her up after me as she changes back to small size i wouldnt miss this trial for all xanth neither would i metria confessed theres something awfully anomalous going on here awfully what peculiar odd irregular unusual curious bizarre queer strange weird she agreed crossly for sure if it were anyone but the simurgh behind it id suspect it of being a joke piers anthony the simurgh doesnt joke she doesnt joke he agreed still pleasantly mystified metria popped next to the only other entity on her list who might know about the trial de mon professor grossclout it would be an unholy pleasure serving him with a summons he was teaching a class at the demon university of magic she appeared in the back of the chamber suddenly suffering a fit of apprehension grossclout had always intim idated her though she had always denied it his aspect was horrendous even in demon terms and small horns glowed red when he made a strong point his face was so ugly that he could have walked without notice among ogres but the worst of it was his overwhelming knowledge if there was anything he didnt know it was hardly worth knowing and therefore he was saying we can conclude that the fourth principle of responsive magic has not been vio lated and there is no paradox he paused his eye glinting every student in the class trembled fearing that the professor was about to make an example what are you doing here metria suddenly she was woe betide she hadnt changed inten tionally there was just something about the professor that turned her spine to mush this had never happened to her before nothing at all your greatness she whined a big frightened tear rolling down her cute little cheer most students come here with heads full of mush he remarked you have a spine of mush you couldnt have crashed this class without help come here gamine out with it what are you up to woe betide took one dread step after another toward him unable to help herself iihave something she peeped give it here he said with such ultimate authority that the rafters vibrated she handed the token to him itits a summons sir roc and a hard place what now the ground shook and plaster and silt sifted down from the ceiling the students cowered to appear at the nameless castle a fortnight hence to preside over the i can see that the professor roared and now the walls began to crumble the students flinched as much as they dared why is this trial occurring ii thought you would know he glowered i shall certainly find out begone mush spine and woe betide metria was begone involuntarily she hadnt learned anything i wouldnt have taken that from him mentia remarked you didnt either before you got your soul metria couldnt deny it there were times when a soul was a real liability i should have let you serve him that sum mons she said let me serve the next one who is it metria checked her bag magician trent and sorceress iris um you take trent ill take iris i just had an adventure with her she had arrived at her home castle she went inside to check on veleno but he was still floating in a sea of delir ium a smile glued on his face he would hold for another day or so so they popped over to the brain corals pool where trent and iris were supposed to be but she didnt see them there she squatted and poked a finger into the water what do you want of me demoness it was the pool itself wheres magician trent she inquired he is not here he took the sorceress iris on a second honeymoon fiftythree years after the first they like each other better this time both being much younger than before a honeymoon metria exclaimed you mean i have to go all the way to the moon that is what i mean piers anthony she sighed well thanks anyway pool she popped off to the moon she landed in a pile of moldy cheese ugh she swore sailing up and shaking off her feet she had forgotten that the two sides of the moon differed the one that faced xanth had long since degenerated into cheesiness because of what it saw only the far side remained unspoiled once she got her feet cleaned off she flew around to the fair side now she saw the surface of milk and honey where newly married couples lolled in a reasonable approximation of the kind of delirious happiness she routinely provided for veleno of course it wouldnt last for those others because they couldnt remain on the honey moon forever she gazed across the idyllic landscape and spied a lovely fountain of firewater with the smoke rising to form a back drop of pastelhued clouds that was obviously illusion as the moon didnt have clouds she made for it and sure enough there was the sorceress in her youthened state a girl in her midtwenties idly indulging her fancy while magician trent snoozed she approached trent remember me king emeritus she inquired he woke and glanced at her oh hello metria we once almost meant something to each other in a vision of mun dania true she agreed that experience caused me to try marriage myself as you remember now im on a mission forwell heres your summons she handed him his to ken he turned it over i am to be the bailiff at a trial thats a novel notion and this is the novel she agreed yielding the body to her worser self and yours mentia said approaching iris we shared the madness where i was sane i remember iris agreed languidly i was youthened roc and a hard place for that and i appreciate it she accepted her token spe cial effects i dont know what that means any more than you do mentia said maybe youre needed for illusion pictures of things that they cant conveniently bring to the nameless castle the nameless castle trent exclaimed amazed the trial is there isnt that where that roc is roxanne roc mentia agreed shes the one on trial you wouldnt happen to have a notion what for would you i cant think of any reason that is one dedicated bird this isnt some elaborate spoof thats unlikely iris said look at these summons disks they are made of black berylone of the rarest stones in xanth no one would fool with them he nodded i should think not well our stay here was about over anyway when do we have to report for the trial in a fortnight mentia said she looked around oops i feel some craziness coming on she dived into iris illu sion fountain and splashed in the rising water sending drop lets splattering against the backdrop then the water changed to fire and the fire changed to water so that she was splashing in a column of fire hoo she cried as it singed her derriere thats hot well you shouldnt mess with illusion trent remarked mildly thats a hint we should get out of here metria advised her worser self they may want to conclude their stay here in style you would think of that you married creature but men tia obligingly popped back to their home base in xanth who else do we need to serve half a slew metria said checking but only two more actual trial personnel grey murphy and princess ida piers anthony not grey and ivy that could be real mischief especially if ida gets a notion true but of course the simurgh wouldnt do anything like that no more than she would put an innocent loyal bird on trial mentia remarked well if ida did get a notion we could sprinkle her with lethe elixir to make her forget about grey metria said great idea that could completely restore her talent too since the ideas she makes become real must come from someone who doesnt know her talent thats a crazy notion metria said thank you so where is grey murphy at the moment use the token blockhead how do you expect to locate the rest of the names oh metria took out the token marked grey murphy and held it up sure enough it seemed to tug in one direction it wanted to do its duty and if the summonsee wouldnt come to it it would go to the summonsee she floated letting the stone disk show the way she made herself smoky light so that it was able to tug her along soon she was traveling at a respectable speed through trees boul ders houses dragons and whatnot the general direction seemed to be northwest in due course she came to the coast but the tug didnt stop he cant be out in the sea she muttered but that was the direction of the tug a see monster lifted its huge eye and peered at her she ignored it see monsters didnt bite they just looked of course it was important not to let them see too much be cause they got really smug when they sucseeded when the big eye threatened to look down the front of her blouse she changed it to a tortoisenecked sweater when the monster tried to look up under her skirt she changed it to slacks eliminating any possible view of anything interesting she could have changed form to a bird or faded out entirely but roc and a hard place she preferred to tease the thing disgusted at not being able to see the color of her panties the monster sank back under the sea surface she was now floating over the golf of mecks co she had to watch out for flying golf balls because this was their nat ural home they sailed in from all over plunking into the water where they chortled as they sank forever out of sight she couldnt blame them it meant that they would never again be clubbed by irons the shoreline discovering she was leaving it behind set out to do something about it she continued to fly in a straight line but it curved around until it intersected her course then the sea made an effort and pushed back under her but the land would not be denied and shoved forcefully across until it was going west and hung on despite the seas best efforts she had not before realized how competitive these two elements were but by this time she was just about there she was right at the westernmost fringe of xanth about to pass across the fringe of magic since she didnt know what would happen to her if she went beyond the magic she came down to earth when human beings left the magic they lost their magic talents but were otherwise pretty much the same when partly magical creatures crossed the boundary they became mundane creatures unbearably dull but demons were wholly magical and they might simply cease to exist she preferred not to risk it yet the token still tugged ahead she walked right up to the scintillating curtain that separated most of xanth from mundania and stopped the token tugged one way and then another what was going on buffoon mentia said dont you rememberthe river beyond moves about constantly its very mobile mobile metria agreed remembering its always in a hurry to be somewhere else the people who live by it have to keep moving too but why would grey be out there mentia considered this is a crazy thing so perchance i piers anthony understand it better i think maybe grey is not out there were getting a reflection from the magic interface i helped recompile its stronger than it used to be there was that crazy claim again about visiting xanths distant past and saving everything from encroaching mad ness but maybe her worser half was right about one detail metria turned around and held up the token sure enough now the tugging was stronger from he east so she left the crazy moving region behind and proceeded toward whatever grey murphy was up to she was relieved she could handle a river or place that was mobile if she had to but she didnt want to go any closer to drear mundania than absolutely necessary the direction steadied possibly the mobile terrain beyond had caused ripples in the curtain so that the reflection moved despite having a still source now she was orienting on grey directly she floated up and moved faster she came to a sign you are now approaching pens cola whats grey doing in a pen mentia demanded metria didnt answer she spied a fence ahead each post was a very large writing pen of a particular style one was a feather quill another a metaltipped stake and a third jetted colored water into the air oh a fountain pen mentia said ropes were strung between the pens to complete the fence the fence curved slowly into the surrounding forest on each standing pen was a single printed letter theres something familiar about this mentia muttered i know what it is little woe betide cried i saw letters on a chain just walk along and read them out of the mouths of babes and sucklings metria muttered she walked along reading the letters they formed a repeating series cost of living adjustment metria couldnt make much sense from this she stood and gazed at the fence wondering whether to fly on over it was that what the fence was penning roc and a hard place suddenly the pens uprooted themselves and jumped to new holes beside the old ones metria could tell from the direction and curvature that the fence now enclosed a bit more territory than it had before it had gotten larger there were old filledin holes inside the penned region showing that this had been happening for some time but who cared i cant read those big words woe betide complained just use the first letters dear mentia suggested c la the pens spell cola she asked pens cola mentia agreed and it seems it keeps ex panding metria shrugged maybe that makes sense to you because youre a little crazy but im going to fly on by it now she lifted higher and followed the tug of the token on across the fenced region at last she caught up to grey murphy he was just stand ing in place looking puzzled whats up man from mun dania she inquired shifting to an appropriate outfit for the occasion very short tight skirt vaguely translucent very full blouse voluminously flowing black hair with embedded sparkles and a complexion so clear that one might almost see ones reflection in it there was just something about men of power that intrigued her he had been betrothed to princess ivy ever since he arrived in xanth and it seemed that he should have done something about that by now she doubted that she could actually tempt him but it was worth a try a girl just never could tell about a human man es pecially a magician grey looked up what mischief are you up to this time metria he inquired i have something for you she said inhaling he refused to be bluffed what is that she leaned slightly forward vanishing the top button of her blouse so as to expose more heaving scenery but he didnt seem to notice a summons she proffered the to ken piers anthony he took it and turned it over i am to be prosecutor at a trial i dont know anything about that its the trial of roxanne roc at the nameless castle i can help you find your way there if you wish no need what did she do i thought she was on a mis sion for the simurgh she is but the simurgh wants the trial its a mystery why so you will have to prostitute have to what indict arraign persecute prosecute whatever she was ruining the good impression she was trying to make he shrugged who else will be there professor grossclout magician trent sorceress iris princess ida a bunch of jurors nobody important the demon professor grossclout he asked brighten ing ive always wanted to meet him hell be the judge of course of course ill consult with him hell know what to do he looked around but first i have to finish what im doing here what are you doing grey i am looking for re who a girl called re humfrey said she would be here in the region known as ality but i cant seem to find her whats the matter with her she got confused and is in trouble humfrey said her talent turned against her so im here to nullify it to get her out of trouble my talent is the nullification of magic so i should be able to handle it she owe the good magician a years service of course but there just doesnt seem to be anything here in ality he looked frustrated how can i nullify something when i cant find it maybe i can succor metria said intrigued maybe you can what roc and a hard place aid support deliverance assistance service help whatever she agreed crossly why did her impediment always get worse when she least wanted it to since when do you try to help anyone metria since when i got halfsouled he reconsidered that does make a difference very well how do you propose to help well this seems like a slightly crazy situation so ill see if my crazy worser half has any insight she turned the body over to mentia hello d mentia he said i dont think weve met before fortunately mentia agreed kiss me why because im the half without soul or conscience i de mand payment for my services kisses for help to start she turned slightly so as to give him a better view of her profile metria had had the right idea with this outfit but simply lacked the crazy cunning to exploit it prop erly id be crazy to agree to a deal like that suppose ivy found out thats what makes it interesting he pondered a moment okay she was startled you agree one one condition i do the kissing sure one kiss for each helpful thing i figure out agreed what have you figured out go away and come back here what just do it handsome craziness doesnt make sense until after the fact you dont have to go far turn twice when you do it too grey looked baffled but complied he turned and walked piers anthony away then he turned again and walked back what does this prove have you turned and returned yes so if you came to ality before now you have come to reality he frowned i suppose whats the point you have to redo things to reach re now that you have reconsidered and returned to reality you are closer to finding her thats crazy yes pay me he looked annoyed but also thoughtful very well come here mentia stepped close to him and raised her face but he took her head in his hands turned it down and kissed the top of her head hey thats not what i meant she protested i kissed you nobody specified where but thats crazy mentia realized that she hadnt made precisely the deal she thought or maybe grey murphy was smarter than she thought she shrugged that simply made it more of a chal lenge now i think that re has this power of redoing and maybe she got mixed up and rejected herself so you must search and research to find her but i have already searched right do it again you have merely rehearsed it so far he nodded he went through the motions of searching again okay i have researched i still dont see her what now repay me oh he took her right hand and kissed it but this time a pair of lips appeared on her hand and kissed him back roc and a hard place now look around again she said examine and ex amine again he looked around twice okay i have reexamined the region what now pay not until you produce something more positive she sighed he was too canny to make this game really fun i think we must be very close to finding her now call herand call again he nodded he cupped his mouth with his hands re he called then again re he had recalled her there was a faint sound almost like a female moan quick orient twice mentia said grey focused on the area where the sound seemed to have come from then refocused i am reorienting he said do you feel anything yes there is something here he agreed say it again he said it again there is something here and with that restatement a form appeared faintly move her mentia said twice he put his arms around the shape and moved it then he moved it again the form became firmer this has to be re he said and again this has to be re he repeated the form clarified yes she breathed help me help me now i can use my own magic grey said i can nullify her magic he put his hand on her head verse re verse the resuit was encouraging suddenly the complete woman was there she was reasonably young and pretty oh you have saved me she cried its such a relief im so really grateful she flung her arms about him and kissed him several times on the face before he could react ahem mentia said it seems to be that you let a num piers anjhony ber of payments go by and now youre paying the wrong person grey smiled ruefully youre right you have been very helpful mentia he disengaged from re took mentia in his arms and kissed her soundly on the mouth twice there was magic in his kisses that nullified her craziness wow she said dizzied wow well you did earn it he replied in your slightly crazy way i will refrain from further demands mentia said and gave the body back to metria she had been teasing him but his magic had more than nullified her effort and she needed to recover grey turned back to re what happened to you i was trying to rebuild my house and i paused to re flect she related something distracted me and i acci dentally repealed myself the last thing i was able to do was release a plea to the good magician to help me i wasnt sure he would receive it but it was too late to re vise it then you came and repulsed my own magic that re mained repressing me and rejuvenated me thank you so much from the recesses of my heart normally i am more reserved but well you know you will have to give the good magi cian a years service before this is resolved grey re minded her he sent me to reanimate you yes i am reconciled to that she said but i feel re vitalized and i really do respect the good magician there is a magic path near here that will lead you safely to his reconstructed castle grey said thank you re organized herself and set off down the path she had a long way to go but her recent experience evidently gave her courage grey turned to metria now i can go to the nameless castle where isit in the sky can you enlist the help of a roc bird to carry roc and a hard place you there youre too heavy for me to carry much as id like to try yes there is a roc who owes humfrey he said he paused you know youor your worser halfhave been so helpful that i no longer resent your presence your ac quisition of a soul does seem to have made you a better creature metria found herself blushing something she never used to do in the old days thank you but im just trying to complete my own service to the good magician so i can re produce oh i thought demonesses could do that when they chose to yes but apparently its much harder the second time so now i need help to get the storks revision he didnt challenge her miscue you summoned the stork before yes about four hundred and forty years ago give or take a couple but whos counting it was a bad business i now realize there is surely an interesting story there he said but id better call that roc bye she agreed and popped off she arrived at castle roognathere at the two prominent comers of the roof were gary gar and gayle goyle spouting water into the moat it wasnt raining so metria wasnt cer tain where the water was coming from but it was a nice effect the moat looked quite clean which wasnt surprising because the gargoyles job was to purify the water they spouted ill handle this mentia said i know them she moved up to take over the body then addressed the two winged monsters hello you ugly brutes remember me both gargoyles swallowed their water so they could talk demoness mentia gary cried we havent seen you in a year piers anthony true ive been with my better half trying to figure out what her strange new life is all about but now i have two summonses for you you are to be jurors at the trial of rox anne roc who gay ie asked a big bird who is hatching something for the simurgh all right gary said well be there mentia tossed a token up to each of them they caught them in their mouths two more served she went on inside the castle returning the body to her better self princess ida came to meet her how nice to see you metria she said in very much the way rapunzel had but ida never said anything she didnt believe because she believed what she said then metria stared there was something floating past the princess head idatheres a big bug about to land on you ida smiled thats not a bug its my moon your what planet globe orb heavenly body orbiting fragment but what are you doing with a little moon it just came to me and it was so cute i couldnt tell it to go away its really no harm apparently not it was just a tiny blob that slowly swung around her head it does look sort of sweet metria ad mitted will it grow up to be a big planet someday i hope so ida smiled what can i do for you you can accept this summons to participate in the trial of roxanne roc why of course ida agreed accepting the token she was a very agreeable person and i see i am to defend her i shall surely do my best this was almost too easy youre not worried because you dont know what youre defending her from im sure i will soon find out metria decided not to argue she had too many tokens still roc and a hard place to serve to waste time and you can find the nameless castle im sure i will and if she believed it she probably would because idas talent was the idea whatever she believed would be would be except that the idea had to come from someone who didnt know her talent that limited it considerably but it was clear that princess ida did not yet know what this trial was all about metrias main vice had always been her curiosity and now it was becoming almost painful why should there be such an enormous effort because of one big bird who seemed never to have done anyone any harm the mystery intensified with every step metria took threnody metria returned home to stoke veleno up for a few more hours then assessed the remaining tokens most of the names seemed straightforward and she thought there shouldnt be any problem locating them but one name she dreaded because that person was bound to be uncooperative what would happen if she managed to serve every summons but one would the trial be delayed and would metria then fail in her service and be denied what she most desired that would perhaps be fitting but she sin cerely did not want it to happen if she was going to fail this was the name that would fail her so the sensible thing to do was to tackle it next then if it went wrong she wouldnt have to bother with the other names unless she got a release from the simurgh this was after all just one of the jurors and there were more than a dozen of them some would be eliminated at the trial itself roc and a hard place but she rather thought that she had better get all the names if she possibly could so she lifted the token for threnody the half demoness wife of jordan the barbarian it tugged and she floated where it led deep in the jungle near the slowly diminishing region of madness she caught up to jordan and threnody they were eating a freshly picked pot pie it was of course shaped like a pot and was rich in iron metria turned invisible and floated quietly up to them knowing that a certain amount of discretion was in order but it didnt work threnody lifted her nose and started sniff ing she was a lovely blackhaired blackeyed dusky sultry beauty of comely aspect and statuesque proportion in fact she looked good considering her age fee fi fo fum the luscious damsel said darkly i smell the bod of someones mum she glared you never could fool her you know mentia remarked for no particular reason metria sighed and turned visible i really wish you would let bygones be bygones thren corpulent chance met go away you know ive changed recently well change into nonexistence demoness jordan barbarian continued eating seemingly not inter ested in the dialogue he was a roughhewn primitively handsome man of middling age who took justified pride in his ignorance of civilized ways but he had learned not to poke his nose into his wifes business lest she cut it off however his crude male eye did explore the crevice of me trias decolletage and the projection of her posterior as was expected according to the barbarian code it was clear that this was going to be difficult i have something to give you you have already given me more than enough thren ody said showing her teeth in unfeigned fury now give me what i most crave your total absence piers anthony right after i give you this handsome engraved disk she held it up that looks like black beryl threnody snapped thats a summons from the simurgh yes for you to be a juror at a trial the woman brightened momentarily are they finally trying you for treason against xanth no this is for roxanne roe then im not interested threnody faced away metria had been afraid of this the woman simply refused to take anything from her or to give her anything other than anger so she tried with woe betide the winsome little girl appeared please your delight fulness if you will only accept this token i will go away forever minus a few mutates a big tear formed jordan glanced at the darling tot his eyeball did not sweat in the same manner as it had for metrias tightfitting adult configuration but he had a certain interest in children be cause their simple minds were parallel to his own dont tease me with that old act you rotten brat threnody gritted impressed not half a whit ill not accept anything from any of your deceitful variations because i know its the same soulless bitch of a demoness inside now are you going to get far away from me or do i have to start singing worse yet threnodys songs were always so horribly sad that metria couldnt stand to hear them and had to flee no please dont do that woe betide cried another big tear welling out you must take this token threnody started singing woe betide clapped her little hands over her little ears but the excruciatingly sad melody insinuated itself past them and into her head she couldnt stand it she lost cohesion and reverted to metriawho still couldnt stand it it was threnodys ultimate weapon against her always effective she retreated until the sound became faint then she formed heavy earmuffs to dull down the sound so that the roc and a hard place dirge was only faintly agonizing now she could stand it but she wasnt close enough to plead with threnody about the summons still she couldnt quit because that could mess up her whole mission it was just barely maybe possible that thren ody was suffering the merest slightest tiniest little suggestion of a hint of softening and might on some impossibly far fetched chance change her mind eventually so metria re mained where she was in sight of the dusky woman and the barbarian but threnody was having less than none of it she con sulted inaudibly with jordan then the two of them walked away it was clear that they would not gladly remain hi me trias sight so metria floated after them when she got too close threnody resumed her song of lamentation and drove her away again so it was an impasse metria could not approach threnody or make her accept the summons token but nei ther could threnody make metria leave her entirely alone in fact just to make it interesting metria formed a diaph anous gown and teased the barbarian with it that much mis chief she could do from this distance naturally threnody was not unduly keen on having her man entertained for too long in this manner but unless she cut out his eyeballs they could not be prevented from straying this was the nature of the features of barbarian men it was involuntary threnody abruptly turned and walked in a new direction metria realized that she was heading directly into the nearby region of madness that was an extremely chancy thing to do as metria well knew obviously threnody was prepared to risk it in the hope that metria would not follow shes got a surprise coming mentia remarked indeed she did for though the madness caused strange things to happen and messed up the minds of ordinary folk until they became acclimated it made mentia sane because mentias normal state was slightly crazy so her abnormal piers anthony state was opposite mentia could handle the region of mad ness the fringe of madness came into view it was a mere shimmer of unreality suggesting the dissolution beyond most folk avoided it with horror but threnody was plunging on in half dragging jordan along metria floated in their wake maintaining the compromise distance between them she wanted to keep them in sight because she wasnt sure the token would accurately track threnody within the mad ness it was impossible to be sure what would happen there then for a moment they paused there was a man looking bewildered his features were indistinct as if he wasnt quite sure himself who he was or what he was doing here he seemed to appeal to threnody for assistance or advice but she brushed him off and plunged on still towing jordan soon metria caught up to that place hello the man cried can you help me im lost keep on moving or youll lose them mentia advised but metrias half conscience wouldnt allow it she formed herself into a nonprovocatively garbed woman you dont want to be in this region she said youre heading into madness i surely am he agreed where am i pretty much dead center of southern xanth now if you go back that way youll get into ordinary territory and should be all right she pointed away from the madness xanth im in xanth he seemed amazed where else now i must be on my way for threnody and jordan were almost out of sight their images fuzzed by the lunacy of the deepening madness but i cant be there he cried its not possible well youll have to settle that for yourself metria said moving on no you dont understand he said following her i im fromfrom mundania thats your misfortune she forged on watching the pair ahead roc and a hard place but this makes no sense he said pacing her xanth isnt real its a story suit yourself but if you dont reverse in a hurry youre going to be out of xanth proper and into madness and i dont think youll like it he shook his head i must indeed be mad or maybe this is all a bad dream the last thing i remember is he shook his head then i was floundering around here he peered at her more closely if i may askwho are you i think i know whats happened mentia said ill take over now before the madness drives you crazy then as suming the body she spoke to the man i am d mentia dementia close enough i am richard siler richard i know a richard from mundania they call me billy jack mentia was on the verge of her sanity as she entered the madness so was able to make sense of this a nickname yes i think i had better take you to the other richard he understands about mundane visits thank you but be prepared this is about to get strange stranger than it already is i doubt it suit yourself they came to a chair there was a rock in it whats that billy jack asked obviously a rock in chair leave it alone but he was already removing the rock out of some foolish sense of the nature of chairs immediately the chair tilted forward causing him to stumble over it and he landed sitting in it the chair tilted back so swiftly that he flew out of it to land in something else meanwhile the chair tilted vio lently forward again catching mentia so that she too fell into it and was similarly hurled back she found herself in piers anthony an invisible swing swinging wildly back and forth she felt wonderful as it swung high and awful as it swung low what is this billy jack cried as he swung past her i feel greatterriblegreatterrible its a mood swing mentia said figuring it out i told you not to mess with that rock in chair now it has rocked us right into trouble however she was a demoness so didnt need to submit to the antics of warped furniture she dissolved into smoke and floated out of the swing she crossed to billy jack caught on to his swing and held it still so that he could jump out you were right he gasped it is getting stranger just stay close to me and dont touch anything the forms of threnody and jordan were dimly visible ahead they had probably been slowed by something similar they ducked past the mood swings and hurried on sud denly they almost collided with a stout pillar it seemed or dinary except for the whiskers before they could pass by it the pillar transformed into a big cat growr it growled and pounced mentia became a splat of cold water the cat struck the water screeched and turned right back into the pillar what billy jack asked cat or pillar obviously get out of here before it changes back this is really weird no it isnt were only partway into the madness these are fringe effects lets hope we can avoid the really weird things suddenly something swept past them it was like a metal ball with arms legs mouth and eyes sprouting from its surface mine it cried picking up the pillar the pillar changed back into the cat screeching but the ball sprouted more arms and caught on to all its extremities it threw the cat into a pit mine mine it cried mentia turned cloudy and floated over the pit it was half roc and a hard place filled with precious things ranging from jewels to golden coins it was a treasure pit mentia formed a mouth in her underside but what do you want with a cat she asked it has two catseye gems the ball replied grabbing for the cats eyes it changed hastily back into the pillar what is this billy jack asked stepping up to the edge of the pit dont get so close mentia cried she was too late the edge gave way and the man fell into the pit his feet came down on top of the metal ball then there was an explosion gems coins and creatures were hurled out of the pit mentia jetted across to intercept billy jack in midflight became a huge soft pillow and cush ioned his crash landing what was that he asked dazedly as everything settled she resumed her normal form as he got off her obvi ously a mine didnt you hear it yelling mine mine as it collected things but mines are very touchy and you made it detonate now stay out of trouble until i get you where im taking you ill try billy jack said contritely they went on now they came to a glade with a single acom tree in it the tree looked healthy but seemed to have suffered recently thats desirees tree mentia said now i know were on course she owns the tree billy jack asked not exactly shes the nymph of the tree hiatus should be close by for she had been here before she raised her voice desiree a rather pretty nymph appeared by the tree who calls me the demoness mentia halfway sane i was here last year why so you were desiree said remembering with the sorceress and the gargoyle and the child you brought me hiatus piers anthony yes im just passing by this time she glanced at the man this is billy jack who im taking to see richard white then to billy this is desiree dryad if her tree suffers she suffers so nice to meet you billy jack said politely evidently somewhat bemused by it all did you see a man and a woman pass by here shortly ago mentia asked yes they had a quarrel with a timber wolf but managed to get away she gestured toward a nearby tree that looked a bit bedraggled its normally very shy and will raise a human cub if it finds one orphaned but with the madness it sometimes gets violent so when the barbarian made a bar baric remark i understand mentia said i see your tree is looking betterand so are you yes thanks to hiatus she agreed hes off gathering croakusses at the moment crocuses billy jack asked well he likes to eat frogs legs desiree said disap provingly the croaks do cuss when he takes them we must move on mentia said anxious about losing threnody do you think the madness will pass soon this is close to the border now mentia said its still slowly contracting maybe in another year what a relief they went on and this time managed to reach the white glade without too much further adventure mentia saw threnody just leaving it going deeper into the madness but she couldnt pursue threnody right at the moment clusters of colored mushrooms sprouted around the yard beside each cluster was a small garden of fancy iris flowers mentia nodded she knew that the mushrooms had sprouted from jars of odd mundane paper money richard had buried around the yard and that the irises grew wherever the woman roc and a hard place janet hines went if the two ever separated so would the mushrooms and irises she knocked on the door of the neat cottage a man an swered hello richard remember me im d mentia the temporarily sane demoness i have brought another richard fresh from mundania who i think could use your help a woman appeared behind richard oh yes of course well help him she said we understand so well mentia turned to billy jack these folk will help you all you need she said i have to move on now but you can trust them theyll get you settled but im not staying here billy jack protested i need to find my way home my wife my daughter richard white stepped out and took his arm come in side he said this is my wife janet im afraid we have unsettling news for you mentia freed of the temporary obligation her better halfs conscience had taken on moved rapidly after threnody she knew what had happened to billy jack but hadnt wanted to tell him he would not be returning to mundania richard and janet had been through it already so would be able to guide him past the madness to his new life she caught up to threnody and jordan who had paused in a glade that seemed clear of mad effects obviously they were not eager to plunge into more madness especially since they hadnt succeeded in losing mentia by coming here she approached i know the madness better than you do she said im mentia metrias worser half im nor mally a little crazy but im sane here i suggest to you that you would be best advised to cease this futile flight and take the summons token no threnody cried i think you are unduly hung up on what metria did four hundred and thirtyeight years ago you would be better off to forget it instead of holding an impossible grudge no did it ever occur to you that she has a side too piers anthony no mentia considered let me offer you a deal lets ex plore the two sides of it to see which makes more sense then i will guide you out of the region of madness and leave you alone threnody was about to say no again but jordan cau tioned her when it came to wild action the barbarian had pretty good sense so she considered guide us out first no we need the madness for this but i will give you my word your word was never any good on the contrary mentia said evenly metria has al ways told the truth and so have i it is one of our foibles thats not true jordan nudged her again barbarians had solid instincts about such things and though they could be totally foolish about women they could generally tell whether other crea tures were trustworthy since the woman jordan was foolish about was threnody he was reasonably objective about mentia very well threnody said through her teeth two sides then you guide us out and leave us alone but her mind is closedmetria protested shes just us ing this to get out of accepting the token of course mentia replied sanely but she may change her mind shell never change her mind she hates me this is the region of madness where odd truths come out i have had experience play it through and perhaps you both will be surprised metria amazed by the assurance and sanity of her crazy worser self which was not at all true to form subsided men tia had access to all her memories and experience so was competent to do whatever it was she had in mind first we shall play it through your way mentia said to threnody we shall need jordans participation jordan jumped mine roc and a hard place you knew king gromden didnt you yes just before he died he was a good old boy you will play his part i will i dont know how the madness will guide you just go along with it jordan shrugged intrigued okay itll be fun to be a king mentia turned to threnody you will play the queens part you do remember her yes threnody agreed tightly and i will play the part of the demoness you should be very good at that threnody said with such an edge that jordan flinched as if he had been cut though the barb had not been directed at him mentia ignored the thrust bear in mind that we must all reenact the truth as we perceive it that is first as you per ceive it second as i perceive it we will each be true to the scenario we are playing threnody looked sharply at her you really believe that something will come of this yes shall we proceed threnody shrugged then i will set the scene mentia said it is the year of xanth six fiftyseven in the countryside near castle roogna gromden has been king for thirty four years he is married but his wife is cold it was a marriage made for political reasons he is a good man a very good man threnody said but fallible as mortal men are he is not yet aware of it but there is something missing from his life that is joy as she spoke jordan postured emulating the king and the madness closed in and gave him the aspect of the king middlingold pudgy yet possessed of authority one day as gromden was out reviewing the kingdom learning how well things were doing by touching stones and posts and other incidental items and using his talent to im piers anthony mediately fathom everything about them he came across a wretched straggler on the road now metria stepped into her part as the scene of medieval xanth formed around them she became the wretched strag gler cloaked and hooded and hunched the king paused in the center of the road he was a stun ningly rich figure in his quality clothing compared to the creature before him may i help you good woman he inquired for he was never arrogant the figure looked wearily at him and recognized his status your majesty dont bother with me she said kneeling and bowing her head i am only a mere outcast from my village in sore need of help and protection not fit to bother the likes of you come come now my dear he said graciously ill be the judge of that what is your problem king my father sought to marry me to the village lout rather than suffer that indignity for i am smart and there are those who call me fair i fled my otherwise excellent home but no other family would take me in or give me succor so i had to depart the village also it was the same in neighboring villages no one respects a willful child now i am a stranger far from home who dares not return and who is grievously weary and footsore from traveling and foraging about the countryside i wish only to find a com patible place to live and in due course to find a good man to marry but in every village it is only the louts who pursue me you poor girl the king said sympathetically let me get a look at you he lifted back her cowl and lo she was black of hair and eye and fine of feature a beautiful young woman he looked at her body and now saw that under the rough cloak was the stuff to madden a mans mind every curve and point of her caused his fancy to see the likeness of storks taking wing as if imperatively summoned she was indeed the loveliest creature he had ever seen the seed of his undoing was planted in that moment roc and a hard place she lifted her large eyes to glance briefly at his face then lowered them demurely king i am unworthy of your attention i will depart forthwith perhaps to sustenance in yonder field i apologize for soiling your view with my as pect but the king was generous quite all right my dear no need to go to the field it would have been a shame to see you married to a lout far be it from me to see the least of my subjects in dire want there is a royal station house near the next village which is currently unoccupied i will install you there until you can find a better situation tears of purest gratitude welled in her perfect eyes how can i ever thank you for this great kindness your maj esty never in my wildest and most foolish dreams did i ever imagine that any such thing would come to pass tut none of that he said and took her by her delicate elbow and guided her to the station house it was in a shel tered spot just out of sight of the road and was well ap pointed for normally a small detachment of the kings guards occupied it but in the past decade the need for such activity had diminished or perhaps the kingship was losing its power gromden was a nice man rather than an imperious one and had little use for guards or indeed for force thus this was a relic of a more imperial age make yourself comfortable here and i will check on you next week to be sure you are all right he turned to go oh but do not leave me so soon she pleaded touching his arm to turn him back she breathed deeply as she re moved her cloak so that her fine bosom heaved i havent yet thanked you for your extreme kindness to me no thanks is necessary he said i am glad merely to have been able to help my lord but you have done so very much for me she said if i may presume she stood up on her tiptoes and kissed him with surprising firmness on the mouth the king reeled as if clobbered on the nogginand he had been in a fashion he had never before experienced piers anthony anything half as sweet and potent as this this girl seemed to be about granddaughterly age yet there was something compellingly mature about her king are you dizzy she asked concerned come lie down for a moment on this bed and i will do my utmost to care for you i would never knowingly cause you mis chief king gromden was indeed dizzy but not from any inca pacity of mind or body her kiss had simply been so sweet as to awaken in him all manner of notions that had never gotten close to him before he suffered himself to be brought to the bed and laid upon it while his newly discovered fan cies danced in circles all around his awareness perhaps your clothing is too tight your majesty she said loosening his collar and then his shirt oh no no need to he protested weakly but she continued and somehow he discovered himself under a sheet with her and she had nothing more on than he did then did the storks indeed take notice for soon such a signal went out as no such bird could have ignored he had been made deliriously happy in the morning somewhat ashamed for his weakness of the night king gromden got up hastily dressed and left the lovely girl sleeping in the bed he had never before done anything like this he hurried back to castle roogna and went about his business with utmost dispatch he tried to forget the affair but such was the illicit appeal of what had happened that in the evening he found himself walking back to the station house nominally to see how the girl was doing love of her burdened his heart and he simply could not stay away yet when he came to the house he discovered it empty with nothing touched it was as if there had never been a woman there she was gone dispirited he returned to the castle every day for a month he went to the house but it remained devastatingly empty he realized that the girl had had whatever she had wanted roc and a hard place of him that one night and would never return so he resumed his dull kingly life trying to forget that single dreamlike night of bliss unknown to him a stork visited the mysterious damsel less than a year after their contact she had hidden herself but the canny bird had located her regardless and delivered its bundle then when the king was at supper with the queen and some prominent visitors the woman appeared carrying a bundle here is your bastard baby adulterous king she cried and dumped the bundle in his lap and know simpleton with what you have sundered your marriage vow she flew into the air dissolved into a cloud of laugh ing gas and vanished as all shocked eyes turned to gromden the laughter echoed for a long time as they stared thus did the foul demoness befuddle seduce and humil iate the decent king the slow deterioration of his power swiftened and before long castle roogna was like an empty shell the queen of course would have nothing more to do with him and he was a laughingstock throughout xanth yet such was his goodness that he made no excuses he recognized the baby as his own and set out to raise her as a princess indeed she became the apple of his eye the one he loved best and she loved him but the queen outraged by the situation finally put a curse on the child if she re mained in castle roogna the castle would fall so the girl now about ten years old and as dawningly pretty as her mother had been fled the castle she refused to be the un doing of the castle as she had been of her beloved father this broke king gromdens heart he banished the queen and lived alone thereafter with only a maid to tend to the castle he searched constantly for his daughter hoping somehow to get around the curse but she being half de moness readily eluded him though she loved him until years later she found love in an entirely different story died became a ghost and was revived about four hundred years later to rejoin her lover meanwhile poor king gromden piers anthony slowly declined into death and castle roogna was deserted all because of the wicked demoness the reenactment ended and i still want nothing to do with you mother threnody concluded you destroyed my beloved father with the crudest of lies and i can never forgive that jordan was startled metria is your mother you never told me of course i didnt threnody said angry tears in her eyes im ashamed of half my parentage that half she glared at mentia trying to get to metria see metria said its hopeless she will always hate me now we shall have the other view mentia said firmly back to square one do we have to threnody grumped through her angry tears yes we made a deal for both views we shall have them the scene formed again king gromden marching down the road the cloaked and hooded demoness meeting him the dialogue played out as before except that the demoness began to be genuinely impressed with the kings manner and goodness of heart she lacked soul or conscience yet was curious about the latter so what had originally been inciden tal mischief became something else she saw how lonely the king was beneath his contented exterior and resolved to give him some reward for it one night of the kind of joy only a demoness or a really devoted beautiful woman could give a man she thought he deserved at least that much on the following day he visited her again so she gave him delight again for she still respected and liked him as much as a demoness could so it continued for some time in perfect privacy she was glad at last to have brought joy into his somewhat sterile life of course in time he caught on to her nature but by then it didnt matter because he found such delight in her when on rare occasion some roc and a hard place mischance threatened to expose their liaisons she quickly and quietly vanished away so that there could be no evi dence returning to him only when it was safe thus no other person learned of their affair but she made one mistake she forgot about the stork normally a demoness prevented the signal from getting out to find the stork but she was so taken with the nice king that she never even noticed the escaping signal when she realized it was too late well she thought she would just have to find a suitable home for the baby when it came because a demoness was no fit mother for a human baby for one thing the baby would probably have a soul while she didnt when the stork actually brought a beautiful baby girl the demoness was so taken with her that she almost decided to keep her after all but she knew that would be folly and she didnt want her daughter to suffer the neglect that was bound to occur in the company of a demoness so she did the next best thing she brought the child to her father the king she did this of course in decent privacy so as to avoid embarrassing him king here is your darling daughter she informed him presenting him with the bundle i wish i could keep her myself but i cant so i trust you to treat her well and give her all the things a precious child needs gromden was amazed in the typical manner of men he had assumed that he had gone through the motions but that the summons would not reach the stork but one look at the baby captivated him and he was glad to accept her and rec ognize her as his own she will be my heir he said for i have no children this was fond illusion because only a magician could be king of xanth but her magic talent was as yet unknown so there was always the chance that she would be a sorceress of course the kingship was tradition ally limited to men for archaic obsolete reasons and those were the hardest reasons to refute and she was half demon ess which would complicate her eligibility further but piers anthony gromden postponed those concerns until later and mean while doted on his daughter i think i must not visit you anymore the demoness said to the king for demons are known to be bad influences on children and your daughter must have only the best in fluences sadly the king agreed so they kissed once more and parted the demoness lacked true human feelings but a few of them had rubbed off on her during her association with the king and so it would be fair to say she emulated a feeling or two in that time she would have liked to continue with the king and did visit her daughter a number of times taking care never to make her presence known thus she was aware of what was going on in castle roogna though she did not interfere gromden named his daughter threnody because soon her talent of sad singing showed he provided every possible thing for her including tutoring playmates and every kind of pastry and pie she had a nursemaid to look after her but he could not provide her with a mother t the queen took an interest she was of course resentfull of the presence of the child because the child was evidence of the kings infidelity the queen had no interest in that i sort of relationship with the king but it was embarrassing to have it generally known that he had found a relationship elsewhere but for a time she masked her enmity and grom den assuming that others had the same generosity of spirit i that he did did not realize how bitter she was j the queen took a hand in educating the child the first thing you must understand she told little threnody is the foulness of your origin your father was cruelly seduced by a hideous demoness who somehow made him think she was beautiful then she embarrassed him in public by bringing you so that everyone would know his folly and the child believed it but dont speak of this to your father the queen continued for he has already suffered more than enough and it would hurt him to be reminded of it so the roc and a hard place child was careful never to reveal what she had learned to gromden but as the years passed threnody showed distinct signs of becoming beautiful indeed she was the juvenile image of the form her mother had assumed to seduce the king gromden of course treated her exactly the way a father should treat a daughter not quite realizing the significance of her image but the queen couldnt stand it so finally she acted she put a terrible curse on the child forcing her to depart the castle forever when the king discovered this he banished the queen also but the damage was done the vision ended gromden reverted to jordan the queen reverted to threnody and the beautiful child reverted to little woe betide who then became mentia threnody seemed shaken i remember now the queen did tell me that and i never questioned it of course she had a bad motive still it was wrong of you to seduce the king my presence did weaken his image i was his eurse no you werent jordan protested you were the delight of his later life his life was empty until you filled it he having just emulated the role of king gromden was in a position to know the demoness did him a real favor it was the jealous queen who made the mischief threnody having emulated the queen now understood that but the belief of four centuries did not dissipate readily ill have to think about this now i will show you out of the madness and depart mentia said but she hasnt taken the token metria protested stifle it better half soft sell does it the demoness led the way out of the madness during her pauses in the vision mainly while the queen was poisoning the mind of the child she had scouted around and found the best route the only obstacle here is the peer pressure she said you simply have to resist it jordan looked around a pier but theres no water then the pressure began they were squeezed from either piers anthony side by invisible ramps not pier peer mentia clarified the things of madness are peering at us trying to make us go their way they want us to be as mad as they are they cant touch us physically but they can peer so hard that it feels solid she tapped the solid seeming invisible shape beside her and it made a dull wooden sound just ignore it but its squeezing the breath from me jordan gasped peer pressure can be very strong mentia agreed she wasnt suffering because she had made herself too gaseous for the pressure to affect very much and threnody was more slowly doing the same threnody could change forms in the manner of a demoness being a crossbreed but this took time so she was under more pressure just say no mentia ad vised them no no with that the pressure eased because peering was difficult when the objects of its cynosure didnt cooperate they were able to pull themselves on through they stepped out of the madness and back into regular xanth ill know better than to go there again threnody said relieved i dont know jordan said i sort of liked being a king and making out with that threnody drew her knife and with one swift deft motion cut off his tongue that silenced him for a while because though his talent was rapid healing it took time to grow his tongue back to full size things had returned to normal curse well it is time for me to depart mentia said paus ing artfully um wait threnody said im not saying that i forgive you for the dastardly thing you did but arent you going to try to make me accept that summons yes metria said silently no that wasnt part of the deal mentia said but its crazy not to pursue your advantage when im wavering thank you i am a little crazy im sure that mysterious trial will be able to proceed without your surely significant participation the demoness made as if to puff into smoke maybesome other deal threnody asked i suppose if you think thats fair you know what i want is there something you really want yes what i most desire is to be able to return to castle piers anthony roogna where i was happy once without it falling to walk through the familiar old rooms and meet the people who are there now a tear formed at one eye or the other to remember how it was with my father to view him on the tapestry that last was ironic because as a child threnody could have viewed recent and current events on the tapestry and learned the truth about her mother but she had been so sure she already knew it that she had never done so very well mentia said briskly i shall see about abat ing that curse i shall return she popped off what are you doing metria asked as they appeared back at their home castle how can we abate a fourhundredyear old curse that was a crazy deal to make thank you maybe there is a way what way i dont feel free to tell you what im your better half i can get it directly from your crazy mind then it wouldnt work metria baffled backed off she had never been able to conceal anything from mentia but mentia could hide things from her whenever she wanted to metria had been grudg ingly impressed by her worser halfs handling of the madness and threnody maybe mentia actually did know how to lift the curse yes now you must take over the body and do what i tell you dont question me just do it bemused metria took over so what do you want me to do stoke up your husband for another days worth then check for the least familiar name in your bag of tokens so metria did both heres one i dont recognize at all phelra shes a witness serve her summons next but she could be way off in some hidden hinterland and take more time to locate than any number of regular folk roc and a hard place good do it metria sighed and held up phelras token it tugged in the general direction of central xanth she popped across the terrain in that direction appearing in the deepest jungle north of lake ogrechobee she lifted the token again and its tug was stronger she popped off for a shorter hop in its direc tion and landed near a house beside a wooded mountain the token tugged toward the house so she went to knock on the door in a moment it opened a young woman of undistinguished features stood there but i didnt summon you she said surprised should you have metria asked similarly surprised who was summoning whom my talent is to summon animals to help me the woman explained but it doesnt work on demons i came here on my own to summon you metria said if you are phelra she held up the token summon me what for for the trial of roxanne roc sorry i dont summon birds just animals anyway shes already busy nevertheless she is to be tried within a fortnight can you get to the nameless castle in time i dont think so its not the easiest castle to reach take her to castle roogna first mentia suggested there are some folk going there from castle roogna metria said suppose i guide you there and you can go to the trial with them that would be nice phelra said ive never been to castle roogna and would like to see it if you are sure they wont mind i can take you to princess ida shes very nice and dont tell her talent will surely see that you are comfortable metria fin ished smoothly what was her worser half up to then lets go phelra agreed brightly accepting the to ken ill summon a large animal to transport us piers anthony oh i dont need ride with her but it does sound like fun metria concluded pheira stepped outside and whistled in a moment there was a heavy clopping sound and a really weird creature ap peared it looked like an enormous furry comb with the teeth serving as many little legs and the head of a cat it came to the house and stopped looking at pheira expectantly what kind of animal is this metria inquired she thought she had seen just about everything but this was new to her a catacomb of course pheira said she caught hold of the tail and climbed up to the top where the ridgeback wid ened so that she could bestride it comfortably of course the demoness agreed joining her how ignorant of me not to recognize it immediately take us to castle roogna comb pheira said and the creature obligingly started walking it moved surprisingly swiftly getting through tangles of vegetation without diffi culty leaving no snarls behind it combed through the forest with smooth strokes tell her there used to be a curse on castle roogna men tia said but there is still a just do it so metria did it you know one of the other folk i have to summon had a problem she was under a curse that castle roogna would fall if she ever entered it so she never would come to the castle but its okay now pheira asked concerned well dont deny it but its not true how do you know that metria hesitated she had always accepted the validity of the curse she understood that threnody had once ap proached castle roogna and that it had started to fall but roc and a hard place that had been some time ago and it was possible that the situation had changed maybe that was what mentia was gambling on how long do curses last pheira asked i thought they didnt last longer than the life of the one who makes them is the cursor still alive no she died some time back that must be a relief to your friend pheira said now she can visit castle roogna maybe so metria agreed dubiously why should men tia care what pheira thought the catacomb made excellent time perhaps because of its many springy legs and soon they hove into view of castle roogna they dismounted and the catacomb trotted off glad to get a chance to comb through new territory now introduce her to ida mentia said they passed the moat monster who rose up to challenge the unfamiliar person oh take it easy souffle metria said this is pheira on my summons list oooo hherrr the monster agreed in an iknewthat tone and submerged ida came forward to meet them her little moon glinting as it caught a beam of sunlight and metria performed an other introduction and explanation why of course you can come to the nameless castle withus ida agreed we can ride the two gargoyles up there gargoyles can fly well pheira asked surprised for she had seen how solid the creatures were and how small their wings were im sure they can for this very special trip ida said well get a flying centaur to make us and them light enough and if ida believed it was so it was so metria knew for her talent was the idea pheira looked around this is such a nice castle im glad the curse is off it piers anthony the curse ida asked and her moon seemed perplexed too going to halfphase the one that prevented threnody from coming here metria explained oh that curse is gone ida asked how nice now threnody can visit suddenly metria grasped the crazy ipgic of her crazy worser self pheira didnt know idas talent and ida didnt know that pheira had no true source of information now ida believed that the curse was goneso it was gone be cause what ida believed was true as long as the source of her idea was from someone who didnt know her magic this was such a devious demented ploy that no one else would believe it so metria didnt try to explain it yes she said i will bring her here now she left ida to show pheira to her room in the castle and popped back to where she had left threnody it didnt take long to locate her though it was now evening because threnody was no longer trying to avoid her jordans tongue had grown mostly back though he spoke with a lisp threnody was constantly cutting him it was her way of showing him affection metria was sure threnody had other ways to show him affection when she chose she was after all half demoness but he was a barbarian so he related well to tough love i think we have nullified that curse metria said i think you can visit castle roogna now threnody gazed at her i am not sure i believe you im not quite sure i believe it myself metria confessed lets go there and see it will take several days to get there afoot threnody pointed out and metria couldnt afford that time she still had a dozen and a half tokens to serve maybe a thentaur jordan lisped that gave metria a notion she had two winged centaurs roc and a hard place on her list they were too young to carry such burdens but if the grown ones helped ill be back she said and popped off to the centaurs stall this was a comfortable house in a glade north of the gap chasm the centaur family was at supper a winged stallion a winged mare and a winged filly their huge wings were folded resembling capes across their bodies i would ask you to join us chex centaur said she was a fine full figured creature but i know you dont eat metria why are you here cheiron centaur asked directly he was an impressive centaur in both his human and equine portions i have summonses for che and cynthia summonses metria explained the situation gee cynthia said she was a filly of about ten not quite verging onto maredom i get to serve on a jury che is not here chex said he is with chief gwenny goblin at goblin mountain he is her companion metria already knew about the companion bit but had the wit not to say so ill go there soon to serve him his sum mons but meanwhile there is something else i wonder if i could prevail on you for a favor chex smiled your soul becomes you metria you are so polite now what do you wish i think we may have abated threnodys curse so that castle roogna wont fall if she goes there i need to get her there soon to see if thats true if it is she will accept the summons i have for her but it will take her and jordan barbarian several days to get there by foot so i was won dering cheiron laughed of course well take them there id love to see if that curse is really gone he looked at chex in the morning in the morning when its light chex agreed well deliver cynthia there at the same time piers anthony thank you metria give them directions for jordan and threnodys location though she expected to be there to guide them anyway then she popped over to goblin moun tain to serve che his token and tell him where his family was going goblin mountain looked like a giant anthill but a pretty one because the goblins had become aesthetic since gwenny became their first female chief there were flower beds on the terraces and the guards were garbed in pastel colors she landed in front of the main entrance halt demon ess the guard said he glanced around to see if anyone else was within earshot and if you know whats good for you youll get your smoky posterior elsewhere fast we dont need your kind here too bad snootface mentia replied evenly im here to see the chiefs companion that piece of horsemeats overdue for the pot the guard muttered in fact the chief should be dunked right in there with him shes ruining the tribe ill tell her you said so metria said sweetly whats your name bigmouth suddenly the guard was surprisingly shy never mind go on in metria smiled goblin men were the dregs of xanth mean of spirit and foul of mouth they hated the notion of having a woman as chief but they were stuck with it and as a result goblin mountain and the surrounding territory were prospering instead of being a core of outrage the goblin enclave had become a center of justice and prosperity soon she located gwenny goblin who was at her supper in the main dining hall che centaur was beside her metria knew what few others did gwenny was slightly lame of ankle and slightly weak of visionfaults that would get her promptly executed if the male goblins ever learned of them but special contact lenses not only corrected her vision they enabled her to see dreams giving her an uncanny insight into plots against her and her companion enabled her to roc and a hard place conceal any physical or mental lapse because che was a centaur albeit a young one his advice was always excellent and the chief always heeded it they were an admirable team why hello demoness metria che said spying her he was careful to introduce any newcomers aloud so that gwenny was never embarrassed by missing them gwenny looked quickly up she was a nice and lovely dark young woman as most goblin girls were in contrast to the crude and ugly goblin men one day she would marry and make some goblin man undeservedly happy but so far she had been way too busy reorganizing the goblin property and hierarchy to concern herself with anything like that she was eighteen she had a little time yet to worry about her social life so nice to see you metria she said to what do we owe the pleasure of this appearance i have to serve che with a summons as a juror metria said and explained and you chief gwenny as a wit ness roxanne roc on trial che said thoughtfully as he ac cepted his token and read it that should be most interest ing it seems hard to believe that she could be guilty of any crime she doesnt know why herself metria said shes busy hatching that fancy egg which is due any month now she hasnt gone anywhere this is certainly peculiar gwenny agreed who is charging her with a crime the simurgh now i am really interested che said spreading his wings a bit with excitement that big bird is not one for incidental mischief just so long as both of you are there in a fortnight minus a day who else will be there gwenny inquired just about everyone of any current percentage any current what piers anthony compensation indemnification remuneration remit tance stipend interest whatever metria agreed crossly magician trent sor ceress iris grey murphy princess ida demon prof gross clout not princess ivy gwenny asked alertly shes not on my list its grey as prosecutor and ida as defense attorney grey and ida che said thoughtfully just as her worser self mentia had before working opposite each other sup pose she gets an idea she wouldnt do that gwenny said firmly then less firmly would she how long have grey and ivy been betrothed metria asked nine years che said promptly centaurs always had their facts and figures straight they were affianced the year after i was foaled good thing they werent your parents metria remarked innocently and gwenny stifled an unchiefly giggle do you think they are ever going to get on with it no i think they are waiting for the sun and the moon to collide first che said trying to look serious gwenny made a conspiratorial wink maybe we can en courage them i understand that ivys parents took some time in that respect too eight years che said until their friends held a wedding party for them in the cemetery catching magician dor by surprise are you two thinking what im thinking metria asked both che and gwenny immediately put on straight faces of course not che said centaurs dont conspire but if professor grossclout will be there gwenny said and hes competent to marry a couple he married me to veleno metria agreed because he wanted to be sure i got what was coming to me roc and a hard place who knows what might happen coincidentally che finished the expression on his face might have been mis interpreted as smugness were he not a centaur so anyway metria concluded cynthia centaur will be there too and your folks are going to take jordan the barbarian and threnody to castle roogna tomorrow i thought you might be interested in joining them threnody cant go to castle roogna che said thats what makes it interesting bye she popped off she loved doing that leaving them with something truly tan talizing they would have to come to castle roogna to see it happen she arrived where she had left jordan and threnody they were camped out in the open barbarian style beside a per fectly even symmetree gazing up at the stars metria looked up and saw that some crazy constellations were forming over the region of madness that made sense cheiron and chex centaur have agreed to carry you to castle roogna tomorrow she announced theyll be here at dawn when you see them fly overhead shout so they can find you okay jordan said his tongue seemed to have healed the rest of the way it was an interesting relation those two had with her violence and his healing i wonder if she ever cuts off anything else mentia mused when shes indisposed for love metria popped home and made sure her husband was still suitably delirious then she settled down to ponder the re maining tokens she still had a number of folk to find and though she had plenty of time she knew that it could quickly dissipate if even one case turned out to be difficult so her best course seemed to be to tackle the next most awkward folk on her list the two mundanes dug and kirn assuming she could even reach them was there a way they had en tered xanth before through screens and and there was her way she would have to approach corn pewter the evil machine next and hope he cooperated he piers anthony was supposed to be a good machine now but she didnt quite trust that fortunately the hour didnt matter the machine didnt sleep at night so she popped off to pewters cave bypassing the invis ible giant who helped drive people into the cave the glass screen was there as usual propped up amidst pewter and crockery it certainly didnt look like much hello evil machine she said ive got something for you the screen brightened print appeared on it a greeting wordimpacted demoness wordwhatted bound constrained constipated confused cha grined mortified whatever she agreed crossly do you have what i need that depends on what you need i need dieodes for my circuits you need dead poets for your circus the screen flickered wamingly no ignoramus i also could use a dterminal what kind of termite the screen nickered again rr dtermines what i can do i am trying to get upgraded well dont upchuck on me machine the screen faded for a moment while the numbers through zipped rapidly across it several times then it got control of itself you are the only creature who comes close to annoying me despite my lack of emotion what do you have for me thats more like it evil machine heres your sum mons she held out the token marked corn pewter demoness changes mind about serving summons the screen printed oops shed forgotten how the contraption controlled re ality in its vicinity she withdrew the token having changed her mind roc and a hard place but she was no ordinary demoness mentia took over the body she hadnt changed her mind listen you bucket of bolts she said you cant ignore this summons its from demoness ceases dialogue and of course she did but she had one more chance woe betide appeared please illustrious machine the tyke pleaded the simurgh will be annoyed if you arent thereshe wants an entity of true competence some one completely rational to serve on the jury in contrast to the mush the screen nickered the simurgh yes marvelous contraption its such an honor to be selected by her for this trial only the very most special folk are on the list and trial roxanne roc is on trial and what for nobody but the simurgh knows sapient device but it must be very super duper extra important because demon professor grossclout is the judge and magician trent is the bailiff and give me that summons the artful moppet seemed to hesitate are you sure puissant cipher i would never want to impose on a thing of your vasty importance corn pewter lost patience cunning tyke delivers sum mons the screen printed obediently woe betide set the token beside the screen and do you think you just might maybe possibly consider about helping me fetch in two other summonsees astute apparatus i think only you can do it perspicacious mech anism the evil machine was evidently not deceived about the childs nature and flattery but decided to be tolerant after all the adult conspiracy had its softer aspects such as treat ing plaintive waifs with consideration what two others piers anthony they are the mundanes dug and kim who played the game of companions three years ago oh yes the screen remembered he is a jerk but she is tolerable what have they to do with this trial they are summoned for jury duty too phenomenal entity the gamine explained i must fetch them in but i cant go outside xanth the screen reflected for a moment woe betide saw her image there this is not necessarily feasible the mun danes did arrive in xanth through electronic screens but they were playing the demons game they still play that game but not often it may be several months before we have only a fortnight the cherub wailed a large tear forming the machine almost seemed to have an emotion i regret i am unable to ensure their participation i can con trol reality here in my demesne and bring them in through my screen if they enter that game but i can not make them play that game isnt there some other way grandiose artifact woe betide pleaded so cute and distressed that her aspect might have melted silicon stop that the screen printed blurring around the edges there may be an alternate way thank you magnificent creation what is it there is an old centaur of magician caliber whose talent is to generate an aisle of magic outside xanth or an aisle of nonmagic within xanth if you enlist his aid you will be able to go into mundania to fetch your two summonsees an aisle of magic in mundania the tot asked duly amazed fantastic intellect how is this possible he is a very special centaur the discovery of hjs talent caused him to be exiled from centaur isle be cause the centaurs there do not approve of magic other than as a separate tool to be used at need in roc and a hard place fact they find it obscene dm higher life forms thus they tolerate magic talents in humans which are not all that high on the scale but not in themselves this is analogous to the attitude of human beings toward stork summoning thus this particular centaur lives isolated from his culture and does not seek notori ety a close observer might have detected just a hint of bore dom in the childish mien as if she already knew much of this fortunately the machine was not observing closely at the moment being more interested in showing off his knowl edge to the amazed tad exceptional appurtenance who is this centaur and where is he now he is arnolde and he resides somewhere in central xanth but he is intolerably old and probably not up to a journey to mundania but then he is of no use to me the little girl said irri tably then catching herself she added illustrious mon itor perhaps you will be able to prevail on the good ma gician to rejuvenate him for the occasion and on someones cat to locate him that was what she needed thanks flatface she said and popped out of the cave leaving only a dirty noise be hind she reverted to metria as she appeared by her home castle however it was too late in the night to go after jenny elf who was the one with the cat who could find anything except home the night it was now coming onto wee morning corn pewter must have jumped time ahead or put her on hold while he considered how to proceed she had been playing the machine along but it seemed that the machine had been doing the same thing back to her well that was what made such encounters fun so she popped across to the brink of madness where jor dan and threnody were just getting up sure enough three piers anthony winged centaurs were arriving from the northwest and an other from the northeast they all landed together in the glade beside jordan and threnody the one from the northeast was che and he was carrying gwenny goblin he was not yet mature at age ten but gwenny was not very heavy so he was able to lighten and support her the others were cheiron chex and cyn thia in a moment the mature centaurs nicked jordan and thren ody with their tails making them light then the two mounted jordan on cheiron threnody on chex all four centaurs spread their wings and leaped into the air stroking strongly they gained elevation then turned west toward castle roogna it was a pretty sightone metria might not have appreciated aesthetically before she got halfsouled in a time and several moments they reached the castle and came to land they stood and watched as jordan and thren ody walked slowly toward the castle princess ida came to the front gate garbed in a fittingly princessly robe and waited similarly it looked as if her moon had been washed for the occasion souffle the moat monster lifted his head from the brine and oriented on the scene they all knew the significance of this occurrence all eyes were on threnody the woman was elegantly dressed very pretty in a dark gown her black hair spreading downward and outward like a cape her demonly ancestry made it possible for her to assume what aspect she chose so of course she was beau tiful but she was also nervous because for more than four hundred years she had been unable to come near this edifice lest it collapse she was plainly in doubt about the abatement of the curseand so were the others but there was no way to verify it except to go to the castle she came to the end of the lowered drawbridge she paused then nerved herself and put one small foot on the bridge there was a shudder and a rumble souffle jumped craning his head around as if afraid a huge roc and a hard place stone was about to fall on it metrias half soul sank down to her knees aw shucks its only an invisible giant jordan said i can smell him sure enough the faint stench of giant soon wafted across the shuddering continued as the giant walked on past in the near distance then faded threnody tried again this time there was no reaction as she put first one foot then the other on the planking she walked slowly across the bridge gazing nervously at the cas tle ahead when she reached the inner side of the moat ida stepped up to embrace her i just knew it was all right she said im not in the castle proper yet threnody said tightly then come on in ida said taking her hand the two walked on through the great front door in perfect silence jordan followed glancing up a bit apprehensively he had once tried to carry threnody into the castle and almost brought it down when it was clear that the castle was not about to fall everyone else took a breath then they all hurried to catch up this is the throne room ida said where where my father king gromden used to sit on the throne and hold me in his lap threnody said remember ing he told me that one day i would sit there her face clouded but of course he didnt know what would hap pen they moved on here is the courtyard ida said where the roses of roogna grow she paused but thren ody didnt comment metria knew why rose of roogna had brought the magic roses centuries after the castle had been deserted long after king gromdens time so threnody had never seen them the roses represent a test of true love so great care must be used when invoking them they went on visiting all the historic chambers of the ancient castle until they came to the one where the great piers anthony magic tapestry hung on the wall oh yes i spent many happy hours watching this threnody exclaimed it shows all the history of xanth sometimes i even dreamed i was there part of the great adventures of the past me too ida murmured and her moon bobbed she glanced at threnody and the two exchanged a smile the tour concluded with the room assigned to threnody there had been no rumble of protest from any of the stones or timbers the curse had indeed been abated then threnody began to weep jordan fetched her a hand kerchief somewhat out of sorts like any barbarian he had no idea what to do with a crying woman but they were not tears of pain or grief but of relief threnody had finally returned to the home of her childhood her fondest wish had been realized then she turned to metria her face shining wet and held out her hand metria put the summons token into it but threnody was accepting more than the token mother she said in a way she had never done before this time the cutting bitterness was gone she caught me trias hand and drew her in for a hug mother i forgive you any wrong i thought you did me or my father will you forgive me for my attitude suddenly the weight of metrias soul pressed her down and then released her for centuries she hadnt cared what her daughter thought and indeed had seldom if ever even thought of her but her soul changed all that and now she wanted more than anything else to have that relationship now her own eyes were streaming yes yes my daughter yes she said not caring how foolish it might sound then they were crying together while the others stood in a circle and watched and no one was embarrassed two curses had actually been lifted the one on the castle and the one on their relationship i think we have seen enough cheiron said cynthia will remain here until it is time for the trial but we must return home roc and a hard place we will remain here also che said the trip has al ready proved worthwhile he glanced at cynthia who though she was only ten managed to blush metria had to agree contest but metria could not stay to appreciate the joy at the castle she had plenty of other business to see to she needed to summonsserve the two mundanes kim and dug and to do that she needed to find amolde centaur and get him rejuvenated and to do that she needed to find jenny elf and her cat who could find anything so how could she find jenny elf well jenny had served as a companion in the game that had brought the two mundanes to xanth metria herself had participated in that game she remembered the rehearsals and preparations supervised by professor grossclout after the game the various parties had gone their various ways but grossclout surely knew where every one of them was so she would ask him she resolved this time not to let him get to her she would be her normal indifferent self no matter what roc and a hard place no sooner thought than done she popped across to the demon caves there was the professor breaking in a new class but if you survive he thundered at the rows of mushy demon faces before him you just may wind up thinking like real demons he glowered evidently doubting that such a thing was possible the students were obviously cowed horsed sheeped and pigged daring neither peep nor poop in response only grosssclout was able to manage that it was his talent to intimidate those who could not be intim idated metria nerved herself and broke the tense silence hey profwheres jenny elf the glower cracked around the edges wisps of smoke rose from the professors glowing eyeballs what are you doing here again he demanded shaking with indignity in fact the whole classroom shook with it heyit was working she was actually resisting his in timidation but she knew she had to hang on to her attitude because if she ever lost it she would never recover it oh did i interrupt something sorry about that her conscience required her to apologize when she transgressed and it was hard to be in grossclouts presence without developing a feeling of transgressing come into my office demoness he said with a calm fraught with such menace as to be terrifying sure prof she popped in shoring up her weak knees with metallic bracing he popped in after her now to what do i owe the dis pleasure of this intrusion demoness he demanded the mo ment his glower softened enough to allow the words out even your mushmind must know better than to interrupt one of my classeswhich you have now done twice she shored up her spine stiffened her jaw and spoke you know that trial the one youre going to judge of course i know that trial you exasperating creature i have scheduled it into my calendar well you do want all the jurors there dont you piers anthony i want every creature there who is supposed to be there of course why arent you out fetching them all in because i cant find jenny elf do you know where she is of course i know where she is then tell me and ill begone ah the temptation he murmured then his eyes scowled into canniness demoness it is not my chore to locate the folk on your list for you what will you do for me in exchange for that information her aplomb dropped and bounced on the floor she hastily stooped to recover it stretching her miniskirt tight in the process why prof i didnt know you cared you mean all those centuries i flashed my fullfleshed shortskirted legs at you and my translucent wellfilled blouses werent wasted you actually noticed of course i didnt neither did i observe that you wore a different color of panty every day including tasteless candystripe and polkadot with no material in the dots in contrast to the more conservative matching herringbone un dergarments you have on now why should i deign to notice the apparel of a student who never completed one single assignment oh she said disappointed so since you dont want anything interesting of me whats on your potent mind prof his glare focused into a gaze of disturbing intensity i have a son he announced she knew that but had to maintain her pose well then youmust have looked under the skirt of some student de moness once never again eh prof cease your ludicrous efforts to bait me demoness you know my son demon prince vore he consumes others yes i tried to seduce him once but he ate me instead hes a real brute maybe he mistook my candystripe undies for the real thing whats your point prof its not like you to be so mushy about business roc and a hard place she thought he would explode but instead he deflated touche demoness you may indeed have the ability to accomplish my desire no i cantharangue a formerly selfrespecting class into a mound of quivering mush she said i am speaking of your propensity for aggravation i have not encountered any creature to better you in that respect why thank you prof she said turning pastel pink and to think i achieved it without completing one single assignment and supreme talent must be respected whatever its na ture i want you to exert yourself on behalf of my son i told you when i tried hes young foolish and imperative but its time he matured he is after all about twentythree in human terms which is twentythree hundred in demon terms but whos counting precisely i think the only thing that will settle him down is marriage now wait prof im already married yes i remember i performed the ceremony and you knew id get halfsouled and develop a con science love loyalty and all that she said accusingly that id be hopelessly tied down by my new awareness of things right proper and decent to be sure and that is what i want for my son her eyes went so round they bowed out of her face oh prof you play dirty your son will rue the day he ever be came related to you naturally and some century he may even squeeze some of the mush from his skull he actually does possess some qualities to be recommended he is honorable handsome intelligent and has fair judgment about things he merely requires seasoning to reduce his natural bloodthirstiness find me a souled woman for him to marry and convince piers anthony him to marry her that is what i want from you you im pertinent tease all thatin exchange for telling me where jenny elf is to be sure id be crazy to make that deal ask your worser self make that deal blockhead mentia said the professor always has something devious in mind you have only to rise to the occasion metria sighed her worser self had good judgment in crazy situations and she would have to trust that agreed so wheres jenny elf in the naga caves whats she doing there after she and nada naga were released from the com panions game they found they liked each other nada invited jenny to stay with them and she accepted she has been there ever since her cat has been useful when the naga wish to locate things such as plaid diamonds now why didnt i think of that myself metria asked rhetorically because your skull is filled with mush now i shall ex pect to see my son ready for marriage within a fortnight great expectations she muttered as she popped off the naga caves were near the lair of draco dragon the naga maintained reasonably cordial relations with the dragon having a common enemy in the local goblin horde eventu ally gwenny goblin of goblin mountain would extend her authority to cover the cave goblins but meanwhile they were their normal obnoxious selves fortunately the naga mutual assistance treaty with the humans had shored up their re sources and the goblins had not been able to make headway against them she popped directly into the throne chamber king nabob was there looking glum he was in his natural form that of a large serpent with a human head he could become a full roc and a hard place serpent or full human in form if he chose to but evidently saw no need to when his natural form was so much better hello your majesty she said im demoness metria looking for jenny elf why so gourd canine he turned his crowned head toward her seeming unsur prised by her appearance probably his daughter had told him about the odd demoness hello metria what kind of emo tion sadness grief affliction lamentation suffering morti fication melancholy whatever she agreed crossly he elected to be roundabout as was the prerogative of senior heavyset kings how is marriage treating you actually thats what brings me here by a devious route that wouldnt interest you well it might you see im entertaining the monsters under my daughters bed while shes out and they really appreciate a good story but your daughters adult she shouldnt have monsters under her bed anymore true but jenny elf does and im old enough to be in my second childhood so fingers now resides under my throne and knuckles joins him there at times oh may i meet them not if youre adult woe betide appeared gee id really like to meet them she said a huge tear welling the king nodded certainly ill introduce you woe here are fingers and knuckles mcpalm monsters this is woe betide a childish demoness two hands flickered brieflyfrom the shadow under the throne bed monsters were very shy in daytime so metria reverted and told him the story and now i need to locate jenny elf so i can serve her with her sum mons and borrow her cat nada tooshes on the jury list as well piers anthony they are off hunting plaid diamonds at the moment but should return soon now i will tell you why i am so fruit dog um glum it is because my daughter the princess is twentysix years old and unmarried and my competence is fading she must marry a prince who can take over the reins and snows of power yet she shows no sign of doing so what of your fine handsome son prince naldo cant he take the snows he married beneath him mind you the merwoman is a fine figure of a woman very fine especially in salt water but not fit to be queen of the naga so nada will have to take up the slack and beguile a suitable prince soon oth erwise our people will lose credence and the goblins will gain confidence and encroach unfortunately princes do not grow on trees and she refuses even to consider any who happen to be younger than she is so she continues to get older while the naga prospects wane metria began to get a glimmer of the devious notion the demon professor had he had known there was a highly eligible princess here how about a demon prince she asked demons are soulless creatures capable of any mischief and not to be trusted suppose one got souled or at least halfsouled why then he would be eligible nabob said surprised but demons seldom have souls because they avoid them knowing their consequence in fact it may be fairly stated that the only likely way to burden a demon with a soul is by trickery such as by marrying a mortal with a soul metria agreed and having one perform the ceremony in such a way that half the mortals soul transfers exactly how did you know i learned the hard way when i married a mortal i thought it was temporary but i changed my mind when i got souled roc and a hard place nabob suddenly was extremely interested you know of a suitable demon prince prince vore professor grossclouts son grossclout wants him married within the fortnight he believes a few decades of marriage would settle the prince down and maybe squeeze a bit of mush from his skull this is fascinating news but i can think of two signif icant objections vore and nada metria said neither will want to marry the other precisely it is not feasible to apply coercive measures to royal scions its bad precedent and makes for negative family relations so im afraid this wont slither yet there must be a way theres always a way to fulfill grossclouts requirement however devious thats how he teaches his classes it is merely necessary to squeeze the mush out and find it i wonder he said thoughtfully it reminds me of something probably irrelevant thats also the way grossclouts examples work i have seen it hundreds of times in the course of ignoring his classes the very thing a mushmind passes over as irrelevant turns out to be the answer this is a story we tell our children about demon inter ference in human relations i believe it actually derives from mundania where the only magic exists in their imagination its called the demons beauty contest but demons can assume any form i am beautiful be cause i choose to be my inner essence is as ugly as ever any beauty contest among our kind would be meaningless true my daughters human form is beautiful for simi lar reason so these demons had a different kind of contest the male demon chose a very handsome mortal prince and the female chose a lovely mortal princess or maybe it was the other way around the judgement was which of the two mortals was better looking but demons wouldnt agree she protested he would piers anthony insist that his mortal was best and she would insist that hers was best demons are extremely unreasonable because their opinions are as malleable as their bodies precisely so they needed a different way to judge the contesta way that did not depend on the opinions of de mons but what would that be they certainly wouldnt accept the opinions of mortals yes they would or they did in the story they brought the two fair mortals together naked and let them judge this is absolutely crazy two mortals who didnt even know each other theyd both run in opposite directions mortals can be very skittish about clothing or the lack of it especially when they are of opposite sexes it was handled in this manner the demons caused the mortals to sleep deeply they put them together then woke them in turns so he got to look at her while she slept and then she got to look at him while he slept naturally the two reacted in certain ways and the one who reacted most to the other was deemed to be the less beautiful thus did the de mons stage and judge their beauty contest metria was thoughtful this is a most intriguing notion are you suggesting that we put your daughter and the pro fessors son together asleep and stage a beauty contest that might be interesting and fun to do but it wouldnt get them married to each other are you sure in the story the demons satisfied them selves that the man was the prettier of the two then put both to sleep again and returned them to their homes but when the two mortals woke far apart each yearned for the other and neither rested until they were together because each had had a real chance to inspect the other at close range metria said that might indeed work it is certainly worth a try d vore is one terrific catch and he is a prince nada is xanths loveliest mortal female figure they well might impress each other favorably especially since both need to marry but can we put them to sleep roc and a hard place i have a sleeping potion i can slip to my daughter surely professor grossclout has something similar that will do for his son then lets do it she exclaimed gratified soon nada naga and jenny elf arrived back with a small bag of plaid diamonds metria quickly served them both with their summonses and explained about the trial while king nabob slithered quietly away to make preparations metria popped back to the demon caves to talk to gross clout again professor something else he paused midway in a step toward the cowering class my patience is being strained somewhat beyond the incen diary point demoness he rumbled you want vore to marry nada right suppose you make it a real occasion by marrying grey murphy and princess ivy at the same time nada and ivy are close friends and and its been nine years he agreed ivys mother procrastinated too very well metria smiled thanks prof then she told him what else was required within the hour the arrangements had been made the demons beauty contest proceeded demon prince vore woke to find himself in a strange situ ation wan light filtered down from above he was in a small chamber whose walls extended well up beyond head height and there were no doors or windows odder yet there lay beside him a bare girl he looked again this was no girl this was a fully equipped mortal humanstyle woman her hair was reddish brown and swirled around her body like a silken cloak her face was stunningly beautiful and so was her body he lifted her hair out of the way to make sure if this is the creature my father has in mind for me to marry shell do he remarked she looks good enough to eat however i have no intention of being coerced into any piers anthony thing or of remaining cooped up here i am after all a demon prince subject to the will of just about no one else he tried to pop offbut nothing happened he tried to dematerialize but again nothing happened he tried to fly and could not his demonly powers had been somehow stripped from him what had happened he checked the circular wall of the chamber it was firm without crevice or opening he pushed against it but it did not yield he tried to climb up it but could find no purchase baffled he returned to his consideration of the sleeping woman who are you lovely creature he inquired she did not respond he touched her slender arm but she did not react she was under a spell of some sort that kept her asleep a spell that must be what had happened to him some magic had put him to sleep and the lingering aftereffects still deprived him of his demonly powers the girl might have been similarly enchanted but being merely mortal had not fought even partially out of it as he had now he saw almost hidden beneath the graceful mass of her tresses a small golden crown set around her head she was a princess ah but what a marvel of pulchritude you are my dear he remarked and a princess too i would love to have a tryst with you were you awake but as it is i must let you be for i am an honorable creature he sat beside her watching her slow even breathing it was most impressive then suddenly he knew no more princess nada naga woke surprised one moment she had been about to retire in the pleasant cave she shared with jenny elf and here she was in some strange chamber eeeeek she screamed putting at least five јs into it there was a naked man lying beside her she scrambled to her feet discovering in the process that she was nude herself she tried to find the door but there was none also no window only wan light sagging down from far above she was in the bottom of a well roc and a hard place she tried to change to serpent form but could not so she tried to revert to naga form and could not do that either something was interfering with her natural shapeshifting ability she realized that she had probably been put under some kind of spell and had recovered from only part of it so that she was now awake but possessed of no other special abilities and this strange man must have been similarly treated she sat down on the soft bed that filled the bottom of the well and considered him more carefully he was a handsome brute firm of feature and muscular of body and as she peered more closely she saw a light golden crown on his head he was a prince i wish i had known about you before she murmured appreciatively i have been looking for a suitable prince for more time than i care to confess but of course youre prob ably obnoxious as most males are when awake she peered yet more closely and you look to be about twenty three years old too young for me because i am twenty six she pondered and considered and thought and finally decided to take a chance and wake the handsome stranger she spoke to him but there was no response she shook his shoulder but he did not stir finally she tried her ultimate she got down on her hands and knees put her mouth to his and kissed him but it was no use he continued to sleep it was the first time such a thing had happened she had been able almost to wake the dead with a kiss maybe that magic too had been stifled by the enchantment on her she sighed unable either to escape or to wake the man she would simply have to wait this out she lay down again beside him took his hand in hers so that she would know if he stirred and suddenly she was unconscious so much for the beauty contest metria remarked nei ther one of them really got hot she was peering through the transparent cloud substance of the confinement tower or piers anthony rather into the big magic mirror that showed the distant tower as if it were made of glass theyre both decent folk jenny elf said at least i know nada is i think this plot of yours is crazy they both need to be married king nabob said thats the point this is merely stage one i still think it wont work jenny said but sammy cat in her arms looked thoughtful the two prisoners in the well woke together oh nada cried and tried to change form for it was not proper to be unclothed in human form with a strange man but she re mained unable to change so she draped her hair across her torso covering most of it though parts of her insisted on poking through youre awake vore said as startled as she and so are you she said not unreasonably hastily let ting go of his hand he looked around then down at his bare self he tried to fashion clothing around himself but that power too was inoperative realizing that there was nothing to be done about it as his hair was not nearly as long as hers he made the best of it hello i am prince vore i am princess nada for a reason neither understood neither gave further identification you are the most beautiful woman i can remember see ing as a conversational gambit this lacked finesse she however took it in stride and you are the hand somest man even if you are young he shrugged i am as i am do you know how we came to be confined here i was about to ask you that one moment i was in my royal chamber the next i woke herebeside you you were asleep oh when i woke before you were the one sleeping she pursed her lips fashioning if not a moue at least not a neigh i think we have been enchanted roc and a hard place my thought exactly but to what purpose she considered i remember a story my father told me as a child about a demons contestbut thats irrelevant perhaps someone has abducted us and means to hold us for ransom but why deprive us of our clothing so we cant escape without attracting notice princess nada i think you would attract notice any where regardless of your attire i presume you mean that as a compliment i do then i thank you do you think we can get out of this well he cast about the soft stuff of which the bed was made seemed malleable he drew some forth and fashioned it into a cord perhaps if this is strong enough i can make a rope that will reach the turret above i will help you she said immediately they got to work on it forthwith and such was their mu tual dexterity that they soon had a fine strong rope forming her fingers were nimble for the fine threads and his hands were strong for the stout rope she admired his hands among other things and he admired her fingers among other things when they had a sufficient length he made a loop at one end and flung it up so that it neatly caught on a turret then he hauled himself up hand over hand his muscles straining because he wasnt used to climbinga wall the hard way he reached the top sat on the turret and peered down your turn nada he called she shook her head im afraid i lack your strength vore i cannot haul myself up in the forthright manner you did perhaps you should go and see if you can win your freedom he gazed at her a bit more closely and saw that while most of his own extra flesh was in the form of muscles on his arms most of hers was in the form of curvature on her torso and legs that would indeed not do for handoverhand piers anthony climbing by no means nada make a loop at the bottom and sit in it and i will haul you up she did so and soon he had brought her also to the top then they both looked around they were perched on the top of a tower which was part of a formidable castle the castle was on a white island in a dark blue sea should we make own way down and then inquire within the castle nada asked i like your trusting nature but i suspect that whoever or whatever occupies this castle is what has imprisoned us and we should avoid contact if we possibly can i like your sensible caution indeed you are surely cor rect and my notion was foolish what else should we do for a moment they faced each other and each became further aware that the other was of wondrously aesthetic as pect as well as possessing trust and caution that nicely com plemented each other but their situation was too precarious to allow them much chance for reflection maybe we should get down and try to find a boat she said agreed and some clothing though i admit it is no great burden to behold you as you are she blushed half a shade becoming twice as pretty though that was impossible he might be young but there was something about him i might say the same for you then he lowered her to the ground and handed himself down he jerked on the rope and the loop came off the turret and fell to the ground beside them they skulked around the castle hiding in the shade of the walls they found what might be a locked boatshed vore was going to bash it open but nada cautioned him about the noise instead she slipped a twisted thread from the rope in through the latchhole and managed to lift the inner latch thus they got inside the boatshed silently how can a prin cess have developed such skill at thievery vore asked ad miringly roc and a hard place i once had a certain passion for cookies which were kept locked up she confessed so i learned how to acquire them without attracting attention there was a small airboat inside vore put it into the air and it floated i had expected a waterboat he said but this will do nada climbed in and vore pushed the boat out the open door then got in himself it sank a bit lower in the air be cause of their weight but floated well enough vore took the oars and stroked and the little craft moved smoothly in the opposite direction there was a noise in the castle oops someone is stir ring nada said alarmed we must flee before they spy us vore put his back into it and the boat fairly shot out from the castle now nada looked down and discovered that what surrounded the castle wasnt water but sky blue air no won der there was an airboat the castle was floating in the air on a cloud soon they were able to hide behind another cloud out of view of the castle their escape seemed to be successful but we didnt find any clothes vore said remember ing perhaps i can do something about that nada said you row us down the ground and see if you recognize any landmarks i will unravel our rope and try to weave some cloth she proceeded to do just that her fingers becoming nimble again you have amazing skills for a princess vore remarked appreciatively well as a naga princess i need to the goblins press us pretty hard and no one can be slack you are naga he asked surprised oh i can say that now she said surprised myself the effects of that spell must be wearing further off yes i am princess nada naga once betrothed to prince dolph human but now adrift as it were does that dismay you piers anthony there might have been a time when it would have he said but now that i know you it has the opposite effect can you change to serpent form i will try suddenly she was a coiled serpent then her human head appeared on the serpents body yes my pow ers are returning she returned to full human form then perhaps mine are also vore said i am a de mon a demon prince d vore does that dismay you yes for i was coming to like you he puffed into smoke then reformed in human guise yes i can now do demonly things but why does this dis may you because now you will pop away forever in a cloud of mocking laughter and i will understand how foolish i have been to think you were nice for a demon has no soul and therefore no conscience and cannot love vore considered once that might have been the case but i have come to know you and i think aat since i have been constrained by my father to marry you are the one i would like to wed you have qualities i never appreciated in a mortal creature before and you are a princess nada laughed somewhat bitterly i dont think any male ever noticed qualities in me only my form but you would not want to marry me because then you might get half my soul and become bound in a way you have never been be fore i realize that but perhaps it would be worth it could you spare half your soul for marriage to a prince of demons i think i could even if he is young well i am twentythree hundred years old which is equivalent to twentythree in human terms i never thought id love a younger man she shrugged but these things happen and allowances have to be made the boat came to rest on the ground then perhaps our roc and a hard place interests coincide vore said i think we should make it formal before our captors or pursuers strike again he took her hand princess nada will you a dragon erupted from a nearby cave and launched itself toward them nada immediately became a huge serpent and vores free hand sprouted a wickedly gleaming sword the dragon hesitated marry me vore continued the dragon decided to attack after all but the serpent chomped it on the neck and the demon thrust the sword hilt deep up its nose the dragon sneezed not being completely comfortable and backed away nadas human head appeared on the serpent yes she said the sword disappeared the demon took the serpent body in his arms and kissed the human face we are betrothed he said agreed she said resuming full human form then they kissed again suddenly several people stood around them one was the demon professor grossclout i heard that he said tri umphantly i shall perform the ceremony at the nameless castle from which you just escaped right after the trial is over another was king nabob so did i the wedding will be within a fortnight there will be an alliance between the naga and the demons a third was the demoness metria and it serves you right she said then she turned to the fourth jenny elf i need to borrow your cat jenny was startled my cat sammy yes the professor wouldnt tell me where to find you until i agreed to get his son married now thats done so i can get on with my mission nada and vore both turned to her mission nada asked somehow seeming not entirely pleased i thought you came to serve jenny and me our summonses piers anthony that too this was arranged vore asked seeming curiously sim ilarly displeased sure it was the demons beauty contest vore and nada exchanged a glance fraught with something or other we should break the be nada started grossclout fixed her with his patented glare stopping her in midword i think not shes right vore said we should not tolerate such interference in our look at her and say it king nabob said vore looked at nada nada looked at vore he saw xanths most beautiful woman and a princess she saw a considerably handsome and talented man and a prince each saw a truly worthwhile match then their respective will powers melted and they kissed again we shall name the grandchild demonica grossclout said and nabob nodded agreement i guess you can borrow sammy jenny elf said to me tria aisle what is it you need to find jenny asked keeping firm hold of sammy cat so he wouldnt bound away to find it the moment it was spoken amolde centaur a centaur couldnt you just ask at one of the centaur villages or at centaur isle i did the centaurs of centaur isle wont even speak of him because they think magic in a centaur is obscene im sure hes not there centaurs in other places havent seen him in years they say he must be one hundred twentysix years old by now if hes still alive but corn pewter says hes still around somewhere i just have to find him he must be a very special centaur he is hes a magician who can make an aisle of magic in mundania i need him to go after the mundanes on my list piers anthony mundanes dug and kirn they oh yes i was kirns companion in the game three years ago metria paused thats right ive been doing so many things im forgetting who knows what and nada was dugs companion he kept trying to get a glimpse of her panties and got expelled from the game for it she tells me jenny agreed laughing after that he behaved and became a tolerably good person kirn was a bit wild too at first but settled down it will be great to see them again we will i have to get them both to that trial on time or the simurgh wont consider my job to be done and the good magician wont tell me how to get the storks notice jenny cocked her head you havent learned how to do that metria smiled t summoned the stork centuries ago but i didnt stay to take care of my baby girl i think after that the stork decided i wasnt a suitable address for deliveries so it ignores my signals though i am now married and half souled and intend to be a good mother maybe you just havent sent enough of them i under stand that some messages get lost seven hundred and fifty in a year jenny pursed her lips i guess you do need some help the stork has tuned you out she looked around well lets get started sammy may outrun me so you will have to keep him in sight ill catch up eventually i always do she set the orange cat down sammy we need to find ar nolde centaur the cat was off in a bound an orange streak amidst the foliage wait for me jenny cried futilely chasing after him metria didnt wait she sailed in pursuit of the feline the cat was fast but not as fast as a demoness so they zoomed roc and a hard place along through forest and field upscale and downscale and across rivers mountains and deserts then sammy paused there was a creature standing in the way it was larger and shaggier than the cat and looked dangerous it seemed to be some kind of omk but sammy didnt seem frightened just bored and of course the economics of infrastructure must also be considered the oink was saying these consist of fif teen overlapping conditions that must be predicated on in versely bludgeoning circumstances with due allowance for rapprochement incentives and integral negations what in xanth are you metria demanded aside from being the dullest creature ive encountered recently the oink glanced at her im a wild bore of course it is my business to bore you to death you dont have to stand for this metria told the cat just go on around him that broke sammys seeming trance of boredom and he skirted the bore and resumed running jenny arrived wait for me she cried certainly the bore said no you dont metria said go around him jenny obediently moved to the side where some pretty yellow vines were growing up along the trees but metria recognized the vines not that way she called jenny pulled back but the wild bore barging after her crashed into the vines suddenly there was a thick yellow splatter of fluid drenching him oh ugh he squealed ammonia not exactly metria said those are golden showers climbing rose vines then she zoomed on after the cat seeing that jenny had gotten safely past the bore who would have to go somewhere to wash himself off then they came to a lake and in the lake was an island in the shape of a bone the lake seemed to extend a good distance to either side so the fastest way to pass it was right across the island and that was the way sammy was going piers anthony but sammy did seem to be a bit nervous and he actually slowed enough to allow jenny elf to catch up then he walked across a dogeared bridge onto the island no wonder metria muttered this is dog island indeed the islands shore was lined with doghouses and all manner of dogs were out sunbathing in fact they were hot dogs a stone promontory was covered with scots on the rocks the water was filled with dogfish and old sea dogs and lapdogs were swimming around and around the island i sammy stepped on tippy toes not making a sound so as to pass without notice metria formed into a haze and sur rounded jenny so she wouldnt be discovered there was just no telling how these dogfaces would react to this intrusion on their retreat the forest inshore was filled with dogwood dog fennel dogtooth violents dog mercury and dog rose all of which sniffed the air and growled suspiciously there was also an occasional have of bgles metria knew that the bhaves could be very bad because their stings affected peoples bhavior in the center of the island was a snowy mountain anyone who wanted to sleep warmly there would have to snuggle up with an afghan bound dogsleds were being hauled up to the top on the peak was the robot dog dogmatic who thought he was reciting fine poetry but only spewed dog gerel they forged doggedly through and finally traversed a dogsleg curve leading to a bridge to the far side of the lake marked k they had passed dog island without getting chewed metria was relieved because though she had noth ing to fear from dogfaces herself sammy cat certainly did once safely past the island sammy plunged on at speed leaving jenny behind again but now the terrain was becom ing vaguely familiar oh no metria muttered not the region of madness again but it was they were approaching it from a different di roc and a harp place rection so wouldnt encounter desiree dryad or the white family which meant that the perils would be unfamiliar me tria wasnt sure she would be able to protect cat and elf girl here because the things of the unexplored madness could be truly freakish yet the cat was plowing straight on in ill take over now mentia said the worse it gets the saner i get just as well because it wasnt long before something weird appeared before them it was a manlike figure but it looked like a mummified zombie it reached for sammy mentia stretched out her arm to three times its prior length and put her hand betweenrthe thing and the cat its hand touched her handand suddenly her hand and arm stiffened what are you she demanded i am rigor mortis the thing replied in ghastly tones i make folk stiff for sure mentia stiffened her resolve and shoved the thing to the side so that jenny elf could pass because demons had no fixed forms they could not be stiffened for long but it would be another matter for living folk then mentia zoomed ahead so as to keep the cat in sight she wondered how the elf had managed not to lose sammy in the years they had been in xanth because the cat seemed to have no regard for jennys convenience beyond the zombielike creature was a grove of angular trees wherein perched strangely thin birds sammy cat plunged right on through it but again mentia was rational and cautious in contrast to her normal disposition she wanted to know exactly what these odd birds were so she inquired because here in the madness things were often communicative in ways they wouldnt be normally what are you she called to the birds we are minus birds they chorused back as you can plainly see because we live here in the geometrees i apologize for my stupidity mentia said realizing that flattery was probably better than irritation are either you or the trees dangerous to ordinary folk piers anthony no we dont care about ordinary folk the birds re plied all we care about is multiplying ohyou get together with plus birds to signal the stork no we cant find any plus birds so we multiply by di viding in half with that each bird split in half forming two where each one had perched each new one twice as thin jenny elf caught up oh what pretty birds she ex claimed the minus birds preened pleased mentia jumped ahead againand was relieved to see an old centaur just making the acquaintance of the cat sammy had found amolde and what is your oddity pretty feline the centaur asked mentia caused a flowing anklelength robe to surround her as she approached arnolde centaur i presume and a demoness the centaur said surprised make a note ichabod two seemingly normal creatures in as many minutes which is highly unusual for this region now mentia saw that amolde had a companion an old human man the man opened his notebook and several notes popped out making brief music one mundane cat no ap parent magic ichabod said one unusually sober demon ess that cats magic talent is to find anything except home mentia said now he has found you arnolde centaur and your nonentitious companion as for mei am normally slightly crazy but in the region of madness i am slightly sane i am not certain about you two however amolde blinked seeming to actually see her as an indi vidual for the first time are you real he inquired not a mere semblance mentias rationality took hold oh you think im something crazy in the madness a manifestation instead of a real creature that i can appreciate yes i am real and roc and a hard place here comes jenny elf who is also real for jenny was now arriving i apologize for mistaking you for part of the local fauna arnolde said yes i am arnolde centaur and this is my friend from mundania ichabod archivist we are per forming a survey of mad artifacts hello amolde and ichabod mentia said i am the demoness mentia the worser half of the demoness metria the old eyes brightened with recognition metria she is notorious shes married now and has half a soul so has settled down now shes doing an errand for the good magician or for the simurgh so she can find out how to get the storks attention seems there was some business a bit over four centuries ago that annoyed the stork so it wont make any further deliveries to her no matter how hard or often she signals it i can imagine amolde said do you mind showing ichabod your legs mentia knew that the centaur was anything but stupid even by centaur terms and she wanted to get his cooperation so she lifted the hem of the gown and flashed excellent legs at the old man his eyes immediately glazed over jenny elf picked up sammy i guess you wont need him now so we can go um maybe better not to depart right now mentia said it might not be safe soon well be leaving the madness and then you can go your way more safely she let her gown drop back into place and the mans eyes began to recover it was clear that he had a taste for attractive legs but this doesnt seem so bad jenny said not com pared to what it was like when i came here with dug mun dane oh i wouldnt recommend a little girl like you going alone through this region ichabod said im eighteen and big for an elf jenny said defensively an elf why so you are ichabod agreed surprised piers anthony but not like one i have cataloged before your hands are fourfingered and your ears are pointed and you dont seem to be associated with an elf elm im from the world of two moons jenny explained two moons the man asked blankly i am certain i havent cataloged that its a different magic realm i came to xanth following sammy cat who found a centaur wing feather here but then we couldnt find our way home but surely you have but to ask the cat to find some other person or object in your home realm close to where you know your home to be amolde said intelligently no i tried that but it didnt work i think he cant find anything anywhere near home unless he is already at home then give him some reverse wood so he cant find any thing but home ichabod suggested no that didnt work either jenny said the reverse wood just made him unable to find anything he looked for reverse wood is treacherous stuff mentia said thats why they never tried to put it in the golden horde goblins hate spring to make it a love spring it might just make everyone hate the water same goes for using it to make corn pewter good instead of evil it might reverse him in some other way making him worse true ichabod said it was hoped that reverse wood would enable a basilisks stare to bring dead folk back to life but it merely caused the basilisk to wipe itself out they tried to use it to reverse the spell that had transformed people to fish in the fish river but instead it turned the fish into water and the water into fish i remember when a kid had the talent of giving folk hotseats mentia said smiling someone slipped reverse wood into his trouser pocket hoping it would make him give himself a hotseat but the next time he tried to use his talent he got wet pants jenny laughed served him right roc and a harp place that time it worked well ichabod agreed but not in the expected way so reverse wood doesnt seem to be the answer for your search for home amolde frowned orienting on the intellectual challenge perhaps if you got one of those magic disposal bubbles and directed it to take you home that neither jenny said it just wouldnt go it is almost as if your home no longer ichabod started then stifled it no longer exists jenny finished firmly i recognized that some time ago but it could be that my family is all right if the holt burned they would move but there would be no way for me to find the new home from here do you dislike it here amolde asked no i have been here six years now and im not sure i really want to go home any more i only wish that there were others of your particular type amolde concluded i know the feeling being the only centaur ma gician in xanth i was exiled from my home of centaur isle because of that and can never return jenny looked at him suddenly warming to him yes or being the only completely unmagical mundane in a magical land ichabod said fortunately there are some cheering sights here mentia realized why amolde had asked her to show her legs before for the tonic effect on his friend she fogged out her gown showing them again why did you seek me out amolde inquired my better halts errand for the simurgh requires her to round up jurors for a big trial two of them are mundanes so mundanes ichabod exclaimed dug and kim mentia agreed they visited here three years ago playing a game and kim won a magic talent as a prize then they went home to mundania now they are on the list and must be summoned here to decide roxanne rocs fate piers anthony the big bird in the nameless castle amolde asked what did she do mentia shrugged no one seems to know but once i get all the people summoned and delivered maybe well all find out so you wish me to take you into mundania amolde said to find those two jurors exactly the summons tokens will indicate the way but im a demoness i cant leave the magic realms but if i can arrange to take magic with me and this trial is required by the simurgh herself yes then it behooves me to facilitate it i suppose my labor here can wait a while then his eye caught something it looked like a large fly but it had several buttons on its body theres a specimen note it ichabod ichabod opened his notebook and several more notes popped musically out one buttoned fly he said marking it in his book are they dangerous jenny asked only when they get unbuttoned ichabod replied with an obscure smile mentia changed the subject exactly how long have you been surveying mad artifacts amolde exchanged a glance with ichabod about twenty eight years the centaur said ever since i retired from the kingship of xanth i went to mundania and fetched my friend who wished to retire in xanth and whose archivistic skill complements my specialty of alien archaeology this is a fascinating region and until last year it was expanding yes the time of no magic voided a confining spell and allowed the madness to expand mentia said but we fixed that last year and now the madness is retreating you fixed it he asked incredulously well it was a joint effort mainly gary gargoyle but i helped we were in stone hinge roc and a hard place thats a mere ruin thousands of years old how could you two thousand years old she agreed we visited the deep past in a joint vision its a long story amolde shook his head bemused it must be he ex changed another glance with his friend are you ready to revisit mundania ich in your company certainly without it i fear i would soon perish of old age mentia glanced at amolde youre pretty old yourself centaur for a mortal over a century and a quarter how is it that you havent faded away long since we have wondered about that amolde confessed though i am a magician my talent does not relate to age and of course ichabod lacks magic entirely we conjecture that the ambience of madness has had if not a rejuvenating effect a stabilizing one so that we remain healthy as long as we remain in it this encourages our continuance of our survey apart from its value as information mentia nodded i know some mundanes who live here who i think would be dead in mundania theres something about the madness it is after all xanths most intense magic amolde pointed out it may have effects that normal magic does not we have not been inclined to question this blessing but if you leave the madnesswhat then jenny asked actually i have on occasion stepped outside the mad ness amolde said i noticed no deleterious effect my conjecture is that i have become so charged with magic that my aisle in effect extends into xanth that is that i now generate an aisle of madness that keeps me and ichabod healthy wherever we go of course this could not be ex pected to last indefinitely but it will be intriguing to test it in mundania great mentia said we can get jenny out of the mad ness then move on toward the isthmus well have to step piers anthony along as it will take several days for you folk to traverse xanth and we dont have time to spare but we may be able to accelerate it if you can summon assistance for traveling ichabod said mentia hadnt thought of that i know a giant who was in the madness last year maybe if i can locate him sammy leaped from jennys arms and bounded away through the madness jenny scrambled after him wait for me no mentia cried you stay here jenny ill follow him and bring him back jenny looked doubtful but stopped running mentia floated rapidly after the cat this was just as well because sammy still not properly familiar with the madness was getting in trouble a huge ant with patterns of stripes on its forelegs was blocking the way companyhalt the ant bawled sammy startled halted but metria didnt what are you she demanded of the ant i am sarge i give the orders around here well sarge ant i rank you because i am a cap tain she formed herself into a large floating cap with the word tain printed across it yessir the ant agreed saluting with a foreleg what are your orders sir carry on sarge just tell me what threats there might be to a traveling cat in this vicinity just king bomb sir whats he king of the ticks sir hes a tick he has a very short fuse mentia considered she knew that ticks could be bad mis chief in real xanth and possibly worse here still a short tempered tick named bomb didnt seem too formidable whats his given name time sir how can we tell when were near him you can hear him ticking sir roc and a hard place thank you sarge dismissed the ant went his way so did sammy bounding on through the madness but he paused just a moment glancing back wait for me mentia cried catching the hint then the cat forged ahead at full feline velocity but soon mentia heard an ominous ticldng they were approaching king bomb so she zoomed ahead sure enough there was a tick shaped like bloated sphere standing squarely in the path the cat would take he looked extremely irritable likely to explode at any moment mentia came to float directly before him tick king time bomb blow this joint she said the kings tiny eyes glared at her begone yourself de moness ill have no truck with thee his ticking got louder thats what you think bomb bast get out of here before i set you off this is an outrage the king declared growing larger as his ticking intensified mentia discovered an egg plant growing nearby she picked an egg and hurled it at the king it splattered on his metallic torso the white and yoke drooling down that did it the king detonated the explosion blasted a hole in the ground and sent shrapnel into the surrounding treetrunks but of course it didnt hurt mentia sammy appeared he bounded across the smoking crater and went on unconcerned mentia followed suddenly the cat stopped he was before a large dent in the forest floor that was shaped like a human posterior mentia knew they were in the presence of a mon strous invisible man who was sitting on the forest floor the smell was so bad that she abolished her nose it was as if a garbage factory with indigestion had burned halfway down hello jethro giant mentia said remember me im the demoness mentia we met last year oh yes jethro agreed has it been that long i was just getting ready to get up and go piers anthony i will gladly show you the way out if you will help me carry a few people to the edge of xanth that seems like an amicable deal stand back mentia snatched up the cat and floated back there was a huge grunt and heave and two monstrous footprints replaced the bottomshaped indentation then an enormous invisible hand came down to take her where are your people jethro asked mentia described the direction and the giant tromped that way in only a few steps they arrived at the glade where man centaur and elf waited holding their noses as they turned greenish mentia floated down think of sweet violets she sug gested as she handed sammy who looked somewhat green instead of orange himself to jenny jethro giant is a nice guy then the huge hand came down and picked them gently up where to the voice sounded from far above mentia floated up to invisible ear level and directed him toward the edge of madness in two steps they were out of it then jethro strode rapidly forward toward the edge of xanth and the resulting wind blew most of the odor away the mortals were able to resume breathing oh this is interesting jenny cried peering down through the invisible hand xanth looks just like a map oops mentia said i forgot to set you down when we left the madness dont bother i know kim and dug and would like to see them again and sammy can help you find them besides were all going to the same place in the end to that weird trial its nice being on a quest of a sort an elf quest that makes so much sense ill have to ignore it mentia said no just put your uncrazy better half in charge jenny said i always sort of liked her even if she did drive me crazy oh why do you asseverate that roc and a hard place why do i what that declare avow attest proclaim expound announce assert whatever welcome back metria its nice to rejoin you too odd elf what are you going to do now that your friend nada has found true love or at least a husband i dont know maybe i should ask magician trent to transform someone for me as he did for gloha goblin harpy yes and in the process i wound up married too metria agreed reminiscently you did it to save her from mischief well my half soul gave me a conscience so i had to but didnt you save her before you got your con science metria paused sorting it out yes i suppose so but i wanted to find out what love was like they looked out across xanth oh look jenny ex claimed theres a light house metria looked sure enough the house was floating through the air carried along by the wind thats a very light house she agreed but whats that jenny asked alarmed as she looked in another direction metria looked again oh thats an air plain she ex plained where flying centaurs can graze indeed four winged centaurs were standing on the cloud like plain picking berry bread and grape fruits and theres an air male jenny said as the centaur stal lion waved to her with his wings hi cheiron wait a half a moment metria said how can there be four flying centaurs there che and cynthia are at castle roogna until the trial there should be only cheiron and chex oh didnt you know jenny asked the stork brought piers anthony two more foals to them last year actually centaurs dont use storks because their foals are too heavy but two more foals chelsy and cherish twins maybe they were taking their naps when you visited the family maybe so metria agreed doubtfully meanwhile the giant was striding obliviously on soon leaving the floating plain behind jenny looked ahead oops metria followed her gaze a third time oh its just a storm not just any storm thats fracto metria peered at the cloud more closely why so it is i remember when he was just another demon before he spe cialized in cloudcraft he always comes at the worst time to mess up whatever others are doing of course hes a demon are you like that i used to be as you know i just had a more delicate contiguity a more delicate what concurrence immediacy propinquity proximity pres sure sensation touch whatever she agreed crossly demonesses just arent as violent as demons but our mischief is equivalent she thought of king gromden and threnody those were the bad old days when she helped bring down kingdoms with her sex appeal windbag fracto never achieved that well maybe hell fail this time jenny said because jethro giant is too big to be blown away but it should be fun watching him try the storm swelled up grotesquely as the giant strode to ward it dark clouds reached up for the sky and down for the ground thunderbirds and lightningbugs spun in the roc and a hard place swirling air currents rain splatted against the giants invis ible body outlining it in glistening water ill fetch rain coats metria said and popped off she found an old ancient wornout storm and took a sheet of its rain fashioning it into several capes because the rain was tired it no longer had the energy to wet things down and just hung there inertly she returned with the coats put these on they will keep the wild new water off you she told jenny amolde and ichabod oh a translucent plastic raincoat ichabod said pleased exactly metria didnt find it necessary to clarify the precise nature of the coats it was just as well they had the rain coats because now the giant was striding over lake tsoda popka and the storm was sucking up water from all the differentflavored little lakelets so that it was raining popka jenny put out her cupped hands and caught some of it so that she could drink oooo its extra fizzy she said it must have been freshly stirred up ichabod did the same but as he drank he jumped who kicked me he demanded amolde laughed you happened to catch some boot rear they passed over the withacookee river now assorted cookies pelted them jenny caught a pecan sandy and threw it away because she cared to eat neither sand nor the other stuff but soon she caught a spiraled punwheel and ate that arnolde caught some chocolate chip cookie crumbs and ich abod a piece of gingerbread unfortunately all the fragments were somewhat soggy from the rain fracto stormed on but could not blow away the giant who simply forged obliviously on though his head was in the clouds they passed a glittering river formed of tumbling crystals and a huge mattress whose projecting springs were silver whats that jenny asked piers anthony crystal river and silver springs of course amolde replied he was good with geography as all centaurs were of course jenny echoed how silly of me not to rec ognize them theres just so much of xanth i havent yet seen new things keep surprising me eventually they reached the isthmus jethro gently set them down by a tree covered with mouths this is as far as i can go he said my head is starting to poke up out of the magic now that they were no longer moving rapidly the smell was catching up thats fine jeth jenny called thanks a whole lot then she stifled a gag welcome the giant strode invisibly away and the air slowly cleared but the mouths on the tree had taken in some of the stench and were mouthing gasps what kind of tree is that jenny asked a twolips tree i think amolde answered then a mouth opened wide repent now it preached the end is near my mistake the centaur said those are apocalips metria brought out the token with kirns name that way she said as it tugged they moved along as a group metria leading the way soon they came to the interface between xanth and mun dania it had been intangible through most of xanths history metria understood but since they had recompiled it last year it had sharpened up considerably and was now a scintillating zone of intense magic we had better hold hands as we cross metria said so that well all return to this same spot when we cross back correct amolde said that will fix us as a party but i am surprised that a demoness knows or cares about such intricacies i helped fix it she reminded him its the interface that confines the madness in the center as well as keeping roc and a hard place most mundanes out so xanth isnt constantly swamped by hordes of dreary unmagical beings so it keeps magic both in and out we really must talk at greater length in due course he said metria shrugged hardly interested maybe someday however now that we are about to depart from xanth i must caution you that the magic will be limited to a narrow aisle of which i will be the center he smiled briefly or the centaur as you prefer if you wander beyond that aisle you will lose your magic whatever it is ichabod of course has little to fear being naturally mundane except that i might suddenly expire of old age the archivist said but you metria could disappear entirely so i recom mend that you stay quite close to me for this interim he smiled perhaps we shall have that dialogue sooner than anticipated whatever metria agreed crossly they passed through the interface there was a slight tin gle and that was all the land beyond was much the same as regular xanth but metria was keenly aware that she was now dependent for her very existence on the centaur aisle of magic mundania if i may make a suggestion ichabod said by all means friend arnolde replied this is after all ybur territory i think it would facilitate things if we had rapid mundanian transportation he glanced at amolde you know how they tend to stare at you when they see you and this time we dont have a spell of invisibility along excellent point perhaps your wheeled vehicle that was what i was thinking my pickup truck will carry the full party and if we put high sides on it oddities will not be noticed thats right metria said centaurs dont exist in mundania nor demonesses ichabod agreed however if you arrange to be garbed a bit more completelynot that im complaining roc and a hard place she had left her gown translucent she opaqued it will this do actually your apparel does not closely resemble that of contemporary mundania he said will you accept my in struction in this respect maybe id better she said but if your hands stray ill turn into smoke and choke you he smiled im sure it would be delightful smoke please assume a colored blouse and an opaque skirt extending about halfway to the knees metria did so then she formed the peculiar pointedheel footwear mundanes used and arranged her hair and red dened her lips i feel like a clown she complained you look like a fine young woman ichabod assured her and i might add a remarkably attractive one metria about to say something appropriately sharp sud denly discovered that her tongue had softened to as profes sor grossclout would put it something like mush then ichabod turned to jenny elf no offense but you could pass for a human child of ten he told her i think youd do best in juvenile garb such as tshirt blue jeans and sneakers then he reconsidered no you would not appear childlike in such a shirt maybe a loose untucked plaid shirtwhats the matter for jenny was giggling thats the color of mela mer womans she dissolved into more giggles a checkered shirt metria said quickly that would do ichabod agreed perplexed there seems to be something we dont know about amolde remarked perhaps we have been too long in the madness for sure jenny agreed as her mirth gradually subsided plaid sure isnt the way to appear childlike but i cant just make clothing from my ownsubstance the way metria does ill have to find some were not all the way out of the magic yet metria said piers anthony have sammy find a shoe tree and a clothes horse and ill fetch what she needs and a jacket for you amolde sammy was off and running as she spoke bring him back with you jenny said this time not trying to chase after the cat metria floated after sammy who brought her in turn to a shoe tree with a pair of sneakers jennys size a clothes horse with good jeans shirt and jacket and a scarlet ribbon worm that would do nicely to tie her hair she gathered these up along with the cat and floated back to the waiting party then she formed herself into a highsided tent so that jenny could change clothes without suffering the cynosure of three or four male eyes after all jenny was not a nymph this accomplished they resumed their travel in the direc tion the token had indicated for kim mundane gradually the terrain changed with the trees becoming unfamiliar and somehow less interesting as if ashamed to be without magic the very air became dusky and less pleasant losing its fresh ness ichabod sniffed the pollution gets worse every year he remarked now we shall have to deviate from the true route because my residence is to the side fortunately it is not far and i believe we can avoid contact with the natives even so it was a dreary hike metria would have popped back to xanth for a break but didnt dare try to cross the dread magicless terrain between she was stuck with the party in her peculiar outfit for the duration at last they came to ichabods house which was a dull wood and stucco structure beside a broad paved path beside it was a funny device with wheels but as they approached it emerging from the forest behind it a horrible loud monster came zooming along the road jenny drew back in fright is it a dragon she asked no merely an automobile ichabod replied confidently do not be concerned it will not leave the highway jenny and metria looked up but saw no high way just the low road he means the paved wide path you see roc and a hard place amolde explained realizing the source of their confusion there are a number of odd terms in mundania i will stand behind the house amolde said so that i will not be seen i am uncertain how far my aisle extends now my long time in the madness may have enhanced it somewhat lets find out metria said i dont want to step out of it by accident jenny and i can walk slowly to the edge and when i fade she can pull me back the prospect made her nervous but she did want to know the limits it was a matter of existence and nonexistence for her which was a new and qualmy sensation meanwhile i will fetch money and supplies from the house ichabod said he alone was free to leave the aisle unless his age caught up with him metria and jenny linked hands and walked ahead of ar nolde it should extend fifteen paces to the front and half that to the rear amolde called and only about two paces to either side metria looked back she judged they were a dozen paces ahead of him she took one more and a second getting more nervous as she did they were now close beside the paved path another noisy block monster zoomed across but instead of passing on by it suddenly squealed like a stuck oink and slewed to a halt right before them metria nervous about the limit of the aisle stood frozen the monster whistled piercingly then it poked a human head from its side hey cutie how about a date i think its talking to you jenny said so metria responded if your dates taste as bad as your air i dont want one the thing whistled again oh wow weve got a live one here part of its side opened and a young man crawled out beat it kid he said to jenny then to metria how about a kiss sugarlips metria was beginning to figure this out the monster was piers anthony actually some kind of conveyance like a magic carpet the man was the standard obnoxious young human male she knew how to handle that kind sure buttface come and get it are you sure jenny asked worriedly well find out soon enough the man came up and put his arms around her he brought his face down to hers just as his mouth was about to touch hers metria turned herhead into a mound of mush his lips sucked mush his head jerked back what the she poked an eyeball out of the mush yes loverboy its an alien thing he cried pulling away but her arms were around him holding him close then i had better chomp it she said her head forming into the snout of a small dragon he screamed as it snapped at his nose aaaaahhh hold still the snout said how do you expect me to chomp your face off but the man was uncooperative he hauled himself away so violently that her arms stretched like toffee he spun about wrenching free and leaped into his box in a moment the box roared shot out a cloud of gas and squealed rapidly away i think that thing has indigestion jenny said giggling not to mention the man inside it well he shouldnt have tried to get fresh with a demon ess metria said resuming her set mundane aspect i think he wont try it again jenny agreed but already another vehicle was squealing to a stop this one seemed to be stuffed full of young men hey babe one called how about a smooch metria found that this sort of thing palled fairly quickly so she turned her whole body into that of a dragon and roared back at them this time no door opened and the ve hicle squealed away as rapidly as it had come now at last they could complete their test of the limits of roc and a hard place the aisle metria took one more step and remained present she took another and still was there then she lost her nerve and retreated the aisles strong enough meanwhile ichabod had gotten his own vehicle loaded i stepped out of your aisle several times he said as he re turned to amolde i felt the difference but it was tolerable for brief periods i believe you are correct we are well charged with magic and it takes time for it to dissipate but we had better resolve the current mission expeditiously that was his way of suggesting that they hurry metria knew but she wanted to do one thing first i was trying to get beyond the front end of the aisle of magic she said but kept running afoul of mundanes or foul mundanes and lost my nerve but i think i should find out exactly what happens when i enter mundania proper maybe its not so bad would you guide me where you have been and bring me back if i understand ichabod said graciously rest assured i would not allow anyone with appurtenances like yours to come to grief if i could help it come this way he meant her legs mainly she followed him around the back of the house while jenny remained with amolde who had not moved the centaur understood the importance of keeping the aisle exactly as it was so they could experiment the phenomenon does appear to be significantly more capacious than during its original manifestation ichabod remarked by perhaps fifty percent that is about three paces out perhaps ten feet observe i scuffed a mark by my back door here where i noted the diminution of the ambi ence where the magic stops metria translated stopping just short of the line would you mind um holding my hand as i cross mind ichabod said as if in doubt dear creature i would consider it a privilege thank you pleased she gave him her most fetching piers anthony smile then took his hand nerved herself and stepped across the line everything turned awful she was swirling out of control dissipating in all directions and losing her mind then after a yearlong instant she found herself strewn around ichabod every which way in severe disorder huh she inquired intelligently are you functional he asked she drew in her extremities from around him and got her head together i think so what happened you dissolved into a dust devil that is a twist of wind carrying dust and leaves i tried to push you back into the aisle with my body but couldnt quite get hold of you and feared i was merely disrupting you fortunately amolde re alized what had happened and stepped sideways one pace that brought the ambience to your locale and your persona reformed a dust devil she echoed blankly at times the wind is channeled into a circular vortex generating a relative low pressure interior which sucks in dust extreme examples become tornadoes or even hurri canes but most dust devils swirl for only a few seconds then dissipate they have no lasting cohesion i realized that this was likely to be your fate if you remained clear of the magic so you got me back in it she said i think you saved my existence ichabod that explained why she was wrapped around him she had been no more than energy in the air and when he tried to push her back he had simply stepped into the swirl thank you she shaped her head into its best configuration made her prettiest face and kissed him firmly on the mouth he looked about ready to faint indeed he sagged somewhat so that she had to support him but he was not in discomfort there was a dazed smile in the vicinity of his mouth and his eyes seemed to glow thank you he breathed but please if you would roc and a hard place whatever you wish friend she said obligingly put your clothing back on oh she had lost that detail in the confusion of the dis solution hastily she reformed shoes skirt and blouse in that order then his eyes dimmed back to medium and he recovered his equilibrium he might be old but his reflexes seemed to be normal amolde and jenny were two paces away it seems that we now know the mundane reversion of demons amolde said they are the flux that animates the currents of the wind in xanth they possess awareness and control becom ing immortal in mundania they lack these qualities so rap idly dissipate and so a longstanding question has at length been re solved ichabod agreed thanks to the courage of the de moness metria courage metria snorted i just wanted to know what would happen if i got out of the aisle now i know id better not try it courage is as one defines it amolde said um maybe i should try that also jenny said im not brave but it does make a difference whether i turn into a regular girl or a swirl of dust to be sure ichabod agreed step this way metria watched as the two approached the line in the dirt and stepped across it the elf girl held her cat tightly in her arms jenny did not disappear or become dust she simply became a childlike girl and the cat did not seem to change at all oh i have five fingers jenny exclaimed and rounded ears ichabod added you have become distressingly normal ugh jenny quickly stepped back into the magic but then she changed her mind and stepped out again the point is to see whether i can safely function in mundania she said and it seems can thats good to know i am not certain that is entirely the case ichabod said piers anthony why whats wrong the mundanes will not be able to understand you out side of the aisle you are speaking the magic language of xanth which all humanoids know but it sounds like gib berish to mundanes oh so if i leave the aisle id better not speak correct your first words would give away your alien origin that will not be a problem for metria who cant depart the aisle or amolde who carries it with him but you will have to be cautious in fact id better not stray unless i really have to jenny concluded that is my opinion and the same surely goes for your cat jenny considered that id better put him on a leash she decided he wont like it but i dont want us both getting hopelessly lost in mundania a sensible precaution they turned and returned to the aisle they had not gone far but there was no doubt that jenny had been operating well enough outside the aisle as she crossed back into it her ears pointed again and her hands and surely her toes too diminished to four digits per appendage a thumb and three fingers the magic to the world of two moons did not apply to mundania any better than that of xanth did now we must travel ichabod said briskly since we do not know the address we shall have to be guided by the summons token i hope we can proceed without further pro crastination yes lets move metria said ichabod put a crate down behind his truckvehicle and amolde mounted this carefully and stepped up into the back of the truck which had now been fitted with high sides j jenny joined him there metria was about to do the same but ichabod stopped her i must have you in front to direct me demoness roc and a hard place oh right she watched him get into the enclosed front portion of the vehicle then popped into the seat beside him perhaps it would be better not to move that way ich abod suggested we do not want to attract undue attention to ourselves oh thats rightdemons dont exist in mundania she said except as swirls of wind ill watph my manners he took a small key and used it to unlock something on the front side but no door opened instead a dragon growled so close it seemed almost on top of them metria dissolved into smoke but caught herself before she drifted out of the vehicle whats that she asked reforming ichabod glanced at her his eyes went opalescent again that is the motor starting he said have no concern but if you dont mindyour clothing oh she kept forgetting it was hard to keep such details in mind when such strange things were going on she formed the necessary items understand i have no objection to your er natural ap pearance ichabod said in fact i find it extremely ap pealing but i fear i would be unable to drive well with such a distraction and any other male who perceived your assets would suffer similarly my what she asked glancing down at herself then she realized that he had not used a bad word you mean if we were alone and nobody else could see thered be no problem she had a suspicion about the answer after all it wasnt as if she were completely inexperienced with hu man males he seemed to hesitate i ah er um that is to say per haps not but that seems an unlikely eventuality that was his way of saying that his orbs would bum out satisfied metria brought out the kim token and held it be fore her she was lucky those hadnt been lost when she stepped out of the aisle that way she said pointing as it tugged ichabod reached for her knee curious she watched his piers anthony hand but it stopped just short landing instead on the knee like knob on top of a stick poking from the floor he wiggled the stick then he pushed his feet against pedals on the floor this was evidently a magic ritual the vehicle lurched forward metria held her position and turned her head back to see how the two in back were taking it they were all right amolde must have ridden in this contraption before and warned jenny about it the two had gotten along very well ever since discovering that each was isolated from his or her natural species er ichabod said glancing at her she completed the turn of her head yes you just did a onehundredandeightydegree rotation of your head he said and then made it three hundred and sixty degrees so that isnt done among humans oh again of course mortals had inconvenient anatomical limits you mean i shouldnt do that it might attract adverse attention which we would prefer to avoid that meant not to do it she sighed mundania is a dull place i agree emphatically now the truck began to move forward though he hadnt finished moving his feet or playing with the wheel angled before him the craft pulled out onto the road turned in the direction she had indicated and gath ered speed this turned out to be respectable it was about as fast as a magic carpet how do you make it mind she asked you havent said a word to it he smiled now that would be novel teaching a de moness to drive why not he considered why not indeed very well metria i am making the truck respond not by verbal commands but by the actions of my hands and feet the key turns on the motor roc and a hard place and the levers connect it to the wheels i steer it with the steering wheel here fascinating she said its a mindless machine to be sure i must guide it constantly or it will go astray she asked more questions and he evidently flattered by the interest explained about the obscure mechanisms of clutch brakes steering column driveshaft and turning sig nals metria paid close attention it seemed that mundania was not quite as dull as she had thought she could have some fun with a contraption like this if she ever got the chance she checked with the token it seemed to have no trouble keeping track of its object though kim was across a stretch of magicless terrain the simurgh must have seen to that refusing to let her artifacts be limited by mundane consid erations but now it was tugging somewhat to the side we are drifting offcourse metria announced that is inevitable given the limits of the highway sys tem i shall have to angle toward it never fear we shall get there in due course he turned at the next intersection and turned again when the direction still wasnt right it seemed that it was not pos sible in mundania to go directly where one wanted to go so they kept moving and metria kept learning about the ways of controlling the vehicle and at other times gazing but at the changingly dull scenery of the region they passed many blocky buildings and many sections of field between and sometimes some bits of forest other ve hicles prowled constantly on both sides of the road it seemed that each had to stay on its own side according to the direction it was going or there would be an awful crash at last the tugs on the token got stronger we are coming close metria said excellent we are approaching squeedunk what age is kim piers anthony nineteen by now if folk age at the regular rate in mun dania then she is college age she could be at the squeedunk community college community collage do they paste unrelated things to gether to make a picture he smiled in a sense metria they try to educate ju veniles which may be about as much of an art soon they came to the scc campus the buildings were large and covered with blue glassy squares young human folk walked between them carrying armfuls of books some had spread blankets on the flat green sward and were sunning themselves in scant attire they are wearing less than i am metria said pouting they are less endowed than you are he said diplo matically less whatted healthy curvaceous symmetrical proportioned statu esque comely stacked whatever he said with a smile you would disrupt traffic and classes so must mask your assets there was that word again my whats charms are we going right she checked the token that way she said pointing to a building ichabod brought the truck around to the parking lot nearest the building i hope she lives on the ground floor he said why how will we get to her out of reach of the aisle amolde will have to go in with us a centaur in mundania better for you to go naked metria sorted that out and concluded that he meant that it wasnt practical for amolde to enter the building he was probably right the centaur wouldnt enjoy the narrow steps and halls and landings metria could see and might attract roc and a hard place more attention than was wise so it would be best if he re mained in the truck but that meant that the rest of them would have to stay there too except for ichabod and maybe jenny jenny couldnt speak outside the aisle so it would have to be the man so you fetch her men are not allowed in the womens dormitories he said it is one of those archaic regulations that still obtain in the hinterlands she realized that he was making a funny but wasnt quite sure about what they got out and walked to the rear of the truck amoldes head and shoulders showed above the high side we have arrived the centaur asked at the girls dormitory but we have a problem she may be out of reach they discussed it but before they came to a conclusion some students approached xibut vq epmm a young man called to metria metria looked at ichabod this is mundane speech yes he just inquired whats up doll he will become intelligible once he enters the aisle doll it is an overly familiar mode of address to an unfamiliar woman thats what i thought suppose i put on a dragons snout and bite his head off i wouldnt recommend it we dont wish to make a scene she had been afraid he would say that so how do i squelch this clod of dragon manure perhaps i had better handle this then as the youth reached them ichabod said were you addressing my mar ried daughter jenny remained out of sight so this had to be metria oops the young man said abashed in three fifths of a moment he was gone that was fun i confess ichabod said piers anthony a young woman approached oooo she squealed is that a horse in there metria realized that amoldes speckled flank showed through the slats of the side not exactly she said but im sure i sawyes thats definitely horseflesh the girl said peering through amolde looked at her from above the side that horseflesh belongs to me he said would you like a closer look oops metria opened her mouth but couldnt think of any thing to say oooo yes the girl cried jumping up and down in her excitement metria knew that did interesting things to her sweater because ichabods eyes were starting to shine then perhaps i might prevail on you for a favor first arnolde said oh sure anything what was the centaur up to there is a young woman we would like to talk with but of course we cant go into the dormitory being male would you be kind enough to take a message to her sure the girl agreed straining to get a better glimpse so far she had not been able to make the connection between the horseflesh and the talking man her name is kim if you take this emerald disk to her perhaps she will come out here amolde nodded toward metria metria was not easy about this but had no choice but to hand over the disk emerald the girl said but its black it has become somewhat corroded with age amolde said smoothly oh then the girl made another connection but why couldnt you go in to find her she asked metria youre about as female as ive ever seen ii metria said but stalled almost immediately she has a speech impediment ichabod said quickly roc and a hard place terrible stuttering please dont embarrass her by mention ing it oh sure no the girl agreed be back in a jiff she hurried off with the token suppose she doesnt take it to kim metria asked sin cerely worried a summons by the simurgh will travel only to its proper summonsee amolde said the girl will not even think of taking it elsewhere how can you be sure of that i am a centaur scholar oh of course for once metria wasnt annoyed by the superior certainty of the species soon enough kim came running out garbed much as me tria herself was she had been a lanky girl somewhat plain now she had put on some flesh where it counted and redone her hair and looked more like a woman especially while running metria she cried instantly recognizing the de moness what on earth are you doing out here in civilian clothing how can i understand her from this distance metria asked because i turned to capture her in my aisle arnolde replied then kim reached metria and hugged her emphatically i never thought id be so glad to see you demoness but how is it possible this is the real world do you know of the centaur aisle metria asked oh sure but thats old history theres no longer then kim caught sight of amoldes head oh no can it be i thought amolde faded away decades ago reports of my fadeaway have been somewhat exagger ated amolde said extending his hand kim grasped it oh marvelous this is almost as good as visiting xanth but what you will visit xanth metria said i brought you your summons you must return with us piers anthony but i cant do that kim protested i have classes homework obligations they will have to wait amolde informed her no one declines a summons from the simurgh from the simurgh kim stared at the black disk i knew there was something really special about this medal but i cant get into xanth except when i play the game and ive been too busy even to do that what even during summer vacation ichabod asked well theres dug she said blushing then metria understood how summers could disappear two of her own years had disappeared similarly dugs coming too she said i have a summons for him suddenly kirns objections faded away ill tell my roommate to cover for me she said and dashed off meanwhile the messenger girl had returned about that horse she said come in and see amolde said is that wise ichabod asked we made a deal arnolde said let her in so ichabod opened the back just enough to let the girl scramble in then closed it behind her there was a breathless pause then a faint scream oh my are you really i am really arnolde said but please dont tell anyone else because it would make things rather awkward for me and im rather too old to handle awkwardness gracefully not so youd notice ichabod muttered hes a con artist theres no counting how many specimens he talked into posing for us in the madness and whowhat are you the girl asked after a bit jenny elf im too young to handle awkwardness kim emerged from the building carrying a bag my re search paper homework she said maybe ill squeeze it in somehow the other girl emerged from the truck looking dazed thanks jo kim said roc and a hard place any time kim jo walked unsteadily away suppose she talks metria asked who would believe her kim asked come on lets go get dug this time kim got in the front of the truck because she knew exactly where to find dug and since her legs were just as visible as metrias ichabod didnt object metria climbed in back with amolde and jenny elf that girls face must have been something metria re marked as the truck lurched into motion she thought she would see a horse and man and she saw a centaur she did see a horse and man amolde said primly there are both in my ancestry but she did seem about to faint at first jenny said i know how it is i was amazed when i first saw chex for tunately i couldnt see very well so didnt realize just how strange she was until she got me a pair of spectacles yes wings on a centaur would seem extremely strange arnolde agreed until the species gets established which of course may be a problem for the alicentaurs for the what jenny asked winged centaurs he said if they are to be established as a species they need a species name since a winged uni corn is an alicom it is reasonable to call a winged centaur an alicentaur alia for short metria agreed glad that for once it hadnt been her in the middle of a confusion of words but whats the problem a winged centaur is not the easiest crossbreed to achieve arnolde said chex was the result of a liaison between a normal centaur and a hippogriph and cheirons origin has not yet been deciphered presumably a strategi cally placed love spring could result in others but centaurs are generally too intelligent to be deceived and are opposed to crossbreeding anyway since new blood from outside the present alia family is required to make a lasting species vi able prospects for the continuation seem remote piers anthony no they arent metria said both jenny and amolde looked at her i presume you have some insight we lack the centaur said in a tone that indicated that she probably didnt certainly magician trent has been rejuvenated and his powers of transformation are as good as they ever were he transformed cynthia human to cynthia centaur seventy four years ago and she has now had a bit of rejuvenation herself and is hot for che centaur so trent can do it again he can transform humans to alia or centaurs to alia or anything else probably it would be best to start with centaurs because theyre already smart and know the form theyd just have to leam to fly and since the magic of all winged centaurs is similar making them light enough to fly thats no problem they wouldnt have to soil their hands on any other obscen ity of magic talents amolde and jenny were staring at her out of the mouths of fools and babes the centaur said trailing off into some private thought i think shes got it jenny said transformation whos a fool or a baby metria demanded he said babe not baby jenny said oh very proficiently very what jenny asked suitable proper appropriate felicitous germane healthy well whatever arnolde said before metria could answer making a cross expression jenny laughed and metria had to too then the truck clunked to a halt they looked out and saw another dormitory just like the first but with boys mostly surrounding it kim got out and walked up to the side until she stood under a particular window then she put two fin gers in her mouth and make a piercing whistle in a moment a head appeared in the window and a hand waved be right down dug called roc and a hard place i thought there was no magic in mundania metria said the magic power women have over men is every where amolde explained soon dug emerged from the building and kim brought him over to the truck he had fleshed out somewhat since metria had last seen him and looked stronger and hand somer the demoness metria has something for you she told him i dont need it as long as ive got you he replied gallantly kim smiled looking rather pretty in that moment its a summons for jury duty his jaw dropped what obligation onus burden charge litigation trial me tria offered helpfully court case amolde suggested whatever jenny kim and metria chorused looking mirthfully cross but they dont have that stuff in xanth dug protested oh indeed they do amolde reassured him the trial of gracile ossein was notorious dug looked at kim who nodded affirmatively she was better versed on xanth history than he was grace is a female walking skeleton marrow bones wife she was tried for messing up a bad dream sent to tristan troll for not eating an innocent human little girl but thats backwards he said trolls shouldnt eat children and bad dreams should be sent for kim shut him up by pulling his head down and kissing him always nice to see proper control metria murmured appreciatively she has certainly learned how to handle him girls do amolde agreed metria reached down and presented dug with his token but i cant go to xanth now he said i have homework papers to write piers anthony im going kirn said let me check out he hurried back into the building classes were getting tiresome anyway kirn remarked though our grades are bound to suffer because of our ab sence and missed work soon dug reappeared metria was glad that the toughest part of her search was done all the rest of the summonsees were in xanth demon driver kim and dug rode in the back discussing old times with jenny elf so metria was once again in the front they were driving first to kirns home because she absolutely refused to go to xanth without her dog bubbles for a time they rode in silence hes looking at your knees mentia remarked k so theyre good knees i shaped them that way but i showed them to him first well you didnt show him your panties metria retorted annoyed not only would that have freaked him out it would have violated the adult conspiracy hes a hundred years old metria thought and in his second childhood she had a point good thing i had no panties when i forgot my clothing piers anthony penny for your thoughts ichabod said mundane coins arent worth much in xanth i mean that i am curious about what is going on in your mind that has you focusing so intently if you care to tell me there seemed to be no harm in it so she told him i was talking with my worser half d mentia she said you were looking at my knees well i was i have been a connoisseur of distaff limbs since adolescence of what limbs the distaff is a long staff for holding wool flax or other fibrous material from which the thread is drawn out when spinning by hand since this was almost invariably the work of women the distaff came to be a generalized symbol of womanhood thus i was speaking metaphorically speaking how using a parallel analogy correspondence likeness af finity kinship similarity synecdoche or more properly metonymy he said crossly then he did a double take how did you come up with that term i have no idea words are strictly accidental with me you are an interesting creature ichabod remarked as he drove on toward xanth that is to say all supernatural entities are intriguing in their separate fashions but you seem remarkable even for a demoness what accounts for your er unusual way with words i think a sphinx stepped on part of my demon substance when i was new and squished it flat ever since some words have been riddles and my character has been subject to fis sioning oh is that how you change from metria to mentia and to woe betide she agreed assuming the form of the sweet sad child do other demons have multiple personalities she switched back to metria because the question was too roc and a hard place complicated for the tyke to answer no others assume any aspect they wish but inside they are always the same evil spirits im the only one who takes those personalities seri ously when im the child i mustnt violate the adult con spiracy when im mentia im slightly crazy except when in the region of madness when i reverse and become slightly sane when im metria i have a problem of vocab ulary fascinating in mundania multiple personality disor dermpdusually stems from some difficult event in childhood such as sexual abuse well getting stepped on by a sphinx distracted by a rid dle isnt exactly easy to take he laughed surely so so you did have a traumatic early experience as a mature individual you could have handled that stepping on but as a nascent one you couldnt so you suffered some subtle psychological damage this was a revelation this is true i mean do other people really suffer conditions like mine because of early whatevers early traumas yes this does seem to be the case though psychological opinion is by no means unified we believe it is the humanand perhaps demonminds way of dealing with what cannot otherwise be handled or perhaps it is merely the shock of the abuse itself striking the forming personality like a hammer and cracking it into several frag ments each fragment then tries to heal itself forming indi vidual personalities but never with complete success because something broken is simply not as strong as something whole he glanced at her face for a moment as is perhaps the case with your vocabulary you obvi ously possess a full repertoire of words but your mechanism for recollecting the particular one you need at a given mo ment is imperfect yes thats exactly what i have languished what you have suffered he agreed oh ichy i could smack you piers anthony he was taken aback what osculate buss peck smooch kiss whatever she said and kissed him firmly on the right ear now at last i know why i am as i am i have mpd the truck slewed for a moment and a half before going straight again i am glad to have been of help ichabod said but if you ever kiss me again please do it when im not driving sorry about that oh dont be just be careful in future it is dangerous for a man my age to suffer such distraction while behind the wheel ill try she said contritely this alternate personality mentiayou actually have di alogues with her shouldnt i usually one personality dominates or the other they dont hold direct discourses well i am usually in charge but she fissioned off when i did the disgusting thing of getting half souled and falling in love shes the half without the soul so she retains the old demonly values woe betide is satisfied to share half my half soul when shes in charge so shes quartersouled but mentias curious about just what i get from my soul in much the way i was curious about the matter before i got it so she rejoined me and she takes over when she needs to do you want to talk with her not exactly i am merely curious about what the two of you have to have a dialogue about since both of you must have had much the same experiences in your existence we have but we place different interpretations on them what would one of your dialogues concern love mainly she just doesnt understand it few do who havent experienced it would it be pos sible toto listen to such a dialogue r roc and a hard place for sure mentia said what kind of idiocy can make a once sensible demoness suddenly become caring self sacrificing and dedicated to making her indifferent husband deliriously happy several times a day she calls it love but i dont see anything compelling her except perversity who cares whether the man is happy or miserable hes just a stupid mortal he doesnt deserve all that attention i dont consider it idiocy metria responded i get real pleasure myself from making him happy its a mutual thing my desires are defined in terms of his desires before i fell in love my life was empty in a way i never realized now it is full in a way i never anticipated love gives me fulfill ment fulfillment why not chain yourself to a dungeon while youre at it you delight in your misery it is only your ignorance that makes it look like misery to you it is sheer joy to me you revel in your humiliation if your values werent inverted youd know its exalta tion yours are inverted im true to demonly nature i think i get the picture ichabod said a person with out a soul simply cant grasp its nature and a person without love thinks its pointless thats right metria said i was governed mainly by curiosity and mischief before i got half souled but my cu riosity was in the end greater than my mischief so i took the plunge and got married i seem to recall amolde saying something about a de moness with a soul who married a king in the past but when her baby was delivered the soul went with the baby and the demoness took off with a rude noise will that hap pen to you yes that was my friend dara demoness who married king humfrey her son dafrey got the soul but later she returned to humfrey because she discovered that she liked existence with a soul better than existence without a soul piers anthony now she emulates a soul she doesnt have so i wont give up my half soul when my baby is delivered ill share half of it and hope that a quarter soul sustains me my child wont have that problem souls grow to full size when a creature is part mortal you have a generous nature yes now when i first saw you or mentia there in the madness i took you for a variant of a nymph a creature without much intellectual content i was mistaken she shrugged its understandable i never cared about intellect before i married they reached kirns home her parents were evidently out kim dashed in and emerged leading her old dog i left a message on the kitchen table so they wont think bub bles was stolen she announced then she lifted the dog into the back and scrambled in herself metria knew that bubbles would be reassured to find jenny elf and sammy cat there because they had been companions during the game metria wondered how it was that the dog could sur vive in mundania as she was very old but thought that the magic of xanth could have charged her when she visited there in effect rejuvenating her somewhat this excursion should have similar effect in that case they drove for a while in silence then ichabod remarked once we return to xanth amolde and i will resume our researches in the region of madness but i am curious as to the identity of your next summonsee i hadnt thought about it i have to guide kim and dug to the nameless castle of course but that will take time as they cant just pop over there and we wont have the assis tance of a giant so i suppose i had better travel a meander ing course and pick up the remaining summonsees on the way beginning with the most difficult and who would that be she opened her bag and checked through the tokens chena centaur because i never heard of her roc and a hard place perhaps amolde has he has a centaurs encyclopedic knowledge ill check metria turned smoky and slid through the metal of the vehicle she emerged in the back the four folk there were resting comfortably amolde lying down jenny elf leaning against his side and kim and dug snugly en sconced in a comer amolde do you know chena cen taur the old scholar shook his head she must be since my time the name makes no connection thank you she slid back to the front seat and solidi fied he doesnt know her either then i agree she may be your most challenging re maining summonsee he shook his head i am growing tired it has been too long since i drove any distance in fact i should probably turn in my drivers license after this is done i have little remaining use for mundania i can do it metria said i have learned all the com mands he laughed then he sobered do you know i believe you could you have been a most apt student of this art perhaps it would be safer trusting your alertness rather than my failing powers then let me she said eagerly oh i really wasnt serious i he lost his voice for she had fogged out her skirt almost to the panty line ill sit in your lap she said stunned by the notion he offered no further resistance she sat in his lap so she could comfortably reach the controls and operated them she fogged herself out enough to reduce her weight so as not to be a burden on him but he showed no sign of complaining she drove at first un steadily but soon with confidence the machine responded marvelously to her slightest nudge on the steering wheel or gopedal it was like riding a responsive unicorn except that no selfrespecting unicorn would suffer itself to be ridden this truck didnt seem to mind at all piers anthony darkness was closing in its dull mundane way as they reached ichabods house i think we shall be obliged to stay the night here as it would not be safe for us to drive by night he opined but we should be all right if amolde is properly positioned so far i am aware of no diminution of his ambience no less magic around him either she said she used the steerwheel and slowpedal and got the truck beside the house then it coughed jerked and died oh i killed it she said chagrined my fault i forgot to remind you to use the clutch the motor stalled oh she had learned about the clutch but not thought of it in her effort to steer the vehicle just right have no concern metria it has been a real pleasure having me drive she asked pleased that too he said as she lifted her bottom off his lap amolde settled down in thte center room of the house so that the aisle reached the length of it and just about to the sides of it sammy and bubbles curled up beside him evi dently thinking of him as more animal than human being which made him acceptable company kim and jenny checked supplies and found no suitable food he had been too long away from here no problem kim said cheer fully ill order pizza piece of what metria asked dug laughed youll like this shes going to do some mundane magic kim did she picked up a banana shaped item with a curly tailed line attached punched some buttons in its belly and spoke into it falling blocks pizza two jumbo giant cheesers to this address she seemed to be requesting something then she put the banana back on its stand not long thereafter a vehicle charged up to the house so rapidly it looked as if it was about to crash but it squealed to a stop just in time and a young man scrambled out with roc and a hard place two wide flat boxes dug gave him some folding green pa per and in a moment he zoomed away dug brought the boxes inside and opened them there were two huge flat pies with surfaces like that of the moon in heavy sunlight blistering cheese the five mortals took piewedges from them and began eating now this is what i call responsive mozzarella dug remarked dangling his slice by a stretching string of cheese and bouncing it like a yoyo oh monster ella metria said finally recognizing the type it came from the ella monster famous for casting long sticky strings of gunk over its prey and smothering it to death she wondered how the mundanes had managed to slay an ella it was a formidable creature but it tasted wonderful this was magic all right but since metria didnt need to eat she was soon bored so she explored the house whats this she asked opening the curtain to a very small bare room that was behind a less small room thats the shower dug said you want someone to take it with you ow because kim had kicked him for no apparent reason take it with me metria repeated it doesnt look as if it can be moved i can show you how it dug began show her kim said as he dodged another kick she got up trailing a string of cheese and approached the cham ber she closed the door to the larger chamber so no one else could see in then she turned two handles in the wall of the smaller one water gushed from a high nozzle vanish your clothing and step in she said metria did so and the warm water struck her bare body hot rain she exclaimed more magic for sure when youve had enough just turn these han dles this way and it will stop thats how you take a shower its weird but nice exactly kim pulled a curtain across and departed piers anthony metria basked in the shower she turned smoky and let it pass through her it was as if she were a cloud and was raining below move over fracto she muttered then she assumed various shapes seeing how the water bounced off them she became a giant pot and let the water fill it more fun but soon enough she tired so she turned the knobs and the water ceased then she turned smoky so that all the water on her fell away and reformed complete with her mundane blouse shirt and footwear she stepped back out to the din ing room i could almost get to like mundania she said mundania would certainly like you dug said and ich abod nodded agreement kim looked studiously elsewhere perhaps because dugs shinwas out of reach of her foot metria was catching on to the nature of their interaction it was as if there were an invisible string of monster ella cheese that kim used to dangle dug from like most men he needed to be leashed the others finished eating and took turns in the shower except for amolde who was too big to fit so he put his front end in then his hind end and dug wielded a hose attachment to get most of the centaur showered meanwhile kim turned on a box with a picture on the side and voices from within it was interesting but seemed to be filled mostly with violence and loudmouthed hustlers metria noticed that panties were openly shown surely freak ing out every male who watched no wonder mundane males were such louts in due course they settled down to sleep setting up mats beside amolde metria didnt need to sleep so she stayed to watch the magic box after a while it showed scenes from some faroff land and became a story between increasingly obnoxious bouts of hustling after that was done there was another story with different scenes it was about a young man who fell in love with a young woman then lost her then regained her metria had never seen such a story before and marveled at its originality she wished she were back roc and a hard place home with veleno making him deliriously happy for her husband had no other purpose in existence than to be made delirious by her she observed the stories interminably until the others woke you watched the movie channel all night kim asked you must be worn out no it was interesting i wonder if we could get one of these magic boxes in xanth its almost as much fun as the gourd maybe corn pewter could arrange it kim said laugh ing jenny entered the showerroom oops i dont like the sound of that kim said i felt the edge of the magic the elf explained but the bathroom is well within the ambience kim said metria took a shower amolde is exactly where he was yesterday maybe im confused jenny said doubtfully whereupon kim in exactly the manner of a woman re versed im not sure of that wed better check they looked at metria so metria stepped very cautiously toward that chamber she extended one arm through the door feeling a tingling and then a numbness and the arm dissolved into a swirl of wind jenny squeezed by her to enter the chamber as she did so her ears and fingers changed she faced back toward me tria and walked up to her pushing the swirl with her body as it crossed the border of magic the swirl became a cloud of demon substance and metria was able to grab it and merge it into herself that was a relief because she had felt diminished without it they exchanged a threeway glance the aisle has shrunk kim said gravely hey whats up girls dug asked approaching they were silent mutually hesitant to spread the alarm arent you going to call me a sexist he asked kim because i didnt say women piers anthony the magics fading kim said bluntly oh shucks i thought our love was forever the magic aisle numskull he sobered in a hurry how much the bathrooms out of it now he angled his head which was his way of doing a mental calculation maybe fifty percent the question is has it been fading steadily from the time arnolde left xanth or is it just giving out now wed better hope that the fading is steady because that will give us time to get the hell moving before it poops out entirely yes kim agreed tersely both amolde and ichabod remained asleep in that state it was clear just how old they were because of the lack of animation of their features and maybe fading magic lets get this organized before we wake them dug said so therere no wasted motions kim and ill load the truckhas it got enough in the tank yes metria said the magic dial says half of its bloat is left its what he asked then immediately ohgas whatever and jenny and metria must stay close to arnolde kim said for moral support for the elders that was one way to put it metria had to stay close to maintain her existence and jenny to maintain her elfhood the two mundanes loaded the truck efficiently and set up the box so that amolde could climb into the back okay its time dug said grimly jenny woke amolde and dug woke ichabod both were slow to be roused and looked around as if befuddled we were afraid of this kim muttered their physical health is tied in with the magic amolde well help you up dug said as if things were routine then he and kim helped haul on the centaurs arms while jenny and metria helped steady his rear end as he lurched unsteadily to his four feet they walked him forward roc and a hard place then half shoved him up into the truck and made him lie down again with his head toward the front that was so metria could sit in the cab within the aisle then they looked back to the house ichabod was tottering walking erratically away from the truck god hes gone senile kim muttered and jumped down to intercept the old man soon she had her arm around his waist and was half encouraging half hauling him onto the truck nuhuh dug said hes not fit to drive put him in back kim nodded they got the man in the truck the dog and cat joined the centaur there too now who drives kim asked what kind of shift is it dug asked stick shift metria said that lets me out kim said all i know is auto me too dug said but i guess id better learn in a hurry because we cant wait i can drive it metria said they both stared at her but youre a demoness kim said i had noticed metria said ichabod taught roe to drive yesterday i drove us much of the way here this is crazy but we cant waste time dug said we dont know how fast the magics fading maybe with a li censed driver up front with her me kim said i wont be distracted by her legs good point he agreed lets move out they closed up the back and metria turned smoky and phased through the truck directly to the drivers seat rather than risk stepping to the side and maybe out of the narrowing aisle of magic kim joined her ill do map duty kim said digging into the panel in front other seat put on your seat belt but no belt can hold me put it on anyway kim said buckling hers we dont want to attract any traffic cops attention piers anthony metria used the key and started the motor remembering to use the clutch pedal she knew she had to do everything right because they couldnt afford any accident she put it in gear and let the clutch pedal rise slowly the brake kim snapped oh yes just in time metria released the hand brake traffics clear ahead kim said metria pulled the truck slowly in a circle and then onto the road turning the steering wheel she was doing it she got it straight and used the pedals and stick to get it through the gears and up to full speed keep to the right of the road kim said oops yes it was just as well that kim was with her because there were a number of details to keep track of and they tended to get lost around the edges kim studied her map and called out a particular magic symbol to look for which marked the route they needed to follow metria hadnt been aware of that ichabod had known the area so hadnt needed any map or route this business of driving was more complicated than it had seemed then just as she was getting accustomed to it something happened drunk driver kim muttered see that wee wawing stay clear of him whats a drunk driver someone whos intoxicated you know dizzy crazy li able to do anything dangerous in a car kim glanced back i hope jenny doesnt catch on shed freak out but what does jenny elf know of dunked drivers just get the bleep elsewhere fast but the traffic had closed in so she couldnt get away from the crazy car so she tried to keep some distance from it following kirns advice then it happened a girl was crossing the road and the drunk car was headed right for her not stopping as it should drat i knew it kim said wincing if theyd just stop coddling those lushes there was a scream another girl ran out in front of the roc and a hard place car getting between it and the first girl pushing her out of the way but then the car struck the second girl meanwhile metria was slewing to a halt so as not to hit car or girl herself she saw the second girl lying by the side of the road and heard the first girl screaming oh god no we cant stop kim said itd be the end of you and of amolde and maybe of ichabod and jenny if we get caught up in this weve got to get out of here but already things were jammed because of the accident they couldnt drive on they had to wait while a screaming vehicle zoomed up and took the girls away of all the things to happen kim moaned all because of that damned drunk they should lock them all up for ever a mundane demon garbed in blue came to the truck you a witness he asked glancing down at metrias legs which were very full and bare below her hikedup skirt the drunk car aimed for the smaller girl but the bigger girl pushed her out of the way metria said ixnay kim whispered we cant get involved but the blue demon was already asking another question how do you know he was drunk he glanced down her blouse which happened to be somewhat loose above show ing the fullness thereof he was sliding all across the road metria said the demon nodded your license please my what heres mine kim cried thrusting a small card under the demons nose he frowned considering it then nodded as he made a note you may receive a summons to appear at court to testify he said have a nice day ladies he took one more glance at metrias assets wavered slightly unsteadily on his feet and moved on to the next vehicle behind them that summons will come to me kim said good thing he didnt think to get your identity too or to look in the back of the truck piers anthony well i did my part metria said lengthening her skirt and raising her decolletage ive had some experience be fuddling mens minds and it seems to work about as well on mundanes as on xanthians fortunately kim glanced at her appraisingly yes that sort of magic does seem to be universal for those who have the equipment i was almost afraid that cops eyes would bulge out of their sockets i suppose were lucky he didnt ask you for a date i could have given him one but it would have dissolved the moment it left my presence thats date as in he gets to take you to a meal or movie and run his hands over your body oh i wish id known that might have been fun no it wouldnt remember youre married that too metria agreed thinking of the cops face on such a date when she made her body smoky and impossible to touch but of course i cant leave the aisle of magic yes i hope we get out of here soon that magic must be fading all the time finally they did get moving the speed of the traffic be came faster in direct proportion to its distance from the cop cars so that they progressed rapidly toward xanth but all was not completely well the magic was dimin ishing at first metria felt it in her toes which were the farthest from amolde they tingled for a while but then they were turning numb she looked down and felt an almost mortal chill kim my toes are gone kim looked they must be outside the magic weve got to do something she knocked on the window to the back until dugs face showed get arnolde closer she yelled metrias toes are going there was a scramble in back then sensation returned to her toes they had gotten the centaur moved up as close against the wall as possible so the magic was back but she knew this wouldnt last long it didnt all too soon the dread tingling resumed then the roc and a hard place dread numbness im losing my feet she said i wont be able to push the magic command pedals we cant stop kim said ill have to do it but youll have to tell me how because im an absolute ignoramus on standard shift take my place metria said well have to stop so we can change no just sit in my lap and sink through me oh yeahyou can dissolve so kim scrambled across and metria turned smoky so that she wound up sitting on top instead of on the bottom then she started to drift over to the other seat but paused when she felt the tingling again oops the aisle kim said its getting shorter and narrower you cant go that way id better go in back then no we dont want to alarm them cant you curl up in a ball or something and sit in my lap certainly metria assumed the form of a lap dragon curled and snoozing but soon kim had to use the gearstick theres a stop light ahead what do i do metria pinched her left leg gently using a paw with claws retracted push the clutch pedal down then she pinched her right arm let me guide you she curled the tail around it and pushed kirns hand along the sides of the magic h pattern of the gearshift by coordinating foot and hand she got the job done weird kim said i dont know how folk ever sur vived when all they had was this kind of shift and that clutch is well named it makes my stomach clutch trying to coordinate it then she glanced ahead oh no what metria asked resuming curledup mode this looks like a ganginfested comer theyre holding up cars for money or worse and i cant avoid it this is bad piers anthony this is awful a girl can get in real trouble when shes caught by animals like these oh monsters metria knew how to deal with those can you get them to reach in here i dont want them reaching in here i want to shut those punks out then she made the connection oh yes prob ably she cranked the window down the truck rolled to a stop in a moment the scene kim feared began to develop a young man whose aspect was somewhere between that of a tired ogre and a sick troll ap peared hey whatcha got chick he demanded nothing for you snotnose kim replied politely now go away hey we got a fresh one here he said you know what we do to fresh chicks around here i could care less sewerbreath we shake em down good he reached in and grabbed the front of her blouse now cough up some change or ill rip this right off you my pet wouldnt like it punk kim warned him your pet aint going to get it girlie then metria opened her dragons mouth wide and clamped it on the exposed arm yeow the youth yelled let go you let go kim said evenly i warned you about my pet he shook his arm and hauled on it metria clamped down harder and exhaled a small curl of flame the man screamed with pain i suggest you stifle it kim said because noise an noys my pet and then she starts chewing harder the punk took a better look at what had hold of his arm metria snorted a demonstration flame through her nose and winked he opened his mouth to scream she clamped down harder warningly he managed to stifle it now give me your wallet kim said like hell roc and a hard place metria breathed a bit more heat past her teeth lightly toasting his arm the punk reached into his pocket and pulled out his wallet it was stuffed with money extorted from other drivers meanwhile the way had opened ahead okay you can go now kim said i recommend that you not tell your friends what just happened here metria opened her jaws and let the arm go the punk jerked it out theres a damned dragon in here he cried it bit my arm its got fire and everything meanwhile with metrias help kim was getting the car in gear as she pulled it out the other punks approached they robbed me the punk was yelling her and that dragon got my wallet metria assumed the form of the softest furriest dearest little cat kitten she could imagine the feline equivalent of woe betide she put her head up by the window mew she said sweetly the other punks almost fell over laughing some dragon i did try to warn him kim said then the truck was out of their range and accelerating yes you did metria agreed with a cheshire grin that was almost fun kim remarked as they resumed normal travel we make a decent team metria purred but all was not well the aisle was still shrinking and metria had to hunch herself in to avoid the warning tingle how far she asked maybe another hour kim said but you know theres no road to xanth metria had forgotten about that i dont think we can make it afoot arnolde was hardly able to walk before and ichabod i know so well have to drive crosscountry and hope we make it because without amolde metria knew exactly what she meant amolde was all that piers anthony stood between metria herself and a dissolving swirl of dust crosscountry she agreed kim checked her map then turned off the main road onto a dirt trail she followed that as far as she could until it too went the wrong way then she bucked the truck across a field hey whatcha doing dug shouted from in back youre bouncing us all over the place trying to get us to xanth kim yelled back just hang on women drivers he said and shut up they found a small winding trail that went approximately the right way but it was no delight as kim zoomed too fast along it thats sugar sand ahead she said if i even slow down well be stuck but sugar sand is good to eat metria said not in mundania it isnt she plowed into the sandy section and metria felt the truck slewing and slowing but it managed to keep going if we dont make it pretty quick we arent going to kim said grimly not all of us anyway metria agreed for the first time in her long existence she felt the threatening fear of extinc tion already the tingling was tweaking her dragon tail when it extended beyond kirns lap the aisle was still shrinking then the trail veered whimsically away to the side my dead reckoning says xanth is straight ahead kim said if i follow the trail it may take us away from xanth but if i dont metrias dragon ears were starting to tingle she flattened them down then changed to woe betide whose ears didnt project as far go for it she said we are about out of time you got it get me into low gear woe betide helped her with the motion of the stick through the labyrinth of the h the truck slowed but seemed to have more power roc and a hard place hang on kim said grimly were going until we stop metria hung on hoping that those in back were doing the same she watched as the scene through the windshield got rough the truck bucked like an angry unicorn and charged for the trees of the forest just as it seemed they would crash into a treetrunk kim steered slightly to the right and missed the nearest tree then slewed to the left and grazed the next they plowed through thick brush that couldnt be avoided the forest realizing that kim couldnt be bluffed gave way and they ground on slowly toward xanth the ride was bumpy but tolerable then they came to a marsh uhoh kim muttered i dont know how deep this is but well find out she revved up the engine and squashed on in at first the truck was game but the farther it went the slower it got the wheels are spinning kim said but they were still moving forward and ahead the ground was rising they nudged toward it and the truck began to lift out of the muckand then the motor stalled bleep kim swore wires mustve shorted she tried to start the motor again but it would have none of it they were definitely stuck book of kings kim sagged in the seat we didnt make it she said what now we cant haul amolde through this muck and he sure cant haul himself we cant leave him for two or three solid reasons and without him woe betide was only a child but she knew what kim wasnt saying without arnoldes aisle of magic ichabod would probably die and she herself would dissolve into a swirl of wind only kim dug and jenny nonelf would be able to trudge on to xanth so she asked a childish question could arnolde maybe slide forward to dry land if the front of the truck wasnt there i guess but what would that gain could he maybe be pushed if we had a sledge to hold him suppose so but we dont roc and a hard place could we push it through that rocky tangle ahead if we had a channel what is the point of this woe we cant change the landscape yes we can what are you talking about your magic talent kim laughed bitterly i dont have any magic talent im mundane remember the one you won kim reconsidered oh you mean the talent of erasure i got for winning the game three years ago i can use that only in the game only in xanth same thing then kim did a double take were go ing to xanth i could use it there what about in the aisle kirns jaw dropped whyi never thought to try try woe betide said kim put her hand against the dashboard and stroked side ways as if washing it that section disappeared as if it were part of a picture that had been erased the brush of the swamp bank showed through that gap kim touched the hole with her other hand its gone she said the whole front of the truck is gone then she made a reverse stroke with her palm toward her that erased the erasure and the dashboard was restored so erase whats ahead and push amolde through woe betide said maybe it would work kim said awed as long as the magic lasts maybe we can make it after all sure woe betide said eagerly but this has to be sensible i can erase the truck and maybe some of the terrain but there needs to be something to replace it kim erased the front of the truck again this time using broader strokes then smoothed her hand across the air that was in the hole a kind of dull blah substance piers anthony filled in smeared paints from what i just erased she said instead of restoring i smeared it back that makes a base i think shame to ruin ichabods truck but this is an emer gency then she turned around this id better erase excruciat ingly carefully because i dont want to erase amolde too she moved her hand slowly across the back of the cab in a moment and a half the barrier between the front and the back was gone dug peered through the hole with sammy and bubbles at his feet what are you girls doing he demanded first you plunge into a swamp now using my talent kim replied the trucks mired and dead we need to go on by ourselves amolde and ichabod cant we have a plan ill erase what gets in our way im not in your way he said stepping back behind him both arnolde and ichabod seemed to be unconscious kim smiled briefly i wont erase you dug well need you to push the boat boat woe betide smiled as she took a place almost astride the unconscious centaur ship craft vessel canoe raft stifle it tyke what boat the one im erasing kim said she had now gotten the rest of the barrier out and was starting on the back of the truck he looked at jenny does this make sense to you elf no jenny said so its not a gender or age thing he said shaking his head do you think shes lost her marbles no woe betide said its an intelligence thing okay genius what is she doing shes making a boat by erasing everything thats not a boat woe betide explained dug squinted i see but theres a problem just let me do it kim said concentrating on her careful roc and a hard place erasing and occasional restoring she was clearing away the truck from the edges leaving an intact platform in the center then it stopped happening she tried repeatedly to erase the side panel but it resisted remaining real thats the problem dug said you cant erase outside the magic and it doesnt extend far enough out to the sides but if amolde turns so that the aisle angles across the sides kim said then everyone else will have to turn with him and even so its just a flat platform not a boat kim paused considering then she resumed her work i can carve a boat out of the middle without erasing whats farther out she said and i can make sides she dem onstrated her newly found smearedpaint technique this may not be artistic but it works dug studied the short smearwall she had just made he tapped it with his finger feels like compressed wood or metal is it strong enough i dont know im still learning how to use my talent maybe you can find out for me sure thing he lifted one foot and brought it down hard on the smear wall ouch its strong enough then he looked beyond the truck but how can you float a boat without water i hope to erase the land and form a channel and maybe the swamp water will fill it he nodded it works for me he looked around not much i can do here maybe ill scout ahead see if i can find xanth kim looked up how will you know without magic ill go with him jenny elf said when i change form well know go kim said returning to her work woe betide knew why they couldnt afford to waste any time if they didnt get to xanth soon it would be too late for half the party the two set off and soon disappeared into the forest piers anthony ahead dont you worry about your boyfriend and your friend woe betide asked no jenny elf was my companion in the game i know her and i know dug answer enough do you think were close enough to xanth to make it in time we have to be according to my map were just about at the florida border which for us is xanth it must be within a mile or so and the fringe of magic must extend out beyond it so any further headway we can make is bound to help but she looked worried woe betide knew why maps might be wrong or the party might not be as far along as they thought a small error could make a big difference they just had to hope they were close enough the boat was forming but its shape showed their problem the front was broader than the rear because in the time it took kim to erase the connecting truck the aisle was shrink ing now it was almost touching the centaur at the sides kim also seemed to be working harder as if the strength of the aisle was weakening as it shrank time was really getting short dug and jenny returned we found it he called less than a mile ahead maybe closer because it doestft thin out all at once thank god kim breathed woe betide saw the sup pressed tension leaving her then the girl smiled and faced dug of course she said as if there had never been any doubt weve marked out the easiest route dug continued i mean theres no point in erasing healthy trees or nice scen ery how do i love thee kim murmured let me count the ways metria was struck by the utter sincerity of her words under the banter and insults and shinkicks there was a solid core of real love then louder lets do it weve got to work fast roc and a harp place dug walked around behind what remained of the truck his feet sinking into the muck must be a rope here he said or a chain got it he pulled forth a chain from under the truck bed ill just hook this to the boat and haul it along soon as theres a channel kim faced forward the ground now came right up to the edge of the boat because the front of the truck had been erased she brushed her hand across the ground and it dis appeared leavinga dark hole she stroked her hands back and the hole spread she wiped it out to the sides and now some water seeped in she reached farther forward but couldnt erasethe land there the aisle was now too short so she did what she could close to the boat while dug tried to hook the chain on need a hole he muttered so kim wiped one finger there and made a hole he passed the chain through then triecj to tie it here kim said she erased part of one link set the end of the chain there and unerased the link now the chain was firmly anchored dug looked at that thats a more versatile talent than i thought its close to sorceress level properly exploited woe betide said dug braced himself and hauled on the chain but couldnt budge the boat too much weight on it kim said step ping off and not enough pull ill help she joined dug you know a fellow could get to like you if he tried dug remarked dont get fresh just pull kim retorted smiling but though the boat wavered it didnt actually move jenny joined them but still it didnt work it seemed to be caught on something below i can help woe betide said she turned smoky sank through the boat and spread out into a sheet immediately below it she could do this because she was still close to amolde within the aisle in fact she could now resume full piers anthony volume and be metria again she felt the snags on the bottom of the boat where kim had not been able to reach and so lidified her substance around them smoothing them out then she turned her bottom side slippery suddenly the boat lurched forward it splashed into the erased hole before itthenout of it and onto the land metria had made it so slippery that it moved readily no longer ac tually needing a water channel the others did not question a good thing they kept haul ing on the chain and so metria maintained the slippery bot tom and the craft fairly whizzed along over the ground it left the peculiar wreckage of the truck behind years later perhaps mundanes would discover it and wonder whether a monster had chomped a boatshaped bite out of it they would surely never guess the truth the trees passed and the forest thickened the boat sloshed in irregular curves as it followed the route dug and jenny had prescribed progress gradually slowed because the haulers were getting tired and because metria was beginning to tingle on her underside she thinned her body but knew that soon she would have to withdraw to the top of the boat or lose her substance that would make it that much harder to haul were they losing their race against time after all then the tingling faded was she turning numb if so she had to quit right now but it didnt seem like that it seemed almost as if she was gaining strength how could that be well as long as it lasted she would do as much as she could she made her undersurface even more super slippery and felt the boat pick up speed the others were pulling harder doing their lastgasp bit too arnolde lifted his head what is going on he inquired metria poked a mouth up through the boat were haul ing you to xanth she said before you poop out en tirely poopshit i was just resting you dont need to haul me anywhere yes we do because roc and a hard place look at jennys ears dug exclaimed theyre pointed were in xanth kim cried oh im so glad i could kiss someone well if you feel that wa but he was cut off by her hurtling kiss metria floated up through the boat she extended an arm cautiously to the side she reached beyond the prior limit and felt no tingle it was true they were now surrounded by magic i could kiss someone too she said she floated to ich abod who was just beginning to stir i think ill wake the sleeping prince she put her head down solidified her face and planted xanths most poignant kiss on his mouth the man came awake as if electrified he seemed to float i thought i was dying he said now im in heaven would you settle for xanth she asked same thing dug and kim and jenny closed in you made it possible met dug said we couldnt budge that thing until you iced it you were the difference youre a great person kim said and jenny nodded agreement metria opened her mouth to say something clever but it dissolved instead she had never anticipated such a reaction she melted into a puddle they crossed the interface and were back in xanth proper sammy found them a pie tree and they feasted it was such a relief to be back in xanth even the animals seemed to like it sammy lived to find things magically and bubbles was becoming more lively than she had been evidently she like the centaur needed magic to restore her vitality now we must organize kim said arnolde and ich abod need to return to the region of madness and dug and i and jenny have to get to this nameless castle and you piers anthony metria have your other summonsees to summons do we just split up and go our separate ways no metria said immediately its my job to get all the summonsees there safely so i cant just turn you loose and i should make sure that amolde and ichabod get to the madness safely too because it was to help me fetch you that they left it at great discomfort and risk to themselves then perhaps we should travel together for a while longer amolde said seeming undispleased it works for me dug agreed similarly satisfied maybe the rest of us can help her fetch in the remaining summonsees if my new talent can be useful kim said metria laughed it was your talent that saved us it can surely help again but without amoldes aisle of magic i couldnt have used it kim said and i couldnt have existed metria added there is enough credit to go around amolde said i think it is fair to say that we have come to respect each other by profiting from the abilities each brought to the mission ichabod provided the house truck and knowledge of mun dania without which the effort would have foundered dug and jenny explored for the most expeditious route and pro vided most of the hauling strength each persons contribu tion was vital at some point the others passed a glance around the centaur did have a point suddenly they all felt better about themselves then lets travel kim said briskly dug shook his head youre a bit hyper know that all the rest of us are tired from physical exertion or wrung out from a siege of low magic and you are too if you had the wit to know it we need to rest or well blunder into real mischief xanth isnt all that safe for distracted or dull folk tomorrow we can find an enchanted path and travel well today wed better just recover another glance circulated it was another valid point roc and a harp place im sorry kim said im being pushy again yes im tired too and sort of dazed about being back in xanth i never thought id get here outside of the game but its great ill shut up thats the way i like my women dug said quiet and submissive he dodged her first kick and beautiful that stalled her second kick in midair she lost her balance and fell into him so he kissed her soundly actually kim wasnt beautiful in the standard sense but it seemed that dug knew a bit about girlfriend management too id better check on veleno metria said remembering her husband for some irrelevant reason will you folk be okay here for a while we should be amolde said this close to the edge of magic there shouldnt be any bad monsters and we can simply step back through the interface if there are jenny said we can go where they cant so metria popped off home where veleno was just be ginning to run out of delirious happiness it had been after all more than a day she bustled him back to the bedroom and dosed him with another days worth she would have liked to stay longer but she had an obligation to the traveling group to see it safely to its destinations her new conscience was a strict mistress but she didnt mind when she returned the group was relaxing under a weep ing willow tree cheering it by their company amolde was discoursing on some of the problems of archivism old documents are invaluable he was saying even those deemed to be of little worth by their perpetrators a scribbled note to stay out of the honey pot informs us that they did have honey pots in those days and that they had writing unfortunately some key documents have been lost to history as a centaur i naturally know the list of the human kings of xanth but there are some distressing lacunae lacuna metria said shes still around she was ret roactively married and she paused seeing their stares did i say something stupid piers anthony amolde smiled no of course not my dear i was merely using the word in its linguistic capacity meaning a gap or omission perhaps we expected you to say a dis tressing what and we could then have had the dubious plea sure of redefining the term oh whatever she still felt out of sons at any rate i was going on too long amolde said i wish there were some forgotten tome listing all the missing kings felicitously turning up but of course good magician humfrey would have found it already if any such existed unless it got lost during his distraction of wives ich abod said then he might have overlooked it say dug said i wonder if sammy could find such a tome the cat had been snoozing beside bubbles but suddenly woke and set off running jenny elf scrambled after him wait for me now look what youve done idiot kim told dug ill track him metria said glad for something to do to make up for her conversational gaffe she floated rapidly after the cat it turned out to be no long chase sammy ran up to a small structure bearing a plaque with the words book store me tria lifted its lid and peered in it turned out to be a solidly constructed box wherein books were stored the top one was a tome titled book of kings so she took that out set the lid back in place and opened it she was holding it back ward so she saw the last page first there was a crude scrawled entry stoln by th ogre achever ogre an ogre agin she considered that did look like the writing of an ogre ogres were justifiably proud of their stupidity but how could any ogre have stolen such a important book once let alone over and over again even an over achiever among ogres would have trouble stealing a book few ogres even knew what a book was still this one obviously did he was actually a literate roc and a hard place ogre perhaps the only such in the mottled history of ogre dom so he had evidently done it and was proud enough of his achievement to record it in the very book he had stolen she turned back another page this one listed magician aeolus the storm king assuming the throne in the year that was all the rest of the page was blank no other kings were listed since there had indeed been kings thereaftershe could think of magician trent the transformer magician dor who talked with the inanimate and about eight brief others in betweenshe knew that this book had been stolen during the storm kings reign that wasnt surprising since the storm king had become rather dim in his declining years able to blow up hardly more than a breath of wind and not much stronger intellectually he had probably lost or for gotten the book and the ogre achiever had found it and given himself credit for stealing it thus all that it contained had been lost to xanth history assuming that it contained anything much so she turned some more pages and saw that more kings were indeed listed in fact they went right back to the beginning of xanth kings this book must have been passed down from king to king over the centuries each one filling in the end date for his predecessor and his own year of ascension good enough she closed the book and carried it back to the waiting group i think this is it she said presenting the tome to amolde why so it may be the centaur said amazed he opened the book and read its title page human magician kings of xanth he looked up astonishing where did sammy find this in a book store a book storein xanth kim asked did you have to buy it no its just a box where books are stored there are other books ichabod asked alertly if they piers anthony are of similar rarity and quality that may be an informational fortune we must examine them sure metria said right this way but when she returned to the place she had found the box there was nothing there there did not seem ever to have been anything there either it was just an undisturbed rocky region in the forest maybe sammy dug said but this time the cat was indifferent i dont think theres anything to find jenny said he can find anything but home except when there isnt anything then he just ignores it but there was a box metria protested ichabod cogitated perhaps it movedand the cat is un able to find a given object a second time that being as it were a home base something already found i think we shall have to relinquish any notion of finding those other books oh fudge metria swore i did it again i should have grabbed them all you are not a scholar ichabod said excusing her but a cloud of disappointment hovered near him the ogre achiever had stolen it over and over again she remembered did that mean that each time the book store disappeared he hunted it down again or that he had finally hidden it in this foolishly obvious place and it had turned out to be a better hiding place than it seemed if so they had caught the book store just at the right time before it moved that made her feel a smidgen less worse they returned to amolde who was engrossed in the book of kings this is absolutely fascinating he exclaimed i can vouch for its accuracy by the entries relating to what i already know but there are many more this is indeed an invaluable lost tome of information whats so exciting about a list of kings kim asked i mean thats what makes british history so absolutely totally completely boring not to mention dull roc and a hard place well there are also the dates of the kings ichabod said looking over his friends shoulder maybe i didnt make myself quite clear kim said grimly if theres one thing worse than lists of names its lists of dates not only are they boring and dull theyre im possible to remember and you flunk if you make a simple little mistake like putting the wrong name with the right dates yeah dug agreed i remember when i listed henry the eighth for to youd have thought the sky was falling you were precisely four centuries off ichabod ex claimed shocked so whats four centuries between friends kim asked i certainly wouldnt want to bore anyone with unwanted lists of names and dates and talents arnolde said i shall be happy to commit this volume silently to memory he pored over the book with much the same intensity that ma gician humfrey did with his own tomes oh my the sor ceress tapis was once married that explains so much and the zombie master was actually the son of a king but alien ated because of the nature of his talent i never suspected this will revolutionize xanth history or at least the current rendering of it ichabod agreed it does seem that there were some dark secrets in those early days exceedingly dark arnolde agreed actually im curious metria said maybe i knew some of those kings dug and kim started to laugh then stopped as they saw that neither metria nor arnolde was thats right dug said demons live forever or as close as makes no never mind maybe she did know some kings i did metria agreed but i got close to only two gromden and humfrey the others didnt interest me thats right kim said humfrey was king once you piers anthony tried to distract him from his studies at the demon univer sity but whats this about you and king gromden i seduced him but it got complicated kim reconsidered maybe i am interested in some of those kings if they were real living people i mean not just dates gromden must have been a hot date dug said she ignored him lets hear about some xanth kings youve got my curiosity going and shes dangerous when shes curious dug said dodging another kick so they settled back and listened to arnolds recital of kings old and new as augmented by the book of kings the uninterrupted human population of xanth began with the first wave its arrival defined as the year for the first two centuries there were no kings the savagery of the early years may have prevented the human folk from achiev ing sufficient unity then king merlin whose talent was knowledge became the first in the year twoohfour just in time to try to help organize the women to kill their rapist husbands of the third wave and bring in better men the so called fourth wave as he spoke jenny elf settled by his flank with sammy and bubbles and hummed a little tune metria interested in information about the old kings that she hadnt paid much attention to at the time listened with complete attention she realized that her half soul was giving her a new perspective so that now the events had meaning she remembered the brutal third wave largely exterminating what had been the brutal second wave but the fourth wave had been something else and that one had built the foundation on which the human kingdom became significant then she saw old king merlin vacating his throne sepa rating from his wife the sorceress tapis and going to mun dania on some kind of business only he could understand tapis was so annoyed she never remarried and never spoke of merlin again she did tolerate her daughter the princess roc and a hard place but neither spoke of their connection because both had writ ten the memory of the king out of their lives well merlin did have business in mundania ichabod remarked he was standing beside her watching king merlin depart xanth there was a lad named arthur he had to educate to be king that was more important than governing xanth jenny asked she was standing on ichabods other side the old mundane shrugged there are those who thought so hey here comes roogna kim said from metrias other side but this is starting to get cluttered with dates then in magician roogna whose talent was adap tation assumed the throne eight years later the princess suf fered a change of plans and married him with her mothers blessing because he really was a decent man he built castle roogna with the help of centaurs naturally the centaurs amolde said no other spe cies had the expertise king roogna died fighting the sixth wave it was an ugly scene because the invading mundanes were so brutal and ignorant of magic ichabod kim and dug winced in unison ashamed of their heritage roognas place was taken by xanths first female king the sorceress rana whose talent was creation in when she died in magician rei tas whose talent was solving problems took over unfor tunately he seemed to generate almost as many problems as he solved because there were always unintended complica tions when one of those complications killed him in ending reitas reign ranas son magician rune became king his talent was evocation too many dates kim muttered that lasted until when rune died fighting the seventh wave the people desperate for leadership that could save them persuaded the zombie jonathan to assume the throne the zombie master kim cried he was king of xanth piers anthony metria popped out of her dream she was back in contem porary xanth but demons dont dream she protested yes you do when you have a soul jenny said you were sharing my dream just now i saw you there watching the parade of kings with me we all were there thats righti can dream now metria said mentia dreamed with gary gargoyle last year that was really an cient history sorry i jogged us all out of it kim said anyone who isnt paying attention can enter one of jennys dreams when shes humming thats her talent but its easy to startle folk out of it i should have kept my big mouth shut as usual but this business of the zombie master being king of xanthhow come he never mentioned that well zombies dont have very good memories ar nolde said because their heads are filled with never mind kim said i get the picture but how could a zombie govern i remember that metria said that was one king i didnt try to seduce he couldnt be killed so anyone who attacked him just got frustrated until jonathan caught up to him and threatened to turn him into a zombie too but he couldnt turn living folk into zombies kim said they didnt always know that and of course he could have arranged to have them killed first so they didnt give him any lip or any other parts of their bodies they did exactly what he told them to do so that he would stay away from them and he did as long as they behaved he was actually a very gentle man thats why his reign lasted a whole century he finally got fed up with the rotten job and abdicated he was more interested in chasing after millie the ghost anyway kim shook her head you were right there are wrinkles to xanth history i never suspected the zombie master is a nice guy now that hes alive he always was it was just that other folk couldnt stand roc and a hard place his talent so he was somewhat isolated until millie loved him night was threatening by now so kim erased a nice place on the ground making a pit then smeared a top across it so that they had a safe underground chamber to sleep in sammy located a pillow bush and blanket tree and they made com fortable beds you know a single bed would do for the two of us dug suggested hopefully sorryim already sharing mine with bubbles kim informed him dug didnt argue they had evidently dis cussed this before metria didnt need to sleep but she did settle down to dream again as jenny started humming she dreamed of ma gician vortex becoming king in after the zombie king abdicated vortexs talent was summoning demons how well she remembered he had summoned her once but not for anything interesting he was merely curious about her impediment of speech as he put it she tried to distract him by seducing him but he had a policy against being seduced by demonesses that was when she learned that sometimes it was best to conceal her nature and that caution was to stand her in good stead two centuries later with king grom den but it took her a good five minutes of seductive effort before she realized that it wasnt working with vortex she was about to do her ultimate by showing him her panties when wow dug exclaimed now thats what i call a hot scene get out of this dream kim snapped at him and he vanished but the interested look remained on his face so it was the group dream again that was all right metria found that she rather liked the company jenny elfs talent was a lot of fun thank you jenny said the dream continued through the next name on the list king neytron whose talent was bringing paintings to life piers anthony he didnt need any sexy demonesses either because all he had to do was paint the type of woman he desired and she would be his he also painted elaborate furnishings for castle roogna and when times became lean supplies of food for the people it occurred to metria that kirns talent wasthe reverse of this then there was king nero who animated golems and they were very good for getting work done they planted a much larger orchard so that the local folk would never again have to be concerned about their food supply then came gromden in she concluded her dream with him though there were a number of other kings of xanth to follow him including a second female king elona in whose talent was longevity for herself and any others she chose she governed for a long time today metria thought folk believed that there had never been female kings of xanth historically but that was ignorance and the ghost king warren who had also been lost to history but after that came king ebnez with his talent of inanimate ad aptation followed by humfrey the storm king aeolus trent and dor she would dream about them some other time that was definitely not fit for dug to see kim said he already has too many big ideas you dont like them jenny asked not when theyre about other women jenny laughed the effort was too much for the dream and it faded out leaving metria awake oh yes she had toyed with history in her fashion now with her soul she regretted some of it but not much then she snapped alert there was someone with her and not one of the regular party who are you she demanded abruptly a horse figure reared back startled a night mare not so fast equine she said puffing into smoke and roc and a hard place surrounding it how is it that youre trying to give a bad dream to a demoness the figure tried to run away but her smoke surrounded it so that it couldnt get away so it projected a little dream figure of a man i thought you were mortal the man said what are you doing with half a soul youre male she asked astonished im a night colt the dream man said they wouldnt let me take out any dreams so i stole half a soul and went out on my own i sniffed out some impromptu dreaming here so i came to see if i could get in on it i dont have much experience you know thats obvious metria said realizing hat it had been jennys powerful group dream that had attracted the colts attention you cant just go anywhere with dreams you have to bring them from the gourd to assigned people who deserve them but i told you they wont let me have any of those then maybe you had better just explore xanth and not mess with dreams at all no im a dream creature i have to associate with dreams since i dont have a cargo of my own messing with others is all i can do metria considered then maybe you can make something of it why not enter ordinary dreams and make the folks in them do things theyd never do on their own that could be fun correctly done i hadnt thought of that thanks demoness he gal loped off and this time she let him go it was good to be back making some mischief even in such a small way then she thought of something else jenny elfs group dream had attracted a night colt what would the night stal lion himself think of her dreaming ability the stallion could of course assume any shape he wished being master of the dream realm he could become a handsome manor piers anthony an elf of any size suppose he got interested in jennys talent and then in jenny herself nah she thought jennys future was surely in regular xanth or in her realm of origin the world of two moons n chena in the morning refreshed they set out to locate chena centaur the mystery token kim passed the back of her hand across the surface of the nether chamber and re stored the ground the way it had been no sense leaving a mess she explained that is one powerful talent ichabod remarked sor ceress level perhaps i dont know kim said im still learning how to use it i dont know its limits it would be wise to ascertain them they moved on soon they came to a river that looked too deep to wade across maybe i can erase a section kim said so we can walk across dry then i can unerase it after were across amolde looked thoughtful i wonder kim squatted by the riverbank and passed her hand across piers anthony the surface of the water there was a ripple but it didnt disappear i dont understand kim said why isnt it working because the water fills in the gap as soon as you make it amolde replied i thought that might be the case it would be remarkable were it otherwise kim nodded i guess so perhaps it is just as well that there is some reasonable limit on it amolde continued it would be dangerous otherwise i think i feel more comfortable this way me too kim confessed but she seemed a bit disap pointed too now how do we get across this river dug asked its too deep to wade and i dont like the look of those shark fins in the center loan sharks kim agreed theyll take an arm and a leg if you let them lets not let them maybe you could carve out another boat or raft jenny elf suggested that worked well to get us to xanth i suppose i could but it wouldnt be easy to navigate because i cant get under to make a keel we could haul it across with ropes if we could get the ropes anchored on the far side of the water and wholl swim across with ropes dug said i can do that metria said i cant float with heavy things but i can with light things and hemp feels light it can make men lightheaded ichabod agreed so they sent sammy cat to locate some hemp with suit able ropes while kim found a fallen log and made a dugout boat by erasing a hole in it there were some cracks in the wood but she smoothed those over with fingersmears mak ing it watertight it wasnt xanths prettiest boat but it seemed serviceable and contrary to her expectation she had been able to shape a crude keel by having the menfolk roll it over so she could work on the bottom of the hull small selective erasures could do a lot when the craft was ready and they had the necessary roc and a hard place rope metria floated across the river carrying the end of the rope the sharks leaped up and snapped at her with their red green blue and white teeth and sometimes they did catch a piece of her but she just dissolved that portion into dirty tasting smoke and they were left with no interest though they continued to make efforts on principle she made sure to float low enough to tease them well her soul was a hin drance when it came to mischief against nice folk but loan sharks gave her no problem at all she tied the rope to a stout acom tree and floated back almost touching the water but the sharks now knew they couldnt get a real piece of her and didnt try ready she said tying the other end to a similarly stout bcom tree she yanked on it to be sure it was tight that shook the trees and a few ripe cobs fell but the rope held they hauled the boat to the water and amolde stepped carefully in and lay down sammy and bubbles joined him that filled the boat they would have to make two trips kim had shaped two paddles by carefully erasing most of the wood from two logs metria took one while amolde took hold of the rope and hauled himself and the boat along across the river he wasnt strong for a centaur but he was able to haul his own weight metria paddled to help move the boat a loan shark sniffing mortal meat forged up to the boat this one was yellow and shaped like a submarine sandwich its tongue was like hot pepper and its teeth like despair it opened its mouth just about wide enough to take in an arm or leg sammy hissed and bubbles growled but the big fish was undaunted metria struck it on the tender snout with the paddle it hastily submerged and they moved on across the river un bitten the centaur got out clearly relieved to be back on terra firma metria formed herself into a pulley connecting rope and boat and pulled the boat back across now ichabod dug kim and jenny climbed into the boat dug and kim taking the paddles ichabod and jenny took piers anthony hold of the rope not so much pulling the boat along as mak ing sure it didnt get carried away by the current metria settled in the center keeping an eye out for mischief mischief wasted no particular time orienting on them this shark was huge and dark with teeth capable of crunching through their boat in short order it charged up jaws open for a horrendous chomp no swat on the snout would dis suade this monster so metria became a big mass of stinkhomflavored toffee and thrust herself into the oncoming maw the shark clamped downand tasted the flavor which was xanths very filthiest stenchiest disgustingest tang amolde caught a whiff and remarked as his face turned a trifle bilious of this nefarious hom it has been said that if a sphinx with a clogged snout sniffed it once from a distance through a thick filter the poor creature would turn to putrid green stone for a century and never clear its nose of the degradation the shark of course tried to spit the loathsome mass out but the stuff stuck to the once clean teeth and festered on the roiling tongue the putrefaction dripped into the mouth sending up nauseating fumes the shark tried to wash it out with water but the surrounding river turned an obscene shade of noisome hue and threatened to curdle finally the shark plunged under the surface and swam away as fast as inhumanly possible leaving a swath of bubbly retchings be hind metria turned smoky and floated up through the water leaving just enough flavor behind to guarantee that the shark would not soon be free of it stink hom was one of her favorite last resorts reserved for only the most deserving opponents usually it was sufficient merely to blow the hom and its foul smelling sound would drive most creatures away but she had felt that the shark deserved more intimate treat ment meanwhile the boat was wending its way across the river and a courteous breeze was clearing the air of the lingering roc and a hard place bouquet the passengers were starting to look as if the mi asma was after all bearable ichabod faced metria as she returned demoness if you pleasenext time a monster threatens to engulf uslet it do so in peace but he managed a sickly smile they reached the far bank and clambered to shore the boat still reeked of horn so they turned it loose to float dis consolately downstream the vegetation along the banks wilted temporarily while the boat was passing they set off across a field of posies that opened out before them each flower puffed itself up as they passed enhancing its color and stiffening its petals posing then a girl appeared before them no it was two children the other a boy evidently twins who are you the girl asked boldly metria popped across to stand before the children i am the demoness metria passing through on business who are you im abscissa the girl replied i travel along the x axis because i have the x chromosome along the what horizontally a line appeared and the girl suddenly jumped a brief distance to the side without moving her legs im ordinate the boy said i travel along the y axis because i have the y chromosome a line appeared and he jumped backwards without moving his legs vertically geometrically and genetically speaking ichabod re marked intrigued he brought out his little notebook these are most interesting talents whose children are you the two zipped back together we were supposed to be grey murphy and princess ivys twins abscissa said but they took too long to marry so the stork dropped us off at an orphanage ordinate said well shame on them kim said t knew they were taking too long about it and they should marry any time now metria said even if they dont know it piers anthony the others glanced at her curiously but the glances bounced off her without penetrating because she wasnt pay ing attention does the orphanage treat you well arnolde inquired oh sure abscissa said of course it cant keep us if we want to go out or dinate said together we can go anywhere we want to abscissa said by projecting our coordinate map ordinate said this is most interesting ichabod said making another note instant travel by geometry where can you go jenny asked anywhere abscissa said such as to that tree jenny asked pointing to a distant nut and bolt tree beyond the flower field sure ordinate said watch the two children concentrated lines appeared marked x and y stretching all across the field intersecting each other forming a grid a dot appeared beside the distant tree the two children took each others hands and suddenly they were standing by the tree metria popped over to them it is really you she asked sure demoness abscissa answered who else could it be ordinate asked it might be an illusion no we dont have that magic abscissa said frowning cutely but it might be fun if we did ordinate said metria popped back to the groupand found the children already there say youre good she said of course abscissa said were always good but wed have been better with a family ordinate said maybe well find a family that needs twins kim said gee that would be nice abscissa said clapping her hands girlishly together roc and a hard place will they let us eat eye scream every day and have pil low fights ordinate asked more likely theyll make you eat pillows and have eye scream fights dug said dug kim exclaimed indignantly dont tease them like that but the children seemed thrilled with the notion thats better yet abscissa said pood fights are great ordinate agreed now see what youve done kim said to dug youve given them a wicked notion youre lucky youre not held in contempt of the adult conspiracy sorry bout that dug said not looking overwhelmed with remorse well we have to go now abscissa said because you folk are getting dull ordinate said this is the nature of adults ichabod said but already the coordinate map was forming and by the time he finished speaking the twins were gone they moved on the token began tugging more strongly so metria knew they were getting close indeed they spied some hoofprints and followed them young filly centaur amolde said how can you tell jenny asked couldnt it be a uni cbm or something no centaurs are especially heavy on the front feet and tend to set them down farther apart to brace the bodies for the use of the hands also the configuration of the prints is distinct from that of unicorns all hoofprints looked alike to metria but it was clear that arnolde knew what he was talking about when one set of prints crossed another he immediately pointed out the fresher ones before metria confirmed it with the tug of the token soon they found a bedraggled young filly centaur her blond hair hung lankly around her shoulders and juvenile piers anthony breasts and there were curse burrs tangled in her tail she was eating bitter fruit and looked miserable if you stare youll reveal yourself as an ignorant mun dane kim whispered to dug uh sure dug agreed dimming down the intensity of his stare like many young men he seemed to be fascinated by nude nymphs and centaur fillies chena centaur metria called the filly heard her lookedand bolted in half a moment she was gone hey metria exclaimed she floated after the creature i have a summons to serve but the centaur fled blindly paying no attention finally metria popped to a place in front of her and assumed the form of a centaur she didnt have the substance of a centaur so was mostly smoky but it did get the fillys attention and bring her to a halt she stood there panting looking wildly about ready to bolt again the moment she spied a feasible route chena centaur metria asked again sure that it was why dont you leave me alone the filly demanded tearfully i cant i have to serve you with this summons metria held out the token summons for a trial you see chena whirled around and bolted back the way she had come but that soon brought her up against the following party she turned again to face metria her eyes showing desperate white i didnt mean any harm amolde stepped forward my dear the trial is not of you you are being summonsed as a mere juror the fillys head turned back and forth between arnolde and metria but see it says juror on it metria said holding the token up and your name i must gather all the jurors for the trial of roxanne roc if you come with me i will see that you roc and a hard place get there safely several of these others in my party are sim ilar summonsees me kim said and him indicating dug and her indicating jenny elf the filly began to relax all right im chena she took the token the day was getting on lets find a place to camp kim suggested tomorrow is another day metria realized that this was mostly to help get chena settled as the filly still looked pretty wild so while kim erased a shelter for the night jenny worked with a comb to get the tangles out of chenas hair and tail and to brush her coat down it seemed funny to hear jennys muttered cursing but it was the only way to get curse burrs off sammy cat located food for them and dug brought it in amolde and ichabod talked with the filly and began to get her story then jenny started humming on centaur isle a filly named chena was foaled with a magic talent the cursory magic inspection which all foals were given did not pick it up so she lived for some time in blissful ignorance of her critical liability chena had a loving sire and dam two older colt brothers and many peergroup friends she was contented in a com pletely normal way she groused about having to spend so much time in centaur school she was furious at herself when she missed the bullseye once during bowmanship practice annoying the bull and was mortified when one foot got sore dam i have foundered she cried as she limped home dont use language like that her dam reproved her laminitis say it correctly night mares founder centaurs suffer inflictions of laminitis yes dam dear chena replied obediently now go to the doctor for some enchanted balm of gilead to put on it enchanted chena said appalled but isnt that magic piers anthony magic in itself is a useful and sometimes necessary thing her dam said sensibly in fact it can even be en dearing in lesser species just so long as it is not too closely associated with a centaur oh chena had thought from the attitudes of her sib lings and friends that magic was somehow dirty now she understood the distinction between using magic and possess ing magic and realized that her friends were actually somewhat ignorant about it so she went to the centaur doctor i need a bomb of gilead she told him for my sore foot he smiled in that annoyingly superior manner of adults everywhere which digit do you need detonated my right forefoot she said lifting it indeed he said examining it well heres the bomb he rubbed some thick fragrant ointment on it and the pain exploded outward and dissipated oh thank you doctor she cried dancing on the pain free foot and here is some more in case the infliction of laminitis returns he said giving her a vanilla envelope apart from routine things like that chena was a happy camper and homebody her main hobby was magic rocks now that she knew that it was all right to use magic things some stones were pretty and some were useful but to her the most fascinating ones were magic some were known to everyone as magical but were difficult for most folk to ac tivate such as charmstones and hearthstones others didnt seem magical at all but chena was able to divine their hid den powers in fact she didnt know it but she had a magic talent it was the ability to activate magic rocks it was not her words or insights that did it but her hidden talent so she became a collector of magic stones she always wore a pouch around her waist filled with different kinds of gems and pebbles rolling stones for example rolled with out being pushed they also for some unknown reason roc and a hard place played music rock music of course and stone age melo dies and pebble tunes they refused to be put in the same pouch as moss agate not because it was soft and green but because rolling stones gathered no moss then there were opeals which opened doors and sapphfires which burned with blue fire useful for igniting wood rubies would rub against her and spinels would spin in dizzy circles one rock in the pouch was neither lovely nor useful it was grayish and ordinary and seemed to have no magic chena kept it because she felt sorry for it then one unlucky day a centaur elder saw chena playing in the street with her pebbles filly what are you doing with those rocks im studying them she replied in some surprise i want to be a mineralogist when i grow up and classify all the magic stones of xanth magic stones yes i am very good at recognizing them and figuring out how they work see here is a gall stone a gall stone she held it up and the stone made a galling remark whats it to you horseface you got a sore on your rump the elder did not know very much about stones but he did know something about magic he took chena at once to the building of magic inspection to have her reexamined the magic detection tool they had there was the kind that responded only to active magic naturally her talent was ac tive only when she was around magic rocks which was why it had not registered before this time she had the stones in her pouch show them your gall stone the elder told her she brought it out and it made another galling remark t resent the implication founderfoot it said bitterly the instrument hummed pointed directly at chena and indicated the use of a magic talent that was enough that same day chena was exiled from piers anthony centaur isle for obscenity she gathered her few possessions bid tearful farewell to her sire and dam and siblings who tried to pretend that she had not deeply shamed them and quietly left she held her head high refusing to let any emo tions show because she was after all a centaur even if she was a filly of tender years once she had been rafted to the mainland and was entirely free of the isle and alone she paused to release her pentup emotions to her surprise she discovered not grief but anger i like my magic talent she said defiantly to the forest they can humiliate me in public and even exile me because of it but they cant make me ashamed of it suddenly the young fillys anger exploded in one sentence i wouldnt go back there even if i could but there was just a sugges tion of a trace of a tear in an eye and a thought of a tremble on a lip she was after all only eleven chena began to adapt to the wilderness little by little or even tiny by tiny in the course of the next few hours ven turing slightly farther inland from the coast she knew enough to avoid tangle trees and carnivorous grassthere were after all such things even on centaur isle carefully fenced off and labeled as examples of what life was like elsewhereand to be alert for stray dragons with the aid of a chunk of magic searchstone which her talent had en abled her to recognize and activate she managed to search out pie trees and other foodsupplying plants she also discovered the full range of her talent now that she no longer had to hide it from herself for example when she accidentally cut herself on a thorn bush she was able to use a piece of bloodstone to stanch the blood if she wanted to go fishing she could use a garnet to net gar if she was thirsty and didnt trust the local groundwater love springs and hate springs werent common but why take chances she could get lime juice from a limestone olive juice from olivine or several quarts of milk from milky quartz grad ually chena came to realize that her talent was more pow erful than the centaur isle elders had suspected it wasnt roc and a hard place sorceress or neosorceress level but it was still an excellent talent to have in the uncharted xanth wilderness they might have thought she would soon perish alone thus enabling them to get rid of her without having to execute her them selves keeping their dirty hands clean they would be dis appointed maybe chena did not take unnecessary chances she was after all a centaur and possessed of excellent intelligence and judgment she stocked up on pies at the first pie tree she found lest she not find another soon that night she ate a banana cream pie because it was too squishy to last long in her knapsack and a key lime pie which was already getting overripe she carefully picked the keys out leaving the limes alone and was about to throw them away when she decided to save them she might need those keys later opeals couldnt open everything after all now where was she to go she had no idea it wasnt as if she had planned this excursion she couldnt stay long in this vicinity because centaur hunting parties came here reg ularly she didnt even dare use their trails because she would be killed if any isle centaur saw her unfortunately she was sure that the farther she got from the isle the more dangerous the land would become she had been allowed to take no weapon which made her situation that much worse she might be able to fashion a crude staff or club but what she really needed was a good knife or bow i wish i had a really good bow and arrows she mur mured and i wish i knew what to do then she heard something it sounded like trotting was it a unicornor a centaur she quickly concealed herself in a place few folk would even think to look behind a tangle tree she could do this because she could see by the fresh bones that the tree had recently feasted that meant it should be quiescent for another day or so it was a nervy thing to do but not as nervy as remaining in sight for a centaur archer to spot and it was a centaur coming she peeked out between the piers anthony listless tentacles of the tree in fact it was her eldest brother carlton centaur that terrified her because when they played hideandseek he had always been able to find her no matter how cleverly she hid he galloped right toward her and for a moment she was sure he saw her but then he went on by then he turned and trotted back and halted again she was sure he had seen her what was he going to do they had always gotten along well but if there was one thing stronger than a centaurs marksmanship it was his honor and he would be honor bound to execute her if he ever saw her again close to cen taur isle carlton stood near her tree but faced to the side now i dont see anyone he said to the forest and i dont expect to but it occurred to me that if anyone happened to be lost around here he might be able to use something so ill leave it just in case and i might also remark that prob ably the best place for a person in doubt to go is to the human good magician and ask a question any question because the good magician requires a years service for an answer and i understand that querents are well cared for while per forming such service he set down a long package of course any lost person is surely greatly missed by his folks even if they arent able to say so and im sure their best wishes go with him but theres no sense in talking any longer to myself so i will depart and not return and he walked away not looking back and was soon gone the scene blurred and chena realized that there was no longer any mere hint of a tear in an eye but a copious flow in both eyes her dear brother had known she was there and brought her a gift and some excellent advice and gone his way not even able to remain for her thanks she came out and checked the package it was a fine bow and a dozen perfect arrows and one very sharp small knife with these she could defend herself from most predators and do some hunting she lacked the muscle to kill a dragon at long range but she could certainly score on small game at roc and a hard place intermediate range with an excellent weapon like this she knew that carlton had not acted alone their parents must have supported it though they would never say so they couldnt stop her exile but they did love her she donned the harness so that the bow and quiver of arrows lay across her human back the bow was so long that its ends came close to the ground and well up beyond her head she would have to stay clear of tight squeezes but it was wonderful having it she strapped the sheath of the knife to her human waist where it was readily inreach she felt so much better with such equipmentand because of what it told her about the true sentiment of her family and what of the advice well it made sense to her go ask the good magician a question and have a year to leam how to get along in the big uncivilized world of xanth not only did it give her somewhere to go it would give her a years leeway before she had to make a decision about the rest of her life the good magician wouldnt care that she had magic all human beings did have magic so they saw little or no shame in it that was of course part of what made them lesser beings so she would do it she set her face to the north thanks carlton she said thanks family then she started on her long journey as dusk came something dark and snarly loomed ahead chena brought her bow about and nocked an arrow the thing hesitated then charged it looked like a robert cat she loosed her arrow but the cat saw it coming and dodged to the side the arrow caught it in the flank instead of in the heart so wasnt fatal but the cat decided that this centaur filly wasnt as helpless as she seemed and bounded away leaving a trail of blood but unfortunately taking the arrow with it chena hated losing an arrow but it was better than losing her life she found a reasonably safe niche by two intersecting wallflowers and settled her rump there then she set her bow and three arrows on the ground before her and lay down if piers anthony anything came in the night it would have to come from the front and she could put an arrow or three in it before it got close she slept keeping her ears attuned to anything unu sual but she was in luck nothing came sometime in the night there came not a predator but a realization her brother carlton had magic too he could find things that explained so much but of course he could not admit it he had used it to find her so he could give her the bow knife and advice but could never demonstrate it else where lest he too be exiled she would certainly keep his secret so it was in the next few days as she traveled north she encountered a small mean dragon but two arrows dissuaded it she regretted this because again she lost the arrows and they were irreplaceable but at the same time she appreciated how very much worse it could have been without the bow there was all the difference in xanth between an unarmed centaur and an armed one it turned out to be a long way to the good magicians castle especially since she didnt know exactly where it was every so often she would inquire of some creature and leam that she still wasnt far enough north so she continued grad ually and reluctantly expending her valuable arrows i wish i could have at least a brief dialogue with someone friendly she said wearily chena longed more than anything else for companionship her rocks couldnt take the place of friends and the only halfway intelligent person she met other than brief glimpses of harpies ogres goblins and other unsavory characters was a more or less human child close to her own age he had brassishbrowning hair gray eyes and a brasscolored sun tan hello she said pausing with her hand not far from her knife just in case though he didnt look dangerous i am chena centaur age eleven who are you i am brusque brassieogre the lad replied also age roc and a hard place eleven my father is part ogre and my mother is all brassie thats why im so handsome you certainly are she agreed realizing that by the stan dards of his crossbreeding he was probably the only and therefore the handsomest of his kind i didnt realize that ogres crossbred with brassies it started with my grandfather smash ogre he said proudly he made the acquaintance of my grandmother biythe brassie and they liked each other well enough oh so they married no he married a nymph named tandy and she married a brassie man named brawnye chena was perplexed then how smash and tandys son was esk ogre brawnye and biythes daughter was bria brassie they married and im their eldest son oh chena said feeling uncentaurishly stupid of course so you are half brassy and and a quarter human if you count curse fiend as hu man and oneeighth ogre and oneeighth nymph he con cluded im a crossbreeds crossbreed my talent is to make things hard and heavy or soft and light she couldnt think of a suitable comment so she changed the subject is there a place for exisled centaurs near your home she asked shyly no i live in the vale of the vole no centaurs there i know of my father has a centaur friend but she doesnt visit much anymore now that she has a family of her own yes i suppose families do keep folk busy she said thinking of her own lost family do you know where else i might find a centaur community preferably one of those who have magic or who are tolerant of those who do oh sure the centaurs at castle roogna do magic i think or maybe theyre nearer the north village across the goops moms calling me indeed there was the distant sound of a brass cymbal i gotta get home nice meeting you bye piers anthony bye she echoed as he ran off she was delighted with the information but sorry that she hadnt quite learned what the north village was beyond still she could find out by continuing north so she did maybe she wouldnt have to ask the good magician a question if she found compatible magictalented centaurs like herself several days later chena was still trekking through the wilderness she had one good meal one day she caught some lox in a salmon stream and smoked them over a piece of smoky topaz they were locked of course so she opened them with some of her lime pie keys she looked for something to eat them with and found a bagel bush then searched through a creamweed for some cream cheese she found it but not until after shed found egg cream buttercream shaving cream light cream dark cream cream of the crop cream soda whipped cream chocolate cream marshmallow cream and eyes cream in var ious icecold flavors she scooped up the latter four to make a wonderful eyes cream mondae for dessert this was the last good meal she had for some time she was now passing through an area with very few feedbearing plants she carefully rationed the amount of pie she could eat each night as well as her quartzmilk and limestone juice which she called her rock food chena was tired hungry lonely and growing desperate her original determination to survive and possibly even prosper to find magicwielding centaurs who would accept her or to ask the good magician a question and be well cared for for a year while she performed her serviceall these notions faded in the face of her growing desperation now she appreciated just how difficult the realm of untamed xanth could be to make it worse she had reluctantly ex pended the last of her fine arrows in the course of discour aging passing monsters who showed too great an interest in her tender flesh she was now almost defenseless she was tempted to gobble down her last two squished pies instead roc and a hard place of rationing them so that at least she wouldnt be so hungry today regardless what happened tomorrow id almost rather be eaten by a monster right now and have it over with she whispered miserably suddenly she heard an ominous rustling and then a slav ering sound followed closely by a loud roar i didnt mean it i take it back she cried as a catawampus burst into view this was an enormous feline creature three times chenas size and vaguely resembling a catamount the most fright ening thing about it was that it seemed to be entirely crazy like its bearish black and white cousin the pandemonium and its sheepish cousin the bedlamb it brought chaos wherever it went chena whipped her bow around and cocked her fist draw ing back the string she was bluffing because she had no arrow but maybe the monster wouldnt realize but the cat awampus was too demented to be bluffed its eyes rolled wildly in its head as it tore at the grass in front of it cackling and snorting before it remembered it was supposed to roar it uprooted a tree and shredded it into splinters it fought its own tail tearing out several hunks of fur without feeling any pain it coughed and spat out a fur ball then it extended its claws showed its teeth in a wicked grimace and advanced toward chena she ran as any normal person would the monster pur sued her she stayed out of its reach for a little while but she was too hungry and tired to keep up thepace for long gradually the catawampus gained on her she could hear the closer thudding of its hugely clawed feet and the blasting bellow of its breath she saw a clearing ahead she used her last burst of speed to race for it hoping that there would be something there to save her but as she reached it she shrieked with pure horror she was at the edge of a huge chasm it stretched as far as her tired eye could see to both sides and was dreadfully deep and wide she had to screech to an emergency stop lest she run right into it piers anthony the catawampus rushed toward her cranking up its claws for pounce mode she had a quick decision to make should she die by leaping into the chasm or by letting the monster tear her apart she decided that the chasm frightened her less so she leaped screaming again as if that would do any good i wish something would save me she cried de spairingly as she began her fall into the dusky depths someone grabbed her hand a tail slapped against her flank making her feel strangely light and free she opened her eyes looking down and discovered that she was sus pended above the chasm being pulled to safety she looked back and saw that the catawampus was growling on the brink unable to catch her here she looked upand there was a winged centaur colt of about her own age or maybe a year younger he was flying in place and somehow supporting her whole body by his hold on her hand how could this be whohow she asked i am che centaur he said i made you light so i could hold you up but i shall have to bring you back to land soon because the effect fades with time i am chena centaur she said i didnt know that winged centaurs existed were a relatively new species we call ourselves ali centaurs will it be all right if i set you on the far side of the gap chasm chena looked down again there was a small cloud pass ing beneath her it looked worried that she might drop a clod on it of course she was now so light that any such clod might simply float away but she could nevertheless appre ciate the clouds concern she tried not to giggle at the thought of clouds being peppered by flying centaur manure yes che pumped his gorgeous wings more forcefully and towed her across the yawning gulf of the chasm she won dered whether the gap was falling asleep and whether it would close its mouth after it yawned roc and a hard place he brought her safely to the far rim she was glad to feel her feet firmly on land again and was sure that che was glad because she had been gradually gaining back weight and he had had to work hard to keep her aloft they paused to rest and talk she learned that che had been trying out his flight feathers using the warm updrafts of the gap chasm when he had abruptly spied her in trouble he had managed to reach her just in time she offered him one of her squished pies which he gravely accepted and she ate the last one herself she was so relieved by escaping the monster and finding a friendly centaur that she hardly cared about what she would eat to morrow we had better walk to my home che said actually im not living at home right now im with gwenny goblin who is camped not far from here the goblins are doing an exercise goblins chena cried horrified they captured you he laughed that was five years ago were firm friends now im gwennys companion this was too strange for her to assimilate dont goblins hate all other creatures especially beautiful or smart ones like centaurs yes and no most goblins are like that but the goblins of goblin mountain are ruled by gwenny the first female chief so they are becoming halfway decent so its safe for other folk to visit them youll like gwenny shes nice chena remained confused if this gobliness is their chief why does she want a centaur around i dont mean any of fense to you its just that she must have important things to do she does have things to do i help her she cant fly of course and shes not as intelligent as a centaur so i can scout for her and give her advice it works well enough chena almost suspected that he wasnt telling her every thing but it wouldnt be polite to pry im sure it does she agreed piers anthony they came to the goblin camp ugly goblin warrior men charged up at the sight of them but che merely held up his hand a visitor for the chiefess he said inform mo ron so instead of attacking the goblins fell in around them as an approximation of an honor guard while one of them dashed off chena would have been really uneasy about this if che werent so plainly at ease who is the moron she whis pered hes gwennys head honcho think of him as the chief of staff but you shouldnt call him names that is his name all the goblin males have ugly names oh perhaps that did make sense they stopped at a prettily decorated tent che assumed a serious mien as a vilelooking goblin approached moron this is chena centaur here to visit the chief moron turned to face the tent chief chena centaur is here to see you the tent flap was pushed aside and a pretty goblin girl emerged she looked very young but chena realized that was because she was so petite she was probably seventeen or eighteen years old she had a mental picture of herself embarrassing them all by treating a mature chief as a child the gobliness smiled it has happened she said chena was astonished had the girl read her thoughts i rescued chena from a monster by the gap chasm che said may we come in of course gwenny said the tent was surprisingly large inside when the three of them were alone che turned to chena gwenny can see dreams he explained i thought i saw mare imbri pass by she must have left you a day dream mare imbri you are not from these parts gwenny said smiling no im from centaur isle but i was exiled roc and a hard place she has a magic talent che explained shes looking for other centaurs like her or perhaps she will go to the good magician but she will need to recover her strength first gwenny said i can see that she has suffered privations on the way here thus began what was to be one of the most pleasant in terludes of chenas young life she remained for a fortnight with the goblin camp during its exercises che and gwenny were usually together and often busy but moron saw to it that chena was courteously treated he introduced her to his friends idiot who was in charge of intelligence and imbe cile the goblin foreign relations officer they seemed like ordinary goblin males apart from their titles ugly stupid and foulspirited yet not bad people as she got to know them and no other goblin bothered her as long as one of the three was anywhere near chena managed to make herself useful by finding magic stones and invoking their properties some goblins were wor ried about getting injured in battle so she gave them guard stones others feared they werent ugly enough so she gave them uglystones some wanted to express themselves more effectively so she gave them cursestones these were very popular even if they werent allowed to use them in the chiefess presence then it was time for the exercise to end the goblins had learned to march in disciplined formations and to sing tunes as they did that would enable them to make a good im pression when they guarded the lady chief on an official visit to another species every one of them wore the same uniform and stepped to the same beat chena had watched their prac tice sessions and had to admit that they were impressive such a formation would quickly abolish the notion that all goblins were undisciplined hordes this was a disciplined horde but something else had been happening in this period and now that it was time for the goblins to go home and for piers anthony chena to go her way she realized what it was she had been falling in love with che centaur he was such a decent crea ture and so handsome when he flew when the time came for the goblins to go home gwenny approached chena you are welcome to join us at goblin mountain she said your magic talent is useful and im sure you would be well received chena hesitated ihow does che feel about it oh che likes you too he says you are excellent com pany he has missed associating with centaurs during his stay at goblin mountain so you have given him something val uable this wasnt quite what chena wanted to hear is that all all i dont understand ii think i love him gwenny sat suddenly down oh my she did not look pleased i know hes very busy being your companion and all but if there is any chance that he might feel the same about me gwenny looked sad chena i never suspected it hurts me to have to be the one to say this but you are not of his species he must grow up and marry a winged centaur fe male so as to perpetuate his species but if there is no such female but there is she is cynthia centaur once a human girl who was converted to winged centaur form some time ago by magician trent she is living with his sire and dam while he is with me at goblin mountain it is understood that they will marry when they are of suitable age oh chena cried mortified didnt know there seemed to be no reason to mention it gwenny said im sure he would have if oh please dont tell him what i told you chena cried i must depart immediately so as neverto embarrass him roc and a hard place no chena that is not necessary im sure that if you just explain but chena hurt and humiliated by her own misunder standing couldnt bear to face che again desolate and de spairing she could think of only one thing to do she gathered her meager belongings and fled now she was back in the jungle this time north of the gap chasm but she had learned much more about the nature of the backwoods for the goblins were expert foragers she could feed herself and she also had some replacement arrows for her quiver not as good as the originals but they would do andshe had learned of a region to the north called the void where a person could enter but never leave that was what she needed now the void proved to be farther away than she had expected and harder to find but she kept looking meanwhile staying clear of both human and centaur settlements she didnt want to associate with anyone she just wanted to enter the void and disappear so she had become a hermit centaur always hiding always searchinguntil the summons party had run her down oh chena jenny elf said che is my friend i know he would never have hurt you had he realized i know it too chena said thats why i had to go now i wonder amolde said are you sure you came to the correct conclusion i did what i had to do chena said and if i have to face che again i dont know what ill do che is another summonsee metria said chena made as if to bolt again there is no need for that arnolde said i am a centaur with magic myself i understand your position i merely sus pect that you have misunderstood a key aspect of it i cant embarrass che chena said he was so nice to me never suspecting piers anthony i want you to picture what you most desire amolde said see here is mare imbri with a day dream for you he was right metria saw the nicker of the mare but what i truly want isnt right chena protested it may not be what you think it is amolde said ac cept the dream jenny elf began to hum metria ignored her what did amolde have in mind centaurs were never frivolous he surely had some phenomenally sensible conclusion to make but she couldnt guess what chena stood still and the day mare passed and delivered the dream and metria found herself in chenas dream it was of a lovely valley with flowers growing all around the filly was standing there alone but she was changing from the juncture of her human and equine torsos grew nubs and from the nubs sprouted feathers and the feathers ex panded to wings she stood as a winged centaur and that was all the dream faded taking the wings with it all was as before where was che arnolde asked che chena asked confused he wasnt in your dream chena was silent evidently not knowing what to say your dream was of becoming an alicentaur amolde said that is your true desire you are in love with the idea of becoming like cherather than with che himself but i can never be like che chena wailed are you sure of that she looked at him blankly trent metria exclaimed magician trent he could change her they need more flying centaurs dawn was rising in chenas face i could be changed we may not need magician trent amolde said take the gray stone from your pouch blankly chena obeyed she reached into her pouch and brought out the stone roc and a hard place now dream again of your fondest desire amolde said speak it aloud mystified chena held the stone and closed her eyes i wish i were an alicentaur she breathed for a moment nothing changed then the dream repeated and the wings appeared and that i think is the end of your talent with stones arnolde said it was the price of your conversion chena opened her eyes my conversion make a mirror demoness arnolde said metria be came a wide flat surface reflective on the side toward the filly chena lookedand almost fell over my dream re mains because this time it wasnt a dream arnolde said this time you used your wishstone my when you wished for a good bow and arrows you re ceived them he said when you wished for a friendly dialogue you got it when you wished to be consumed by a monster one came when you wished to be rescued che did that and when you wished to become an alicentaur that too was granted now you have your desire and no longer need your power over stones your magic is now to make yourself light enough to fly try it chena flicked herself with her tail as she had seen che do so many times to himself and to her when he brought her across the gap chasmthat most glorious experience then she spread her wings and pumped themand lifted into the air the six spectators broke into applause scramble whos your next summonsee kim asked metria opened the bag there were ten tokens re maining i dont see how im going to serve all of these in time she said ive already used up several days and the others are scattered all over xanth and what you have already accomplished along the way is remarkable ichabod remarked if i understand what i have heard correctly you have enabled princess nada naga to marry a prince shown the way to resolve the problem of a viable alicentaur species reconciled a fourcentury alien ation from your daughter abolished a longtime curse on cas tle roogna and discovered a significant lost history of the kings of xanthand you havent yet finished your job this reminds me of the type of chess problem i used to see in the newspaper wherein the challenge is for white to win one pawn but along the way occur casualties of rooks bishops roc and a hard place knights queens and threatened checkmates but the pawn is won whats a pawn metria asked i think its a type of shrimp jenny elf said thats a prawn arnolde replied with a face too straight however it may do a pawn is a chess piece generally regarded as insignif icant ichabod said with a reproving glance at his friend though at times it becomes a key element in the game my point is that sometimes amazing things occur as the result of what seems like a rather simple task it may be that the si murgh is using you as a vehicle to accomplish a variety of significant things that are in need of accomplishment in short the demoness may indeed be a pawn amolde said in the human sense im not human metria said indignantly to be sure ichabod agreed though you certainly appear so when you choose to he glanced at her legs at any rate i believe it would be in order for us to facilitate your project with a bit of advice i could use advice how to fetch in all the remaining summonsees in one day metria said so i could relax with my job done and get my answer from the good ma gician not to mention getting the summonsees in this party to the nameless castle arnolde said and the two of you back to the region of madness jenny elf said precisely ichabod agreed would you like that ad monition metria that what counsel guidance recommendation suggestion advise ment advice she asked whatever he said crossly yes pop over to castle roogna and ask princess electra if piers anthony she would like to have her husband prince dolph out of her hair for a day or two she will surely agree then ask dolph to assume the form of a roc bird so he can carry the sum monsees directly to the nameless castle as you serve them the process can be accomplished in a day if you are able to locate them that rapidly and if they are ready to go then now why didnt i think of that metria exclaimed striking her head with the heel of her hand which assumed the form of a heel of a shoe for the occasion because youre not a scholar he replied ill be back she said and popped across to castle roogna electra was out in the orchard trim in blue jeans and freckles as usual she didnt look very princessly but the folk of the castle had gotten used to that she was watering some of the smaller plants using a hose connected to a tap root her fouryearold twins dawn and eve were playing in a small house plant when it was fully grown it would be big enough for full grownups to use but right now it was just childsized lady bugs and gentlemen bugs were sitting around it because the children evidently wanted their playhouse to be in a city there was a fast food chain draped around it in case they got suddenly hungry metria realized that the children were using their talents to find the best things for their play because dawn could tell anything about any living thing and eve could tell anything about any in animate thing but it was electra she had come to see would you like to have dolph out of your hair for a day or two she asked the princess electras normally sunny visage dimmed dont you have something better to entertain you now that youre mar ried she asked metria realized that there was a slight misunderstanding the girl evidently recalled when metria had teased prince dolph threatening to show him her panties odd that such a minor thing could be remembered so long im not trying roc and a hard place to vamp him she said quickly im on a mission for the simurgh and i need to transport a number of people to the nameless castle from all parts of xanth i thought he might become a roc bird and carry them for me oh yes of course che and cynthia are here and grey and ida and threnody will be going too everyone is curious what roxanne roc could have done to warrant being tried if it will help resolve that mystery by all means borrow my husband there was a slight stress on the last two words indicating that electra would not look kindly on any display or threatened display of panties got it metria agreed thanks princess she popped into the castle where prince dolph was doing housework that made her pause whats this with wom ans work she demanded he looked abashed electra wanted to clean things up but she had to go water some plants in the orchard so she asked me to do it and shes got you wrapped around her little finger yes metria nodded thats exactly as it should be but how would you like a one or twoday break from such chores id love it but electra has given permission i need you to become a roc bird and haul scattered folk to the nameless castle for me will you do that dolph became a baby roc because a grown one wouldnt fit in the castle squawk he said emphatically good enough first we have to go to north xanth to move some folk make yourself into something very small and ill take you there he became a hummingbird hummhummhumm humm he hummed in four notes she put one hand carefully around him then popped back to the party in the northwest she opened her hand and dolph resumed his natural form piers anthony this is prince dolph she said he will transport you to the places you need to go hello prince dolph kim said im so glad to meet you at last im kim mundane dolph looked puzzled mundane dug and i were in xanth three years ago playing the companions game but we didnt get to meet you then oh the game nada was in he said remembering and jenny elf kim said as our companions i sup pose it wasnt important to the regular folk of xanth but it made a big difference to us she took dugs hand posses sively well lets take amolde and ichabod back to the mad ness metria said briskly thanks for your help folks youre welcome ichabod said wryly it has been an interesting experience quite interesting amolde agreed it will be good to get back to the madness where things seem more settled there was a perplexed look on dolphs beak as he as sumed roc form his giant bird body now took up most of the glade they were in he picked the two up carefully with his talons spread his monstrous wings and took off one wing clipped a tree ripping off a branch then he was in the open and gaining altitude he spiraled up high in the sky turned south and accelerated there was a thundery sound what was that jenny elf asked sonic boom dug replied those big birds fly pretty fast kim squatted and stroked her hand across the ground a swath of smear followed what are you doing dug asked im making a cabin she said a thing for us to ride in so we wont have to risk falling between the big birds talons when it picks us up he nodded good point i could fly there myself chena said hesitantly roc and a hard place if you know the way kim said if you could keep up with the roc better to ride with us yes the centaur agreed relieved by the time the roc returned kim had shaped a basketlike structure large enough for herself dug jenny and chena a gondola she said with satisfaction that will give us a more comfortable ride do you want to go directly to the nameless castle metria asked or to castle roogna where you can stay in comfort with illustrious figures of xanth until it is time for the trial well since you put it that way id love to see castle roogna kim said she looked around anybody object ive been there dug said its a great place and that orchard is something else its fine with me jenny said especially since che and cynthia are already there che chena asked stricken youre winged now kim reminded her you dont need him to fulfill your dream but i still do like him even if so the other femalecynthia had a crush on magician trent metria said catching on to the fillys concern as did gloha goblinharpy these things dont always work out but friendships do gloha was my first friend and shes cynthias friend too theyll all be at the trial dont worry about it ac tually she wasnt at all sure how chena and cynthia would get along but the last thing she wanted was to have chena fly away now and maybe you can use the time to visit the centaur villages and ask if any other centaurs would like to turn winged as you do kim continued youre experienced in that respect for you the perfect companion would be a male who just turned winged she smiled a handsome one piers anthony chena nodded thoughtfully and there will be time to get to know some because im young yet right on kirn said briskly so youll stay with us until you get comfortable with others were all going to that trial remember yes chena agreed relieved they climbed into the gondola the roc picked it up this time metria squeezed in too as it was easier than trying to pace a roc in flight this reminds me of my flight home in the bubble kim said holding her dog bubbles whom she had found in a bubble but its more fun this time because im not on my way out of xanth you floated home in a bubble dug asked i just blinked and i was back in my own room how did you rate i won the game she said actually toward the end we passed back through the screen same as you did oh yeah but i got your number you sure did she said and kissed him ill be back metria said and popped off home it was time to dose veleno with another charge of sheer bliss something about the gondola ride had reminded her when metria left home again the party had long since reached castle roogna as she zeroed in on it she saw two winged centaurs flying out from it so she zipped over to check on them and was surprised chena and cynthia she exclaimed oh hi metria cynthia said im showing my friend chena around things look different from above and i wouldnt want her to get lost your friend metria repeated somewhat dumbly cynthia smiled comrade associate colleague acquain tance companion but what about che hes with gwenny goblin chena said theyre play roc and a hard place ing a game of people shoes she suggested that we go flying together we have much in common cynthia said both of us were transformed from other forms i knew the moment i saw chena that we would be friends che had told me all about her about how nice she is and how sad he was when she left and now she has wings its wonderful to have company im trying to talk her into joining me with ches family after the trial metria remembered belatedly how electra and nada naga had been close friends though both betrothed to prince dolph apparently something similar was operating here that sounds nice she said you explained to me about friends chena said happily about gloha and cynthia and magician trent and you were right we have a lot in common were both converts from other forms which makes us special regardless how we look magician trent cynthia echoed a look of fond nos talgia crossing her face now theres a man i know ex actly how gloha feels shes on my list metria said im going to serve her next because suddenly she wanted to see her friend again go ahead chena said were fine and dug and kim and jenny are fine too electras showing them around the castle grounds wheres dolph i need him hes around cynthia said turning her head yes there she pointed at a shape in the distant sky thanks metria popped across to that shape it was the big bird playing with the updrafts squawk he asked right ill take you metria reached out and grabbed on to the tip of the rocs tiniest huge talon then the hummingbird was there she closed her fingers carefully around it then she popped off to gloha goblin harpys nest this was in a gantree which was one of the piers anthony weirder trees of xanth looking like a tall network of metal beams gloha resided there with her husband graeboe giant another converted winged monster metria gloha exclaimed flying out from the nest to embrace her hows veleno i left him with a heavy dose of delirious happiness be cause i have a job to do hows graeboe the same what job i have to serve summonses for a big trial heres one for you she brought out glohas token oh i couldnt go without graeboe gloha protested i have one for him too she produced the other token oh very well then gloha took the second token well be there where and when is it at the nameless castle in two thirds of a fortnight the nameless castle isnt that where where roxanne roc will be put on trial youre on the jury because were winged monsters gloha said she has a right to be tried by her peers all right well be there i wish i could visit longer but i have eight more sum monses to serve well see you at the trial gloha said metria realized that she was still holding dolph well no problem she checked her next token mela merwoman witness so she popped over to the east coast of xanth where mela lived but mela wasnt there instead where a river emptied into the sea she found a different merwoman who are you she asked who wants to know the other replied im d metria on business for the simurgh oh in that case ill answer im merci merwoman she reached down into the water and hauled up a human head and this is cyrus merman he was playing with my tail now metria remembered that liaison what are you do ing here in brackish water roc and a hard place its the only water both of us can stand cyrus ex plained im a freshwater creature and shes saltwater so we get together at the fringe however our children are tolerant of both waters merci said proudly thats interesting but im looking for mela mer woman oh mothers with prince naldo naga she showed him her panties and i know that where are they in his princely estate in the naga caves he had salt water piped in for her oh thanks she popped back to the naga caves where she had found jenny elf and nada naga soon she delved down and found the salted caves there was mela merwoman sporting in the water eeeek she cried exactly like an innocent young thing though it was clear that no female with her endowments could ever be innocent its just me d metria the demoness said mela looked at her oh i didnt see you then why did you scream naldos playing with my tail like daughter like mother both had irresistible tails i have to serve you with a summons oh what for youre a witness in the trial of roxanne roc that big bird what did she do i dont know but i hope to find out at the trial so do i ill be there she took the token where is it in the nameless castle how do i get there prince dolph will take you metria held up the hum mingbird prince naldos head broke the surface of the water thats a rather small bird to carry my wife anywhere piers anthony dolph assumed roc form and hunched at the edge of the water squawk but i might be mistaken naldo conceded may i go too youre not on my list but i suppose you can be a spec tator then lets go he said assuming full human shape as soon as we don some clothing mela split her tail into legs climbed from the water shook herself gloriously dry and donned plaid panties the rocs eyes bulged dangerously maybe a bit more clothing naldo said reluctantly so she put on a reasonably sexy dress and he put on a princely robe well meet you on the surface naldo told metria your roc wont be able to fly from here true metria put out her hand and the roc became the hummingbird she popped to the surface where they waited for the others to make their slower way through the labyrin thine naga passages havent you seen panties by now she asked the bird prince dolph appeared only electras of course theyre nice but but nobody fills panties the way mela does metria finished as i recall she even almost freaked you out with out them when you were nine yes i never forgot nor should you she said primly she would have been in violation of the adult conspiracy had she shown you her panties then thats why i never showed you mine i know it was most frustrating well thats the point of the conspiracy what would xanth come to if children got to see anything they wanted to or if they never realized that things were being kept secret from them i understand that now but then i didnt because children arent supposed to understand they roc and a hard place have to be kept in agitated ignorance suspecting what theyre missing otherwise what would be the point none he agreed a stone hatch opened and mela and naldo climbed out lets go naldo said dolph assumed roc form and took them gently in his tal ons and launched himself into the sky but he forgot and took them to castle roogna instead of the nameless castle well thats all right mela concluded well wait there until the trial i can visit with my friends and naldo can hobnob with royalty it works for me the prince agreed maybe i can meet that demon prince my sisters hot for i worried about her but she came through in the end metria resisted the temptation to advertise her part in that because she had to keep moving on her summonsing so she saw them safely to castle roogna then oriented on her mis sion again the next token was for okra ogress that should be no problem okra lived in the deepest darkest jungle with smithereen ogre she popped across and knew she was in the right region because of the small trees tied into pretzel knots large trees with wary looks about them and the furtive ways of me diumsized dragons the presence of an ogre did that to a neighborhood okra had charmed smithereen ogre despite being insufficiently ugly stupid or strong but it had worked out because he had more than enough of all three qualities for both of them she owed her success she thought to her achievement of major character status because no really bad things happened to one of those folk sure enough there was a bashedwood house in the center of the devastation where a notveryugly ogress was wield ing a length of ironwood pounding chestnuts on a mossy stone the chest she was working on was tough but she had it between her rock and a hard place and was slowly getting at the nut inside piers anthony i have a summons for you metria announced you have to be a witness at the trial of roxanne roc i dont think i can go okra said i have to get this nut out so smithereen can eat it and be fortified for his evening of dragon intimidation couldnt he bash that chest open faster himself he could but then hed lose most of the nut it tends to fly into widely scattered fragments when he bashes it she smiled fondly hes just such an ogre so i do it because i have a gentler touch she whaled away with the club chipping away another comer of the chest anyway hes helping he is how by providing the support for the chest so i can bash it it takes a really dense block to hold one of these metria looked now she realized that what she had taken for a low mossy ridge was actually an ogre lying down and the rock on which the chest rested was his head thats as dense as anything is she agreed yes i couldnt do it without him okra clubbed the chest one more time and it finally cracked open she pulled apart the sides and lifted out the big nut inside she heaved it up her limited muscles bulging open your big mouth dear she gasped this is one tough nut the face of the rock cracked open like a mountain fissure okra let go of ae boulderlike mass and it dropped into the hole a tongue appeared as the ogre chewed and sparks flew where the great teeth battled the hard nut it would evidently hold him for a while the trial isnt for a while yet metria said but maybe you could bring your husband along he might find it inter esting in a dimwitted way its at the nameless castle oh i remember that okra said yes he would prob ably like it there he could chew on that extra tough solid ified cloud material hes always been curious about clouds roc and a hard place metria was surprised i thought true ogres were too stu pid to curious about anything oh thats not true okra protested loyally it is ru mored that clouds are even more stupid than ogres and since that hardly seems possible naturally ogres are curious about it smithereen could do a great service for ogredom by in vestigating the matter i could take you both there now metria said but remember he mustnt bash the castle down just the sur rounding cloud ill keep an eye on him okra promised good enough dolph the hummingbird she held became the roc the roc fas tened one set of talons around the ogres feet and the other around the ogres head and looked around so many trees had been bashed down here that there was clearance for take off the bird squawked do what metria asked perplexed squawk squawk squawk squawk squawk squawk okra suggested whatever metria agreed crossly get on but okra was already climbing onto smithereens body following her own suggestion the roc spread his wings and launched into the air carrying the stiff ogre flat with okra riding it like a platform the big ogre mouth still chewed on the tough nut they winged it to the nameless castle where they de posited smithereen on a suitable outcropping bank of cloud dolph returned to hummingbird form smithereen sat up and poked a finger at the cloud in trigued by its toughness this was not ordinary cloudstuff he put his face down and took a bite of it the stuff resisted yielding only very slowly ugh he remarked disap pointed well it depends on which part of the cloud you bite dear okra said this evidently isnt the part that contains piers anthony thunder or lightning but keep biting that section is bound to be somewhere metria nodded there was enough cloud here to hold his attention for some time ill let you know when the trial actually starts she told okra thats fine the ogress said turning to admire the tow ering castle in the center of the cloud isle dont wander too close to the edge its a long way down i know i remember okra waved as metria popped off after a quick check on veleno at home to verify that he was still floating blissfully somewhat above the bed she brought out her next token this was for stanley steamer this could be tricky but if she had to shed get his friend princess ivy to ask him how they were going to keep him from steaming and eating the other jurors during the trial she didnt know but her job was just to get him there she popped across to the gap chasm suddenly the steep walls rose on either side of her and she looked across the reasonably pleasant base of the valley where small fur trees fluffed themselves out and a stray sickamore tree waited for a victim she couldnt resist teasing it she sashayed right toward it haha sicko you cant make me sick im a demoness then she heard a faint retching oopsit was the hum mingbird she had forgotten about dolph she hastily popped across the valley well out of the sick range of the tree sorry about that she said i forgot i was holding you dolph resumed his normal form he looked as if he had just succeeded in not quite retching shnake he gasped what he swallowed reptile serpent viper snake whatever he said weakly looking better its on your leg metria looked down there was a garter snake swallowing her left leg she had inadvertently landed beside a hose bush roc and a hard place and the snake had come out to enclose her leg up to the thigh as was its wont given time it would digest the leg below its fastening on the thigh ugh she puffed into smoke and the snake dropped she reformed to the side she should have watched where she landed such a snake could not hurt her of course but it was embarrassing is that stanley dolph asked peering down the valley it does look like a serpent she agreed but not like stanley the serpent approached them a human head appeared in place of its reptile head hello a naga dolph said yes the naga said perhaps you could help me i seem to be lost of course dolph said i always liked the naga folk im prince dolph of the human folk and this is the de moness metria what can i do for you the figure assumed human form she was a young woman attractive in the way of those who could craft their appearance to suit their desire she lacked clothing because in her natural state she wore none dolphs eyes did the usual male thing trying to bulge out of their sockets it occurred to metria that the human male form was badly designed its eye sockets were too small im anna conda the naga said i am traveling to the northern naga caves via the underground route but i dont recognize the terrain thats because youre in the gap chasm metria said you came up too soon oh the gap i forgot all about it it happens dolph said some wisps of the forget spell that was on it for eight centuries may still be around and you ran into one just go back into the caves and bear north and youll get there i will thanks she shifted rapidly to full serpent form slithered into a hole and disappeared piers anthony prince dolph shook his head im happy with electra of course he said but sometimes i wonder how it would have been with nada naga she doesnt love you metria reminded him electra does he nodded that too as with most young men he could hardly see beyond a girls physical form especially when it happened to be nude that was what made human men such easy prey for demon esses well lets go find stanley sure thing he glanced once more at the hole down which the naga had vanished as if almost tempted to assume serpent form and go after her then became the hummingbird she took him in her hand and floated up high enough to get a better view of the chasm then she took the token in her free hand and heeded its tug she zoomed along in the correct direction soon enough she spied the gap dragon whomping along stanley was now full grown a long sinuous slightly winged green dragon with six legs the legs were too short for real velocity which was why he whomped lifting up his fore section hurling it forward landing it and bringing the rest of his body along in a following arc it looked awkward but it got him where he was going in a hurry hardly any animal caught in the gap escaped once the dragon went after it those that were just out of reach of the teeth could still be brought down by a searing jet of steam the gap dragon was one of the most feared creatures in xanth except for certain folk metria was one because she was a demoness prince dolph was another because he could assume dragon form if he chose and because he had known stanley steamer since childhood and they were friends so she glided down ho stanley she called the dragon paused lifting his snoot there was a puff of steam now dont get steamed she said its me metria roc and a hard place and prince dolph she opened her hand and dolph as sumed his human form and dropped to the ground stanley recognized him dolph threw his arms around the dragon they rolled wrestling and tickling it was an em brace almost nobody else in xanth would have risked but they had been young together for all that it was stanleys second childhood he had been youthened more or less by accident over three decades ago in a slight mishap stanley had become princess ivys pet until it was time for him to resume his job guarding the gap there were three basic types of dragons in xanth fire breathers smokers and steamers the fire dragons were the most feared but actually the smokers were more dangerous because their smoke could blind and suffocate others espe cially in closed places the steamers were the least common but were to be respected in their regions when the two settled down metria held out the token i have a summons for you stanley she said you are to be a juror in the trial of roxanne roc the dragons ears perked up startled one ear was slightly shorter than the other that dated from the time that smash ogre had chewed it off and even the rejuvenation hadnt repaired it entirely his snout assumed a perplexed aspect dolph took the form of a small dragon and growled at him metria wasnt strong on dragon talk but knew that dolph was explaining the situation in greater detail stanley growled back then dolph resumed man form he says hell have to ask his family she couldnt say no to that so lets go ask stanley led them to a deep side shoot of the main chasm there was another grown dragon and a baby dragon metria had known nothing of this she felt slightly jealous even dragons could get the attention of the stork while she couldnt but the baby was cute his mate stella steamer and their son steven steamer dolph said chucking the baby under the chin steven puffed piers anthony out a bit of warm vapor that couldnt be rated as steam but showed promise for the future stanley is on my summonsing list but i dont know that the whole family would be welcome in the nameless cas tle metria said doubtfully stella says someone has to patrol the gap dolph said they take turns with the offduty one taking care of steven if stanley goes to the trial hell have to take steven along because stella cant both whomp and babysit metria considered let me see the tyke she said dolph picked up the little dragon and handed him to her she held him and the little snoot caressed her neck with warm vapor suddenly she lost control oh you little dar ling she cried and hugged steven close she so missed the baby of her own she had not been able to get i think steven will get along okay at the trial dolph remarked if your reaction is typical i guess he will she agreed kissing steven on the cute snoot theres nothing much cuter than a baby dragon when can they go dolph consulted they decided to bring stanley and steven just before the trial date so as to minimize disruption metria set down the little dragon with reluctance i still have more to summons she said noting that dusk was be ginning to think about arriving its a real scramble who are they dolph asked she checked the five remaining tokens marrow bones and sherlock black next i think theyre both family men youd better go after them tomorrow i suppose youre right i do have several days remaining before the trial then if you dont mind ill fly home to my wife he said see you tomorrow she agreed he became the roc spread his wings and stroked up to ward the band of daylight above the chasm roc and a hard place metria waved farewell to the steamer family and popped back home she didnt need any rest but it would be good to relax anyway this job didnt seem so bad after all tomorrow she would complete her summonsing well ahead of schedule mpd in the morning she took care of routine details stoked her husband up for another days worth of bliss and checked her tokens she paused with surprise she had thought there were five left but she hadnt been counting carefully there were four for the walking skeleton the black man and the simurgh herself plus the mysterious unmarked one but now that fourth one was marked it said mpd and on the other side witness so the blank token was finally identifying itself well she had better attend to that immediately because she had no idea who mpd was which meant that he or she or it might be hard to find she held up the token to see which way it tugged there seemed to be a firm direction north so she put it away and popped over to castle roogna to fetch prince dolph roc and a hard place he was rubbing sleep from his eyes last day huh he asked blearily ill be glad of that so will i she agreed this has been an interesting experience but ill be glad to have it done i forget he said did you ever tell me why youre doing this i mean sure for your service to the good ma gicianbut what was your question how to get the storks attention she said i know the motions but the stork has been ignoring me oh he said looking reasonably embarrassed he was twentyone and married and a father but retained a certain fetching naivete well lets go get sheriock and marrow somethings come up she said i had a blank disk now it has a name mpd a witness to the north whos mpd i have no idea but the token should lead us to him then lets go he became the hummingbird and she took him and popped north she landed safely north of the voidand now the token tugged south hmmthat could be bad news nothing left the void except night mares she was a demoness but even she didnt dare risk passing the voids event horizon be cause then she would have to give half a soul to a mare to carry her out and half a soul was all she had she was not about to give it up but as she approached that dreadful line the token tugged down down toward a gourd that was almost as bad nor mal folk entered the gourd realm by looking in a peephole and though their bodies remained outside their souls were locked inside for as long as the eye contact remainedand they could not break it themselves so anyone visiting the dream realm needed a friend to put a finger over the peephole at an agreed time freeing the visitor but this didnt work for demons who had no permanent physical bodies their whole selves entered and they could not leave without the permission of the night stallion trojan that horse of an piers anthony other color was not particularly partial to demons so what was she to do well she was on business for the simurgh so she would just have to tell the horse that meanwhile it would be in teresting exploring the dream realm dolph it seems i have to enter the gourd she said so maybe you had better go home and ill return for you when this is done i dont know he said assuming his human form the gourds a pretty tricky place even for demons maybe i bet ter go in with you but your body would be left out here she reminded him and you would be unable to break contact actually i have a pass for the gourd the stallion lets me visit when i want to but its true i dont want to leave my body exposed he looked around but maybe if i as sumed a safe form it would be all right a safe form some creature no one will bother like maybe a snake a what serpent viper reptile i know what a snake is but someone could step on you not if i become the right kind of snake like maybe a bushmaster oh yes maybe so ill change you orient the gourd for me he became a bush with reptilian scales and poisonous foliage no one would bother him in that state she turned the gourd around until its peephole faced one of the bushs eyes when the bush went rigid she knew it had taken then she turned vapory and carefully insinuated herself through the peephole careful not to interfere with dolphs line of sight it was dark and wet inside she couldnt see anything so she formed a light bulb on the end of her nose the bulb roc and a harp place absorbed darkness leaving the light behind so that the scene became dimly visible she was floating in some deep brine green sea there might be a surface somewhere far above but it seemed too distant to bother with there was no sign of dolph but since he could change form here as well as in normal life he might be a fish exploring ahead there did seem to be a sea floor and on it was a large decorated vase she wasnt sure what it might contain so she made a knuckle and rapped on it a head popped out eh it inquired who patted my um sorry metria said i didnt know it was a pat urn he stared at her what manner of creature are you im the demoness metria he looked disappointed oh one of those she bridled whats the matter with me nothing except that youre only half what i wished for but thats the way it always is her curiosity never far beneath her surface surged up you always get half your wish yes im hal halfling a bit player for bad dreams it is my fate to get only half of what i wish for no matter what it is this time i wished for decent company and i got you metria nodded im indecent company for sure not only am i not a real person i have only half a soul and im not staying exactly i thought i could outsmart it by wishing for xanths most lovely and accommodating woman figuring that i could settle for an ordinary one but once again it halved it in such a way as to leave me no benefit i had such xanticipation he sighed well this is your xanthropology lesson she said i could assume the form of xanths loveliest woman but i dont care to i study men but i try to please only one and it isnt you obviously i dont know why i keep making wishes since they never work out well piers anthony what was your first wish i wanted to be a wit that explains it he looked sourly at her i would wish you to depart but but half of me might remain to pester you she finished i see your problem actually i do plan to depart once i locate my partner and figure out a way to travel conveniently in here yeah sure leave me already hal said grimacing isnt that what you wanted no what i wanted was good companionship he reached up and tore out a hank of hair why cant i ever have what i want maybe you should have wished for control over your emotions metria suggested i did i can control them only halfway too bad you cant control the emotions of others id just get the wrong halves of their emotions she paused having a notion maybe you should make a wish for me youd get only half of it i wonder limited wishes may have their uses wish for my ship to come in he shrugged suit yourself i wish for your ship to come in a light showed in the blurry distance it forged nearer it turned out to be a sort of ship but it sailed well below the surface of the water what is that she asked a hatch opened its a yellow submarine dolph said in human form i was in fish form looking for a better way to travel and i found this just lying where someone discarded it so i brought it in we can travel in comfort in this see hal said thats a half ship halfway sunk so it is metria agreed floating into the hatch say how is it we can talk normally here underwater roc and a hard place this is the dream realm dolph reminded her it doesnt follow regular rules thats right i forgot she settled on the interior floor of the submarine and dolph closed the hatch it was mirac ulously dry here and portals looked out on the sea around them the interior looked lived in as if several notquite housebroken entertainers had spent time here there was a picture of a beetle on one wall where does your summons token point dolph asked she brought it out that way she said pointing he steered the submarine that way it accelerated forging through the sea then the sea dried it didnt end it just thinned into air the submarine didnt care it floated on through the air this is a pretty nice machine dolph remarked i cant think why anyone would have thrown it away theres a man out there metria said dont run him down the airship slowed but the man became a dragon and snapped at it oha weredragon dolph said he opened the portal hey dont snap at us were just passing through the man reappeared ooops sorry about that i thought this was an invader from mundania thats okay dolph said im prince dolph ofxanth who are you and what do you do im jay my father was human my mother a firedrake i wasnt quite comfortable in either society so i got a job supporting bad dreams i listen to the instructions in my hu man phase then perform in my dragon phase its a living do you know anyone here named mpd jay scratched his head there are some pretty strange folk here but i dont recognize that one maybe the cyborg would know cyborg hes part animal part machine really weird i think hes piers anthony reducing flowers today just keep on going the way you are and youll find his dung pile soon enough thanks the submarine floated on they came to a sign hung deep better turn aside metria advised i dont think we want that the submarine veered to the left there was another sign rowing gong metria looked around but saw no gong this doesnt seem right either so the submarine moved to the right instead this time it encountered a sign saying rot night i told you this was an odd place dolph said wed better ask again they saw a woman painting a sign dolph opened the hatch helloim prince dolph from xanth i think were lost can you help us im miss pell she replied of course i can help you why should i because the sooner we find what were looking for the sooner well be out of here miss pell nodded appreciatively that does seem worth while drince polf simply correct my signs and you should be successful drince polf he echoed blankly miss pell metria exclaimed misspell thats whats wrong with the signs he brightened oh okay he closed the hatch and guided the submarine back the way they had come not right metria read correcting the third one going wrong as she saw the second and dung heap this is where we were going sure enough there was a machine man with a piece of wood surrounded by beetles he was touching them with it and they were in turn turning flowers into dung there were not many flowers remaining and the pile of dung was quite large roc and a harp place dolph opened the hatch you must be the cyborg he said but why are you destroying those flowers they were part of the last set the cyborg explained several dreamers were pushing up daisies now we need to recycle them so im using reverse wood to enable the dung beetles to turn them back into dung that must make sense for dreams metria said but i think i see one of a different species she floated out and picked up a bug ill bug his ear she said to dolph then she put the bug in the cyborgs ear and whispered something why of course the cyborg said right that way he pointed dolph set the submarine in motion what did you do i dropped a hint she explained that was a hint bug i found once i bugged his ear he had to tell me the truth they moved on the landscape faded into a sort of fuzzy nothingness with colored ribbons curling through the tug of the token got stronger at last they came to a man sitting on a loop of ribbon surrounded by music he had a huge shock of hair swept back from his forehead and wore a suit that trailed almost to the ground behind him he had no instrument and his mouth was closed yet the music was clearly governed by his will because he was nodding to its beat and moving his hands as if to accent some aspects while smoothing down others when metria approached him he looked up and it faded yes are you mpd she asked i am no one somewhat wary violin music sounded i think you are mpd because this summons token is nudging right toward you you must appear as a witness at the trial of roxanne roc the music rumbled with drums ascendant where is this trial no one asked in the nameless castle in xanth proper were here to take you there piers anthony a bassoon made a dirty noise i cant leave the dream realm i cant go but this summons says you have to she said holding out the token no one brushed it away forget it demoness the woodwinds whistled as he dropped off his loop of ribbon and fell into the depths below she dived down after him but the bands of ribbon became numerous and convoluted obscuring her view and her way mpd had disappeared so its going to be that type of a serving she muttered well i wont be balked she held up the token and heeded its tug she threaded her way through the ribbons and they be came thin bands of candy then thickened into flavored col ored cotton the cotton formed into threads and then into fabrics and the fabrics wound their way into items of cloth ing and there amidst the hanging suits and dresses sat a young woman with fair hair pressing sections of cloth to each other they adhered where they touched and she twisted the free sections around and pressed them together again and they stuck together again forming the configu rations of clothing yes she inquired as metria floated up im looking for mpd have you seen him who his name is mpd he has a big shock of wild hair and he makes music just by thinking of the instruments oh thats maestro no one maybe me two can tell you hes that way thank you metria floated hurriedly in the direction indicated the racks of clothing became blobs of goo she weaved around them and soon they became blocks of charred wood she lifted the token again and it tugged her in a new direction she followed it she came across a short stout man with fiery red hair standing in a smoking pit a blob of goo appeared before roc and a hard place him he stared at it and it burst into flame it burned vig orously for half a moment then settled into a moderate glow for another moment and finally became another charred lump he looked up as she floated close yes me two im looking for mpd who she described the maestro the man frowned who told you that was the one you wanted i know because my token indicated him but a fair haired young woman told me to come this way because me two would know that was she three she shouldnt have told you that why not dont you know where mpd is i know where maestro no one isbut she shouldnt have told you metria was beginning to be annoyed i think you folk are giving me a runaround now tell me what you know no go away demoness we dont want your kind here listen burnbrain she started angrily then realized that he was baiting her since she really didnt need him she refused to let him waste more of her time she lifted the tokenand it tugged right toward him whats that me two asked its a summons token for the trial of roxanne roc in mainland xanth and it seems to be tugging toward you she said perplexed he squinted at herand suddenly she was a mass of flames he had spontaneously combusted her you dirty noise she swore becoming water the flames hissed out but the distraction had been effective me two was gone she lifted the token and zoomed along the path it indi cated the charred blobs became polished blocks of wood and then polished metal and then polished glass reflections were everywhere and there among the reflections were a piers anthony host of little old whiskery men with collections of small ob jects metria knew the difference between a real figure and a reflected one she zeroed in on the original where is mpd she demanded the man lookedup who the maestro did he pass this way the little man lifted a glistening red bottle he put his two hands around it and drew them apart and lo there were two glistening red bottles no she was getting about as fed up as a noneating demoness could be no you wont tell me or no he didnt pass this way no neither who are you i am who four i duplicate inanimate objects as you can see i am busy at the moment as you can also see now go away demoness metria was getting more crafty she lifted the tokenand ittugged right toward who four are you mpd i dont know what youre talking about he lifted a small puzzle box put his hands around it and separated them holding two small puzzle boxes well im going to serve this summons on you who four she decided she floated toward him who four jumped the action was so sudden that it caught her by surprise he sailed right up past a mirrorbeam and disappeared she followed but all she found were dozens of reflections of herself so she faded into invisibility and then there were dozens of reflections of nothing but who four was gone now she was getting good and irritated there is something very odd about this she muttered she lifted the token and followed its tug once more this time it led her away from glass column and beams and past a forest of upside trees to the blank wall of a mas roc and a hard place sive rock cliff there was a door set in it marked gourd storage dept no admittance fooey on that foul noise she muttered and floated through it for a moment she wished she hadnt because something fearsome rose up before her she screamed and retreated halfway back into the wall then she got hold of herself putting one hand on a shoulder and the other on a knee and hung on tight youre a demoness metria she reminded herself you arent afraid of anything because nothing can hurt a demoness then there was a small swirl of leaves and dust before her she screamed again and popped right out of there but in two thirds of a moment she took stock that is the storage place of fears she realized no wonder its scary and her worst fear was of stepping beyond the magic in mundania and dissolving into a mindless swirl of dust but this was the gourd the dream realm one of the more magic aspects of xanth she would not fade out here all she had to do was conquer her unreasonable fear and follow the token this time she would not let whoever or whatever it was she found escape because a remarkable suspicion was lifting its pointed head partway into her consciousness so she nerved herself and walked back through the cliff wall the dust swirled up again but this time she addressed it with what boldness she could muster you are merely a fear from my memory of mundania i am not dreaming you have no power over me aw shucks the swirl muttered subsiding metria smiled dust did not normally speak in human fash ion unless king dor was around but this was the dream realm where the rules were as the night stallion made them she had won a small victory now where was that person hiding she lifted the token and followed its tug the simurgh had good magic because these bisks worked in xanth mundania and the dream realm which stood to reason because metria wasnt sure piers anthony that any entity had more power than the simurgh except perhaps the demon xcan himself that reminded her of the root of this endeavor whatever could roxanne roc have done to warrant such a prominent trial with the threat of enormous punishment the simurgh must be really annoyed well she would find out when the trial came meanwhile she merely had to serve the last three summonses then report back to serve the simurgh herself of course her job wouldnt be quite finished because she still had to make sure that every last summonsee arrived at the nameless castle but she was confident she could handle that because once served no summonsee could really decline she walked onward through the storage dept of fears seeing things that were surely fearsome to normal folk slav ering dragons hissing snakes quivering tentacles things go ing bump in the night hairylegged spiders rent collectors and a long hollow stick she paused whats so fearful about you she asked the stick i am from the stem of a plant known as rye the stick answered i am full of my seeds which are very solid and that terrifies dreamers she asked with a hint of a suggestion of a sneer she knew would annoy it yeswhen someone points me at such folk and threat ens to shoot out my seeds the rye full replied i think its the loud bang i make as they go because i dont like losing my seeds metria shrugged and moved on mortal folk chose funny things to fear soon she came to an eye land it was shaped like a giant eyeball gazing up at the sky she remembered that big eyes in the night frightened some folk the token tugged toward it but it was surrounded by water as most eye lands were for some reason maybe the water cooled their chafing orbs as they shifted in their sockets she could float across to it but preferred to walk so she wouldnt miss anything low that made the water a problem roc and a hard place well she would just have to wade she put a foot to the waterand discovered it was solid she could walk on it what kind of water are you she asked it i am hard water of course it said oh of course she agreed feeling stupid whats fear ful about you folk fear drowning in me especially when my surfs are revolting they can get pretty violent especially during a storm all of which she should have realized on her own she walked on across to the eye land there she saw an eyeglass bush which was of course made of glass with glass eyes in lieu of flowers the eyes glared at her in frightening fash ion so she could appreciate why this plant was stored here there certainly seemed to be a good many props no wonder the dream crews had no trouble grafting bad dreams for all occasions every night it amazed her to realize how many bad dreams were needed since they went only to those who deserved them there had to be a great many imperfect peo ple if it was like this in xanth how much worse must it be in mundania the token tugged her on she came to a rocky section of the eye land she paused at a big rock whats so scary about you rock it opened an eye thats roc demoness not rock havent you learned the difference it shook out a wing which she now saw was folded around it making it as fea tureless as a boulder sorry about that shesaid amused but you still dont seem very petrifying to me very what the stonehard bird asked appalling dismaying horrifying alarming consterna tioning frightening whatever she agreed crossly why should any dreamer fear you because of what i do the roc said like thus piers anthony suddenly metria was rock hard she had become a statue she puffed into smoke nullifying the effect why you putrescent excrescence she swore you turned me into a rock thats what i do the rock agreed folk are terrified of being petrified she gazed at the sharp tip of its beak as it spoke you have a point she agreed cuttingly and went on she came to an ugly tree with uglier fruit it was a bag tree growing every kind of bag she touched one and found it was full of trash a trash bag another contained a sand wich and bottle of juice a lunch bag one almost put her to sleep a sleeping bag a fourth one grabbed at her a grab bag so she made like a punching bag and punched it in the mouth get out of here you old bag it told her the token led her to a bookshelf and stopped when she tried to walk on the token tugged back when she went to the side the token tugged toward the shelf but there was no one there so she considered it more carefully on it were several books scattered and tumbled there were parts of pictures on their spines someone didnt put these away properly she said disgusted so she stood the books up and set them together but the picture segments on their spines formed a jumbled mess this wont do she said so she rearranged the books with an eye to the picture segments and they began forming a proper picture when it was complete the picture was of a comfortable chamber wherein a man snoozed on a couch he was a fairly handsome human male obviously just resting between stints of work an open book was on the table beside him the picture now properly assembled was surprisingly realistic and the token tugged right toward it toward the snoozing man this is weird she muttered but she reminded herself yet again that she was in the dream realm where weirdness was routine and in a private section of it where fears were stored for future use there seemed to be nothing fearsome roc and a hard place about this scene but she didnt yet understand all its impli cations so she turned smoky then shrank into the scale of the scene and entered it she found herself in the room beside the couch are you she began but she stopped because the man wasnt there he must have gotten up as she was phasing in he was standing to the side near the door who are you he asked i am d metria here with a summons for mpd she said and i think you must be him she stepped toward him with the token extended you have to report to the nameless castle as a witness but he had already moved away i have no reason to accept such a summons he said she whirled on him then tell me who you think you are i am take five he said and i was doing that as is my wont when you intruded into my home what is your talent i can see five seconds into the future that is why you will not be able to serve me with that summons i will be five seconds elsewhere i am a demoness she said evenly i can float or fly at any speed suppose i take out after you and simply pursue you unremittingly no matter how fast you flee you may see it coming but you will not be able to prevent my serving you with this summons eventually you wont even be able to sleep unless you can do so in naps less than five seconds each he pondered evidently realizing that she was not bluffing there was a limit to his talent how much do you know he asked i dont know anything for sure but i think that you are a person with multiple personalitiesand each personality has a different magic talent he nodded how did you catch on in part because i have the same complaint myself i am piers anthony metria and mentia and woe betide she shifted briefly into the two other forms as she spoke its a nuisance but it has its points so im not condemning you i just have a job to do his attitude softened i see you do have a similar com plaint i took you for an impersonation a what counterfeit bogus fraudulent pretense semblance sub stitute fake whatever he said smiling couldnt see why any one would summons an entity who exists only in the fear storage of the dream realm i have many personalities and forms and talents because i am a generalpurpose substitute when they dont have the proper character for a dream se quence i fill in as well as i can my mind is deemed irrel evant so i assumed you were another joker sent to disturb my equilibrium they play jokes on you sometimes it seems it gets boring between scenes he shrugged nevertheless i cant go outside the dream realm because i have no reality in the real world so i think that however sincere you may be your summons is not its from the simurgh that may be but unless she is prepared to lend me a soul i may not leave here i lack the solidity of the walking skeletons or brassy folk i would simply fade into oblivion like any other figment maybe the token can handle it she said doubtfully very well lets test it i will know if it provides support for the external realm she handed him the token he took it and paused no this has no animation for me its dead in fact it seems to be blank she looked indeed the disk was blank on both sides i dont understand it said mpdwitness before and it led me right to you to all of you roc and a harp place something is amiss try it again he handed it back she lifted itand now the words were back it tugged toward him its working again seethere are the words she held it up so that he could see true so it works when you hold it and not when i hold it maybe i just happen to be the wrong personality so lets try the others no one appeared the token tugged but faded when he took it me two appeared with no better result the same happened with she three and who four well maybe one of my alternates take five said a new form appeared in the uniform of a nurse im pickup six my talent is to take pain away by touch but the touch of the disk did nothing for her another form appeared a very friendlyseeming character i am roll seven my talent is making friends but there was still no reaction yet another appeared a young man vaguely reminding metria of grey murphy i am eight late my talent is de hancement still nothing a mischievously smiling young woman appeared i am nine line my talent is to tickle at a distance she gestured with her hands and suddenly metria exploded into helpless laughter because she was being terribly tickled she had to form a layer of impervious shellac all over her body before she was able to withstand it then the tickle started in her throat making her cough she lost track of the other variations the token answered to none i dont think it relates to any of your aspects she said at last i dont understand this it was blank until today and then it suddenly brought me here and now it doesnt seem to want to be served is it possible that someone else enchanted it take five asked resuming form who could interfere with something the simurgh set up he nodded that is an excellent question but perhaps it piers anthony isnt interference merely illusion you say thats a blank token so maybe there is no magic on it if someone made it look as if it had a name and made it seem to tug that might not be overriding the simurghs magic merely sliding past it metria considered that seems possible but who would bother he shrugged i cant imagine but it seems like a pos sibility to be investigated yes she put away the token then i wont bother you anymore i apologize for chasing after you a demoness apologizes im halfsouled bye she popped off she returned to the region she had last seen prince dolph he was in the submarine playing with a creature he had found somewhere it had big heavy flat feet that smashed constantly against the floor he looked up as she popped in this is a stampede he explained it stamps nickelpedes into flat squares of paper indeed there were several such squares before him each marked fivecent stamps so did you nab your summonsee it was a bum lead she said lets get out of here the submarine got into motion taking them back while it traveled she explained what had happened too bad i had to waste a day finding out that this was a wild duck chase goose if you do ill tell your wife we had better have eve check that disk he said she should be able to tell if anything has been done to it good idea his twin daughters were only four years old but were full sorceresses they reached the exit region and metria slid out she knew that she probably wouldnt have been able to do it if the night stallion objected but her mission for the simurgh gave her authority then she put a finger between the bush masters eye and the peephole of the gourd breaking contact roc and a harp place so that dolphs attention returned to the regular world of xanth if was now late in the day he resumed his human form every time i enter the gourd its different he remarked this wasnt as wild as sometimes but it was interesting i liked that submarine and that stampede could be useful out in real xanth then he became the hummingbird and she took him and popped back to castle roogna they explained the situation to electra who took them to the twins dawn and eve who were in their playroom play ing with their pet eightlegged kitten octo puss then metria showed eve the token the childs eyes went round something awful strong did this she said but i dont know who cause she never touched it someone enchanted it metria asked from a dis tance yes its sposed to be blank eve lost interest and re turned her attention to the kitten metria shared a glance with dolph and electra so there was interference and i can ignore it after this do we have time to serve the last two dolph asked lets go they went after marrow bones first he lived in a house made of bones with his wife gracile ossein and their eight year old son picka and daughter joynt so how do you like your eight souls metria inquired she had been present when graeboe giant had given marrow bones half his soul enabling the walking skeleton to remain permanently outside the gourd marrow of course had shared with his wife and children now each of them had an eighth soul because souls didnt regenerate in nonliving folk its odd pick said odd joynt agreed but nice grace said now we do nice things natu rally instead of having to figure them out that was the thing about the bones family they had al piers anthony ways been nice despite having no souls metria had not no ticed or cared before she got her own soul but now she found it remarkable marrow and grace had been two of the most decent creatures in xanthwhile believing that they were not it made metria wonder whether souls really were the origin of goodness i have a summons for marrow she said to be a juror at roxanne rocs trial she explained the situation as far as she knew it i shall be glad to attend marrow said accepting the token though i find it hard to believe that such a bird would do anything culpable or that i should be competent to judge her in such a matter its one monstrous mystery to me too metria con fessed i have always been curious and this has pulled my curiosity so tight its about to snap she assumed the form of a giant rubber band tightly stretched do you think grace and the bonelets could come to watch marrow asked i am sure they would find it ed ucational metria resumed human form and shrugged we can bring them along and see whether there is any objection it isnt my job to exclude anyone just to make sure that every person on my list is there the two little skeletons jumped up and down clapping their bony hands with a rattling sound goody they ex claimed we get to see the nameless castle are you ready to go now metria asked its early yet but id like to get folk there early rather than late i have just one more token to deliver and if you dont mind sharing the trip marrow and grace exchanged an eyeless glance we are ready now marrow said so dolph assumed roc form and marrow bent over and grace kicked him on the tailbone he flew apart and formed into a basket of bones and the others climbed into this bas roc and a harp place ket and dolph hooked three talons into it spread his wings and heaved it up oooo this is fun picka cried peering down through the bonebars of the basket it looks just like a map joynt exclaimed metria found herself enjoying the flight through their eyes as if experiencing it for the first time maybe this was another fringe benefit of having a soul squawk the big bird was circling high getting his bearings oh she had forgotten go to lake ogrechobee she called to dolphs huge head the black village the bird oriented and winged swiftly for the lake oooo the children repeated as the land slid by below showing off its fields forests rivers mountains and settle ments the outlines sharpened because the land too was responsive to appreciation and wanted to make its best im pression even the small passing clouds brightened their sil ver linings looking pretty most clouds were sweetspirited in contrast to stormy practo they spiraled down toward the black village which was in the center of a nicely landscaped section beside lake ogrechobee dolph landed in the central square released the basket folded his wings and resumed man form a cheerful black man approached to what do we owe the pleasure of this visit prince dolph he inquired his eyes passed across the skeletons i see you come in style the demoness metria has something for you sherlock dolph replied a summons metria said and explained sherlock considered i suppose i could go this is a quiet time during tourist season its another matter let me go post my name on the black list he walked away the little skeletons were looking at the village everything was black from the houses to the blackeyed peas growing around the square a black cat eyed them from atop a black post and blackbirds sat in the edge of the black hole that piers anthony was the village well surrounded by blackberries a black snake slithered across the black peat in the village men were playing blackjack and they could see the school where black magic was being taught there were letter boxes for black mail in a nearby field black sheep grazed among blackeyed susans what a neat place picka said awed yes everythings a dull bone white where we live joynt agreed black is beautiful grace agreed lets go get some black paint so we can turn our house and boneyard black delighted they went with her along the black brick road to the black market at the other side of the village dolph kicked the bone cage so that the bones flew apart and reformed as marrow this is already proving to be worthwhile the skeleton remarked sherlock returned wearing a black hat showing that he was now dressed for duty i got a black look when i said id be away but i showed them this black beryl token and they knew it was legitimate he looked around uhoh are they shopping at the black market that can be danger ous for the inexperienced why marrow asked are the proprietors black hearted not exactly its just that too many things are available all they want is black paint grace and the children returned they carried a can of black paint but also a black bag with black bread and black silk cloth and a black pete doll and the children wore black face as they chewed on black licorice sticks i think my common sense blacked out grace said abashed there were so many nice things point taken marrow muttered black markets are dangerous marrow resumed basket form and the others crowded in dolph resumed roc form and lifted them up they were on their way to the nameless castle metrias job was almost done prosecution so you are the last one i am serving metria told the simurgh offering her the token with her name on it of course the simurgh agreed accepting it you thave done well demoness but there is one token remaining its blank so i cant serve it do you want it back the simurgh cocked a huge eye at her no it means that your job is not yet finished at one time it had a name but that was an error the eye remained fixed on her so metria told the simurgh about the mpd misadventure do you think someone is trying to interfere she concluded the simurgh sighed l had hoped this would not hap pen ip i employed an insignificant personage it seems that the opposition did in due course realize what is going on piers anthony roc and a hard place you mean someone is yes but who would dare try to interfere with something you wished to accomplish metria asked on occasion the major demons have contests be tween themselves in their endless quests for en hanced status three years ago the demon e challenged the demon x for dominion over the land of xanth and their instrument of decision was the companions of xanth game as played by two ig norant mundanes now the demoness v is chal lenging the demon x h and it seems that their instrument of decision is this trial metria was amazed you mean the way roxannes trial is decided will decide the fate of xanth so it seems this was not my purpose in instituting the trial but they have now fixed on it for their own purposes i have no power over the senior demons nor do i know in what way it will settle their issue but dont you know everything everything except what is in the minds of senior de mons they are laws unto themselves but then how do we know which side were on we do not know but it seems likely that it is the demoness who wishes to disruptthe trial because the demon could have canceled it at the outset had he chosen it may be that the likely decision in the trial will favor the demon so she hopes to prevent that decision from occurring then we need to make sure that the trial proceeds as scheduled metria said exactly good demoness but i have no power to en sure that as i am at this stage merely a witness then who the eye merely gazed at her oh no but my job is merely to fetch in the witnesses metria protested your job is to see that all the chosen personnel are present for the trial at the appointed time i cant do anything to stop an entity as powerful as the demon x himself perhaps you can there are constraints because the demon x th evidently wishes this trial to proceed the demoness cannot interfere openly demons never oppose each other directly she must arrange for the trial to be disrupted by some seemingly coincidental factor or introduce some element that will change the verdict this was surely her intention when she caused an erroneous designation to appear on the thirtieth summons disk it may be that her inputs are limited perhaps to three and that you have nullified one you must be alert for any disruption or unwar ranted change so that the trial proceeds as origi nally slated only in this manner can you be assured that xanth will not become subject to the will and magic of a foreign entity and such a change might well be the end of xanth as they knew it because a foreign demoness would have different priorities the demon x th allowed the land of xanth to function without interference and that was the way most residents preferred it the demoness v evn might simi larly let it be or might decide to change everything just to spite the former proprietor or perhaps from simple whimsy metria as a demoness herself had no confidence in the mo tives of the type it would be betterinfinitely betterto remain with the present administration metria swallowed which was a sign of stress because she had no saliva to swallow i will try my best she said do that good demoness then it was time to go so she popped back home she saw to the routine chores with only half a mind in fact her worser half mentia saw to most of them realizing that this was not the occasion for mischief what was the demoness v going to do next and piers anthony what could metria do about it she had no idea and no idea yet she had to be ready so she circulated constantly making sure that all of the summonsees were ready and that they would report to the nameless castle at the right time she encouraged them to go early because once they were there at the castle they couldnt depart until the trial was done fortunately the nameless castle had accommodations for everyone and was a fine place to stay the trial personnel and prospective jurors and witnesses and their families and friends had a fine time associating with each other they were all under the aegis of the castle so tender morsels like jenny elf or mela merwoman had no fear of the dragon stanley steamer or the realitychanging corn pewter in fact they were having a great time rapunzel and threnody were learning weird games like bridge and poker from kim and dug mun dane which were actually played with decks of cards they had little or nothing to do with rivers or fires the children of the bones family were playing dice with okra ogress and stanley steamer somehow the children kept winning and claiming their prizes of ogreback or dragonback rides prin cess ida was in a deep discussion with corn pewter about whether changed realities were believable kirns dog bub bles and jennys cat sammy were playing tagtail around cloud hummocks with little steven steamer the two gar goyles provided a steady stream of guaranteed fresh water which pooled in two depressions of the cloud so that nada naga could swim in one and mela merwoman could swim in the other after it had been appropriately salted when they swam by some coincidence all of the unattached males got interested in watching possibly their preference for swim ming in bare human form had something to do with it in short a good time was being had by all it wouldnt last roc and a hard place for she had been left alone by the simurghs decree all rise magician trent said most of those present stood two of the winged ones flew up higher before realizing that this wasnt required the dragon lifted his head high one child wasnt paying atten tion so trent walked over to him and transformed him to an infantree then he changed him back having made his point the bailiff could enforce his directives demon grossclout appeared with a great noxious flair of brimstone and called the proceedings to order from the lofty rampart of his bench i realize that there remains an inor dinate quantity of mush in your heads he said politely but if you really concentrate maybe just maybe you will get through this procedure without utterly disgracing your selves however he looked extremely doubtful about that now do we have the prosecuting and defense attorneys present magician grey murphy and princess ida stepped forward yes your honor they said almost together grossclout frowned though this was hardly distinguisha ble from his normal expression you have flies princess ida no just a little moon she tilted her head so that the moon swung up for a clearer view now the others in the courtroom noticed it and were impressed he glowered forbiddingly and have you prepared your cases yes your honor be seated he glared around and is the court bailiff present magician trent stepped forward looking about as young and handsome as he ever could be yes your honor and the special effects person sorceress iris stepped up young and pretty her recent rejuvenation became her though she was probably enhancing her appearance as well yes your honor and the court translator piers anthony grundy golem stepped forth present your honor be seated judge grossclouts terrible gaze forged across the remaining people and creatures and the eight een prospective jurors here your honor they chorused the judge frowned horrendously i heard only seventeen responses one was missing metrias soul almost sagged out of her body she had thought she had everyone identify yourselves magician trent said grundy count them off as they do the prospective jurors stood in turn lifting their summons tokens and speaking their names and the golem counted them off when they were done the count stood at seventeen meanwhile metria made her own count she had served seven trial personnel tokens seventeen juror tokens and five witness tokens that was twentynine of the thirty to kens she had been given and there was the key say i know what she started but was almost immediately stifled by the collision of judge grossclouts glare i mean if it please the court the glare became insignificantly less forbidding speak demoness seventeen juror summonses was all i served all i had i have one token leftbut its blank that must be for the eighteenth juror approach the bench she approached holding up the blank disk grossclout took it and frowned on it for a generous moment then he looked up is the simurgh present present your honor the simurghs powerful thought came occupying another chamber of the castle even the judges forbidding mien seemed just a trifle daunted by that puissant presence why is this summons disk blank it is a spare to be invoked at a later time grossclouts eyes looked as if they would have rolled roc and a hard place somewhat in their brooding sockets had the response been from any lesser creature but he put a lid on it as he returned the token to metria the prospective juror roster is com plete at seventeen are the five witnesses present here your honor the judge nodded this is to be the trial of roxanne roc for violation of the adult conspiracy there was a mixed gasp some were amazed by the seri ousness of the charge others that such a creature could have done it roxanne had not even been near a child in centuries the awful brows lowered we shall now impanel the jury the grim gaze focused bailiff prosecution de fense perform your roles the judge closed his eyes seem ingly going to sleep magician trent called the first name threnody barbar ian metrias beautiful daughter the half demoness stepped up and took the interrogation chair she had done her hair for this occasion and looked stunning in her short skirt espe cially when she crossed her legs do you understand that you are under oath grossclout asked her sure you want me to tell the truth prosecutor grey murphy approached her you are a bar barian he said by marriage she replied im an asocial half demon ess in my maiden state do you care about enforcing the adult conspiracy i think its hilarious is that a yes or a no thats a laugh the judges left eye cranked open the prospective juror will answer the question with an affirmation or a negation what that means yes or no grey said oh she considered no you dont care about enforcing the adult conspiracy piers anthony right i think its crazy i mean whats so bad about using hot words or showing your panties to a child the kids all know about them anyway grey frowned i challenge this juror on the ground that the juror is excused the judge said what just because i told the truth i thought you wanted the truth we appreciate the truth grey said carefully we just dont feel that you are suitable for this jury well if you feel that way i dont want to be on it threnody got up almost showing her panties in the process and went to join the audience suppose those panties had shown metria wondered there were some children in the audience would the judge have called a mistrial or merely tossed threnody off the cloud for contempt of court the bailiff called out the second name rapunzel go lem rapunzel took the chair she was as lovely as threnody but in a much safer more demure way she agreed that the adult conspiracy should be enforced lest childish minds be corrupted the prosecution accepted her but the defense did not do you have any affinity with the defendant roxanne roc princess ida asked rapunzel frowned i dont know what you mean i dont even know her except by reputation have you formed an opinion about her guilt in this mat ter well there must be some reason for her to have been charged im ready to listen to the evidence and decide idas moon swung meaningfully around suppose you were charged with such a violation objection grey called the juror is not being charged this relates to her attitude and belief ida responded the judge shrugged overruled the juror will answer roc and a hard place rapunzel was shocked why i would never ever but you are prepared to believe that a bird you dont know would ida demanded and her moon looked bleak i didnt say that but if the evidence objection grey said counsel for defense is badg ering the juror the judge rapped the counter with his gavel the sound was explosive approach the bench grey and ida went to the bench what is your point defense grossclout asked my client has the right to be tried by a jury of her peers ida said rapunzel is certainly a nice person but her perspective is that of an ordinary xanth citizen not that of an isolated roc so she is not a peer the judge actually looked faintly impressed what do you consider to be qualification for a peer to be a winged monster or isolated from mainstream xanth but that would exclude almost everyone grey pro tested no i could find twelve or more qualified jurors in this group grossclout nodded point taken he glanced at grey do you have any objection to a jury consisting of winged monsters and isolated others provided there are a sufficient number grey shrugged no objection your honor provided they accept the adult conspiracy as valid very well this should facilitate the selection process proceed but at that point the castle shook there was a faint howl ing sound and the floor slowly tilted what is going on grossclout demanded irritably ill check metria said and popped outside it was an ugly storm brewing dark clouds were scudding around the castle in a malignant pattern and the winds were piers anthony rising because the nameless castle stood on a floating cloud it was subject to destabilization by high winds fracto metria exclaimed she was answered by a menacing roll of thunder it was the evil cloud for sure fracto had probably been sent to do this mischief by the demoness v her second effort to disrupt the trial that meant that the storm could not read ily be stopped she popped back inside cumulo fracto nimbus is at tacking she said why that impertinent pipsqueak grossclout snapped i remember when he flunked out of my ethics of magic class a mere century ago well well have to find a way to stop him and soon metria said before he huffs and he puffs and he blows our castle down i could transform a number of folk into roc form ma gician trent suggested so they could flap their wings and blow him away objection ida said anchored to the castle their backdraft might turn it right over and if she believed it was so it well might be so we need something fast and gentle metria said she felt responsible perhaps because she had been forewarned by the simurgh a person in the audience has the talent of making a force field magician trent said perhaps that could stabilize the castle no sorceress iris said it merely keeps anything in or out it wouldnt stop the castle from being turned over entire meanwhile the storm intensified shaking and tilting the castle worse people were holding on to their chairs but the chairs were starting to slide there was a squawk of alarm from roxannes chamber she was trying to protect the egg in this increasingly treach erous situation normally being between a roc and a hard roc and a hard place place was quite safe but the egg could crack against the stone nest if jogged or rolled too violently hold on the simurghs thought came then to metria do something but what could she do she was an insignificant demon ess it would do no good for her to go out and insult fracto who would just get worse her despairing gaze saw the winged monsters flying above the others achieving stability by having no direct contact with the heaving castle among them was chena centaur the most recently converted one chena metria popped across to her chenai need your wishstone will it work for me im not sure no one else has tried it it has to give it to me distracted the centaur reached in her pack and brought out the little stone metria took it and popped outside the castle the clouds were roiling closer and worse forming obscene blisters about to burst and spatter the castle with their juice the castle was in the center of a turbulent wall of grayblack cloud that formed a complete circle and ex tended up and down making an awful tube that tube was contracting and the clouds were moving faster as it did like a stone winding up on a whirling string when that tube got small enough the castle itself would be whirled around and probably hurled right out of xanth fracto was doing his very worst ever this time and the simurgh couldnt stop it be cause she couldnt directly oppose the demoness v eyn that was why metria had to find another way she lifted the stone i wish fracto would go away she said the storm hesitated the wish was taking effect but then the motion resumed metrias wish wasnt enough to stop the effort of two demons fracto and venus now what could she do a light bulb flashed just over her head mentia make your wish mentia took over the body she was a little crazy but not piers anthony crazy enough to support the possible destruction of all xanth she held up the wishstone fracto go away she wished again the evil storm hesitated two wishes were stronger than one the funnel of dark clouds lost cohesion and began to expand but then it pulled itself together again fracto was so or nery that even two wishes were not enough to turn him aside woe betide mentia said the innocent tyke took over the body woe betides big soulful eyes brimmed with fetching tears she held up the wishstone please fracto go away she wished this time it was too much the wish of an innocent child was the strongest of all curses foiled again the wall of cloud fragmented and the fierce winds died the storm fell apart into a great mess of brownish blobs like diarrhea foul ing the sky and faded into impotent drools of mist fracto was gone good work good demoness metria resumed control she was if not overwhelmed by the compliment at least generously whelmed but she knew her job was not done there could still be one more effort to disrupt the trial and she had to guard against it she popped inside the castle had stopped rocking and the creatures were settling down judge grossclout spied her you had something to do with this he asked around a glower in her direction yes your honor she confessed abashed as always by his direct attention you may yet lose a bit of mush from that idiot skull he said turning away and she felt deeply nattered again because the demon professors faintest favor was a thing rarely granted to any creature the impaneling of the jury continued in deference to the nature of the defendant who was a winged monster half the selected jurors were winged monsters gloha and grae boe giantharpy gary gar and gayle goyle stanley steamer and che centaur the others were objective aliens roc and a hard place on the assumption that this would enable them to understand the viewpoint of a bird who had been mostly isolated from xanth for several centuries dug and kim mundane whose contact with xanth had been limited sherlock black and jenny elf who had come from far lands not all that long ago marrow bones from the gourd realm and corn pewter who never did relate well to ordinary xanth reality cynthia and chena centaur were seated alternates in case something should happen to any of the impaneled jurors each of them had become winged monsters after being something else so they should understand both perspectives overall it was an unusual but well qualified jury the judge wasted no time is the prosecution ready yes your honor grey murphy said proceed now the wall separating the trial chamber from roxanne rocs nesting chamber slid back making one huge central chamber metria was surprised she hadnt realized that this was a feature of the nameless castle the big bird was now in the full view of all the assembled trial personnel she seemed oblivious neither twitching any feather nor making any sound she merely sat as she had for centuries grey took the center stage the prosecution will dem onstrate that the defendant roxanne roc egregiously vio lated the adult conspiracy by uttering an adult word in the presence of a minor and thereby may have prejudiced the future of xanth a murmur passed across the group roxannes near eye opened squawk she protested the judges loud gavel banged there will be order in this court defense will have its hour in due course but this was the nub of it metria realized how could roxanne have done any such thing when there had not been any minors in this castle in all the centuries of her confine ment here this was one of the most protected places in all xanth before the trial few creatures had even known of the nameless castles existence fewer had visited it and the roc piers anthony had not spoken any bad words to them so the charge seemed baseless yet grey murphy evidently took it seriously and he was nobodys fool his talent was to nullify magic and he seemed to be able to nullify foolish notions too if he thought the big bird was guilty it seemed likely that she was grossclout oriented on grey murphy resume first the matter of the adult word the prosecution calls pheira human to the witness seat pheira stood and came to the witness box grundy golem approached her do you swear to tell the truth no matter what sure the witness is duly sworn the judge said with more than a hint of annoyance at the informality grey approached the witness where do you live i live in a mushroom in the deepest jungle north of lake ogrechobee what is your talent i summon animals to help me or those i want to help have you ever interacted with the defendant roxanne roc yes once about two years ago state the full nature of that interaction well it was an accident really and nothing much hap pened just objection ida said and her moon bobbed the wit ness is offering a conclusion sustained the judge said grey grimaced then came at it another way did you have a dialogue with roxanne roc yes but it really wasnt objection sustained but i need to establish the context of this encounter grey protested the judge was unsympathetic find a way that doesnt roc and a hard place cause the witness to offer a conclusion about the defen dant grey considered then he faced the judge prosecution requests the assistance of the court special effects officer to animate this testimony and the court translator to rep resent speech without invoking any conclusions of the wit ness granted the sorceress iris came to the stage followed by little grundy golem what scene do you want iris asked start with her home and animate her description for the jury and audience iris stood beside the witness and listened to her words which were now spoken faintly so that the jury did not hear after two and a half moments the illusion picture formed it started with an aerial scene similar to that seen by crea tures being carried through the air by a roc it showed lake ogrechobee with the chobees basking at its edges south of it was the curse fiends thunderdome and west of it was black village then the view slid to the north moving down until it intersected the ground there was a deep jungle there through which the kiss mee river wound the river had been very friendly until the demons pulled it straight making it into the kill mee river but later its friendly curves had been restored and once again those who drank of it became kissing friendly in fact some of those who partook of its fresh water became quite fresh metria watching found herself becoming part of the scene and came to understand the impressions and feelings of the woman whose scene this was it was her half soul that was doing it she knew she never used to care about feelings this became a problem one day for pheira when a man called snide happened by he spied her giving directions to her pet catalog and made sarcastic remarks about the cat you think that motheaten fur ball will remember your di rections he demanded sneeringly you must be as stupid piers anthony as it is the image was snide but the voice was that of grundy golem who was doing the dialogue it didnt matter because grundy had a natural talent for insults now pheira was not a person to take offense without cause but something about the mans attitude annoyed her for one thing he was wrong about the cat who could indeed take orders competently oh go have a drink she said which was just about as close as a nice girl could get to swearing then she wanted to swallow her tongue because she remembered the effect the river water had on folk who werent used to it the last thing she wanted was to have snide get too friendly so she retreated into her mushroom and closed the door the house was of course somewhat mushy but was the best she could afford she was afraid snide would come after her and that the mush would just make him even more inclined for what she didnt want she peeked out the window and her fear was confirmed snide was drinking in a moment he would be not only snide but fresh she had to escape maybe if she could find her friend alias she could get away alias talent was to make everyone around him answer to wrong names when there was a crowd of people it could get so complicated that they had to compile a list to get them all straight again snide would never find her in such a crowd but alias was elsewhere today and anyway there was no crowd of people to help confuse things so what about her friend tom who could conjure a small cloud and pluck any tool or weapon he needed from it of course he had to return the tool to the cloud before he could get any other tool but it was a pretty strong talent if he were here he could pull out a sword and tell snide to go lose himself in a boggy swamp but tom wasnt here either none of her friends were close so she would just have to flee for it hoping that snide would give up the chase she would invoke her power to roc and a hard place summon an animal to carry her rapidly away what animal would be best now snide was approaching the house and he looked re ally super awful fresh his hands would be all over her the moment he got close she had to summon an animal im mediately maybe a rocky mountain goat because it would carry her swiftly up the nearest rocky mountain and she would be able to hide behind the rocks if she needed to she opened her mouth as she exerted her summoning tal ent roc then snide crashed through the wall of her house actu ally crash wasnt a good description it was more like a squish ripping a sagging hole the suddenness of it startled her so that she didnt complete herword besides snide was already reaching for her and he smelled sickeningly fresh it was probably time to scream but her talent had been invoked and it oriented on the nearest animal of the type she had named unfortunately she hadnt named an animal but a bird and she didnt do birds because a peculiarity of her talent was that too late suddenly she was flying she sailed right out through the hole in the mush wall and up into the air she knew what had happened she had attempted to summon the wrong kind of creature so instead of bringing it to her she was being brought to it because it was a type of bird she was flying to it it was her own messedup magic doing it she just had to hope that wherever she landed was not worse than being caught by a fresh man lo she found herself flying right up into a cloud her talent had never backfired this badly before but of course she was going to wherever the nearest roc bird was and it must be flying high above the clouds as they tended to do so that the magic of perspective would make them seem like much smaller birds for reasons she wasnt quite clear on the big birds tended to conceal their presence so that human folk seldom encountered rocs close by piers anthony then astonishingly she saw a building on the top of the cloud a castle in air and she was flying right into it what a misadventure she came to light in a huge inner chamber before a roc bird sitting on a huge stone nest the bird was fearsomely large but seemed as startled to see her there as she was to be there squawk the bird inquired pheira didnt understand bird talk but took this as a ques tion she started to explain how her talent had gotten fouled up bringing her involuntarily here squawk the bird said evidently miffed freeze that frame grey murphy said the scene stopped where it was grundy turned to the witness who was sitting right where her illusion self was standing repeat exactly that roxanne roc said to you she said squawk and then squawk and then she those were the very words yes and then grey turned to grundy and what do those words trans late to in human terms the first is what and the second is dam the go lem said are you sure of course im sure i speak and understand the language of all living things thats what i was made for before i achieved living status and what is the nature of the second word objection ida cried conclusion grey turned to the judge this is in the translators line of expertise he is qualified to define the word the judge nodded overruled the translator may an swer the question it refers to the process of mending torn cloth by means of rows of stitches grundy said the process is tedious and the result tends to be unsightly so is usually not appre roc and a hard place ciated a darned item is neither as pristine nor as valuable as the original thus when anything is accused of being darned or when anyone is told to dam get to the point the judge rumbled it is considered an objectionable word grundy said one not suited for the delicate young ears of small chil dren a word not suited for small children grey repeated with emphasis one which would be a violation of the adult conspiracy if uttered in the presence of a very young child exactly of course its only a mild transgression thank you grey turned to the judge i am done with this witness he stepped away but whats the relevance metria asked there wasnt any child there the judges glower swiveled to cover her but she passed her hand across her mouth leaving it visibly zipped shut and he let it pass she knew she had better not speak out of turn again ida approached the witness was there a translator pres ent when you encountered roxanne roc she asked no i didnt understand her squawks so you did not realize thatshe had spoken an unfortunate word thats right in fact until this time you had no notion why you were summoned to be a witness at this trial objection grey said irrelevant immaterial and be side the point sustained what happened then ida asked objection relevance its relevant to my defense ida snapped with unusual asperity for her normally sunny nature her moon looked similarly annoyed though not actually eclipsed but this is a prosecution witness piers anthony sustained then ill call her when my turn comes ida said walk ing away the witness may step down the judge said pheira returned to the audience evidently somewhat be mused the scene faded grey smiled grimly second the matter of the presence of a child the prosecution calls the simurgh to the witness seat there was a murmur of awe at this causing the judge to issue a generalpurpose glower that silenced the sound the simurgh requests permission to respond in place owing to the limited size of the stage grossclout almost smiled granted the special effects officer will generate a small illusion to be addressed in the witness box sorceress iris nodded a small image ofthe simurgh ap peared perched on the back of the witness chair if anyone thought such a representation humorous he had the sense to stifle his reaction grundy golem approached do you swear to tell the truth no matter what i do the answer seemed to come from the bird in the witness box the witness is duly sworn the judge said grey murphy approached what is the nature of your employment objection ida said relevance grossclout frowned is there relevance yes your honor it will be apparent in a moment then proceed the witness may answer i am the oldest and wisest creature in the universe have seen the destruction and resurrection of the universe three times i am among other things the guardian of the tree of seeds do you find this tiring after a few millennia it does get dull roc and a hard place are you considering any way to alleviate that dullness i hope in due course to pass along some of these chores to my successor who will eventually be as wise as i am and who is your successor my unnamed chick where is this chick in an egg between a roc and a hard place here in the nameless castle which wa established for this purpose and where precisely is the egg now under roxanne roc there was a murmur in the chamber despite the judges glare this was news of enormous import how long will it take your chick to hatch from the egg six hundred years when was the egg delivered to you six hundred years ago in the year then it must be due to hatch this year yes what is the state of the chick the chick is sentient and sapient that is alive and intelligent grey said can the chick hear words that are spoken in the nesting chamber yes so when roxanne roc spoke that forbidden word the chick heard yes roxanne listening in the adjacent chamber jumped it was clear this was a revelation to her that wasnt surprising there was a glarestifled murmur in the audience and a muted exchange of glances in the jury box grey turned away your witness ida approached the image and her moon inspected it cu riously since you are the wisest creature in the universe why didnt you anticipate this infraction and prevent it wisdom does not equate to foreknowledge phelras piers anthony visit to the nameless castle was essentially a ran dom act there was no way to anticipate the damage was done before i could act so you did nothing i initiated the sequence of events leading to this trial even though you knew that the defendant had no aware ness of her violation objection argumentative conclusion the simurgh knows everything ida said evenly she is qualified to give an opinion its still argumentative grey argued the judge pondered briefly rephrase your question do you believe the defendant was aware of her infrac tion no then why did you objection the witness is not on trial sustained the witness does not have to answer i will respond nevertheless i required this trial be cause ignorance is no excuse a violation has oc curred and it must be dealt with even though objection sustained ida shrugged not looking frustrated metria understood why the members of the jury both human and monster understood the nature of the unvoiced objection and were being swayed by it i am done with this witness she said the witness may step down the small image faded from the chair grey murphy stood the prosecution rests he an nounced he had called only two witnesses but they had been enough they had established that the defendant had uttered a forbidden word and that a minor had heard it roxanne roc was in deep dung defense the judges devastating gaze swept across to princess ida is the defense ready yes your honor proceed the defense calls the simurgh to the stand objection she said she was done with that witness i was done for crossexamination now i want her as my witness thats a different matter the judge rolled one eye expressively but allowed it overruled the image of the simurgh reappeared on the chair ida addressed it you have stated that your egg was delivered six hundred years ago and that you arranged to set up the nameless castle for its incubation when did you assign roxanne roc as eggsitter the year piers anthony so that was five years after you received the egg yes you had to take care of the egg yourself in the interim objection relevance i am establishing the importance of the defendants duty this relates to her character grey shook his head importance and character have no necessary interconnection prosecution will stipulate that the job is important so important in fact that any default is a most serious objection the prosecutions case has already been made judge grossclouts dour mouth quirked in a hint of a sug gestion of a thought of a faint unfrown the defenses ob jection is sustained the prosecutions objection is overruled but do not try the limited patience of this court with too free an interpretation of your mission ida smiled sweetly at the judge metria realized that she looked very nice when she did that probably she believed that she was making a marginally favorable impression and so it was true even her little moon seemed to glow that was bound to have more of an impact when she addressed the jury then she returned to the witness you took care of yes was it difficult to eggsit while also guarding the tree of seeds on mount parnassus and attending to your other du ties yes so you decided to get an eggsitter objection defense is leading the witness this witness cant be led against her will ida retorted overruled yes was the egg important to you there was a ripple of mirth through the audience as the simurgh answered yes roc and a hard place so you did not seek just any creature to do the job true in fact didnt you seek the most qualified creature avail able for that most important task yes and that creature was roxanne roc yes so by your judgment which is by definition the most authoritative one available roxanne roc was a highly qual ified bird in fact a creature of excellent competence and character yes and did she perform in the manner you required yes for almost six centuries yes and does she remain so qualified today yes so your pursuit of this infraction does not imply that the defendant is in any way deficient in competence or charac ter agreed and you still trust her to sit your egg yes there was another subdued murmur in the court the words and action of the simurgh herself were the best pos sible endorsement of roxanne rocs character thank you ida turned to smile at grey murphy it was a try to dispute that expression but her moon brightened prettily metria worried about its effect on a man who had been too long betrothed without result your witness grey approached the chair but the defendant did violate the adult conspiracy yes and there was the crux metria realized it hardly mattered how great a person roxanne was she had done the deed piers anthony and it hardly mattered how fetching princess ida became greys talent nullified that magic he nodded significantly at the jury thank you i am done the image faded ida faced the audience i call gwen dolyn goblin to the stand the pretty little lady chief of goblin mountain stood and came to the stage she was duly sworn in have you encountered the defendant ida asked her yes once state the circumstances of that encounter well i was rivaling my bratty little brother gobble gob lin for the chiefship of our tribe and he arranged for me to have to fetch what was between the roc and the hard place as she spoke the sorceress iris animated it so that the scene in goblin mountain appeared gwenny goblin was with her companion che centaur and her friend jenny elf both of whom were now on the jury the three of them struggled to grasp the meaning of the requirement and realized that they would have to somehow find their way to the nameless cas tle in order to fetch the precious rocs egg the scene shifted past the complicated route they took to reach the nameless castle it was in fast forward so it looked as if they were feverishly dashing across xanth and scrambling upward toward the castle they reached the main chamber where roxanne sat on the nest gwenny used her magic wand to lift the supposedly sleeping bird off the nest exposing the beautiful crystalline egg then che touched it and roxanne squawked stop grundy translated thats the simurghs egg and on her command the en tire castle was suddenly sealed shut so that the intruders couldnt escape there followed a chase as the big bird sought to catch and confine the three and they sought to escape they man aged to get roxanne into one of jenny elfs shared dreams and had a dialogue with her and learned how she had run afoul of the simurgh and lost her power of flight she had roc and a hard place finally petitioned the simurgh for release from her ground ing and the simurgh had assigned her to community service in the nameless castle where she had to remain until she hatched the egg stored there she did not know that she had actually been chosen for this important labor she thought it was a rebuke rather than a privilege but she did her best regardless because she was that kind of person and there she remained for almost six centuries guarding and warming the egg she was allowed to eat only those intruders who threatened the egg and since she didnt want to make a mistake she was very careful in this case she had waited until one of the intruders actually touched the egg then she had acted metria remembered she had passed that scene at that time while on gameduty for professor grossclout and seen jenny and che in the cage the roc had put them in gwenny goblin had been fending off the bird with her magic wand so it was an impasse but it didnt look good for the intruders so the defendant defended the egg loyally ida con cluded oh yes gwenny agreed she was a terror but we came to understand that she was just doing her job and we came to respect her for that in the end we reinterpreted our requirement and took one of roxannes old shed claws be cause it had fallen intothe nest beside the egg so was also between the roc and the hard place ida next called okra ogress to the witness stand she testified that she and her friends mela merwoman and ida human had been sent by the simurgh to rescue the stranded trio and had done so with the help of a seed of thyme and some negotiation because roxanne had been out of circu lation for several centuries she had not learned that che centaur was to be protected by all winged monsters so that he could in due course change the history of xanth once she learned this she honoredit there was another murmur in the audience as the anima tion showed ida herself in the scene along with two of the piers anthony members of the jury and three witnesses but an allpurpose glower by the judge stifled it as usual okra agreed that roxanne had acted in an honorable man ner and had certainly protected the egg to the best of her ability mela merwoman the next witness was wearing her legs instead of her tail she took time to settle her comely pos terior in the witness chair so that the males in the audience could complete their gawking then endorsed the ogress tes timony in the end they had given roxanne the seed of thyme and the big bird had not used it to destroy them as she readily could have done so the defendant proved to be a creature of her word ida concluded yes shes a good person pheira was the next witness so you heard the defendant squawk but did not at that time know the meaning of her exclamation ida said you were not aware that she said a word that was forbidden in the context she didnt know existed objection ill rephrase it was just a squawk to you yes pheira agreed perhaps an exclamation of surprise or dismay when she realized that you had arrived there accidentally and that it might be a chore to get you clear of the nameless castle yes that is the way i understood it and indeed that is exactly the way she intended it she could understand your speech because most animals take the trouble to leam human speech despite being unable to speak it themselves in contrast to the ignorant attitude of most humans her frustration was that she was unable to explain to you how to return to your home yes in fact she might even have made an analogy to a sock that had been torn that would need tedious and imperfect mending because the sock doesnt understand the problem roc and a hard place why yes pheira agreed brightening in that sense it wouldnt be a bad word at objection sustained jury will disregard that comment the jury however looked as if it wasnt sure it wanted to forget the comment ida was doing a remarkably apt job of swaying the members of the jury perhaps because of her talent of belief she probably had the idea that she could save roxanne and what she truly believed always came to pass because she was a sorceress but she did get you safely home didnt she ida con tinued yes she had a chip of reverse wood i held it then exerted my talent to summon the roc again it reversed the thrust and sent me flying right back the way i had come it was exactly what i needed in fact it even helped me get rid of snide im sorry that i never had the chance to thank her or to return her chip of wood so the defendant once she understood the situation treated you with helpful courtesy yes she was great she could have eaten me but she didnt metria could see that this made another impression on the jury by rights roxanne could have chomped pheira for intruding where she didnt belong but the bird had acted compassionately rather than viciously but still she had ut tered the bad word ida was finished with the witness and grey had no further questions the damage to his case was already quite enough the defense calls roxanne roc to the witness stand judge grossclout spoke are you aware that if the de fendant testifies on her own behalf she will become fair game for the prosecution who may cause her to incriminate herself yes your honor idas moon looked serious but i feel the risk must be taken piers anthony proceed the witness may answer from her present lo cation ida faced the other chamber roxanne please relate what befell you during the time of no magic there was yet another muted murmur the time of no magic had occurred in the year fiftytwo years before and a number of the participants of this trial had not been on the scene at that time to them it was history and therefore boring what relevance could this have to the pres ent case but grey murphy did not object either he saw some rel evance or he was curious himself roxanne began squawking grundy golem translated and the sorceress iris animated the scene it was of the nameless castle on its cloud floating serenely above the land of xanth roxanne herself was snoozing as she sometimes did during the somewhat tedious centuries and inthat state she looked as if she were a great stone statue then abruptly the magic ceased this was because bink human participating in an aspect of the demon x ths reality had given the demon leave to depart the demon had done so in half a trice going somewhere far from xanth and taking his magic with him for all of xanths magic stemmed from the ambience of the demon representing that trace that leaked out much as the heat of an animals body leaked out to the surroundings some magic remained for a while in the manner of some heat slowly diffusing from xanths larger concentrations but it was so scant as to be virtually unnoticed immediately the cloudstuff of which the castle was made began to soften and the cloud itself lost its buoyancy it sank rapidly toward the suddenly bleak land roxanne had no idea of the background cause but did realize that the cloud and castle would crash and be destroyed if she didnt do something quickly she leaped off the nest and ran outside she peered down past the fragmenting brink there lay xanth spread out much roc and a hard place as usual but twice as dreary as usual it looked almost as bad as mundania not far away was lake kiss mee looking as if it had been kicked instead of kissed maybe she could get the castle to splash down into the lake instead of wrecking on land it would still be one awful collision but the cushioning effect of the water might enable her to save the egg that was all that mattered she dug her talons into the loosening cloudscape stood up straight and spread her giant wings she couldnt fly because the simurgh had deprived her of her power of flight for the duration but her wings still could beat the air and make a strong backdraft if she could just push the castle toward the lake the castle movedin the wrong direction of course she was facing the lake she angled her wings and caused the cloud isle to spin around until she was facing away from the water then she pumped as hard as she could already the castle was much lower because it had continued falling but there was still a chance to slant it down to the lake she pumped until she thought her heart would burst watching the land rush up beneath her she couldnt see the lake now was she going in the right direction she must be because forward was the one way she could not see but she couldnt let the egg take the shock by itself it could be cracked open so as the tops of the trees loomed close beneath she let go turned and launched herself back into the incubation chamber she was diving for the nest just as the castle struck the water there was a horrendous swish walls of water sailed up all around visible through the higher windows the castle came to a sudden but not calamitous partial haltand bounced back up it was skipping across the water like a clumsy stone because she had succeeded in angling it for ward at a faster rate than it was falling she overshot the nest because everything but her was slowing down drasti cally she scrambled to turn around so as to get back on the nest and protect the egg piers anthony the bounce reversed and the castle descended again the egg sailed out of the stone nest roxanne leaped at it and caught it in her talons ohsocarefully so that it would not fall back against the stone but she was falling now too so she pushed her wings down hard to break her fall and keep the egg clear of the hard nest normally the safest place in xanth was between the roc and the hard place but not in this circumstance the castle skipped again rising a second time it came up hard under her her wings took the shock and she was able to land in the nest and lay the egg gently back in it but she felt a terrible shock of pain and knew that one of her wings was broken but she had no chance to be concerned about that the castle was still bouncing across the water in diminishing hops rattling the egg dangerously she wrapped her wings down under herself and the egg cushioning the contacts with the hard nest at last the awful motion ceased she breathed half a sqawk of reliefthen realized that there was still some motion a slow settling the castle was sinking in the lake she left the egg secure for the moment and scrambled back outside water was covering the surface of the cloud and lapping at the base of the castle itself the castle was light but the cloudstuff was getting waterlogged so that in the end it would sink to the bottom how deep was the lake she didnt know but feared it was way beyond the height of the castle the egg would drown at the bottom of the lake unless she could do something to shore it up if she could make it float she clawed at the cloudstuff of the cloudislands rim hauling it up a fragment tore out leaving a gap she quickly jammed it back down but at an angle so that part of a rim formed one advantage of the deteriorating nature of the cloudstuff was that it was now malleable she could shape it to her whim she moved around the edge turning it up and jamming it roc and a hard place in place soon she had a boat of sorts or raft but it was waterlogged and still slowly sinking so she formed a chan nelramp low inside high outside set herself at the low side dug in and began flapping her wings again pain shot through her left wing with every stroke but she gritted her beak and forced the motion through she was directing her backdraft across the water by the crude channel as she pumped harder the wind pushed the water along the channel and on off the cloudbank more water seeped in to fill its place and this too was forced along the channel and out soon she had a weak fountain of water forming squirting off the edge of her island and the level on the island was dropping as it did the island became more buoy ant and the castle slowly lifted she was succeeding in mak ing it float at last the cloud surface was mostly dry and she was able to relax her broken wing was smarting something awful and the rest of her was almost worn out but she had suc ceeded in saving the castle and with it the egg that was all that mattered she checked on the egg and it was secure she didnt have to sit on it all the time it was large enough and dense enough to hold its heat for some while still it wouldnt hurt to the castle shook she scrambled back outside to check there was a ship trying to collide with it a big boat filled with annoyinglooking people its side was banging into the cloudwall threatening to dent it and let the water pour back in what are you doing she demanded angrily get away from here but all that came out of course was two squawks which she knew from experience were indecipher able to ignorant human folk indeed they were standing at the rail of the ship staring stupidly at her then she saw the name of the boat relationship this was the craft that carried all the relatives naturally folk hated to see its approach because relatives tended to be a pain particularly those of ones spouse these were probably piers anthony kissing cousins because this was lake kiss mee right now they looked quite sour though because the magic was gone she braced one foot against the ship and hooked the other into the cloudstuff and managed to shove the ship away it drifted onward toward whatever fate any relationship was doomed to suffer now she had time to ponder obviously the magic had departed for what reason she wasnt competent to wonder the nameless castle had lost its enchantment and surely the spell that denied her the ability to fly was also goneexcept that the magic of rocs was the ability to fly because no other creature their size could do it so the loss of the magic had the same effect on her as the nullspell and of course her broken wing would have prevented her from flying anyway the question was would the magic return she had to as sume that it would because otherwise she and the castle and the egg were doomed the proper place for them was in the sky where it was safe down here on land or water it would be only a matter of time before land monsters attacked or a storm blew it over but she had no control over that all she could do was waitand hope and keep the precious egg warm she went back to the nest and sat on the egg she tried to sleep but her wing was too painful she wished she had access to a healing spring but realized that the healing elixir wouldnt work without magic so she simply steeled herself against the pain and waited every so often she went outside and repaired the deterio rating rim she judged that if the magic stayed away more than a day there would be nothing more she could do to preserve the castle because the cloudstuff continued to sag it would founder and disappear under the water unless she could guide the castle to land so that at least it couldnt sink yesthat was her best course she anchored her feet and pumped her wings again the pain flared awfully but she kept at it until at last the soggy roc and a hard place floating island bumped up against land she nudged it as far up as she could then rested now it wouldnt sink at least she returned to the egg and sat on it warming it with her body it took her a while to snooze because of her pain and fatigueand when she did more trouble came there was a horrible howling near the castle some mon ster was coming and it sounded dangerous she scrambled out to assess the situation because she did not want to be surprised on the nest the big disadvantage to perching the cloud isle on land was that it was now exposed to the dep redations of land creatures which could be about as bad as the sea creatures worse really because surely there had been no unfriendly ceatures in the kiss mee lake it was something that might once have been a dragon but now was a crazed obscurity in the night it snapped at the fringe of cloudstuff tearing out huge gobs it lurched toward the castle itself roxanne gave a squawk for challenge and charged it she could not let it chew up the softening fabric of the castle and perhaps get at the egg itself she was in no condition to fight but she had to protect what remained of her charge in case the magic ever came back the monster hissed and whirled on her its eyes glared balefully it was confused and maddened by the loss of magic but it was large and vicious maybe it was the rem nant of a sphinx all she wanted was to make it go away but she feared that it would feel no pain and would not be bluffed she was right the monster snapped and clawed at her gouging out feathers and flesh she retreatedaway from the castle it followed intent only on viciousness so she continued to hold its attention luring it away from the castle she could have fled and saved herself a beating but she wanted to be sure it was far enough away so that it would not blunder into the castle again so she endured the unre lenting attack though hardly any part of her body escaped laceration and bruising piers anthony when she was finally satisfied she backpedaled faster es caping the nearly mindless thing but now she was so worn and battered that she wasnt sure she could straggle back to the castle herself let alone defend it from other predators she wanted simply to collapse and expire but she didnt she dragged herself in what she thought was the right direction after a time the deadly fatigue over whelmed her and she sank down on the ground unconscious but after more time she recovered a bit and resumed drag ging she couldnt leave the egg vulnerable she had no idea how long she dragged and collapsed dragged and collapsed but certainly time was passing her concern for the egg grew when would it cool too far she had to get there and collapse on top of it so that it would have its best chance regardless what happened to her even if she died her body would take time to coolperhaps time enough for the magic to return then then what the egg needed her protection with magic as much as without it her consciousness was dimming but she realized that she had to do more she had to find a way to get the castle back in the sky where it and the egg would be safe if the magic returned the castle might recover and float again but she had to be with it warming and protecting the egg but what could she do she was so far gone that just getting to the castle might be more than she could manage and then she would be unable to do anything more useful than warming the egg she pondered and slowly came to some conclusions first if the magic did not return all was lost the egg roxanne herself and all xanth second if the magic returned there was a way to help but first she had to help herself because otherwise the egg would be lost anyway and if the magic returned there was a way she had to find a healing spring and she remembered that there was one in this vicinity it was one of the numerous roc and a hard place springs that fed the kiss mee lake for there was healing in kissing where was it she struggled with her memory and concluded that the spring was no farther from her than the castle was so she changed her course and dragged toward the spring if the magic did not return it would be no good but since in that case everything would be lost anyway it didnt matter if the magic did return it could be the salvation of the egg at length she reached the place she remembered there was an indifferent pool but the growth of vegetation around it was good suggesting that normally it existed in supreme health this had to be it she would need to take a quantity of it with her so she labored to fashion a watertight container she gathered leaves and twigs and clay and tediously pieced together a bag drawing on bird lore that was older than magic now if the spring ever resumed its power she would be ready she stood at the brink of it and relaxed she had done what she could as she relaxed she lost her balance and fell forward into the spring she landed with a great splash and sank down below the surface of the water too tired to try to climb back out she knew she would drown but her last physical resource had been expended making the bag now she could not save herself then something happened she was feeling better the pains and rawnesses of her mangled body had faded and she saw that her plucked feathers had been restored but that was impossible unless the magic had returned but why hadnt she drowned even so she was floating beak down in the pool not breathing then she realized that it was impossible to drown in a healing spring because it constantly healed whatever damage the body suffered the magic had returned in time to save her or maybe it had returned after she had drowned and restored her it didnt matter she was suddenly fit to proceed piers anthony she was no longer horribly fatigued and her broken wing was whole she hauled herself out and filled her bag with the precious elixir then she charged for the castle at a phenomenally faster rate than before in two and a half moments she was thereand saw the castle walls stiffening magic gave them their hardness but more was required she lifted the bag and held it over the gouged rim of the cloud isle if this worked the rent healed the cloudstuff had just enough life init to respond to the healing elixir her desperate ploy was working she walked all around the isle carefully dripping elixir on every wound then she went inside and dripped more elixir on the castles injuries these too healed finally she came to the nest and the egg which was shivering with cold and dropped the last drop on it the shivering stopped the egg too had healed she climbed on top of itand felt the castle move it was floating again it lifted from the ground at first slowly then more swiftly as the healing elixir penetrated to the last of the damaged crevices she had done it she had saved the egg that was all that mattered all was well again the defense rests ida said as the illusion image faded your witness but for some reason grey didnt choose to question rox anne further proceed to the summations judge grossclout said now grey murphy took the floor and addressed the jury you have just one thing to decide he said grimly did roxanne roc violate the adult conspiracy her personality does not matter the prosecution concedes that she is a fine bird her intent does not matter the prosecution concedes that her violation was inadvertent only one thing matters did she do it the evidence shows that she did you have roc and a hard place no choice but to find her guilty as charged he sat down again ida approached the jury it is not that simple she said intention does matter perhaps it cant entirely excuse the infraction but it can mitigate it you must weight the balance of what roxanne roc did suppose she had not been there what would have been the fate of the egg would it have been better off without her this is the context in which you must judge her she paused marshaling her arguments and her moon got focused imagine that you were passing innocently by a region you didnt know was forbidden and suddenly found yourself grounded as she was and punished by being re quired to sit on an egg for centuries wouldnt you feel a trifle rebellious now the power of her sorcery was coming into play her talent was the idea and what she believed came to be true provided that no one who knew her talent originated the idea could there be some members of the jury who didnt know her talent metria doubted it but wasnt sure suppose you nevertheless served that penance honorably though it meant almost complete isolation from your kind and from all others except for unwarranted intruders so that your only contacts with others were hostile ones though you yourself were naturally friendly metria saw jenny elf nod ding and graeboe giantharpy and sherlock black an im pression was being made then suppose that your chance came to escape because the enchantment that bound you was gone in he time of no magic would you have done it stanley steamer nod ded and marrow bones but roxanne roc did not she remained true to her mission though in great pain and peril she went to extraordinary lengths to preserve the egg and succeeded when many another creature would not have kim mundane nodded and gayle goyle then suppose you made a trifling inadvertent error merely exclaiming in frustration when you realized that you piers anthony were unable to explain to an accidental intruder what the situation was would you ever have suspected that a chick who had been silent in the egg for more than five centuries was listening that it would understand this time only three did not nod corn pewter whose screen couldnt nod anyway stanley steamer and che centaur who as a centaur was probably smarter than all the rest of them and suppose that for that inconsequential infraction you were hauled up on a charge of violation of the adult con spiracy that despite all your loyalty beyond the call of duty you faced punishment for breaking a rule that many feel is a pointless infringement on the rights of children now corn pewters screen showed a pattern of dots that formed into an exclamation point his way of agreeing and che centaur the youngest juror nodded so did cynthia and chena centaur in the alternate juror section and so did ida you have to know when you think about it that sometimes the law is a donkey sometimes it is not the person but the law that needs correction when extreme honor and loyalty are punished on a technicality instead of being rewarded you have to know that something is wrong che centaur nodded again and so did several others so did most of the audience now there were tears in princess idas eyes and her moon clouded over roxanne roc gave the best years of her life doing the very best she could in a sometimes extremely dif ficult situation she made one tiny mistake who among us all would have done better who among us all has not made at least as bad a mistake at some point in our lives how can anyone condemn her for being in the end not quite perfect that egg could not have had a finer guardian other than the simurgh herself how are we to reward this devoted servant of that egg who did so much to preserve it and who would never have had the chance to commit the infraction had she failed to safeguard that egg so well the tears were reflected in kirns eyes and jennys and gayles and glo has and the alternate jurors and the others looked uneasy roc and a harp place if this is the reward of virtue what hope is there for any of the rest of us you must decide whether you can in con science convict roxanne roc in a case that shames the stan dards of xanth you must decide what is right otherwise what point is there in even being here ida turned away and her moon hid behind her head as if disgusted with the proceedings there was silence in the court metria felt the way she was sure most of the others did that the trial was in the end ludicrous the judge focused both grim eyes on the jury it is not your business to determine the fairness of the law only whether it has been violated the evidence and arguments have been put before you i want you to understand that i expect a suitable decision in this matter i do not expect to have a hung jury however if that turns out to be the case i will deal with it as needs be behold he gestured and one of iris illusions appeared behind him it was an econ omysized gallows with twelve hangmans nooses turning slowly slowly in the wind i trust i make myself suffi ciently clear the jury made a collective gulp and nodded there would be no hung jury judge grossclout banged his gavel the jury will be se questered for deliberations this court is in recess the jury and alternates went to a private room and a murmur of relaxation rippled across the audience the trial was almost done metria hoped that the jury would come to the right deci sion but she had a soulsinking feeling that there was no certainty of that verdict mela and nada were back in their pools splashing each other and screaming and bouncing as each was struck by drops of salt or fresh water and as sorted males were watching just as if this were the most interesting show in xanth one would never have known from watching them that both were mature princesses or that one had a daughter almost as well endowed as she was cute steven steamer was being adored by any spare ladies in the vicinity when ida picked him up he snapped at her moon but the moon was elusive the little skeletons were playing tag around the chairs in the courtroom others were feasting on the refreshments provided including a considerable pud dle of boot rear left over from somewhere metria went to talk with roxanne roc who remained at the stone nest they cant convict you she said the whole thing is facetious roc and a hard place squawk ridiculous droll farcical funny absurd squawk whatever it would be ludicrous to convict you after six centuries of such loyal service but the big bird did not look reassured metria it was bailiff magician trent the judge wants to talk with you in his chamber oh thanks she popped off leaving trent to converse with roxanne grossclouts glower was unchanged metria fetch prin cess ivy here but i cant carry a full person she protested then get prince dolph to do it in fact you might as well bring electra and the twins too and king dor and queen irene a bulb glimmered over her head ooo grossie is this what i think dont call me grossie you impertinent spook when he saw that she was sufficiently cowed he continued and dont say anything about any conjecture you may have just tell them that i wish them to attend the conclusion of the trial yes your honor she popped off to castle roogna soon enough the entire royal family was traveling in a basket carried by prince dor in roc form metria popped back to the judges chambers mission accomplished judge she reported good now go with the feline the what butthen she saw jenny elfs cat sammy approaching her oh he must be lost ill take him back to jenny she picked him up and walked to the jurys cham ber jenny elf was waiting the other jurors were seated in a wide circle thank you metria she said now please sit here and watch what we do piers anthony but i only brought the cat back she protested im not supposed to stay in here yes you are jenny said evenly i asked sammy to find the one most suitable for our purpose he found you it seems appropriate since you are halfsouled judge gross clout understands but what we do not wish to be a hung jury but we have found ourselves unable to agree on a verdict therefore we have agreed to find another way to do it we have a show for you a what demonstration exhibition array display i know what a show is but why show me anything when youre supposed to be deliberating we will explain that in due course it is important to us that you not know immediately i have no idea what this is about excellent now please watch and i will explain as it goes as what goes the play about the dream of souls the whatever now there once was a young woman called donna but you may think of her as anyone you wish to at this point kim mundane stood and stepped into the center of the circle she was wooed by a very handsome sensitive thoughtful and likable young man dug mundane rose and joined kim taking her hand and kissing it kim looked thrilled he had a pair of lovely winged centaur steeds who took them wherever they wished to go jenny continued her voice assuming a humming quality as che and cynthia cen taur joined them he took her to nice places they did many interesting things together and donna was falling deeply in love with him and believed that he loved her too he just seemed to have more than the normal amount of soul roc and a hard place metria watched bemused what was the point of this ir relevant little skit then a scene filled in around the two people and the steeds they were no longer in the castle chamber but in an amusement center having fun she saw dug tease kim by inviting her to step on a pretty rug when she did the rug threw her off so that she landed in a bed of feathers thats a throw rug she exclaimed with happy indignation he laughed and stepped on the rug himself it promptly threw him after her they wound up in a tangled heap on the bed kim squealed and kicked her feet as he tickled her obviously enjoying herself a light illuminated them kim quickly sat up straight and tried to straighten her hair afraid that someone would think she was doing something private in public whats that spotlight doing here she demanded picking a feather off her skirt that is not a spotlight its a searchlight dug informed her whats the difference the searchlight hasnt yet found what its looking for kim grabbed a feather pillow and whammed him over the head with it they had another pleasant bout of tickling and squealing but metria noticed something slightly odd dug did not look when kirns skirt flew up to show too much of her legs and did not let his hands stray when he tickled her under her arms these were opportunities any normal young man would take automatically it was almost as if he had some purpose other than normal then they entered the castles dining hall kim reached for a large pretty but oddly shaped fruit the top part of it was transparent and there were moving bubbles inside i wouldnt recommend eating that dug said why not it looks good its a perkulater fruit it tastes fine but later it makes you wideawake so you cant sleep piers anthony oh she set the fruit down and its perking subsided im already beginning to get tired i dont want my sleep disturbed here he said bringing out a small metal object he used his thumb to flick a little wheel on it as he touched it to her arm whats that she asked its a lighter it will make you light so you wont be tired oh yes i feel much lighter now she agreed and in deed her step became bouncy they walked into the courtyard there was an icy wall with odd formations on it dug reached out and took one what is that kirn asked an icycle shall we have a race how do we do that we each get on an icycle and pedal it as fast and far as we can before it melts oh this sounds like fan she said she took an icycle of her own they both got on and put their feet on the cold pedals the cycles enabled them to race through the courtyard and on out into the garden the loyal steeds ran after them seem ing strangely subdued as if none of this fun meant anything to them again metria felt a tinge of concern there was a friendly barking sound as several of the flow ering plants leaned toward them oh how cute kim said what kind of flowers are those they remind me of dogs those are cauliflowers dug said when they are young they are collie pups they grow into dogwood trees actually they looked and sounded more like the two gar goyles but metria didnt care to quibble with the dream animation kim laughed loving it but neither dug nor the steeds did dug seemed quite serious when not actually playing up to kim and the centaurs seemed depressed they zoomed toward a lady with a musical instrument roc and a hard place she looked just like jenny elf and the instrument looked like sammy cat she began to sing but then cut off whats the matter kim asked concerned i am marcia the minstrel i just realized its too early for me to sing the singer replied ohyou must have the preminstrel syndrome kim said sympathetically yes soon ill be singing the greens and blues instead of the reds and oranges they raced on through a series of arches but there was a man with a sledgehammer knocking them down he looked like graeboe giantharpy why are you making falling arches kim asked him i have to im an archenemy this is one weird place kim exclaimed as they raced on into a sheep pasture but now their icycles were melting soon both dissolved into puddles on which the breeze raised very small waves in fact they were microwaves that left kim and dug standing on their feet in the pasture you won dug said you cycled farther than i did before yours melted kim looked around at the sheep laughing that depends on your point of ewe she didnt notice that neither dug nor the centaurs laughed then they saw the beautiful sunset oh this has just been the most wonderful day of my young life kim cried im so excited i could burst i think my soul is ready to float away in pure happiness yes dug agreed he took her in his arms and kissed her deeply the centaurs flinched something was wrong kim seemed to shrink to dwindle to fall away as if struck oh i am undone she cried you have sucked out my soul right dug said satisfied and a fine soul it is too he walked away whistling the centaurs followed down cast piers anthony he what metria asked she realized belatedly that she was in one of jennys dreams and so were the others he sucked out her soul jenny said he is a soul vam pire thats awful jenny didnt answer metria watched in horror as kim staggered away barely finding her way home she looked despondent hopeless empty and wishing she could die but jenny explained kim discovered that scattered bits of her soul remained clinging to her deepest loves such as her pet green steamer dragon who came out looking for her and helped her struggle the rest of the way home these pieces came together to keep her alive but they were only a shadow of what had originally been hers kim was now mostly soulless and with this emptiness came the baser emotions she had been happy now she was depressed she had loved life now she had the urge to kill she was bent on revenge she got a sharp knife and made a concealed sheath for it so she could keep it with her all the time no no the inadequate fragments of her soul cried faintly this is not right because those fragments were precious to her kim tried to heed them she went to a wise and gentle man to ask for help this man was graeboe giantharpy no longer knock ing down arches my child he counseled her do not seek revenge stay home and let yourself recover your soul may regenerate in time from the fragments you still pos sess it was good advice but she lacked enough soul to take it seriously vengeance was an easy concept and forgiveness a difficult one for a person with too little soul she had thought dug loved her and he had only been after her soul he had played her along until her happiness of the occasion had lightened her soul and loosened its moorings so that he could more readily steal it he had callously taken her most precious possession she had to make him pay for it roc and a hard place in fact she wanted to kih him yet she was also afraid that he might return realizing that he hadnt gotten quite all her soul she didnt know how she would react if she saw him again because the main remaining fragment of her soul was what had loved him most deeply she was afraid that if she somehow found him she wouldnt be able to destroy him because of that little bit of love that remained in her and that he would then finish her off cleaning out the last bits and pieces of the remnants of her soul leaving her en tirely barren so she wasnt certain whether she should kill him or if she could she battled the monsters in her mind trying to come to a firm decision in the dream those monsters appeared resembling two gargoyles and a walking skeleton kim fought them but her knife had no effect on stone or bone and she had to retreat she realized that she wasnt the only victim dug must have done this to many other girls before her ooo that made her furious maybe she could after all kill him then dug reappeared she knew what he wanted the rest of her soul which had regenerated a little bit she knew what she should do stab him but he was so handsome and so much fun to be with and his two sad centaur steeds were so nice he brought her a qt pie guaranteed to make her cute he promised to take her to see the bottlenosed purpose one of xanths most helpful marine creatures he said they could even go to washingtown where they washed folk utterly clean he spoke of eating the special fruit that hung from bendy branches and tasted so good that anyone who tasted it was ready to have a party it was called the dangling party citrus it all sounded so wonderful in this manner he wooed her again and though she knew better she felt herself giving up she wanted to believe it was true that she could share joy with him as she had before that her loss of soul had been only a bad part of the dream she wanted to love him at the same time she knew that she was being utterly foolish and that she should kill him she piers anthony fought to get her hand on the hidden knife to bring it out and up to stab him but her willpower was feeble and fading dug took her in his arms and brought his lips down to hers he was going to do it he was going to suck the meager rest of her soul out and leave her completely void she made one final effort her knifepoint came up part way she wasnt able to stab him just to prick him through his clothing and he exploded like a burst balloon souls flew out everywhere some were fresh some decayed some were in good shape some hideously shrunken most were in be tween hundreds maybe thousands of themand in his greed he had wanted yet more he had been so full of souls that he was ready to burst and her tiny pinprick had done it she had after all managed to kill him kim remained seriously shaken not to mention appalled and disgusted and afraid but she had the common sense to grab her own soul before it floated away and draw it back into her it was one of the good ones it had not had time to get degraded she was whole again the two centaurs grabbed at their own souls similarly then their sadness faded and they smiled you have saved us they told kim you are a heroine they spread their wings and flew joyfully home no longer bound to the one who had stolen their souls and exploited them so kim went home feeling better though she was sorry about losing such a handsome suitor unfortunately there was a wannabee in the neighborhood this bee liked to assume characteristics that didnt belong to it this time it assumed the mantle of public citizen it had seen her prick dug and reported her to the better business bureau she was arrested and brought to trial since there was no delectable corpse they charged her with something else because it wouldnt do to have a false arrest the judge was a machine with a stem monitor screen who looked just like corn pewter the prosecutor was a fierce black man resembling sherlock roc and a hard place we shall demonstrate that the defendant violated the adult conspiracy the prosecutor said but she didnt mean to the defense attorney protested she looked like gloha goblinharpy who says i did it kim demanded i do a winged monster replied i am the simurgh with my omniscience i saw that when you rolled in the feathers with that man you were careless about how your skirt hiked up and a baby mouse looked out of its hole and saw your panties that is a violation but this is ridiculous kim protested i never even fcnew the mouse was there silence the judges screen printed how do you plead this is crazy kim said here i have just survived having my soul stolen not to mention losing my boyfriend and all you care about is irrelevant statement deleted the judge printed and it was as if it had never been spoken for reality was changed i dont care what the defendant knew or when she knew it sherlock said grimly i am prepared to bring the mouse in to testify to the crime but the defendant is a person of good character from a far land gloha said she had no knowledge of any such violation ignorance is no excuse sherlock insisted and she restored lost souls to many folk gloha said i am prepared to bring in two centaurs to testify to that surely the good she has done outweighs any inadvertent evil she did the crime sherlock said shes a good person gloha replied the judges screen flashed the cases have been made the jury will now render the verdict suddenly metria was the cynosure of all eyes this was weird because she wasnt even slightly sure of anything let alone cyno sure who me she asked yesyou piers anthony this is all just a crazy dream metria exclaimed this whole thing is just a house of cards im getting out of here and she broke her way out of jennys dream only to find herself in the middle of the jury room still being watched by at least a dozen pairs of eyes now you must decide for we cannot and we must not be a hung jury corn pewter printed the image of a hangmans noose appearing on his screen is the defendant guilty ill do no such thing metria said im not even on this jury demoness changes her mind metria found herself with her mind changed yes of course ill decide she agreed just let me ponder a bit others relax while demoness ponders musical notes appeared on corn pewters screen and jenny elf began to hum again soon a new picture formed with all the members of the jury at the fancy castle dancing in the ballroom mar row did the danse macabre with a fine rattling of bones while gloha and graeboe did pirouettes in the upper dome stanley steamer kept the beat by clacking his teeth and the two gargoyles made stone circles around each other the rest formed a fine square dance drawing marrow in to make it complete and then a round dance followed by a triangle dance in this dream dug was handsome in a formal suit and kim lovely in a flowing dress and the rest looked great too they were all having a wonderful time but not metria she was stuck with the verdict they couldnt decide so they wanted her to do it for them and corn pewter had changed her reality so that she couldnt refuse she was supposed to decide whether kkn was guilty of showing her panties to a baby mouse but she knew that this was just a suppose story the real verdict would be on roxanne roc who had just as innocently erred how could a responsible jury abdicate its responsibility like this by assigning the decision to a slightly weird de moness this was a plain violation of its whatever in fact this was a demons beauty contest the issue roc and a hard place would be decided not by those who had the debate but by an innocent person who hardly knew what was going on that person was metria herself hoist by my own petard she muttered angrily lift up what mentia inquired did you say something dirty im caught in my own kind of scheme i helped arrange a marriage by setting up a demons beauty contest and now the jury is making me decide their verdict similarly i wonder what gave them that notion a light bulb glowed the demoness v this was her third effort to mess up the trial she had caused the duly appointed jury to abdicate in favor of an unqualified creature metria understood this nowbut still couldnt change it be cause of corn pewters stricture it might be wrong but she still had to do it well there was a way out she could just pop back to judge grossclout and tell him what had happened corn pew ter wasnt watching her at the moment she could escape before he overwrote her decision but what would happen then grossclout would declare a mistrialand that would probably represent the victory of the demoness v who was trying to disrupt the pro ceedings there had to be a verdictor the demon x h would lose and all xanth would pay the price so metria had to do iteven if it resulted in an unfair verdict bur not alone mentia woe betide you are in this too you decide sure soulless mentia said the law may be crazy and im crazy and i say she showed her panties and shes guilty no she isnt woe betide protested shes a good girl who was led astray by a bad man he pushed her he made her roll in the feathers he is the guilty one but hes not on trial mentia said maybe theyre both guilty we have to decide about her no one else and she did it piers anthony but there were exextexten woe betide stalled unable to handle such an adult word extenuating circumstances metria said yes so shes innocent mentia and woe betide were on opposite sides making another hung jury so it was up to metria after all she couldnt let all the others get hung the case as presented to her was against kim mundane who had been deceived led astray deprived of most of her soul and arrested when she fought back instead of charging her with the crime jaf killing an evil predator they had trumped up a ludicrous incidental indictment they thought would be easier to prove because kim had acted in self defense and helped many others recover their souls so should be praised rather than condemned so she was on trial for something irrelevant because someone wanted a convic tion the tactic reeked and roxanne roc had given almost six centuries of loyal service doing as well as any creature in xanth could have yet instead of being requited as she deserved she was put on trial for a trifling technical violation why so as to avoid the need to reward her that gross unfaimess was surely what had hopelessly divided the jury and it divided metria too she wanted to praise roxanne not punish her but the situation had been so crafted that she couldnt she had to decide on the basis of the limited technicality oh yes the jury had recreated the situation in the guise of a different story so that no one could say that an unauthorized person had made the decision about roxanne but in fact they had dumped the outrage into metrias lap she had to decide why had the simurgh done this why did grossclout and the others go along with it where was there any fairness in any of this business metria had only half a soul yet she could see that this entire thing was a travesty the jury saw that too why couldnt the simurgh she was supposed to be an extremely fairminded and wise bird was she actually just a meanspirited creature determined to welsh on a deal roc and a harp place but the simurgh was not on trial roxanne roc was me tria had to address the issue before her not the issue she wished she could tackle maybe the demoness v fig ured that the jury would refuse to address that issue and would win if that happened and if metria herself refused what mischief might she be doing to all xanth she struggled going round and round but finally she came to an unwilling conclusion its crazy its wrong its lu dicrous its a blot on us all the law is a mule but technically kim isguilty of the charge against her she said the dance abruptly stopped all the living jurors looked stricken but it was clear that they had made a deal and were honoring it so be rr corn pewter printed demoness inform judge grossclout that the jury has reached its verdict you will say nothing of the manner of it and the others nodded grimly this was their secretand hers had she just saved xanthat the expense of a noble and really innocent bird metria was much afraid that she had she popped out grossclout scowled at her the jury is ready she said grimly and wished she could sink into some other realm the judge called the court to order the various celebrants ceased their efforts and quickly returned to the main cham ber the audience had swelled in size because of the arrival of king dor queen iris and the rest of the castle roogna personnel even the good magician humfrey and the mem bers of his household were here now metria was amazed she had delivered grossclouts general summons but it was still astonishing to see it honored so completely the good magician almost never left his gloomy study the jury returned to its jury box metria saw that several of the female members were dabbing their faces with hand kerchiefs and several males looked unhappy they had not liked their decision any better than metria had only corn pewter looked smug with a smileyface on his screen he must have been the only one to insist on guilty forcing them piers anthony all to face the threat of being hung and metria had sided with him what a disgrace have you reached a verdict judge grossclout inquired rhetorically through a glower we have your honor sherlock said he was evidently the foreman we find the defendant roxanne roc guilty as charged there was a gasp of dismay from the audience princess ida looked stunned and her moon turned its bright face away becoming dark in the adjacent chamber roxannes beak dipped if she had hoped for better it had been in vain yet somewhere distant there was a sinister vibration as a powerful demoness cursed and departed metria thought she knew who that was correct demoness the simurghs thought came you have saved xanth the demoness v bet was that roxanne would not be convicted she believed that no jury could be found to decide strictly on the basis of the evidence she had indeed saved xanth but at what price metrias half soul was hurting judge grossclout nodded roxanne roc you have been found guilty of violation of the adult conspiracy to keep interesting things from children because this may prejudice an extremely important chick i sentence you to a continua tion of your obligation to care for this bird until such time as the adult conspiracy no longer applies to it objection ida cried that could be centuries the judge ignored her you will continue to place the welfare of this creature before all others until it is grown and independent no other desire or obligation will take pre cedence over this mission he glared in her direction do you understand and accept this sentence roxanne roc slowly her head lifted squawk she understands and accepts grundy golem translated she will do her best so let it be the judge said banging his gavel on the desk the sound was so sharp and loud that it made the entire roc and a hard place castle reverberate then he turned to face the jury and au dience the supreme importance of this mission made it necessary to verify the constancy of the one selected to per form it a pretext was established for this purpose i have five rhetorical queries and a statement to issue he paused a moment it was surely for effect because the demon professor never had any hesitancy about anything here is the statement no other desire or obligation in all xanth will take precedence over this mission his baleful near eye fixed on the jury box you che centaur will in due course be summoned to tutor this chick in all the things needful for it to know and understand it is for this purpose you came into existence winged so as to be able to fly with it a centaur so as to command sufficient intellect for it you will for a time share its destiny do you understand and accept this mission che centaurs mouth had fallen open as had those of the other jurors they were beginning to realize that the verdict they had just rendered had more significance than they had thought ii do che said his word was of course in violate because he was a centaur yet he was dazed he had just learned the purpose in his life the judge focused on grundy the chick and roc will on occasion need to communicate with other creatures you grundy golem will provide your service as translator as required do you understand and accept for a moment even the bigmouthed golem was flustered yeah sure he agreed looking quite flattered grossclouts terrible gaze swung toward the audience which collectively blanched it fixed on the good magician and toward the successful completion of that mission your resources will be made available to che centaur and rox anne roc at need without impediment do you understand and accept magician humfrey of course humfrey said seeming unsurprised metria realized that there had been considerably more purpose in piers anthony the service he had required of her than she or anyone had guessed the judges gaze swung toward the chamber where the simurgh perched and yours do you accept simurgh yes there was no surprise there either it was after all her chick the gaze moved to another creature metria hadnt noticed before perhaps because it became visible only now it was a great horse black as the midnight sky with the small bright lights of the stars shining from it it was the night stallion the lord of the realm of dreams and yours do you accept trojan do the horse of a different color faded out now that gaze swung back to the defendant whose beak lifted to face him to facilitate the further obligation you have acquired roxanne roc your power of flight is hereby restored and magnified beyond that of any of your kind you are granted the freedom to travel anywhere in xanth in the performance of your mission without impediment no crea ture or thing will hinder you in any manner on pain of being banished to the realm of dreams and subject to the extreme ill will of the night stallion and his night mares there was a groaning murmur through the hall there could be no worse fate than to be locked into perpetual bad dreams you will take any step you deem appropriate to secure the safetyand welfare of your charge and will preempt the services of any creature or thing of xanth toward that end as necessary for the chick about to hatch grossclout glanced at his left wrist in three quarters of a moment is destined to be the successor of the simurgh when she retires it must have the best upbringing and education available and the most con stant guardian and governess in fair times or adversity this court is satisfied that you are qualified for that duty there was a murmur of awe through the audience and jury metria realized that roxanne roc had just been pro moted to xanths most powerful position because of the im portance of her job her sentence was not a punishment but roc and a hard place a reward for her extremely loyal service none of the mem bers of the jury had suspected and because this mission may indeed require some ad ditional centuries the enchantment that has preserved your youth will continue for the duration you will not age until your job is finished judge grossclouts gaze lifted now it is time the gavel banged again shaking the castle there was a loud crack as if something extremely hard had sundered roxanne squawked and jumped off the nest oh grundy translated the egg was cracking open it fell into two segments as it did there was the whirring of wings and a stork flew in bearing a bundle it landed on the nest roxanne had just vacated set down its bundle and removed from ita fluffy towel it set this towel in the open egg and used it to dry off something inside then it released the towel metria watched in bemusement if the stork brought birds what was the point of eggs and how could the chick have been inside the egg to overhear the bad word then she realized that this was probably a courtesy call to attend to the hatching and make sure all was well for of course this was not just a routine hatching from the towel stepped the chick it scintillated with twice the colors of the rainbow sparkling like a collection of brilliant faceted gems it was taken as a whole the most beautiful and precious chick anyone had ever seen it blinked and caught sight of roxanne cheep it ex claimed nanny grundy translated the chick stepped toward roxanne who quickly returned to the stone nest and spread a wing protectively over it it was obvious that the two would get along the partition returned closing off the scene now there is other minor business grossclout said is the wedding party ready magician trent stood yes your honor piers anthony proceed the sorceress iris stood turning to focus on the chamber it became a festively decorated room with the audience ap propriately garbed there was even a stork in attendance for the one who had come to dry off the chick had remained for the other ceremony this was unusual but of course every thing about this occasion was extraordinary trent walked to the side and brought back the demon vore stand here he said then he walked to the other side and brought back magician grey murphy stand here but im not grey protested yes you are there was a crash somewhere outside everyone jumped and idas moon looked alarmed what was that grey asked the sun and the moon just collided che centaur said and gwenny goblin tittered fortunately no harm was done metria remembered how they had joked that this was what grey and ivy were waiting for before they married now their last excuse for delay was gone then the music started metria looked toward its source and was surprised to see maestro no one sitting in a pit marked orchestra conjuring a series of musical instru ments to play the theme apparently he had been able to leave the gourd for this occasion perhaps because the night stallion himself was attending now a great organ manifested and played with enormous authority it was the wedding march two young women appeared at the back in twin wedding dresses princess nada naga and princess ivy human they had been friends since both were fourteen now they were getting married together metria recognized the wedding dress first used by electra now restitched to fit nada making her magically beautiful though of all the women in xanth she needed it least ivy wore a pale green dress her mother roc and a hard place must have made which did much the same for her the two began their long walk down the aisle toward the two hand some males waiting at the front nada was accompanied by king nabob naga and ivy by king dor human naturally their two fathers were participating after waiting so long for this occasion metrias eyes blurred now that she was married herself and had half a soul she cried at weddings and this was a double wedding so she cried twice as hard her tears washed out most of the details but it did seem to be a nice if blurry event before she knew it it was done and the happy couples were slicing the monstrous cake someone had made indi vidual groups were forming as folk with common interests chatted magician trent was talking with che cynthia and chena centaur probably about the prospect of transforming some regular folk to winged centaur form they would need to search for suitable volunteers and surely some normal centaurs would be interested rapunzel was talking with the bones family no telling what mutual concern such folk had metria found herself sitting alone amidst a pile of wet han kies she was dimly aware of a dialogue between dug and kim as they settled nearby to eat their wedding cake i dread going back to mundania after this he said i wish i could stay and play the game again grossclout let slip that the next winners prize is the talent of creating things that would go nicely with your talent of erasure kim ruffled his hair maybe next time dug the trial was more important and the wedding was divine at least we get to keep our summons tokens as souvenirs though i guess no one would believe us if we ever told the truth about them and i shouldnt tell you this after the way you stole my soul well you got back at me he retorted you pricked me into burst nothingness you deserved it anyway the simurgh told me that in stead of being docked for skipping classes well both get piers anthony as it seems that corn pewter has a connection to the col lege database for grades its sort of our reward for jury duty thats great i cant think of much of anything i want more than an easy a what not anything he looked at her well nuhuh that stork is entirely too close for comfort bubbles perked up glancing at the stork which was standing by a wall as if asleep it was a curious business having a stork remain metria thought maybe it was on call in case there was an emergency with the chick dug sighed you know youd look good with a moon like idas then maybe id know by its phases whether you kim stomped on his toe but not hardyou may kiss me if you promise not to suck out my soul again done metria realized that she hadnt seen her husband in several hours she had more than kisses in store for him then she remembered something else she stood shedding hankies and started to cross the hall metria she jumped it was grossclout yes your honor forget that my duty is done where are you going to the simurgh to return the extra summons token is your skull still entirely filled with mush the simurgh doesnt want it back but then what what do you think demoness you have completed your assignment and by enabling the trial to proceed and a proper verdict to be achieved you have spared xanth much mischief the simurgh intended you to have your reward when that was done now you must serve that last summons and go home to your husband but who is there to serve it on its blank is it his tone said mush whose attention or atten roc and a hard place dance have you most wished to compel you know that crea ture will not wait here forever she brought out the last token and looked at it now it said the stork the other side said deliveries well now mentia remarked while woe betide stared in childish awe oh metria exclaimed a brilliant bulb flashing then with determination and excitement she marched in the di rection of the longlegged bird the demon grossclout almost smiled fortunately he was able to stifle the miscreant expression
