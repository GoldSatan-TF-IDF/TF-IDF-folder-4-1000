prologue no no the girl tossed fitfully in the large canopy bed mumbling in her sleep please no stay away if only she could wake up if only she could open her eyes then shed be safe safe in her bed safe in her house on fear street but she couldnt wake up no no her moans grew louder nooo suddenly the girl sat straight up in bed wide awake she shuddered gasping for breath grabbing the covers she glanced around her dark familiar bedroom no one here just a bad dream just a bad dream she repeated the words over and over like a lullaby from her bed she could see out the window she peered out at another cold fall night the large old maple shivered in the icy breeze dropping its last leaves through the bare branches of the tree she could see the streetlight casting an eerie yellow glow she sank back against the pillows wet with sweat her long blond hair was matted to her head id be better off not sleeping at all she told herself she sighed softly feeling a little better now she closed her eyes which is when she felt the presence felt that she wasnt alone in the room after all her eyes snapped back open she had never been so alert in her whole life what made her so sure there was someone there she didnt know who is it she whispered no answer she sat up slowly clutching the bedsheet to her she stared into the rooms dark corners studied the shadows then she saw it a glint of light in the far corner she opened her mouth to speak but was too frightened for she was now able to make out the human figure who lurked in the corner of her room she heard an angry growl then the darkness exploded the other girl rushed out at her so quickly she didnt have time to react the knife came down the first blow missed she struggled desperately trying to twist away but she was tangled in the covers now and the girl was holding her down sister she protested trying to push her away but youre my sister she tried to scream but hadnt enough breath she forced herself up but her attacker shoved her back smashing her skull hard against the headboard for a moment everything went black then she felt a searing stab of pain and again and again and then darkness closed in on her from all sides in the eerily silent room nothing moved now except for the trembling canopy over the bed chapter maggie traverss bad dreams didnt start until the night she slept in the canopy bed for the first time the bed was just one of the surprises awaiting maggie and her family at their new house on fear street but for a while it appeared the travers family would never find the house maggie had stared at the map in her lap trying to trace the route to fear street with her finger she pushed a strand of long red hair behind one ear it fell right back again i guess we turn left here she told her mother mrs travers slowed the car to a crawl she peered through the windshield into the glare of the sunny spring afternoon are you sure no shes not sure andrea grumbled from the backseat i told you mom we should have turned right on canyon road but nooo maggie says go straight so you go straight its so stupid maggie kept quiet she didnt want to start a fight with her sister starting a fight with andrea was one of the easiest things in the world not starting a fight with andrea now that was tricky gus maggies old golden retriever was sharing the backseat with andrea the dog had his head out the window he gave a low pitiful growl maggie glanced in her side mirror gus was wearing the forlorn look he always had on during car trips i know how you feel maggie told him silently it was saturday the day of their big move had finally arrived were off to a terrific start maggie thought grimly they were supposed to follow the huge white whale of a moving van but then andrea had insisted on stopping at a eleven for cokes they had lost the van maggie misread the map and now they were wandering through a maze of streets that circled north of town toward the fear street woods for almost maggie glanced at her watch ten after three she would never get to practice now the other girls on the shadyside high swim team must be wondering where they were were missing practice she informed her sister andrea rolled her eyes naturally she muttered unhappily if only we could find someone out walking mrs travers said nervously brushing her reddish gray hair back with her hand we could ask where we are were lost andrea said thats where we are thanks to youknowwho we were supposed to be following the moving van maggie reminded her sister as calmly as she could what does that have to do with anything andrea shot back maggie sighed it seemed as if andrea wanted to argue no matter what look maggie said im just saying its not all my fault okay who said to go straight andrea demanded gus maggie tried to keep her face blank but she could feel her anger mounting it always worked this way no matter how many times she told herself not to let andrea get her angry she got angry maggie tried to push the large unwieldy street map back to her sister you want to take over she asked here if you think you can do better be my guest no thanks andrea muttered im sure i couldnt do it as well as you you do everything better well maggie began mrs travers gave her older daughter a warning glance maggie she said please maggie felt her face flush it seemed as if mrs travers was always warning her to go easy on andrea always explaining how andrea had it much harder than maggie did maggie was seventeen andrea sixteen but the way their mom acted youd think andrea was five maggie glanced back at her sister who was now staring out the window scowling her jaw jutting forward in that way she had when she was frustrated maggie felt her anger easing a rush of pity taking its place mom was right she should go easy on andrea with their red hair and green eyes she and andrea looked a lot alike but the same features that made maggie pretty the green eyes the red hair the high cheekbones just didnt fit together right on andrea maggie was tall and thin andrea shorter with a broadness in her shoulders that bordered on stocky also maggies long red hair was thick and wavy andreas shoulderlength hair was fine and always hung limp and straight no matter what she did looks werent maggies only advantage maggie had always been one step ahead of her sister in everything grades sports guys there was no doubt about it she thought sadly this move was going to be harder on andrea than any of them after all andrea had never been very popular at school and the one thing she felt she had going for her was that she was a north hills girl north hills was the most exclusive section of shadyside andrea liked the status of north hills she loved hanging out at the country club maggie winced when she remembered how andrea and her friends had snubbed kids from other parts of town well now they were leaving north hills far behind and all the kids andrea had snubbed over the years would have the last laugh i will not argue with my sister maggie told herself i will not i will not she thought as if her mind were a blackboard and some teacher had assigned her to write the words over and over maggie still felt guilty and the feeling came back every time she argued with andrea shed been arguing with andrea the day their dad died so dumb there wasnt any milk for cereal that morning andrea blamed maggie for finishing the milk the night before maggie protested that she hadnt touched the milk then andrea called her a liar they were off in an angry torrent of words maggie found herself reminding andrea of things that had happened years before like the time when andrea was seven and she had set fire to the hair on maggies favorite barbie doll then andrea started yelling that maggie had ruined her life she sputtered angry nonsense about how maggie stole any guy she was interested in by then they were shrieking at each other and andrea was crying and then mr travers told maggie to stop picking on her sister that made maggie so mad she dumped her bowl of dry cereal on the floor it was one of the great injustices in maggies life andrea could have a tantrum scream cry break plates whatever everyone was used to her fits but let maggie lose it one little bit and her parents acted as if the whole house had blown up right after she had dumped the cereal maggie felt ashamed her dads face turned bright red i am so fed up with this bickering he yelled really maggie why cant you act your age then he scooted his chair back tossed down his newspaper and stormed out of the house that was the last time maggie saw him mr travers had a stroke that afternoon in his office while sitting at his desk when his secretary found him he was already dead i never even got a chance to apologize maggie thought bitterly they were still sitting at the intersection well mrs travers said sighing we should try something she turned left of course you listen to maggie andrea griped gus barked twice thats right gus mrs travers said you tell them to her daughters she added gus wants you two to stop bickering despite the tension between them maggie and andrea shared a quick grin their mothers belief in the knowledge and wisdom of animals was legendary in the travers family the traverses mailbox was always stuffed with mailings from all the animal rights groups mrs travers had once given money to she was always telling them what gus was thinking i hope were not getting close to our new house andrea murmured staring out the window please tell me this isnt where were going to be living andrea was right maggie thought the house had looked pretty bad the day mom drove them over to see it but that day it had been pouring and they figured it was the rain that made the house and the neighborhood so gloomy somehow todays bright sunshine just made the neighborhood seem even drearier all the houses needed to be painted they were all so shabby so rundown welcome to burglar city andrea joked pretending to do a tourguide voice our neighborhood is proud to announce we have one of the highest crime rates in the country maggie laughed but she could feel her heart fluttering the thought of burglars had always terrified her even when they were living in north hills where breakins were almost unheard of mrs travers frowned i know this part of town isnt the greatest girls she said but its all we can afford now she forced a smile anyway weve got old gus to protect us right thought maggie if a robber broke in gus would be all over him but the only danger for the robber would be that gus might lick him on the lips and gross him out look maggie cried suddenly pointing to the green sign tilted into the intersection fear street we found it were not lost after all mrs travers cheered maggie felt a surge of relief her good mood lasted until she saw the house twentythree fear street seemed even more ramshackle and neglected than it had the last time two of the green shutters were now hanging by single rusty hinges the lawn had huge brown patches and looked dead as did the whole place maggie shivered the big white moving van was parked out front and men were carrying furniture up the front walk maggie watched two burly men in green uniforms disappear through the front door struggling with her dresser she wanted to tell them to turn around to bring everything back to north hills but this was home now mrs travers turned in her seat to face her daughters she was smiling but under the smile maggie saw worry girls she said i know it doesnt look like much but when we have more money we can paint it and fix it up and plant some flowers and it really will look quite nice you wait and see besides fixing it up will be fun maggie forced a smile the move was hard on her mom too she knew well maggie said clapping her hands together lets get started she climbed out of the car and stretched gus was thumping his tail against the backseat watching her every move just a second gus she told him mrs travers waved to the moving men we got a little lost she called the workers didnt even nod back mom maggie said tugging on her arm i need the trunk key they had brought their valuables and clothes in the car maggie inserted the key into the lock popped open the trunk and started unloading suitcases she pulled out her green bag and carefully set it down on the sidewalk gus was barking like crazy andrea leaned against the car staring into space andrea you going to give us a hand here mrs travers asked sharply making a face andrea walked over and selected the smallest and lightest bag she instantly thumped it back down on the sidewalk oh poor gus she said opening the car door you must be dying of the heat in there wait andrea not yet maggie warned too late gus burst out of the car he started running in circles around andreas legs then he raced over to mrs travers jumping up on her then over to maggie easy gus maggie told him the next thing she knew gus was running off down the block maggie had her hands full of suitcases gus she yelled the dumb dog didnt stop quick andrea go get him cried mrs travers its maggies dog replied andrea peevishly let maggie get him maggie started to point out that andrea was the one who had let gus out but she saw the annoyance on her mothers face ill get him she said sighing she dropped the suitcases and started to run after gus he was down at the end of the block decorating somebodys hedge gus she yelled again he didnt even pick his head up to listen he trotted on she ran faster she was running flat out her sneakers smacking the pavement hard gus had turned the corner out of sight gus she yelled again then she reached the corner and slid to a halt gus was ambling across a lawn on the other side of the street but when he saw maggie he started running straight toward her he took the shortest route right through the middle of the street right into the path of a speeding delivery truck gus stop maggie shrieked she shut her eyes and heard the dogs shrill yelp of pain chapter tires squealed a horn blared the truck skidded with the dogs pitiful yelp still in her ears maggie screamed without realizing it she had clamped her hands over her eyes trembling all over she slowly removed them and stared at gus standing shaken but unhurt on the sidewalk the poor dog she realized must have yelped in fear not pain the truck had stopped several yards ahead the driver leaned out his round face red with fury get that stupid mutt on a leash he bellowed sorry maggie called but when the truck took off she let out a whoop of joy oh gus youre okay youre okay she fell to her knees her arms thrown open wide gus come here boy gus came trotting over obediently she threw her long arms around the dogs graying head and hugged him tightly sure she murmured now youre obedient gus waited patiently until maggie finally let him go this time she kept a firm grip on his collar panting with his mouth open the dog looked as if he were smiling maggie kissed the top of guss head i couldnt bear another death in the family she thought grimly i just couldnt bear it maggie led gus back to the house and in through the front door she bumped into a moving man coming the other way watch it he muttered rudely as soon as maggie let gus go free the old dog took off sniffing everywhere exploring the new house he ran into the living room where andrea was relaxing on the traverss whiteandgraystriped sofa the sofa looked lost in the empty room in the kitchen mrs travers was scrubbing away at the soot and dust and grime on the stovetop mrs travers could be spacey about a lot of things but when it came to dirt she was focused a cleaning machine she waved a yellowrubbergloved hand at maggie and andrea well she said i think ive made some important archaeological discoveries in the kitchen weve got about ten layers of dirt in here maggie gazed at her sister whose features were tight with unhappiness andrea she said gently why dont we start setting up our rooms well probably feel better when weve got our own stuff in them i doubt it andrea grumbled but she trudged upstairs after maggie now dont get discouraged about how it looks their mom called after them it just needs a little dusting ill be up there as soon as i finish in the kitchen it was going to take more than dusting to make this place livable maggie thought the wallpaper in the hall was supposed to be white with a rose pattern but the paper had yellowed and was peeling and the roses looked as if they had died she turned right at the top of the stairs their bedrooms were at the end of the hall she led the way and turned right into the room she had chosen while andrea turned left into hers whoa maggie uttered a low cry and stopped in the doorway there it stood a beautiful oldfashioned fourposter canopy bed dark polished wood and with a pink canopy on top oh my goodness maggie whispered she blinked as if to make sure the bed was real she crossed the room and sat down on it unbelievable she said softly the previous owners had left the bed behind but why why did they leave the bed and nothing else what a mystery youve got to be kidding andrea exclaimed from the doorway she had heard maggies delighted cries maggie stood up and gestured to the bed grinning can you believe it andrea was circling the bed now her mouth open she ran her hands down the old wooden posts how could they leave this maggie shook her head i dont know maybe they didnt like it anymore even as she said it the explanation seemed silly how could anyone not like this bed its so gorgeous andrea gasped look at the carving on the posts she was right the woodwork was stunning with intricate carved pinecones poking over the top of the canopy do you think theyre going to come back for it andrea asked maggie frowned that hadnt occurred to her maybe she wouldnt get to keep the bed after all beats me she said thoughtfully why would they take everything else and leave this for later it doesnt make sense youre right andrea said i think they deliberately left it behind andrea gave maggie a friendly smile i know that smile maggie thought in fact maggie could predict everything that was about to happen andrea was trying to act calm but maggie could tell how tense she was and she knew why andrea was tense andrea wanted the bed desperately say mags andrea began mags you know how ive always wanted an oldfashioned bed like this one right andrea bit her lip here came the question maggie had silently predicted sure enough andrea demanded can i have it can i have it andreas four favorite words andrea stared at maggie pleading with her eyes maggie lowered hers to the bed what should i tell her maggie asked herself what should i do should i avoid a fight and give it to her what should i say if maggie had known the horrors that awaited her in the old canopy bed her answer might have been different but she had no way of knowing why the bed had been left behind chapter finders keepers maggie told her sister andrea flinched as if maggie had punched her finders keepers oh give me a break andrea cried heatedly youre not going to be that childish are you maggies smile faded fast its not childish we chose the rooms last time we were here you wanted the bigger room the one in the back of the house the quiet room off the street remember the one with the great window seat but that was before we knew they were going to leave the bed behind andrea whined its not fair andrea maggie said im sorry it was just luck look sometimes i get lucky sometimes you thats such bull maggie and you know it andrea snapped you always get your way no thats not true thats it is true i dont believe you you never give me a break never you are a totally selfish pig as far as maggie was concerned it was always andrea who started the namecalling and yelling first it was certainly true now andrea was shrieking at the top of her lungs the louder andrea yelled the quieter maggie became andrea what if the bed had been in your room would you give it up andrea had been pacing around the bed now she slapped her forehead in disbelief i would if all your life you had dreamed of having a canopy bed she screamed all your life since when andrea maggie replied she was trying to remain calm but her voice was shaking since five minutes ago she could hear footsteps hurrying up the stairs mom andrea pleaded as mrs travers hurried into the bedroom you tell her havent i always wanted a canopy bed havent i hold it hold it hold it mrs travers said wearily please whatever you do dont shout then her eyes fell on the bed and her jaw dropped oh my goodness mrs travers cried her eyes lit up they left that beautiful antique behind yes cried andrea and maggie says mrs travers wasnt listening she walked across the room slowly and stared at the bed as if it were a mirage this must be worth over a thousand dollars she said softly why would they leave it behind i hope theres nothing wrong with it its not rotted or infested or something its perfect andrea insisted and maggie claims that its hers because its in her room which is so childish i she didnt get any further mrs travers held up a hand like a traffic cop wait a second andrea i dont want an argument about this i mean this is something to celebrate im supposed to celebrate because maggie got a great bed andrea made a disgusted face youre supposed to celebrate because we all got a great bed mrs travers told her but since maggie picked this room maggie gets to sleep in it whats the big deal but thats soooo unfair andrea wailed mrs travers rarely spoke sharply instead her expression became pained as if she was going to cry they had all done plenty of that in the seven months since mr travers had died but mrs travers had cried more than any of them maggie and andrea had both been awakened many nights by their mothers sobs they would try to comfort her but never could so when she got that abouttocry tightness on her face as she had now it shut them both up andrea gritted her teeth but didnt say another word i cant believe you two mrs travers said crossing her slender arms over the front of her sweatshirt the way you are always at each others throats people would think you hate each other but we do maggie thought bitterly even daddys death hasnt brought us closer together we do hate each other that night they planned on making dinner at home but mrs travers couldnt find the box with the kitchen stuff so even though they were on a tight budget she took her daughters out to a restaurant maggie managed to make it through the meal without fighting with andrea that was the good news the bad news was nobody said much of anything well that wasnt too surprising maggie told herself they were all exhausted i just wish we could go back to our old house andrea grumbled as they were finishing dinner even without any of our stuff there it would still be better mrs travers didnt answer neither did maggie what was there to say maggie slung an arm around her sisters shoulders as they walked out of the restaurant im going to keep this family close she told herself if its the last thing i do when they returned to the house on fear street maggie got her first peek at the place in the dark the house was rundown and ugly in bright sunshine no surprise that it loomed dark and creepy at night the phone rang as they ran inside our first call andrea cried excitedly racing for the phone her face fell when she answered just a sec she said sighing she dropped the receiver so that it dangled down from the phone for you she told maggie as she walked away dejectedly always for you maggie heard her mutter under her breath when maggie picked up the phone a familiar voice said brightly hey hows the new house justin maggie exclaimed she had been going out with justin stiles for only a few weeks and still couldnt quite believe it justin had to be the most popular guy at shadyside high one of maggies best friends on the swim team dawn rodgers had dated him the past year when justin first asked maggie out dawn had warned maggie that justin had a wandering eye but right then maggie didnt care she was just glad his eye had wandered in her direction justin had sexy wavy brown hair and gorgeous iceblue eyes that made maggie melt so whats up with the new house he asked its like something out of the addams family maggie told him dryly it is not maggies mother called from the living room it is maggie whispered it looks like one of those houses you see in horror movies where green gunk starts to pour out of the walls justin snickered sounds like my kind of place maggie groaned they were both silent she tried to think of something to say so when can i see it justin asked never maggie told him seriously im way too embarrassed you cant come over here ever justin laughed but this time it sounded a little tense so what are you trying to tell me maggie grinned it delighted her to think that justin might be feeling a little insecure about their relationship even for a single second justin stiles insecure from everything she had heard about justin that would be a major switch lets see how about coming over uh tomorrow afternoon she asked so much for playing it cool awesome he replied later mags the moment she hung up the phone rang again andrea hurried in from the living room it was for maggie again we missed you this afternoon said a cheerful voice you ready to lose the hundredmeter tomorrow hi dawn maggie said leaning against the wall and shifting the phone to her other ear dawn rodgers was the best swimmer on the team after maggie of course as a matter of fact i just could lose said maggie i havent been in the pool all week good said dawn maybe i have a chance then she laughed so far this season maggie had managed to edge dawn out in every race dawn was the most competitive person maggie had ever met but she was a pretty good sport about coming in second anyway dawn said thats not why i called you know why i called dont you maggie smiled i just talked to justin a second ago she replied youre a mind reader dawn said giggling maggie started telling dawn about justins call she leaned back against the wall smiling dreamily being with justin was the best but talking about it with her friends afterward was a close second as she talked to dawn maggie could see andrea staring at her from the other room why is she glaring at me like that maggie wondered why does she have to stare at me and listen to my conversations give me a break andrea get a life they went to bed at ten they were all worn out from unpacking maggie and andrea shared a bathroom at the end of the hall saying she would be only a minute andrea insisted on going in first hey get out maggie finally complained twenty minutes later she rapped hard on the bathroom door the door flew open and a burst of steam hit maggie in the face andreas red hair was plastered to her skull and she was glowering the water pressure stinks andrea cried and i had to let the shower run for a year before the brown water stopped coming out i dont think anyones used these pipes since the civil war maggie wanted to complain about andrea hogging the bathroom but she held back she forced a smile well sleep well she said in this disgusting haunted house andrea exclaimed fat chance she stomped into her room and closed the door the canopy bed was even prettier since maggie had covered it with her pink sheets and the thin white afghan her grandmother had knit for her she stopped to admire it for the hundredth time it was awesome maggie moved to the window in the pale light from the moon she could see tiny buds opening on the old maple tree that grew right up to her window that seemed like a good sign and justins call had made her happy he was coming by tomorrow she yawned she really was exhausted she changed into a nightshirt dropping her clothes on the one chair the movers had brought upstairs maggie loved getting into a wellmade bed she felt so protected when she was tucked in tight she lay on her back and gazed up at the canopy overhead more protection maggie closed her eyes she settled in feeling her muscles start to relax usually she had trouble falling asleep in a new bed this time she drifted to sleep before she knew it and then came the first dream in the beginning it was a pretty dream she was floating no falling falling slowly through a swirling pink haze then the mist grew heavier darker the pink disappeared replaced by ugly harsh grays through the ugly mist she saw a girl what was cold what felt suddenly cold had the dark mist turned cold or was it the girl she saw the girls head her long ashblond hair but she couldnt see the girls face i want to see her face maggie dreamed why cant i see her face is something wrong with it she knew she was dreaming and she knew she was scared the dream wasnt pretty anymore something was wrong something was wrong with the girl why doesnt she move maggie wondered why cant i see her face the girl is in trouble maggie knew all at once the girl is in terrible trouble she tried to move closer but the heavy mist pushed her back she tried to see the girls face but the mist deepened the mist swirled over and around her like a heavy curtain blanketing the girl from view and then maggie heard a hideous scream chapter the scream rose shrilly like someones dying shout maggie sat up her heart pounding her eyes wide open who screamed and why breathing hard she stared into the dark room was she alone yes but where was she this isnt my room she thought this isnt my house then she remembered this was her new house her new room she gasped as andrea and her mom came running in sitting straight up in bed gripping the white afghan to her chest maggie stared at them dazed and frightened whwhat was that scream her mother demanded fearfully maggie realized that it was she who had let out the long bloodcurdling scream bad dream she murmured more than a little embarrassed oh thank goodness her mom said sitting down heavily on the bed the way you screamed i thought a real nightmare huh andrea asked quietly sitting at the foot of the bed and wrapping her hand around the carved bedpost maggies breathing slowly returned to normal she forced a smile it felt good to have them there it it seemed so real she stammered well dreams do quite often mrs travers said she patted her daughters shoulder maggie was starting to feel a little foolish as if she were three years old tell it to us andrea suggested before you forget it i dont think ill ever forget it maggie told her it was just a girl sleeping the way she was sleeping at first i thought she was dead then she started twisting and turning she looked i dont know tortured i could feel she was in trouble weird said andrea what did she look liket i couldnt see her face but she had long blond hair dawn rodgers andrea guessed you talked to dawn tonight it was true dawn did have long blond hair but the girl in the dream was an ash blond with paler hair than maggie had ever remembered seeing outside a magazine maybe it was dawn she told andrea i dont know mrs travers brushed a lock of hair from maggies forehead its just the stress of moving to a strange new place she smiled at maggie but her face remained worried her eyes puffy maggie felt bad about waking her her mother had had a hard day think you can sleep now mrs travers asked maggie nodded thanks she murmured as her mother and sister left the room uh leave the door open she added she felt foolish saying that but she hadnt gotten over the dream yet she couldnt shake her fear it seemed to hover over her hover over the canopy bed like a heavy cloud maggie had set her alarm for seven she wanted to get to the pool at the high school and swim for an hour before breakfast swimming was so relaxing she could just get in the water shut her mind off and tell her body swim but when she opened her eyes the clock radio said ten she picked it up and examined it it had stopped the outlet she had plugged it into must be controlled by the light switch at the door ten was when she had turned out the light to go to bed she found her watch it was nearly eleven oh great maggie muttered unhappily another morning swim missed and the next day was the first tryout for the allstate swim team sighing maggie pulled on faded denim shorts and an oversize tshirt and hurried down for a late sunday morning breakfast then she and andrea spent the rest of the morning helping their mom dust and mop maggie wasnt in the greatest of moods she decided it would help if she set up her room the way she had in their old house but that only made her sadder when she put up her old swimming posters it made her notice how badly the offwhite walls of her room needed a fresh coat of paint then she lined up her crystal collection on the dresser her old room had been so sunny the crystals changed colors constantly here the prisms and glass animals barely shone as she worked in her room maggie found one other thing the previous owners had left behind on the wide ledge outside her window sat a tiny potted geranium dead the shriveled and gnarled plant seemed to sum up her mood justin will cheer me up she told herself around two she started to get nervous butterflies about seeing him she told her mom to be sure to keep an ear out for the doorbell she even went outside and pressed the doorbell just to make sure it worked then she took a quick shower and put on clean clothes a fresh pair of faded denim jeans a white tshirt and a greenchecked vest she had found at a flea market it brought out the green in her eyes she knocked on andreas door come in andrea said lifelessly maggie found her sprawled on her back in bed whats up maggie asked her andrea ignored the question well get used to this place right she asked gloomily maggie shrugged she caught a glimpse of a fashion magazine tucked under andreas pillow andrea always claimed she didnt care about looks or fashion or anything superficial like that but once when maggie was looking for a cd andrea had borrowed she came across a whole shoebox full of articles andrea had clipped from womens magazines articles such as ways to look slimmer and trimmer and want to look tall stand tall that kind of thing i havent found my hairbrush yet maggie moaned can i borrow yours go ahead maggie found the silver hairbrush on andreas dresser and started brushing her wavy red hair in long strokes justin will be here any minute she told her sister in the mirror she caught the jealous expression that briefly flashed across andreas face what am i supposed to do maggie thought bitterly break up with justin just so andrea wont be jealous maggie studied her sisters face trying to think of some way to cheer her up you still feeling down about moving here she asked i guess andrea murmured its just weird the house the neighborhood she swallowed hard then added no dad i know maggie said softly the silence was heavy between them there wasnt anything else to say and they both knew it ive just been having such strange thoughts andrea confessed avoiding her sisters eyes strange strange thoughts she paused then flashed maggie a tense smile have a good time with justin she said coldly where is he maggie asked out loud staring out the front window it was four oclock and no sign of justin by five oclock she swore to herself she was going to break up with him how could he do this to her at ten after five the doorbell finally rang maggie eagerly scrambled down the stairs by the time she reached the bottom step she wasnt angry anymore she opened the door to justin standing there one hand behind his back something for me maggie asked delightedly justin pulled his hand out he was holding a big bag of kitchen sponges how romantic maggie said he caught her puzzled expression you said you had all this cleaning up to do he explained grinning oh right maggie stepped forward and gave him a quick peck on the cheek touching his arm softly she had to stand on tiptoe to do it which she liked maggie was almost five feet eight that meant she was usually as tall if not taller than her boyfriends justin was six feet easy and so greatlooking she felt like pinching herself look mom maggie said as she led justin into the house new sponges mrs travers melted as if justin had brought her a bouquet of roses just what i needed she gushed moms a cheap date maggie said dryly hey mags justin said glancing around this place isnt as bad as you said you see mrs travers beamed justin was really turning on the charm you want something to drink maggie asked as she led him to the kitchen weve got two cans of sprite and she yanked open the fridge and peered inside and two cans of sprite weve got a little shopping to do mom explained guiltily uh i think ill have a sprite justin said his blue eyes twinkled maggie found herself staring at them she couldnt help it justins eyes were the color of the water in those ads for vacation islands in the caribbean come on she told him handing him the can let me give you the grand tour it was a small house so the tour didnt last long they ended up in maggies room justin sat on the only chair maggie draped herself across the bed hoping he would come sit next to her and kiss her he didnt they had already made out a couple of times but their relationship was so new it was as if they had to start from scratch each time they saw each other just then gus bounded into the room and ran straight to justin if only i could be that direct maggie thought gus collapsed on the floor begging justin to scratch his belly maggie laughed on second thought she told herself i dont think i do want to be like gus justin scratched gus with his sneaker gus whimpered with delight then he got up and trotted out of the room again and the silent tension between maggie and justin returned are you all set for the tryouts tomorrow justin asked finally maggie groaned thanks for reminding me why youre not nervous are you not me she jumped to her feet and began pacing youll do great justin promised i hope so maggie replied she didnt want to be superstitious but compliments like that always made her feel that she was going to mess up coach randall was holding tryouts to decide who would swim the im in the allstate meet the im was the individual medley the most taxing event the swimmer had to be good in every stroke shadyside could enter only two swimmers in the event coach randall had narrowed the field to four my biggest competition is your old sweetheart dawn maggie said making a face at him justin grinned sweetheart come on mags give me a break i keep telling you we went out once one date maggie tried not to show how pleased she was by his answer well anyway i think dawn is going to beat me dawns tough justin agreed oh thanks for the support maggie cried laughing that was the wrong answer youre supposed to tell me i can beat her easily youre supposed to say i could lap her twice in a twolap race justins expression turned serious i think you can beat her he said you think i know i feel so much better she said rolling her eyes actually it did mean a lot to her that justin had confidence in her abilities when it came to sports justin knew a lot he was captain of the shadyside high baseball team and a track star you know tiffany also has a shot justin added tiffany hollings was a softspoken girl with dark frizzy hair and large almondshaped eyes maggie had learned not to take her for granted tiffany worked out for hours every day including weekends she had a fantastic dolphin kick and a gorgeous backstroke and then theres andrea maggie said justin replied you can take andrea no prob maggie turned quickly toward her bedroom door shh when she saw the coast was clear she lowered her voice to a whisper thats not true dont write andrea off shes really getting good and besides beating me is her lifes goal thats because shes never done it justin replied maggie sighed im so pumped justin so totally pumped i want to swim the individual medley so much that if i dont get it ill kill myself im glad youre not putting any extra pressure on yourself justin teased theres something else maggie said justin waited studying her with his perfect blue eyes i had a dream last night let me guess you dreamed that when you walked into the pool your bathing suit fell off and everyone was laughing at you i have those dreams all the time before a big game wrong she said shaking her head there was a girl in my dream i couldnt see her face but i could tell she was in trouble weird justin replied but what does that have to do with swimming nothing she admitted but i keep thinking that maybe its a bad omen nope justin said with a reassuring grin just a bad dream to maggies surprise justin jumped up from his chair he put his strong hands on her shoulders then he kissed her on the lips a long deep kiss she felt his arms sweep around her and move down her back she didnt know until that instant how much she had wanted to be held when the kiss ended they were both breathless maggies heart was thudding in her chest she gave justin several quick kisses on the cheek then she glanced past him to the bedroom doorway and saw that they were not alone someone stood in the shadows staring at them the girl from the dream chapter maggie gasped so loudly that justin spun around in alarm andrea hi he called andrea maggie squinted hard yes it was andrea is she spying on justin and me maggie thought angrily wheres your camera do you want to take a picture maggie demanded sarcastically huh andrea pretended not to understand how long were you standing there maggie snapped ignoring her sisters anger andrea stepped into the room i just wanted to see if you had unpacked any socks she said i cant find mine see she held up one bare foot wiggling her toes she had painted her nails cherry red she lifted her foot so high she almost lost her balance maggie continued to glare at her that was a lie and andrea knew it socks but she stalked to her dresser i saw the home run you hit against waynesbridge andrea told justin coyly lowering her head too shy to look at him what did you say justin asked distracted oh yeah thanks andrea was obviously stung maggie knew that being ignored by a guy like justin was a million times more insulting than anything she could have said here catch maggie said she tossed andrea a rolledup pair of white socks as soon as her sister left maggie closed the door whats with her justin asked she hates me maggie answered shes just jealous justin said he slipped his hands around maggies waist pulling her toward him she stepped back you know when i saw her standing there in the doorway it reminded me of my dream again yeah justin reached for her again but she moved away she sat down in the chair where he couldnt get to her andrea had shaken her up and totally destroyed her romantic mood she needed to talk justin she said thoughtfully i know this sounds dumb but ive never had a bad dream that scared me before i cant help thinking what if the dream is a warning what kind of warning she shrugged feeling the same fright she had the night before i dont know just a warning a warning that something bad is going to happen forget about it nothing bad is going to happen justin assured her youre just tense mags because of moving and because he stopped in midsentence his breath caught in his throat his eyes went wide in sudden fright his mouth hanging open he grabbed his chest justin maggie cried shrilly his hands went up to his throat he uttered a hoarse choking sound and staggered toward her another choking sound cant breathe before maggie could get to him justin had crumpled lifelessly to the floor chapter maggie stood over him justin justin then she gave him a little kick when she noticed his stomach moving up and down you jerk she cried you scared me to death he grabbed her ankle and let out a highpitched hyena laugh i didnt believe you for a second maggie exclaimed liar he cried you fell for it you nearly had a cow youre not funny she nudged him again a few seconds later they were laughing and wrestling playfully on the carpet thanks for cheering me up maggie cried she pinned both his shoulders to the floor then jumped to her feet cheering victoriously give me a break how about two out of three justin demanded dawn rodgers slipped her long tanned arms through the straps of her black speedo racing suit and flicked the material into position okay everybody ready to take a lesson she called dawn whooped out a war cry the cry echoed off the walls of the halfempty locker room please spare us dawn tiffany hollings moaned clutching her ears we wont be able to hear the starting whistle dawn laughed youll hear it all right and heres the next thing youll hear she cupped her hand into a microphone now swimming the twohundred im for shadyside in lane number one dawwwwwnnn rodgers maggie was sitting on the bench next to dawn braiding her hair and smiling broadly imitating an announcers voice she added but whats this dawns wearing her tennis whites oh no those are definitely going to slow her down dawn maggie and tiffany laughed at that only andrea who had been scrabbling through her locker in the corner didnt seem to hear coach randall had asked the four girls to come to practice fifteen minutes early so they could race while they were still fresh the locker door opened just then and carly pedersen claudia walker and renee larson all members of the swim team strolled in hey you guys good luck today carly called maggie grinned and waved but her heart did a flip turn thats what it felt like anyway in competitive swimming the racer somersaulted at the end of each lap pushing off the wall with her feet it was called a flip turn about five minutes before every race maggies heart and stomach started doing flip turns okay okay andrea suddenly said and slammed her locker shut lets have it maggie maggie turned to her sister in surprise have what my bathing cap where did you hide it unbelievable maggie thought andrea was always accusing her of things did you lose it maggie asked did i lose it andrea mimicked nastily very funny hand it over everyone in the locker room was staring at them andrea maggie said as patiently as she could i didnt take it she bent into her locker here maybe i have an extra one i dont want an extra one i want mine andrea insisted andrea had dumped most of her stuff on the floor tiffany pointed to something white sticking out from under andreas backpack is that it andrea yanked the backpack away revealing her bathing cap oh yeah she mumbled redfaced some of the other girls in the locker room started giggling which only made andrea blush harder maggie turned away even when andrea was acting like a spoiled brat she didnt want to see her get teased tiffany finished dressing and started some warmup stretches i think im going to hurl she declared as she bent her head toward the floor youre that stressed out dawn asked relax you have nothing to worry about you always swim great besides were all on the same team right thats right agreed maggie glancing at andrea the locker room door swung open and coach randall walked in carrying her clipboard martha randall was tall and stickthin even thinner than maggie as a teenage swimmer she had once made it all the way to the olympic trials now she was in her forties and she still had the intensity of a champion it was a quality maggie really admired coach randall rarely said much today was no exception okay the four girls for the twohundred im she said studying her clipboard lets go this was the one part of swimming that maggie hated the time just before she got in the water she knew shed be all right once the race started but now she was starting to feel dizzy as they padded barefoot through the long hallway that led to the pool the familiar smell of steam and chlorine swept over her the pool gurgled softly the water slapping gently against the sides good luck maggie murmured to andrea maggie glanced at the bleachers a few of her teammates had pulled on their suits and come out to watch they waved and maggie waved back dawn was right maggie told herself why should i feel so nervous ive raced against these three girls in practice all year lets get started coach randall said curtly she checked her clipboard tiffany lane one andrea two maggie three dawn four the four girls bent over and scooped up water to splash on their bodies then they took their places on the starting blocks before maggie pulled her goggles on she spat into them to moisten the rubber edge she always did this to make sure the seal was watertight but this time she had trouble spitting her mouth was dry nervous nervous she scolded herself she glanced at andrea her sister was staring straight ahead with an expression of cold determination on maggies right dawn was nervously flexing her hands she had known dawn rodgers long enough to know that her confident manner was mostly an act dawn was as worried about the race as maggie was okay this is the twohundred im coach randall reminded them butterfly backstroke breaststroke freestyle in that order two lengths each any questions no one had any except for the one question they were all silently asking who will win coach randall moved into a crouch to watch the race and judge the finish maggie shook her head trying to clear it she had so many stray thoughts flying around andrea the new house justin she knew if she wanted a shot at winning this race she was going to have to concentrate focus she told herself focus below her the water stretched blue still and cold the four girls lowered themselves into a diving crouch coach randall called out on your mark get set then the whistle blew shrilly maggie dove she hit the water glided up to the surface kicking hard the key to the butterfly was the rhythm of the dolphin kick maggie tried to picture the grace and strength of a dolphin diving in and out of the water before she knew it the first length had ended maggie tucked and somersaulted a perfect flip turn she could tell she was in first place concentrate concentrate maybe she had started too fast it was only the second length and she was feeling tired slowing down concentrate halfway through the first length of the backstroke maggie saw dawn pass her on the right then andrea started edging by on her left there was no way to know where tiffany was since she was two lanes away so much for her early lead the coach was screaming instructions and her teammates were screaming encouragement but their voices were only a jumbled echo dig dig was the only thing maggie picked up breaststroke next maggie was breathing hard now and every muscle ached but the thought of losing hurt a lot more she silently commanded herself faster faster she pushed harder harder as she came to the end of the breaststroke but then she made a poor turn at the wall ive blown it she thought she had never lost a really big race before could she still win it was now or never freestyle was her strongest stroke but she had only two laps to catch up she felt as if she were skimming over the water the shrill cheers and screams in the gym reached an even higher pitch nearing the far wall maggie passed andrea then tiffany maggie kept charging she was swimming very close to the lane marker but there was no time to straighten out now she just had to hope that her hand didnt smack into the little lane markers or shed lose for sure faster faster she pulled herself forward churning through the water with all her might she was only inches behind dawn now only a few strokes left she pulled with all her might and stretched for the wall her wet palm slapped the tiles and a split second later dawn hit the wall maggie was first tiffany arrived a full second later and a stroke behind her andrea who finished fourth holding on to the wall with both hands and gasping for breath maggie gazed up at coach randall with a happy grin the coach was studying her stopwatch and making notes on the clipboard first place maggie travers she called maggie didnt bother to listen to the rest she just pushed off the wall into a lazy backstroke as she started to unwind then she swam back and dragged herself out of the pool after swimming so hard her arms ached and her body felt like dead weight nice finish maggie coach randall told her and smiled maggie beamed compliments from coach randall were like gold next time i want to see you pick up the pace on your butterfly and backstroke the coach added she never let you have a pure compliment there was always a catch whoa time out dawn cried she was out of the pool now and charging over to maggie and the coach there was interference didnt you see it maggie shoved the line right into me she didnt shove the line coach randall replied firmly her wake pushed the line over well so what dawn continued youre not going to allow that are you save it dawn coach randall replied sharply you came in second andrea picked up a towel and wrapped it around her broad shoulders maggie gave her a sympathetic glance andrea turned away some congratulations tiffany sat on the edge of the pool kicking her feet in the water shaking her head unhappily okay girls coach randall said with a smile lets not get down that was just one race weve got three more maggie glanced up to see dawn glaring at her breathing hard dawn maggie said im sorry i didnt mean to of course not dawn replied rolling her eyes maggie glimpsed andrea watching them obviously enjoying the argument all right coach randall called to the girls in the bleachers everyone in the pool maggie groaned the race had been so intense she had forgotten they still had an hour of practice by the time practice was over maggie was exhausted every muscle ached she took a really long shower some girls talked excitedly about the practice and the races but maggie dressed in silence lost in her own thoughts she was the last one out of the locker room she walked out through the pool most of the lights were off now maggies eyes were still burning from the chlorine they kept blurring watering over so it wasnt until she got right up to the water that she saw the body floating facedown in the pool chapter dawn maggie shrieked in the middle of the pool dawns body was slowly drifting with the waters gentle movement maggie hesitated for only a second then she dove into the water with all her clothes on please let me be in time maggie prayed please when she surfaced dawn was still several yards away please be alive be alive maggie prayed dawn raised her head dawn maggie gasped swimming over and grabbing her dawns face twisted in surprise let go she said shoving maggie away whats your problem maggie treaded water staring at her in disbelief my problem what do you think youre doing dawn blinked water from her eyes practicing breath control what do you think i i thought you were dead maggie stammered she grabbed dawns arm again it was hard to tread water with her clothes weighing her down dawn laughed dead maggie started laughing too partly from relief and partly from embarrassment i guess i got you dawn said splashing water at maggies head you did this on purpose didnt you maggie demanded splashing dawn back dawn backstroked out of maggies splashing range no way she insisted how was i supposed to know youd be such a jerk look at you youve got all your clothes on maggie reluctantly admitted to herself that it was pretty funny dawn threw her head back laughing she had a contagious laugh and soon maggie felt herself losing it as well the two girls laughed till they nearly cried their voices echoing off the high tile ceiling tuesday night maggie struggled to fall asleep staring up at the canopy over her head she tried to clear her mind to relax her muscles to relax relax as her eyes closed she felt a force pulling her down it was as if she were being dragged down into the darkness a darkness that became a swirling gray haze as the haze circled around her she drifted lower down toward a square of pink focus focus the square of pink became a canopy on an oldfashioned fourposter under the canopy maggie could hear someone in the bed someone moaning no no maggie drifted down through the pink canopy into the bed she saw the girl who was tossing fitfully beneath pink blankets the girl with the ashblond hair maggie knew she was dreaming but somehow that made the dream twice as frightening it was cold in the room but there were beads of sweat glistening on the girls bare shoulders she lay still now her head turned away if only maggie could see her face maggie wanted to call to the girl to turn around but when she opened her mouth no sound came out this girl was in trouble maggie knew it and then she knew why it came over her suddenly like a shadow rolling across her body she and the girl were not alone there was someone else in the room maggie whirled and saw the glint of a knife blade in the darkness then all at once the darkness exploded violently as a figure leaped forward the blond girl tried to twist away and her skull smacked against the headboard then the knife came slashing down through the air maggie jerked so sharply in her sleep that she woke herself up she lay in her bed in the darkness gasping in air her heart thudding her eyes still shut just a dream she told herself just a dream just a dream just a an image from the nightmare loomed in her mind the pink canopy the same pink canopy she saw when she opened her eyes the canopy her canopy the girl in the dream was sleeping in her bed the realization made maggies heart start to pound even harder what did it mean im just stressed out she told herself gripping the bedsheet im sleeping in a new bed so im dreaming about it thats all but then another frightening thought came to her one shed had before maybe the dream was a warning maybe her own subconscious mind was trying to warn her about something through the dream but what what she closed her eyes and rolled over onto her side gazing at the window only then did maggie feel the presence of the intruder her eyes popped open her mouth contorted into a silent scream the girl stood blanketed in darkness next to maggies bed staring straight down at her straight down into her face with a desperate gasp maggie jerked backward banging her head against the headboard she couldnt get away the girl reached out to grab her chapter maggie opened her mouth to scream its me its me its me the girl kept repeating in a desperate whisper maggie stopped yelling and covered her mouth her shoulders heaving the girl leaned closer close enough for maggie to see her face andrea are you okay andreas features showed her concern andrea maggie murmured i keep thinking youre the one in the dream i keep mistaking you why andrea squeezed maggies hand youre not making any sense get yourself together maggie youre scaring me ssorry maggie stammered she pulled herself up and shook her head as if trying to shake the dream away you were moaning and making all these frightening cries andrea whispered i thought id better wake you maggie swallowed hard her mouth was dry she covered her face with her hands wow another nightmare andrea asked settling down on the edge of the bed no maggie replied through her hands same one i had the other night only this time what maggie shut her eyes picturing the dream again this time the girl got stabbed it was so awful she was being stabbed and i i couldnt do anything about it who stabbed her andrea asked i dont know i couldnt see its like a horror movie andrea said yeah only its playing right in my head they sat in silence for a moment not total silence the rickety old house was full of quiet sounds creaks and cracks did my cries wake you maggie asked her voice still shaky nah andrea said i was up i couldnt sleep i went downstairs for a glass of water and guess where gus is sleeping next to the rocking chair andrea nodded dumb old gus maggie murmured affectionately officially gus was maggies dog but really gus had been mr traverss dog wherever mr travers was that was where youd find gus sleeping with his head on mr traverss lap or feet mr travers liked to read in the rocking chair at night and so that was still guss favorite spot to snooze from somewhere in the house came the sound of something snapping maggie jumped relax will you andrea cried youre getting me scared i hate this house maggie admitted suddenly youre not the only one i feel like its haunted please andrea begged ill be up all night no you wont youre not the one having nightmares maggie youve got to calm down dont start losing it its only a dream maggie wasnt listening in her head the dream started to replay itself something was bothering her teasing at the edges of her memory what was it what was she trying to picture she couldnt quite get a hold on it andrea stood up she ran her finger down one of the bedposts see i told you you shouldve let me have this bed its bad luck and its giving you nightmares maggie stared at her as if she hadnt heard the bed she said that was it she reached out and grabbed her sisters hand andrea youre right the girl in the dream the girl in trouble she was sleeping in this bed thats spooky andrea admitted and she got she let the question trail off maggie finished it for her stabbed she murmured softly with a knife over and over dont you see i knew it was too good to be true maggie moaned unhappily what was the owners just leaving this beautiful bed behind there had to be something wrong with it andrea shook her head this isnt like you maggie something is wrong here maggie whispered thinking out loud i can feel it did you see the girls face this time andrea asked maggie shook her head no hmm what does she look like she has long blond hair ash blond ash blond andrea repeated thoughtfully why maggie asked nervously you know who she is no andrea said with a smile i was just thinking i have no idea who she is maggie waited for andrea to explain well thisll sound crazy andrea continued but you want to know what i think is giving you nightmares what youre putting yourself under too much pressure with the swim team its like you have to be number one or else maggie frowned so i want to do well whats wrong with that nothing dont get defensive im not getting defensive maggie insisted well thats all im saying andrea said i just think that could be whats causing this maybe with dad and the move to this house and the competition its all too much for your brain its on overload what does swimming have to do with a girl getting stabbed maggie demanded her voice rising andrea shrugged as if the connection were obvious maybe you want to stab the rest of us so youll be the winner that that is totally stupid maggie protested okay okay andrea said quickly forget i brought it up im no shrink how am i supposed to know what your dumb dream means maggie regretted raising her voice andrea was only trying to help who knows maggie said maybe it is the swim team thats got me so stressed but what am i supposed to do drop swimming because i had a couple of nightmares no but you could ease up a little not push yourself quite so hard andrea suggested maggie laughed scornfully right take it easy so you can swim the twohundred im instead of me right instantly andreas eyes became dark with anger uhoh maggie thought what did i say you really are disgusting andrea cried shaking her head bitterly no matter what i do you always think the worst of me dont you andrea what are you talking about i you think i said that because i want to beat you in swimming you think this was all some kind of trick no andrea i was just jok believe me maggie swimming isnt all i think about get a life i didnt say you did i just andrea stabbed the air with her forefinger to stress her point i dont need tricks to beat you because i can swim faster and better than you how do you like that maggie sighed andrea she said youre taking this all wrong i didnt mean andrea was on her feet now dont do that she snarled dont do what dont start acting all innocent and sweet after you insult me you always do this always always do what you make a crack andrea said and then when i get mad you pretend you have no idea why im angry so ill look crazy andrea you are crazy maggie cried in frustration youre making up this whole fight out of nothing right andrea snapped its all my fault its always all my fault youre miss perfect right maggie raised her hands helplessly did i say that i came in here because i was worried about you andrea said her voice trembling i came in because you sounded upset and this is the thanks i get please andrea maggie said look how angry you are because of one stupid remark i made about the swim team whats the big deal here you and i both know that you dont exactly wish me the best of luck on the swim team and what about you andrea cried furiously whos the one dreaming about a girl getting stabbed huh dreams are all wishes right thats what i learned in psych class so who do you want to stab who do you want to be dead who was andrea right maggie wondered suddenly cold all over she couldnt be the dream cant be telling me i want to stab someone it cant be telling me im going to stab someone because when im in the dream maggie realized im not on the side of the attacker i dont identify with the attacker i identify with the victim chapter maggie spun the dial on her combination lock for the third time what was wrong with her she couldnt focus her eyes was it left to or right she ought to know she had only opened her lock about a zillion times she pulled down hard and the lock finally popped open she loaded her history and math books onto the top shelf it was friday tgif thought maggie wearily why was she so tired because she hadnt been sleeping well every night when she went to bed she worried about dreaming again the dream hadnt returned but the thought of having it scared her so much she tossed and turned every night every sound in the house became amplified and scary she hadnt had a good nights sleep since they moved to fear street maggie shoved her english textbook far into the locker the assignment for that day had been to read a story about a boy who keeps thinking its snowing turns out there is no snow its all in his head hes going insane just what i needed to read she told herself sarcastically she pulled out her notebook for mrs harrisons geology class snapped her lock closed and followed the stream of students through the noisy hallway only one more period to go and then she had swim she was so tired her feet felt like lead forget finishing first in any race shed probably sink straight to the bottom of the pool geology class was down one flight she joined the crowd in the stairwell sunlight streamed in through the tall windows of the hallway it caught a flash of red hair up ahead andrea she called she hurried to catch up to her sister there was no way to push through and her voice was drowned out by the loud conversation and laughter then a few yards ahead she saw dawn laughing happily as she started down the stairs with a couple of guys on the basketball team excuse me excuse me maggie forced her way forward she had no idea why she suddenly felt very uneasy she pushed harder hey someone said watch it no shoving her heart started to pound why was she feeling so strange dawn she called again moving with the crowd maggie now started down the stairs too hey dawn oh maggie cried out as she saw dawn start to lose her footing she heard a sharp cry and saw dawn start to fall it all happened in an instant but that one instant seemed to go on endlessly as if the whole world had gone into slow motion dawn tumbled forward down the concrete stairs her books flew out in front of her her head bounced on the concrete with a deafening crack louder than the startled shrieks and cries of the crowd another loud crack as she finished rolling and hit the floor her legs twisted under her her jaw fell open lifelessly her eyes stared blankly dawn didnt move chapter maggies trapper keeper fell from her arms and bumped down the stairs she raised her hands to her eyes to shut out the ugly picture of her friend lying twisted at the bottom of the stairs dawn dawn she muttered the stairwell echoed with shouts and cries a crowd had circled around dawn from near the top of the stairs maggie saw dawn begin to writhe in agony my arm dawn screamed it i think its broken get a teacher somebody yelled somebody call kids took off in all directions maggie heard frantic cries for help someone tried to help dawn sit up but she shrieked in pain when she was touched my arm my arm she cried shrilly somebody pushed me maggie took a deep breath and made her way down the stairs gripping the railing tightly she spotted andrea at the outside of the circle andrea turned and gazed at maggie she had the strangest expression on her face half smile half bitter stare dawn are you okay maggie asked what happened did you trip dawns reply made maggie turn away no i told you i was pushed did you do it did you push me dawn cried through her tears huh maggie wasnt sure she had heard correctly maggie dawn insisted weakly her arm bent behind her tears flowing down her pale cheeks i heard you call me maggie then then you pushed me horrified maggie started to sputter huh dawn no i i couldnt i wasnt near you i mean maggie turned to andrea for help but andrea was staring down at the floor tell her i didnt do this andrea maggie begged i i didnt see anything andrea stammered all around her maggie felt the accusing stares of the other students maggie glared back at them in disbelief did they really think she would push someone down the stairs didnt they know her better than that with an angry sob she picked up her trapper keeper turned and pushed her way back up the stairs no one made it easy for her to pass by the time maggie reached the upstairs hallway she was crying fighting back her tears she started to run the final bell rang for class but maggie ran straight into the girls room she shut the door hard and leaned against it at least she was alone she turned and saw her tearstained face in the mirror the dream as she stared at herself the dream popped into her head dawn has blond hair the girl in the dream has blond hair andrea had guessed the girl might be dawn the first time she heard about her and in the dream the girl always fell backward smacking her head hard against the headboard dawn had just smacked her head against the concrete just like the girl in her dream in the mirror maggie saw her own eyes widen with fear and the tightlipped horror on her own face scared her even more was the dream coming true andreas words came back to her dreams were wishes could maggie have caused dawns accident somehow even without meaning to she made it through geology class but her mind was somewhere else the whole time mrs harrison was going through plans for the field trip scheduled for the next wednesday about a fortyfiveminute ride out of shadyside was glenn rock mountain the caverns at glenn rock were a popular tourist attraction maggie didnt really listen to what mrs harrison was saying halfway through the period she asked to be excused to go check on dawn maggie went to the principals office the news didnt cheer her up dawn had a broken arm and possibly a concussion after school maggie ran into tiffany in the hallway do you believe what happened to dawn tiffany asked quietly she couldve been killed tiffany youve got to believe me i didnt do it maggie blurted out surprised tiffany studied her with her large eyes i never thought you did maggie gratefully squeezed tiffanys hand tiffany lowered her eyes listen dawn had a concussion she wasnt thinking clearly thats why she accused you shell be better dont worry i hope so maggie replied shaking her head trying not to cry again it was so awful tiffany everyone was shoving you know how it is on the stairs between classes im sure it was just an accident of course tiffany replied but you can understand where dawns coming from i mean you have a pretty good reason to want her out of the way tiffany maggie said trying to keep the sound of pleading out of her voice you know me better than that do you really think id hurt dawn just to make sure i swim the twohundred im tiffany tugged at a strand of hair of course not besides youll be in unless you totally blow the next three races anyway there are two slots so i had no reason to push dawn maggie insisted why did she accuse me how could she im so hurt tiffany so hurt tiffany moved forward to give maggie an awkward hug just give dawn a little time she whispered shell come to her senses just give her a little time maggie forced a smile the two girls backed away from each other maggie wiped a tear off her cheek tiffany was right she knew maggie would have to wait to talk to dawn maggie couldnt face swim practice she told the coach she was sick and went straight home as soon as she got there she threw herself facedown onto the living room couch she didnt want to think anymore she was just tired worn out she needed to rest that was the last thought she remembered when she opened her eyes again the room had grown darker maggie groaned and sat up she felt as if her brain were glued to her skull the nap had made her disoriented and groggy at least she hadnt had the nightmare then she smelled tomato sauce heard it bubbling softly in the kitchen her mother came into view in the kitchen archway holding a wooden spoon she waved the spoon and smiled you were sleeping when i got home from work dinners almost ready your favorite spaghetti with nonmeat meatballs it wasnt exactly maggies favorite she liked real meatballs but mrs travers was mainly a vegetarian you were sleeping so peacefully i didnt want to disturb you her mother called the phone rang twice and you stayed dead to the world i think you really needed the sleep maggie sleeping peacefully for once it was the first time that maggie had slept well in the new house what made this time different she knew the answer right away she had slept on the couch not in the canopy bed that night she stood in her bedroom staring at the beautiful old bed she still had not been able to figure out why the owners had left it behind could it be because the bed was haunted how her feelings about this bed had changed since they first moved in that first day it had been the one good thing about having to move she had loved it now she feared it the backyard of fear street was tiny hemmed in by the lawns of three different houses the previous owner had started a flagstone walk from the back door but had abandoned the project after laying only a few stones there was a rusty old swing set with two swings maggie sat on one it was designed for a young kid and she had to stretch her long legs straight out in front of her to swing at all the rusty chains creaked overhead as she rocked back and forth it was saturday morning a hot sunny day with small puffs of white cloud high in a blue sky usually maggie woke up feeling refreshed ready to go but now she felt as tired as when shed gone to bed shed been up all night thinking about dawn thinking about the dream and wondering if there was any connection inside the house she saw her mother moving in her bedroom maggie waved and tried to smile she got off the swing and started making her way along the row of scrawny shrubs that bordered the yard she pulled off a few early red berries and squished them in her fingers making a bloody pulp come on she scolded herself youve got to shake this think about something else but that was hopeless she couldnt switch her mind off what was the old game you told someone not to think about an elephant and then she couldnt think of anything else she sat down and leaned back against the smooth trunk of a white birch tree gazing up she could see the sky through the budding branches a gentle wind blew the clouds slowly by so peaceful so quiet before long maggie fell asleep a restful sleep with no disturbing dreams no knives no girl in pink and then a hand on her shoulder she opened her eyes with a startled gasp and saw a frighteninglooking man reaching for her throat this wont take long he rasped chapter maggie pulled away with a terrified cry the man jerked back his gray eyes wide with surprise sorry didnt mean to scare you he said i i asked if youve been baking long he pointed up at the sky the late morning sun was climbing higher heating up the backyard you could get a bad burn today even though its spring the man said i thought id better wake you uh thanks maggie choked out as she stared up at him he came into sharper focus he was old with a heavy white stubble on his leathery creased face he wore a battered orange cap and had a toothpick wedged in his mouth his smile revealed uneven yellow teeth he held a hand out it took maggie a while to realize he was offering to help her up reluctantly she took his hand and climbed to her feet i am so jumpy and stressed out she thought scolding herself i think everyone in the world is out to get me milton avery the old man said in his harsh voice he nodded and raised two fingers to his cap im your neighbor he held out his right hand to maggie maggie shook it the old man held on to her hand a moment longer than maggie would have liked his skin felt like old paper you havent told me your name mr avery said oh sorry maggie maggie travers maggie travers the man repeated he nodded thoughtfully nice name maggie smiled thanks the man smiled back warmly he removed his cap revealing a head that was bald except for a fringe of scraggly white hair he scratched the top of his head then put the cap back on he looked up at the house it sure is nice to have this house occupied again maggie stared at the house too as if she hadnt seen her own house before it was on the market a long time mr avery said maggie felt her spine tingle was it a long time the way he said it maggie wanted to ask just how long he meant years decades he obviously could remember back a long way mr avery went on i didnt like having an empty house next door kind of gave me a dead feeling every time i saw it know what i mean maggie knew exactly what he meant mr avery took his cap off again and used it to point at his house i even took to keeping the shades down on this side of the house so i wouldnt have to see yours maggie glanced at the stilldrawn shades as another thought rolled through her mind did you know the people who used to live in my house she asked mr avery didnt answer right away not really they didnt live here very long terrible story terrible her heart pounded hard why what the old man searched her face the real estate salesman didnt tell you the story no what story mr avery frowned well i guess i cant blame him for keeping it from you i mean bob jamison is a pretty honest guy for a salesman anyway but he hadnt been able to sell this house for months i guess he figured that if you didnt ask he didnt have to tell he cleared his throat his eyes focused on hers boring into her they were old eyes pale gray but clear and hard listen he said hoarsely my wife claire would sure love to meet you a pretty young girl like you would brighten up her morning she could use that why dont you come on over for a cup of tea and ill tell you the whole story maggie glanced up at her house again to see if her mom was watching but her bedroom window was dark that sounds great she said mr avery pointed to a break in the hedge this way he told her he took off his cap bowed and gestured after you mr averys house was warm and cozy there were family photos on the walls children grandchildren mrs avery was sitting at the kitchen table the newspaper folded beside her plate as she worked the daily crossword she had a round moon face accentuated by a halo of thin white hair i thought you were going to do some gardening milton she said without looking up i am claire he said but as you can see mrs avery raised her eyes and smiled warmly this is our new neighbor mr avery explained placing a hand on maggies shoulder claire this is martha maggie she corrected him maggie sorry maggie travers mrs avery stood up and smiled broadly she shuffled over to shake maggies hand welcome to the neighborhood she said oh im so glad to meet you such a pretty girl are those green eyes yes maggie replied uncomfortably gorgeous mrs avery said nodding her head in admiration oh it must be nice to be young it hadnt been nice this week that was for sure mr avery said he was going to tell me maggie started would you like some tea mr avery interrupted and a gingersnap do we have any left claire claire moved to the stove hefted the kettle to make sure there was water inside then turned on the burner full blast i dont know she said check the cookie jar maggie couldnt wait any longer what happened in my house she asked bluntly mrs avery gave her a sharp look you dont know back to square one again no she said i milton mrs avery said sharply narrowing her eyes at her husband are you trying to scare this nice young girl maggie felt a trickle of sweat run down between her shoulder blades so she was right all along something awful had happened in that house she knew it she wasnt crazy after all maggie sat down at the table trying to stay calm mr avery set his cap down such a sad story he muttered please milton we didnt even know the poor people the helfers mrs avery chimed in she shuffled back to the stove to lift the whistling kettle so many horrible stories on this street mr avery continued there was a girl about your age named miranda pretty girl with blond hair miranda maggie knew instantly that miranda had to be the blond girl in her dream did miranda live in my house maggie asked eagerly she and her family lived in your house yes answered mr avery milton thats enough mrs avery spoke up no please tell me maggie pleaded she was killed the old woman blurted out murdered she was stabbed mr avery said in a hushed whisper stabbed right in her own bed chapter justin had his arm around her that felt good it was saturday night the movie he had taken her to was a goofball comedy maggie usually enjoyed silly movies but this time she couldnt lose herself in the story a girl was murdered really murdered in my bed and now im dreaming about her that was all maggie could think about after the movie justin kept his arm around her as he guided her out with the crowd out into the mall parking lot it was a balmy spring night the air soft and sweet a pale halfmoon floated low in a purple sky i guess you didnt like the movie as much as i did justin said no i liked it maggie lied she suddenly had the feeling that she was being watched she turned and stepped out from under justins arm dawn her arm in a cast was standing at the edge of the parking lot with tiffany she waved to maggie dont you want to sign my cast dawn maggie cried startled to see her ive been trying to call you i hope you still dont think she hurried over to them justin followed slowly behind guess i should apologize dawn said flashing her a warm smile i said some pretty weird things after i fell well you have to believe me i didnt do it dawn maggie said simply dawn shrugged well somebody pushed me but it doesnt really matter now she grinned at maggie tiffanys going to beat you out for the twohundred im anyway hey justin justin nodded hey then he tugged on maggies arm impatient to lead her away maggie signed dawns cast weve got to get going justin urged see you at practice maggie told tiffany she told dawn shed call her then she hurried after justin who had already started toward his car maggie couldnt help sneaking glances back at the two girls even though she knew she hadnt pushed dawn maggie still felt guilty i know dawn thinks i pushed her maggie told justin no matter what she says thats dawn for you justin said unlocking the door on the passenger side for maggie like when she loses a meet theres always an excuse he opened the door for her and if she trips she was pushed i guess maggie replied thoughtfully but as she climbed into the car her good mood faded the uneasy feeling had returned justins car was upholstered in soft black leather maggie settled back in her seat relax she told herself justin started the car then fiddled with a control on the dash the top cranked down letting in the moonlight and the warm spring breezes he smiled at her then he pulled out of the parking lot making the tires squeal they didnt drive far about a block from the mall he parked on a deserted street maggie glanced around surprised why are we stopping here justin pretended to peer outside looks like were lost he said and grinned even in the evening darkness his blue eyes were gorgeous maggie grinned back i dont mind justin leaned over slowly bringing his face toward hers her eyes were locked on his she felt her heart start to pound with excitement but she quickly found that kissing was awkward in the tiny car for one thing it had bucket seats they were so low it was hard to reach each other then they both got tangled in their seat belts untwisting herself a gruesome thought suddenly filled maggie with cold dread this was what that girl had felt like when she got tangled in the covers miranda the girl who died in maggies bed she was tangled tangled in the bedsheets and then she was stabbed with a sigh maggie clicked her seat belt open and let it slide away from her shoulders why cant i stop thinking about miranda justin reached for her wait maggie said pulling her face away huh whats wrong she didnt want to tell him nothing she said its just so cramped in here justin uttered an annoyed sigh he sat back in his seat and stared straight ahead in angry silence finally he turned back to her theres a nice big tree over there he said we could sit under it she hesitated im really sorry my mind its somewhere else justin sighed again mags whats wrong he asked finally all of a sudden its that dream again she confessed the dream justins face knotted in confusion what dream remember i told you about a nightmare i had a girl with blond hair i couldnt see her face justins face remained blank i tried to put it out of my mind maggie rushed on but then i had the dream again and this time the girl was stabbed in my bed in your dream justin corrected her right said maggie thats what i thought it was just a dream but guess what i found out from my neighbors the last people who lived in our house their daughter was murdered in bed in my bed weird justin muttered who was she her name was miranda helfer did you know her did you ever hear about the murder miranda helfer he thought for a moment no never heard of her justins expression brightened well that explains why youre having nightmares no dont you see maggie said impatiently i had the nightmares before i knew about the dead girl huh justin reacted with surprise the real estate guy didnt tell us maggie continued and i started dreaming about the murder my first night in that old canopy bed theres no way i could have known about it justin no way so it must be something you know supernatural justin narrowed his eyes what do you mean you know like the bed remembers the murder and its trying to transmit it to me to warn me to something justin ran his hand through his dark wavy hair mags he said rolling his eyes scornfully the bed remembers the bed earth calling maggie earth calling maggie i know i know it sounds dumb but can you think of a better explanation maggie demanded earnestly why am i having this dream maggie justin said sounding more than a little annoyed dreams are always mixed up and crazy well i think this one means something maggie replied heatedly i think miranda is trying to tell me something i think shes trying to warn me about something justin gaped at her he let out a highpitched giggle from the grave maggie nodded solemnly from the grave maggie cupped her hand at the perfect angle cutting deep into the water with each stroke she was swimming beautifully she could feel it she wasnt surprised when she pulled her head up at the end of the race and saw she had finished first by half a lap behind her the water churned the other two swimmers andrea and tiffany swam neck and neck battling it out for second hanging on to the edge of the pool maggie started shouting go andrea pull with her bathing cap and dark goggles andrea looked like some strange water creature surging through the pool maggie barely recognized her you can do it andrea she shouted but tiffany pulled ahead and her hand hit the wall first okay good race coach randall called out a moment later i need to see the three of you over here they stood in a semicircle around the team bench where coach randall sat studying the notes on her clipboard even though it was warm in the pool area the three girls all held their hands crossed over the chests of their dripping bathing suits as if to protect themselves maggie had always noticed that about swimming you felt vulnerable when you came out of the water raising her eyes to the bleachers maggie spotted dawn in the top row she was dressed in street clothes her feet on the bench below her even at this distance maggie could see that dawn wasnt smiling well what did i expect maggie asked herself if i had broken my arm and lost out on swimming allstate i wouldnt be in the friendliest mood either coach randall scribbled something on her clipboard all right she announced maggie tiffany youre going to swim the twohundred im in the allstate tiffany danced away from them throwing her arms up in the air excitedly i made it she shouted to dawn dawn cheered way to go tiffany she didnt congratulate maggie of course no surprise there maggie congratulated tiffany but her smile faded fast when she caught andreas expression andreas lower jaw was jutting out in an expression maggie knew only too well her sister was fuming andrea the coach continued if its any consolation you didnt miss out by much youre swimming better than you ever have great andrea muttered i want you to keep training hard andrea coach randall instructed the twohundred im is the most important event youre our numberone alternate obviously grumbled andrea rolling her eyes theres no one else left coach randall stared at her sternly theres a whole team left there are eleven other girls if you dont want to swim the twohundred im just say so andrea shrugged being an alternate is important coach randall continued and dont forget that youre a year younger than maggie and tiffany youve got another year to go maggie gave andrea a sympathetic glance you can stop with the pity act andrea snapped at her she turned sharply and stalked off to the showers coach randall turned to maggie dont worry she said shell get over it somehow i doubt that thought maggie it wasnt the first time she wished that her younger sister didnt hate her so much maggie couldnt get comfortable the sheets felt as if they were burning normally she liked to sleep on her right side but that night she could hear and feel her heart pounding it made her so uncomfortable as if any moment her heart might stop tossing and turning she was tossing and turning just like the girl in the dream no please no im tossing and turning like miranda im just like miranda she felt herself falling now falling into the dream no turning back she fell through a pink haze from high above she gazed down at the billowing pink canopy of her bed im dreaming she told herself its just a dream why didnt that thought offer any comfort through the pink canopy through the pink gauzy top into the bed and she saw the girl she saw miranda her ashblond hair matted and wet against the pillow the girls face was turned away as always then the dark shadow swept over the bed maggie whirled just in time to see the glint of the knife blade in the dim light no maggie screamed the scream must have been loud enough to wake her up she found herself wide awake sitting up in bed her eyes darted around the dark bedroom i dont want to wake up now she told herself i want to finish the dream i want to see more i need to see more she settled back against the pillow determined to go back to sleep and finish the dream but lying in the dark staring up at the canopy fluttering in the gentle breeze from the open window maggie suddenly knew she wasnt alone its not a dream she knew its real not a dream and someone else is in my bedroom the figure stood in the dark corner of the room just where the attacker always hid in her dream with a shudder of terror maggie pulled herself up and saw who it was andrea andrea andrea its you andrea crossed the room quickly to maggies bed and as andrea moved toward her maggie saw something gleam in her sisters hand she recognized the silver glint of the knife chapter andrea what do you want what are you doing in here maggie whispered i couldnt sleep came the whispered reply i was trying out some new hairstyles i just came in to borrow your curling iron she held it up the glint of light maggie now realized was the silvery rod of the curling iron sorry i woke you andrea whispered she tiptoed out of the room do you want the door open maggie was breathing too hard to answer ill shut it partway andrea said after andrea left maggie remained still staring at the doorway waiting for her breathing to return to normal andrea crossing the room in the dark the metallic shimmer of the knife that was from my dream she thought but how could that be am i really cracking up she didnt have long to think about it suddenly the door to her room creaked open she heard the thud of soft footsteps but she couldnt see anyone without warning guss head popped up on the side of the bed his dark sad eyes staring at her in the dark maggie was so glad to see him she flung her arms around his neck and kissed him on the nose gus licked her ear then he trotted back out the door again she heard him thumpthumping down the front steps be sure to get lots of rest maggie suddenly remembered the coachs instructions she closed her eyes ive got to sleep got to sleep she lay still it seemed like an eternity probably only about five minutes she opened her eyes this was pointless she had never been so wide awake in her life okay dad she said to herself time to take your advice her father had always said that if you couldnt sleep get out of bed and read until you were sleepy she swung her legs out of the bed the floor felt refreshingly cool she crossed to her bookshelf and searched for something boring to read moby dick that ought to do the trick dad always said it was the most boring great book ever written she remembered another piece of advice from her dad on insomnia he said it helped to leave the bedroom until you felt sleepy mr travers had been a real expert on insomnia because he suffered from it many late nights when maggie would wander downstairs shed find him sitting in the kitchen drinking his favorite remedy a tall mug of hot cocoa and reading moby dick weighed a ton carrying the heavy hardback under one arm she padded out into the hall through the crack under andreas door she could see her sisters light still on she didnt move toward it but headed through the hall and down the front stairs gus was sleeping by the footstool in the living room snoring like crazy no insomnia problem there the empty kitchen was as silent as a grave she opened the fridge letting the cool air spill out onto her bare legs somewhere in the house a floorboard creaked she listened her body instantly tense usually when the house made noises she told herself it was gus but gus was in the living room sleeping its just the house settling she assured herself outside the wind made a shutter bang there was nothing in the fridge she wanted but she kept the door open anyway just for the light she stood still and listened a moment more all quiet now she closed the fridge she flicked on the light and sat down at the kitchen table she didnt even open the novel there was no way she could concentrate on a whaling story could i get back to the dream she wondered could i close my eyes and drift back into it could i finally see the girls face see the attacker could i finish it once and for all she surprised herself by her eagerness to get to the end of it am i tired enough to sleep now she closed her eyes she could feel her exhaustion just under the surface she turned off the kitchen light and climbed the front stairs she had been in the house for only two weeks but already she could find her way around in the dark it had become a little familiar maybe someday it would seem like home back in her room she stopped short the blankets on the bed had been pulled up strange maggie was sure she had left them crumpled up at the foot of the bed where she had kicked them off she crossed to the bed and reached for the covers she yanked them down and screamed when she saw the knife its long blade plunged deep into her pillow chapter with a shudder maggie raised her hands to her face and backed away from the bed when she reached the open doorway she turned and ran she felt sick her stomach heaved the blood throbbed at her temples andrea it had to be andrea maggie remembered the crack of light under andreas door andrea was still awake was the dream warning me about andrea maggie asked herself fighting back her terror her anger does andrea hate me that much at the end of the hall in the darkness her mothers door flew open mrs travers came running out in her nightgown maggie lurched toward her mom mom she grabbed her mother by the hand and pulled her back into her mothers bedroom mrs traverss eyes went wide with worry what what is it maggie whats wrong andrea maggie choked out what what about andrea the knknife what knife what maggie is andrea okay me me maggie screamed frantically clutching both of her mothers hands she tugged her back down the hall andrea put the knife in my bed she cried hoarsely what are you talking about maggie pushed her mother into her bedroom there she cried pointing at her bed mrs travers clicked on the ceiling light they both stared at maggies bed the covers were down just as she had left them but the pillowcase was smooth and uncut and the knife was gone chapter im not crazy maggie shrieked mrs travers drew back tugging tensely at a tangle of hair her eyes narrowed at maggie studying maggie im not crazy mom maggie insisted in a shrill shriek of a voice with a furious cry she pushed past her mother and ran out the door and down the hall dont wake andrea up mrs travers called behind her but maggie shoved her sisters door open and snapped on the light andrea lay facedown on the bed the covers pulled up over her shoulders quit acting maggie shrieked youre up i know youre up andrea groaned and turned over slowly shielding her eyes wha mrs travers stormed into the room maggie leave your sister alone im serious leave her alone maggie laughed wildly leave her alone she stabbed a knife into my bed mother she she shes trying to drive me crazy maggies whole body trembled in rage she lunged forward grabbed andreas shoulders started to shake them hard wheres the knife andrea where whered you hide it under here she let go of andrea and jerked her pillow off the bed let go andrea cried sleepily what is your problem maggie mrs travers grabbed maggies shoulders and tried to pull her away from andreas bed but maggie whirled around her light was on until two seconds ago she cried her light was on she wasnt asleep mom shes faking she stuck the knife in my pillow i swear to you what knife andrea demanded pulling her pillow out of maggies arms where would i get a knife she turned to her mother what is maggie talking about im not sure mrs travers replied wearily come with me maggie she said softly lets talk about it in the morning okay when youve calmed down a little ill never calm down maggie insisted but she allowed her mother to lead her out of the room youre crazy maggie she heard andrea mutter from her bed youre totally crazy the whistle blew shrilly coach randall stared down at her watch all right girls listen up tuesday afternoon the end of another long practice maggie was clinging to the pool edge beside her teammates listening to the coach she glanced up at dawn watching from her usual perch at the top of the bleachers coach randall paced up and down at the pools edge as you know coach randall went on friday is the allstate meet so for those of you wholl be competing there isnt much time left to get you in tiptop shape what do you say everybody five more laps there were groans all down the pool coach randalls face twisted into an expression of mock surprise oh youre disappointed were doing only five youre right well make it ten more groans but coach randall clapped her hands no fooling everyone on the diving blocks five laps freestyle maggie tiffany lets see why you guys are swimming the twohundred im for us maggie took the lane between andrea and tiffany youre going to lose andrea muttered under her breath as she pulled down her goggles thanks for the vote of confidence maggie said with a bitter smile she crouched into her diving stance andrea had done her a favor andreas remark reminded maggie of how much she hated losing the whistle blew and maggie pushed off hard heading straight off into the cold blue water she started strong but almost immediately her energy flagged her body remembered how tired she was even if her mind had forgotten every time she turned her head to breathe she saw tiffany match her stroke for stroke maggie stroked harder faster but when she turned her head to breathe now she saw tiffanys midsection she was falling behind one lap thats all it was but it seemed like a mile her hand smacked the floats that marked the lane stinging pain ran up her arm she realized she was veering too close to andrea she tried to straighten out but it cost her more time maggie had already lost once to tiffany this week that had been painful enough but lose to andrea she had never lost to her sister in her life with a low groan maggie picked up the pace punishing her exhausted muscles tiffany finished first maggie and andrea swam neck and neck maggie could hear andrea groaning in anger and frustration maggie let out a growl and stretched with every muscle for the wall her fingertips touched the wall then andrea touched maggie gasped loudly struggling to catch her breath she shook water from her ears listening as coach randall called off the top three finishers tiffany maggie andrea without turning her head maggie could feel andrea slump against the wall then coach randall blew her whistle again and ordered everyone to hit the showers it took maggie a few minutes to feel strong enough to drag herself out of the pool she was the last one out you looked like you were struggling out there coach randall told her frowning did i maggie asked be sure to get plenty of rest from now till friday the coach told her slapping her on the back sure thing get a lot of rest easy to say somehow maggie doubted that coach randall had nightmares about a girl getting stabbed or found a knife plunged into her pillow she trudged into the locker room and wearily dropped down onto the bench in front of her locker most of the team were already in the showers their shouts and laughter spilling out into the dressing area a locker door slammed maggie knew it was andrea hiding her feelings had never been one of andreas strengths beat you again tiffany called to maggie thats twice in a row youre slipping travers tiffany stood a few lockers down buttoning up her blouse maggie nodded yeah well she turned to andrea good race andrea was bent over struggling to untie a knot in her sneaker laces she heaved the sneaker down hard in frustration please just leave me alone she muttered fully dressed tiffany came over and sat down next to maggie shes being awfully friendly maggie thought she had never seen tiffany so happy before how do you think well do on friday tiffany asked well kill them maggie promised wouldnt that be awesome tiffany asked to win at allstate awesome maggie repeated without enthusiasm she caught the scowl on andreas face see you tiffany said climbing to her feet just three days to go she hoisted her gym bag onto her shoulder and started out through the pool exit maggie it was coach randall in the doorway of her office can i see you a second uhoh andrea whispered maggies in trouble grow up maggie told her sharply she draped a towel around herself hooking it tightly above her chest coach randall was sitting behind her desk when maggie came in the coach smiled warmly how are you feeling exhausted and excited at the same time maggie replied coach randall nodded your backstroke was looking better today a lot less sidetoside movement yeah it felt good maggie said what does she want maggie wondered since when does she like to chat so hows everything else the coach asked casually everything else you know coach randall replied life things at home boyfriends that kind of thing whoa thought maggie whats up with coach randall why is she asking me all this what was she supposed to do pour her heart out my father died my boyfriend has been ignoring me ever since i told him about my weird nightmare i found a knife in my pillow and i think my bed is haunted no that wouldnt sound too good everythings fine maggie said coach randall stared at her for a long time studying maggies eyes ive been a little worried about you lately maggie you havent been yourself im fine maggie insisted really i hope you and andrea have worked things out the coach said leaning over her cluttered desk yeah no problem maggie lied they talked for a little while longer finally coach randall repeated her instructions about getting plenty of rest and let her go as she left the office maggie passed the wideopen door to the pool and glanced in what was that oh she gasped not believing her eyes she started through the doorway then stopped she cried out in horror as she saw tiflany lying facedown on the floor bright red blood puddling around her on the tiles chapter tiffany maggie screamed tiffany didnt stir maggie bent over her and saw the bloodspotted knife and then the stab wound in tiffanys side oh oh ohh maggie uttered a shocked groan and picked up the knife just as coach randall came running in from the locker room and two other teachers pushed through the front doors to the pool maggie glanced up frozen in horror her hand was covered in warm sticky blood the knife fell from her hand the teachers their faces wide with horror were running toward her maggie jumped to her feet i didnt do it she cried really i didnt do it maggie lay on the living room sofa staring up at the ceiling no one really suspected you sweetie mrs travers said she sat by maggies feet why would they you had no reason to stab tiffany as if you would ever do such a thing even if you had a reason the police they asked so many questions maggie moaned they were just doing their jobs her mother replied but they never thought you stabbed tiffany im just glad shes going to be okay maggie said sighing her mother says shes in pain but shell be okay mrs travers said she chewed her bottom lip too bad tiffany didnt see who attacked her she told the doctors someone grabbed her from behind maggie felt something wet and warm slop against her hand she lowered her eyes to find gus licking her hand as it dangled off the sofa he panted up at her putting a paw up on her arm good dog she said stroking his head good sweet dog that was one of the great things about dogs they always loved you no matter what was going on andrea was in the kitchen talking to tiffany on the phone maggie could hear snatches of andreas end of the conversation important that you rest plenty of other meets thank goodness youre okay could have been so much worse well thought maggie at least tiffany is going to be okay but there was no way tiffany could swim friday first dawn then tiffany now there were only two swimmers left maggie and maggie sat up as andrea entered the room andrea had a pleased smile on her face she couldnt hide her happiness andrea was in the meet now maggie realized shed swim the twohundred im in tiffanys place tiffanys going to be fine andrea assured maggie and her mother as if that were what she was smiling about maggie thought bitterly thats wonderful andrea mrs travers said you see maggie everythings going to be okay she stood up id better start dinner how do hot dogs and baked beans sound mom must really be worried about me thought maggie the last time she let us eat hot dogs was the week after dads funeral maggie and andrea had done the cooking that week they made franks and beans every night until there were no franks left in the freezer you know what this means dont you mags andrea asked it means i go to allstate maggie nodded but she wasnt really paying attention she was distracted by a very disturbing thought tiffany was stabbed the girl in my dream was stabbed is there a connection crazy thoughts maggie told herself crazy thoughts but she couldnt force the idea away andrea began pacing in front of her her hands shoved deep into the front pockets of her denim cutoffs i cant believe it how many people will be there friday do you think im so nervous i know ill faint or puke or something has anyone ever puked in the pool during a meet tiffany was stabbed maggie murmured not really hearing her sister was the dream trying to warn me oh please dont start with that dream stuff again andrea begged youre just making yourself crazy maggie she started pacing again im better than tiffany anyway so i guess its lucky in a way what happened lucky andreas words broke into maggies troubled thoughts her mouth dropped open lucky that tiffany got stabbed i know it sounds awful andrea replied without any emotion but what am i supposed to do act depressed about making the team maggie jumped up she was so furious at andrea she could barely speak the way youre talking people might think you stabbed tiffany maggie sputtered andrea laughed scornfully what an idea she exclaimed what an idea please please help me maggie tossed on the bed back in the nightmare only the dream had changed the girl with the ashblond hair was no longer sleeping in the bed now the girl was running running for her life and maggie was running with her miranda maggie called to her miranda wait for me she followed miranda through a long dark tunnel the tunnel walls were wet and slimy the roof of the tunnel was low so that miranda and maggie had to bend their heads miranda kept slipping and falling over loose rocks on the floor every time she fell she hurried to her feet again and rushed forward maggie followed her she knew it was a dream but it was as real as life to her miranda miranda she called if only the girl in the dream could hear her the dark tunnel became narrower and narrower as if the rock walls were slowly closing in miranda kept running the tunnel twisted and turned maggie could see only the girls back her hair bobbing up and down as she ran let me see your face miranda please let me see your face but she didnt have to see mirandas face to know that she was desperate terrified all at once maggie realized why someone was pursuing miranda through the tunnel pursuing her with a knife closer closer the knife blade gleamed in the gray tunnel light maggie gasped as miranda slipped and fell once again maggie fell with her this time fell through an endless swirling pink haze below her the pink canopy came into view maggies heart froze she was heading for the canopy miranda was back in the bed now her head turned away so the tunnel was the beginning of the nightmare maggie realized all the other times i came into the dream in the middle the dream repeated as before but this time slowly very slowly the girl turned over and finally maggie saw her face a pretty face a terrified face and as maggie stared at the face she saw the hand of the attacker the dark figure moved forward to stab miranda then maggie woke up wide awake her eyes blinked open her heart thudding she took a deep breath then another im awake im okay i saw her face and now im awake maggie didnt have a chance to scream before the cold hand clamped tightly over her mouth this isnt the dream she realized this is happening now to me andrea was it andrea again no as the cold hand pressed down over her mouth maggie stared up into the darkness and saw miranda no it cant be maggie raised both hands to shove the hand away miranda glared down at her pale hair falling wildly over her forehead are you a ghost maggie managed to utter in a choked whisper miranda nodded you youre really a ghost miranda nodded again and raised the knife chapter the knife blade shone in the dim light from the window maggie squirmed desperately and rolled to the floor she landed hard pain shot up through her body miranda no she pleaded the ghost glared down at her dark eyes peering through tangles of hair that tumbled over her face the knife bright in her hand miranda please maggie mrs traverss worried voice rang out in the hall maggie heard her mothers footsteps rapidly approaching the ghost took a silent step back maggie are you okay mrs travers called maggie watched in dazed horror as miranda yanked open the bedroom window and disappeared maggie pulled herself up from the floor her body convulsed in a single shudder of terror the bedroom door flew open the light clicked on maggie mrs travers stopped seeing the dazed expression on maggies face mom the ghost maggie cried huh the ghost the girl in the dream she was here quick look she grabbed her mother and pulled her to the window look mom the girl mrs travers leaned out the open window the wind ruffled her nightgown a few seconds later she pulled back into the room theres no one out there maggie her expression was grim mom she was here in my room she floated out the window she she had a knife and mrs travers uttered a low cry moved forward quickly and wrapped maggie in her arms oh maggie she cried in a trembling voice dont worry ill get you help ill get you help right away dear well find a good doctor youll be okay i know you will now in your projects next week youre going to be growing your very own versions of stalactites and stalagmites mrs harrison told them she shone her flashlight up at the roof of the cave where the pointy formations hung straight down like daggers they look like icicles said carly pedersen her voice echoing in the cavern exactly right mrs harrison agreed and theyre formed the same way but much more slowly in fact the word stalactite comes from the greek word for dripping wednesday afternoon outside it was cold and dark and cloudy more like a winter day than a spring one and that was outside in the cave the temperature was at least ten degrees colder maggie wrapped her arms around herself why hadnt she brought a jacket as the rest of the kids had probably because she couldnt think sensibly all she could think about was that she had seen a dead girl a ghost and that the ghost had tried to stab her maggie searched for dawn in the crowd of students clustered around mrs harrison she found dawn staring at her and glowering now what have i done maggie asked herself what is dawns problem all right mrs harrison said as you can see there are three different tunnels leading back from the mouth of the cave dont worry they all connect up eventually but its a real maze back there so stick together okay lets split up into our groups of four find your way through and then well meet outside in half an hour groups of four maggie glanced around in a sudden panic when were the groups assigned must have been friday youre with us deena martinson told her oh thanks maggie said relieved this way deena called leading her into the blackness that was the back of the huge cavern maggie followed obediently up ahead another member of their group deenas friend jade smith was exclaiming wow the walls are so slimy maggie had to stoop to keep her head from brushing the rough wet ceiling of the tunnel the parks department had put in some lights to help guide the way and the rest of her group had flashlights another thing maggie had forgotten but even with flashlights it was still gloomy and getting colder and colder the farther back they went remind me never to become a geologist maggie murmured i hope there are no bats deena said finally the tunnel opened into a wider space maggie held back what was that fluttering sound bats are supposed to be good jade whispered has anyone told the bats deena replied look deena pointed a whole mess of tunnels leading off this one maggie slipped and almost fell she suddenly felt dizzy she leaned against the wall for a moment holding her head down until the feeling passed when she raised her eyes she saw that the cavern was empty her group had taken off without her hearing them up ahead she plunged into the mouth of the nearest tunnel she moved as fast as she could crouching low and picking her way over the loose rocks the tunnel kept branching off and she tried to follow the voices of her group but soon maggie realized that she was no longer hearing any voices up ahead and she couldnt hear any voices behind her either she stared into the darkness of the narrow tunnel okay maggie she told herself stay calm just follow the tunnel youll come out somewhere and oh she gasped as she thought she saw the tunnel walls begin to close in no just like in the dream miranda in the dark tunnel running running no no this isnt the dream the dream isnt coming true she assured herself take a deep breath then simply head back the way you came but which way was that shed lost her sense of direction which way which way which way she couldnt see a thing surrounded by heavy darkness then she heard footsteps behind her maggie took a few steps toward them then she stopped the footsteps kept coming this isnt the dream she told herself this isnt the dream the footsteps moved closer closer who who is it maggie called in a trembling voice chapter no answer maggie could hear shallow breathing the sound echoing off the narrow tunnel walls closer who is it she repeated her fear making her voice high and shrill still no answer the breathing grew louder the footsteps crunched over the rock floor closer closer choked with terror maggie spun away from the sounds and forced herself to start jogging over the pounding of her sneakers she could hear her pursuer begin to run too she couldnt deny it anymore she was being chased just like miranda just like in the dream ow maggie scraped her knee against something sticking out of the tunnel wall the pain raced through her body but she kept running then before she even realized it she was screaming for help the sound just ripped out of her she ran through the darkness the dream had become real her life had become the dream she didnt get far she tripped over a rock and went down hard she could hear the footsteps padding closer as she scrambled back to her feet her knees throbbed with pain she turned a corner and slammed into a wall her hand touched something wet and slimy and then she heard dry fluttering overhead like hundreds of tiny umbrellas opening all at once something brushed her face something furry she screamed help me somebody help me get me out out of here the tunnel vibrated with the sound of a thousand flapping wings the footsteps crunched closer screaming for help maggie ran into another cold wet wall a dead end im trapped she realized chapter maggie pressed her back up against the wall as if she could push her way through the rock the footsteps pounded closer overcome with terror she collapsed to her knees she listened hard too frightened to move any second she knew her attacker would appear and the knife would come down out of the darkness now or now but nothing happened breathing hard her side aching she climbed back to her feet the dream is real she thought again and my life is the dream then she heard the footsteps again very close she pressed back helplessly against the rock the footsteps stopped a flash of light the knife no a flashlight played over her face mags a boys voice unsteady muffled in the heavy wet air the flashlight burned into her eyes hey are you okay she felt a strong hand grab her arm pull her to her feet justin maggie why did you run he asked breathlessly still holding her arm i came searching for you i called your name i didnt hear i only heard your footsteps maggie said still trembling everyone is outside waiting at the bus he told her you were missing so i got lost she told him leaning against him yeah well everyones real worried about you justin said lets get out of here she held on to him as he led the way out of the tunnel maggie heard the flap of bats wings she held her breath and kept walking i i thought you were the killer she blurted out what killer from my dream she instantly regretted telling him she could feel his muscles tighten his expression hardened maggie i hope youre not starting up with that dream stuff again he murmured maggie stopped near one of the lights mounted in the slimy cavern wall the eerie glow of the naked bulb made justins normally handsome face look like a skull sorry maggie whispered they walked the rest of the way out of the cave in silence maggie strode quickly down the sidewalk she didnt really know why she was in such a hurry there was no reason to rush home one day had passed she hadnt seen the ghost again hadnt dreamed the dream but the fear was always with her there in the creepy old house there at night in the canopy bed she didnt want to talk to anyone see anyone maggie someone called behind her she picked up her pace pretending she hadnt heard hey mags slow down justin appeared at her side jogging to keep up slow down whats up why was he pretending everything was okay between them he hadnt said a word to her since the day before in the cave nothings up she muttered walking fast are you okay he asked you mean am i crazy she asked sharply he reacted as if he were stung he grabbed her shoulder and made her stop i saw you werent in school this morning so i was worried i had a doctors appointment maggie said a doctors appointment you sick sick in the head she muttered bitterly you saw a shrink she nodded dr brenda marsh was a softspoken fortyish psychiatrist whom mrs travers had seen a couple of times after her husband died mrs travers reported that she had been very helpful but as far as maggie and andrea could tell all she had done was tell their mother it was natural to feel depressed and given her a mild sedative to help her sleep maggie was surprised at how good it felt to talk to her brenda had an easy smile and kind eyes she didnt seem shocked by anything maggie said even when maggie said she thought the dead girl miranda was after her for revenge i know it sounds crazy maggie had blurted out near the end of the session but i think its because miranda died now she wants me to die too dreams can be very upsetting dr marsh said softly theyre also important clues to whats really bothering us i want you to come in again and talk to me next week all right maggie had nodded sure ill come back did this shrink figure out whats going on with you justin asked as they passed the corner a school hangout already filled with shadyside kids maggie shook her head she thinks the dreams are about something else something thats bothering me oh justin said maggie could tell the subject made justin very uncomfortable she knew it was coming between them am i ever going to see you again she demanded he didnt hesitate how about tomorrow night he grinned at her moving close first you win the twohundred then you and i celebrate first i have to win maggie said frowning youll win he told her i know it he put his arms around her waist and hugged her it felt great being in his arms again she rested her head against his shoulder for a moment she forgot her troubles for a moment it seemed as if nothing could harm her a very brief moment then gazing over justins shoulder something caught her eye standing across the street on the sidewalk in front of the hedge miranda miranda the ghost standing there watching them justin must have felt her body tense up because he let go of her maggie couldnt decide what to do she wanted to cry out to show justin that miranda really existed she wanted to run after miranda to grab her to hold on to her to show everyone she wasnt crazy but what would happen if she told justin one more crazy episode and justin would give up on her she stared at the ghost with the pale blond hair shimmering in the afternoon sunlight she had to tell justin she had to show him justin maggie cried look across the street its her its the ghost the girl from my dream look huh justin spun around following her gaze to the hedge across the street there was no one there chapter maggie cried out in frustration and darted across the street no sign of miranda she searched behind the hedge she ran halfway down the next block miranda had vanished vanished like a ghost maggie justin chased after her his features rigid later she called waving him away she didnt want to deal with him right then she couldnt she just couldnt she couldnt stand being with another person who thought she was crazy and no matter what justin said she knew hed be thinking it she wandered around the neighborhood near school her head down barely glancing up to check for traffic when she crossed streets every few blocks she would raise her head expecting to see the ghost but no miranda wandering aimlessly maggie didnt get home until after five as she walked into the living room andrea stepped out of the kitchen carrying a tray of sizzling french fries hey maggie she called casually andrea was wearing her shortshort khakis an orange tank top and gold hoop earrings maggies gold hoop earrings i hope you dont mind andrea said cheerfully tilting her head from side to side to make the earrings bounce i was feeling like dressing up a little maggie was in no mood to fight with her wheres mom she asked dully out back the averys invited us to a cookout great maggie muttered without enthusiasm dropping her backpack on the hall table she followed andrea into the backyard just beyond the hedge she saw a familiar orange cap mr avery was standing over his barbecue grill expertly flipping burgers with a metal spatula when he saw her he waved the spatula gus was on a long leash tied to one of the averys birch trees the dog started barking excitedly when he spotted maggie glass of iced tea in hand a floppy straw hat on her head mrs travers stood talking with mrs avery she draped an arm over maggie when maggie came up beside her mrs travers squeezed her shoulder your ears must have been burning her mother said with all the nice things mrs avery has been saying about you mrs avery beamed leave it to you mrs travers went on to introduce us to our new neighbors maggie has always been the friendly one in the family she told her neighbor i dont know where she gets it from it takes me so long to make friends she trailed off maggie could see from her eyes that she was thinking about their dad andrea and mr avery burst out laughing maggie watched them they looked as if they had already become fast friends dinners ready mr avery called handing a platter of burgers to andrea this is fine for me andrea joked as she hoisted the heavy platter but what will everyone else eat everyone laughed but maggie they found places around the wooden picnic table set up in the backyard and began to dig in mrs avery had set out a large pitcher of pink lemonade that looked inviting but it was too sour she had obviously forgotten the sugar andrea carried the conversation chattering away gaily about school the next days swim meet movies she wanted to see mrs travers kept trying to include maggie in the conversation but maggie answered all her questions with oneword answers even that was a struggle the only thing that kept her going was petting gus who had lodged himself under the table across her feet maggie youre awfully quiet tonight mrs avery said giving her a searching stare sorry maggie replied struggling to smile im just she couldnt think of a good excuse shes just worrying about how im going to beat her at the meet tomorrow andrea boasted reaching across the table to spear more fries no offense mr avery she said but these fries i made are incredible everyone laughed maggie had never seen andrea in such a good mood it was as if the unhappier maggie got the happier andrea became as if there were only enough happiness in the house for one of them maggies mother kept sneaking glances at her maggie knew what she was thinking that one appointment with dr marsh wasnt going to be enough mom thinks im crazy andrea thinks im crazy my boyfriend thinks im crazy the whole world cant be wrong maggie decided glumly maybe i am crazy she could barely listen to the conversation she kept picturing miranda standing so ghostlike staring at maggie and justin from the hedge and then vanishing into thin air she pictured the canopy bed the beautiful canopy bed that had held such horror for maggie such horror such horror and the answer did the bed hold the answer to what this was all about was there more to the dream maggie wondered if i finished the horrible dream if i saw the face of the attacker as well as mirandas face would it clear everything up for me im tired enough to go to sleep right now maggie decided i have to get to the end of the dream i have to put this nightmare behind me im going to get some more soda she lied getting up from the table everyone was staring at her her mom started to her feet with a worried look im just going to the refrigerator mom maggie said chill out she smiled at everyone but she smiled too hard which only made her feel like a lunatic then she bent down to whisper in her mothers ear ive got to go lie down im totally wiped out dr marsh said i should get some sleep cover for me okay she patted her moms arm and hurried away in the kitchen she took a long drink of milk straight from the carton milk always calmed her down even cold milk she took the stairs two at a time heading for her bedroom ill go to sleep ill dream she told herself and i wont wake up till i know the answer to this mystery i wont wake up until the dream is over and then maybe maybe the whole reallife nightmare will be over too eagerly maggie crossed the hall to her bedroom pushed open the door and saw that the canopy bed was gone chapter huh maggie gaped in shock gone vanished the bed was gone in its place stood an ordinary box spring and mattress on a metal frame made up with maggies pink sheets and white afghan still in the doorway to her bedroom she heard the back door slam footsteps up the front stairs andrea appeared in the hallway a smug expression on her face didnt mom tell you she asked dr marsh said she didnt think the bed was good for you the way you were always obsessing about it but i need it maggie cried feeling herself lose control she grabbed andreas shoulders where is it what did she do with it she knew the answer even as she asked the question she stormed past her sister into her room maggie was sure she would find the canopy bed in there but there was only andreas dumpy old bed with her raggedy old teddy bear lying on the pillow same as always where is it maggie shrieked wheres the bed what have you done with it i didnt touch your stupid bed andrea replied with a sneer mom had it moved to the attic she got one of those moving men over here and mr avery helped the attic maggie knew the house had one but shed never been up there she pushed past andrea hurrying out into the hall where is it she demanded andrea pointed up at the ceiling i think thats what youre looking for she said maggie stared up at the ceiling for the first time she saw there was a short rope dangling from a metal hook and a rectangular crack in the ceiling a trapdoor the stairs pull down andrea told her but dont even think about going up there mom will totally freak out i dont care what she does maggie snapped listen maggie andrea said mom sent me in to get you to come back mrs avery made chocolate pie because mom told her it was your favorite youve got to come back even if its just for a few minutes maggie leaned back against the wall with a sigh the bed would have to wait for her andrea tugged on her sisters hand come on maggie mom is worrying all the sugar mrs avery had left out of the lemonade had been added to the pie it was so sweet it made maggies teeth ache but she plastered on her best fake smile and made it through dessert settled in the new bed maggie fell asleep the moment she closed her eyes or that was the way it seemed anyway when she opened her eyes again the room was dark and silent she squinted at her clock radio as she watched the numbers flipped silently forward she lowered her feet to the floor everyone was asleep she was sure the coast was clear maggie could sneak up into the attic climb into the canopy bed and try to finish her dream who killed miranda who she asked herself tiptoeing to the bedroom door silently she crept out of her room and into the hall taking it one step at a time trying to keep the creaking floorboards to a minimum it wasnt until she reached the end of the hall that maggie realized her mistake even though she was tall there was no way she could reach the cord on the trapdoor she had to get a chair please dont anybody wake up she begged silently a few seconds later she set the chair down carefully and climbed up on it praying that gus wouldnt wake up and come sniffing around a couple of barks from gus and her mom and andrea would be up for sure the trapdoor was wide with a set of wooden stairs that slowly opened downward as she pulled even though she pulled it down one inch at a time the contraption creaked noisily maggie wiped the sweat from her forehead every few tugs she stopped to listen for sounds from her moms bedroom finally the attic stairs had reached the floor bending forward she started up them one step and one creak at a time she climbed up to a tiny space whose walls were the sloping eaves of the roof the rafters were low and she had to stoop the only window was tiny and covered with a thick layer of dust letting in dim moonlight but she could see it clearly the bed pushed against the far wall the canopy was pressed right up against the low ceiling maggies heart began to pound as she made her way over to it will i be able to sleep she wondered gazing at it in the tiny dark space will i be able to return to the dream will i be able to solve this frightening mystery once and for all maggie stopped a few feet from the bed and gasped when she saw that someone was sleeping in it chapter maggie moved closer on trembling legs the shadows deepened around the bed the canopy made it even darker but maggie recognized the sleeping girl at once miranda im staring at a ghost maggie realized she could hear mirandas shallow breathing maggie moved closer and reached out a hand im close enough to touch her im going to touch a ghost will i feel anything at all her hand touched mirandas shoulder maggie felt warmth beneath the thin tshirt hey miranda jerked up her eyes wide and angry she scrambled out of bed maggie let out a startled cry and stumbled back mirandas slender chest heaved as she breathed hard glaring through the darkness at maggie with wild angry eyes she took a step toward maggie maggie shrank back but there was nowhere to go her back was already pressed up against the low sloping wall are you really a ghost maggie choked out miranda didnt reply instead she bent down and picked up something from the floor beside the bed the knife the blade glinted in the pale moonlight from the dusty window just like in the dream maggie thought miranda raised the knife with a desperate groan maggie rushed forward she gripped the girls arm they struggled you youre real maggie cried youre not a ghost miranda pulled out of maggies grasp breathing hard she took a step back maggie frantically searched for an escape route but miranda was planted between maggie and the stairs there was nowhere to run i i dreamed about you miranda maggie cried the girls eyes widened in surprise i dreamed about you every night in this bed maggie continued someone stabbed you it was so horrible i the girl laughed a strange shrill mirthless laugh someone stabbed miranda she said poor miranda huh maggie gaped at her what are you saying youre not miranda the girl shook her head her long hair swayed around her face but in the dream maggie started miranda had to die the girl interrupted miranda was mean like you like me i i dont understand maggie stammered who killed miranda did you the girl nodded maybe she said softly her eyes burning into maggies maybe i had to kill miranda because miranda was mean but who are you maggie demanded gena the girl replied wasnt i in the dream i i dont know maggie told her she edged toward the attic stairs im mirandas sister the girl said angrily why wasnt i in the dream i dont know really maggie repeated swallowing hard her throat felt dry as attic dust i dont understand the dream gena i do the girl replied sharply miranda always said she had powers miranda made you have the dream miranda wanted to warn you about me miranda is so mean maggie edged a little closer to the steps and you killed her gena you stabbed your sister gena raised the knife i had to i told you miranda was mean like you but im not mean gena really maggie cried seeing the anger in the girls eyes you want to lock me up again dont you gena accused you want to lock me away in that gray hospital but you cant maggie you cant i got out once im not going back when maggie asked desperate to keep her talking when did you get out just before you moved here gena said i came back to my house but everyone was gone so i had to live up here in the attic gena nodded youve been living up here the whole time gena nodded again your house is empty all day long i had the place to myself i dont eat much so nobody missed the food i took out of the fridge and the way you all leave your keys laying around it was so easy to get one made i could come and go as i pleased suddenly she sprang forward without warning she grabbed maggie by the hair and pulled hard with surprising strength ow let go maggie cried out trying to break free but gena had caught her off balance maggie fell hard grasping maggies hair gena pulled her head back exposing maggies throat she raised the knife she held it high as they both heard rapid footsteps up the creaking attic stairs hey andreas startled face appeared in the open stairwell hi andrea gena said casually as if they were old friends im going to kill your sister for you now chapter gena tugged maggies hair hard until maggies head rested on the bed im ready andrea she announced andrea maggie cried in horror you you planned this with her andrea climbed into the room wait she said softly do you really hate me that much maggie shrieked wait andrea insisted louder moving toward them over the creaking floorboards who are you andrea cried to gena let go of her but im doing it for you andrea gena replied sounding hurt shes mean to you shes mean like miranda for me andrea cried what did you do for me i did everything for you gena replied softly maggie ive never seen her before andrea cried never youve got to believe me stop her maggie choked out staring up at the knife gena pulled harder on her hair bending her back on the bed the pain roared down maggies body paralyzing her stop her andrea dont let her kill me maggie pleaded i did everything for you andrea gena continued ignoring maggies terrified cries i hurt those two girls for you so you could be on the swim team you what andrea shrieked oh no maggie gasped shes the one who hurt dawn and tiffany i dont believe it and i pushed the knife into your sisters pillow andrea gena confessed proudly you know to give her a little scare to get her ready for tonight but i dont want you to kill her andrea wailed who are you what is going on how did you get into our house shut up andrea gena said softly she lowered her gaze to maggie its time she whispered its time for mean sisters to die with a desperate cry maggie reached up and grabbed genas hand the hand that gripped her hair ow gena cried out as maggie dug her fingernails into the girls wrist gena jerked her hand free releasing maggies hair she brought the knife down hard and fast maggie rolled out from under it the blade cut into the mattress an inch from maggies side maggie struggled to pull herself off the bed but gena dove on top of her knocking her back with such force that maggies head bashed into the headboard just like in the dream the thought flashed into maggies mind the nightmare its coming true they struggled on top of the mattress gena was too strong too determined she brought the knife down again maggie uttered a terrified moan as everything went black chapter everything went black but maggie realized she was still alive still struggling in the darkness the knife had missed her she squirmed free from genas grasp rolled off the bed and realized why everything had gone dark andrea had pulled the canopy down on top of them quick andrea urged maggie quick andrea held one end of the canopy and motioned frantically to maggie maggie didnt hesitate she grabbed the other end of the canopy and they lowered it over gena gena kicked and struggled trying to get free the hand holding the knife shot out andrea grabbed the wrist and pulled open the fingers the knife bounced onto the floor wrap her up maggie cried working together the two sisters began to wrap the squirming girl in the canopy what on earth mrs travers cried from the stairwell call the police hurry mom maggie called they heard her run to the phone to call the police gena was wrapped tightly in the canopy she stopped struggling and lay still on the bed i i hope you can explain this all to me andrea said holding gena down struggling to catch her breath i think i can maggie replied forcing a smile for the first time i think i can do you really think genas older sister made me dream that dream do you really think she was trying to warn me about gena maggie asked mrs travers sipped her coffee thats as good an explanation as any she replied thoughtfully maggie andrea and their mom were sitting around the kitchen table sipping coffee from white mugs the police had just left taking gena with them through the kitchen window they could see the red morning sun lifting itself over the trees old gus really protected us didnt he maggie said rolling her eyes hearing his name gus trotted in from the living room he rested his head on maggies thigh maggie patted his warm head what a good guard dog you are gussie yes youre a real killer thanks for telling us we had someone living with us in the house this whole time gus gazed up at her adoringly as if he were being given the highest praise maggie smiled at andrea you saved my life andrea shrugged hey it was the least i could do you can have the canopy bed now maggie offered grinning no thanks you have it andrea replied no really maggie insisted you have it no way andrea cried maybe well give it to gus mrs travers suggested he deserves some bad dreams could i have a water bed andrea asked their mother suddenly yeah you could practice your breaststroke in it maggie teased theres nothing wrong with my breaststroke andrea insisted sharply itll be good enough to beat you at the meet the swim meet maggie cried in alarm its today and weve been up all night what a nightmare andrea shrieked please maggie rested a hand on top of her sisters dont ever use that word in this house again nightmare nightmare nightmare andrea chanted sisters mrs travers muttered dryly shaking her head gus nodded his head as if he agreed totally good night all maggie said climbing up and starting to her room good night and sweet dreams
