chapter one two ships the race began in the summer of on june st in london a black ship the terra nova went down the river thames to the sea thousands of people stood by the river to watch it they were all excited and happy on the terra nova captain robert falcon scott smiled quietly it was a very important day for him he was a strong man not very tall in the blue clothes of a captain he was fortyone years old but he had a young face like a boy his eyes were dark and quiet one man on the ship titus oates smiled at scott what an exciting day captain he said look at those people i feel like an important man scott laughed you are important titus he said and youre going to be famous too we all are do you see this flag he looked at the big british flag at the back of the ship and smiled at oates that flag is coming with us he said in the antarctic im going to carry it under my clothes were going to be the first men at the south pole and that flag is going to be first too five days later on june th a man opened the door of his wooden house in norway he was a tall man with a long face he waited outside the house for a minute everything was very quiet he could see no houses only mountains trees and water it was nearly dark the sky was black over the mountains the man smiled and walked quickly away from the house down to the sea in the water a big wooden ship waited for him the man got onto the ship and talked and laughed quietly with his friends the ships name was fram and the man was roald amundsen the fram was the most beautiful ship on earth amundsen thought his friends were the best skiers on earth too one of them olav bjaaland smiled at him north pole here we come captain he said yes amundsen said his friends could not see his face in the dark fram is going to the arctic everyone on the fram was ready to go to the north pole to the arctic amundsen wanted to go there too but first he wanted to go south his friends didnt know that at midnight on june th the fram moved quietly away from amundsens house out to sea chapter two the race the fram went to an island in the south of norway it was a very little island with only one small wooden house two trees and nearly a hundred dogs look at that bjaaland said its an island of dogs there are dogs in the water near the trees on the house dogs everywhere two men came out of the house hassel lindstrem amundsen said its good to see you how many dogs do you have for me ninetynine roald said hassel the best ninetynine dogs from greenland and theyre very happy they dont work they just eat and play all day theyre having a wonderful summer here good good amundsen laughed but thats finished now hey bjaaland stop laughing come down here and help me lets get all these dogs onto the ship it was not easy the dogs were fat and strong and they didnt want to go on the ship but at last after three hours hard work all ninetynine were on the ship and the fram went out to sea again the men were not happy the weather was bad the dogs were dirty and some of the men were ill they began to ask questions why are we bringing dogs with us asked one man johansen were going thousands of kilometres south past cape horn and then north to alaska why not wait and get dogs in alaska dont ask me said his friend helmer hanssen i dont understand it the men talked for a long time then on september th amundsen called everyone to the back of the ship he stood quietly and looked at them behind him was a big map it was not a map of the arctic it was a map of antarctica bjaaland looked at helmer hanssen and laughed then amundsen began to speak boys he said i know you are unhappy you often ask me difficult questions and i dont answer well im going to answer all those questions now today we began to work for this journey two years ago then we wanted to be the first men at the north pole but last year peary an american found the north pole so america was first to the north pole not norway were going there but were too late i dont understand this bjaaland thought why is amundsen talking about the north pole with a map of antarctica behind him amundsen stopped for a minute and looked at all the men slowly no one said anything we have to go a long way south before we get to alaska he said very near antarctica you know and captain scott the englishman is going to the south pole this year he wants to put his british flag there an american flag at the north pole a british flag at the south pole bjaaland began to understand he started to smile and couldnt stop he was warm and excited well boys amundsen said slowly do we want the british to put their flag at the south pole first how fast can we travel we have a lot of dogs and some of the most wonderful skiers on earth bjaaland here is the best in norway so i have an idea boys lets go to the south pole and put the norwegian flag there before the british what do you say for a minute or two it was very quiet amundsen waited and the men watched him and thought then bjaaland laughed yes he said why not its a ski race isnt it and the english cant ski its a wonderful idea of course lets go chapter three the ponies on october th the terra nova arrived in wellington new zealand when scott came off the ship a newspaper man walked up to him captain scott captain scott can i talk to you please he said scott stopped and smiled yes of course he said what do you want to know are you going to win the man asked win scott asked win what win the race to the south pole of course the newspaper man said its a race between you and amundsen now look at this he gave a newspaper to scott scott looked at it it said frame races scott to south pole were going to win says amundsen scotts face went white give me that he said he took the newspaper and read it carefully the newspaper man watched him and waited well captain scott he said at last whos going to win this race tell me that scott looked at him angrily this is stupid he said its not a race i came here to learn about the antarctic im not interested in amundsen or in races then he walked back onto his ship with the newspaper in his hand later that day he talked to his men he gave them the newspaper and laughed it doesnt matter he said were in front of amundsen and we have more men and more money he has only eight men and a lot of dogs i know about dogs they dont work in the antarctic we have sixteen men and the new motor sledges they are much better and tomorrow the ponies are coming we need ponies motor sledges and good strong british men thats all forget about amundsen hes not important scott asked oates to look after the ponies but he did not let oates buy them when oates first saw the ponies in new zealand he was very unhappy most of the ponies were old and some of them were ill theyre beautiful ponies titus scott said they come from china theyre wonderful ponies oates looked at them angrily and said nothing then he asked where is their food captain here scott opened a door oates looked inside he thought for a minute we need more food than this captain scott these ponies are going to work in the coldest place on earth they need a lot of food more than this scott smiled quietly we cant take more food on this ship titus where can we put it but it doesnt matter old boy theyre very strong ponies you know the best ponies on earth later that night oates wrote a letter to his mother there are nineteen ponies on the terra nova now he wrote all the ponies are in a small room at the front of the ship we eat our food in the room under the ponies so our table is often wet and dirty scott makes a lot of mistakes i think and antarctica is a very dangerous place chapter four food depots the two ships terra nova and fram arrived in antarctica in january at the end of summer the englishmen and the norwegians wanted to stay on the ice all winter they wanted to be ready to go to the south pole at the beginning of the next antarctic summer the dogs pulled the norwegians sledges they ran quickly over the snow and pulled the big sledges from the ship onto the ice the men ran beside them on skis they put a big wooden house on the ice the house was full of food and skis and sledges they called it framheim outside the house the dogs lived in holes under the snow when the house was ready the men made their first journey south before the winter they wanted to take a lot of food south and leave it in depots for the long journey to the pole they needed a lot of food and they couldnt carry it all with them on february th five men three sledges eighteen dogs and half a tonne of food left framheim and went south it was easy the weather was warm for the antarctic between degree centigrade and degree centigrade the snow was good and the dogs and skis went fast they went fifty or sixty kilometres every day after four days they reached degree south and made the first depot amundsen made his depot very carefully it was very important to find it again next summer so he put a big black flag on top then he put ten flags to the east of the depoteach flag half a kilometer from the next and ten flags to the west so there were flags for five kilometres to the left of the depot and five kilometres to the right then they went back to framheim and took some more food south this time to degree south this time it was harder the temperature was sometimes degree centigrade and there were strong winds with a lot of snow the dogs and men were very tired and the tents and boots were bad at the second depot they put out sixty flags to help them find it again they came back to framheim on march rd it was nearly winter in the antarctic their ship fram was far away now near south america they were alone on the ice oates went with scott to make the first british depot they left cape evans on january th there were thirteen men eight ponies and twentysix dogs the dogs were faster than the ponies they ran quickly over the top of the snow but the ponies feet went through it every morning the ponies started first and the dogs started two hours later because they ran faster at night the dogs made warm holes under the snow but the ponies stood on top of the snow it was degree centigrade after fifteen days oates talked to scott there was a strong wind and the two mens faces were white with snow three of these ponies are ill captain oates said they cant go on dont be stupid oates scott answered theyre good strong animals the best ponies on earth not these three oates said theyre ill and unhappy and now they cant walk lets kill them and leave the meat here in the snow we can eat it or the dogs can of course not scott said angrily these ponies are our friends they work hard for us i dont kill my friends three days later two of the ponies were dead scotts men were slower than amundsens it took them twentyfour days to get to degree south they made a big depot there and put one large black flag on top of it then they went back to cape evans their camp was on an island in the ice and the sea ice moved sometimes there were holes in the ice and black sea water under it one day seven ponies went through the ice into the sea and died one motor sledge also went into the sea chapter five a long cold winter it was dark for four months outside the wooden house at framheim it was often degree centigrade the dogs lived in warm holes under the snow the men stayed in the house and worked in their rooms under the snow the skis and sledges came from the best shops in norway but bjaaland wasnt happy with them he changed a lot of things on the skis and sledges soon the sledges were stronger than before the skis were better and faster too all the norwegians worked hard they looked after their dogs and worked on their equipment the sledges skis tents every day they thought about their journey to the pole and talked about it and every day amundsen thought about scott one day in midwinter he talked to his men lets start early before scott amundsen said remember scott has more men than us and he has motor sledges too perhaps they can go faster than us bjaaland laughed oh no they cant go faster than me he said on snow nothing can go faster than a good man on skis we dont know amundsen said youre the best skier in norway but you get tired and dogs get tired too motor sledges dont get tired they can go all day and all night johansen laughed angrily thats stupid he said perhaps the motor sledges can go all night but the englishmen cant the english cant win roald they dont understand snow but we do and theyre too slow perhaps amundsen said but i want to win this race so were going to start early do you understand it was quiet and warm inside framheim bjaaland looked at amundsen and though about the long cold journey in front of him he thought about the dogs in their holes under the snow and listened to the wind over the house when roald he said quietly on august th the sun comes back on that day we start then but we cant johansen said he looked angry and unhappy thats too early we cant start then its dangerous and stupid amundsen looked at johansen coldly youre wrong johansen he said we want to win remember so we start on august th bjaaland listened to the winter wind outside in scotts camp at cape evans no one talked about amundsen and no one worked hard they had good food and they played football on the snow they wrote a newspaper the south polar times and read books no one learnt to ski no one worked on the motor sledges twice men went for long journeys across the snow they walked and pulled the sledges themselves oates stayed at cape evans and looked after his ponies over the window in cape evans scott put a map of antarctica with a pen he made a line from cape evans to the south pole and he put a little british flag at the pole under the map scott wrote the day for the start of their journey we start on november rd he wrote chapter six a bad start on august rd the norwegians sledges were ready they took them outside and the dogs pulled them across the ice the sun came up for a half an hour but it was too cold degree centigrade they could not travel in that weather they went back to framheim and waited they waited two weeks until september th then with the temperature at degree centigrade they started they ran happily across the snow to the south eight men seven sledges and eightysix dogs only lindstrem the cook stayed behind in framheim at first everything went well they went twentyeight kilometres on saturday and twenty eight kilometres on sunday it was easy then on monday the temperature went down to degree centigrade there was white fog in front of their faces they couldnt see anything but they travelled twentyeight kilometres that night in their tents they nearly died of cold next day they stopped and made snow houses inside the snow houses it was warm but everyone was unhappy i told you roald johansen said even september is too early we cant travel in this cold do you want us to die lets go back and wait for better weather amundsen was very angry he was angry with johansen but he was angry with himself too he knew johansen was right all right he said slowly we can go on to the depot at degree south leave the food there and then go back we cant do more than that it was thirtyseven kilometres to the depot the wind was in their faces all day two dogs died on the way at the depot they did not stop they put out the food and the flags turned round and went north at last the wind was behind them the dogs ran quickly and the men sat on the empty sledges they went faster and faster it was like a race amundsen was on wistings sledge and soon he wisting and hanssen were three or four kilometres in front soon they were alone they travelled seventyfive kilometres in nine hours and they reached framheim at four oclock that afternoon bjaaland arrived two hours later with two more men but the last two johansen and prestrud went more slowly their dogs were tired their feet were wet and cold they had no food and they were alone in the dark the temperature was degree centigrade they reached framheim at midnight next morning johansen was angry in front of everyone he said you were wrong roald september was too early i told you but you didnt listen and then you left us alone and we nearly died in the cold youre a bad captain im a better captain than you are amundsen was very angry but at first he said nothing because he knew that johansen was right then that evening he gave a letter to johansen it said you arent coming to the pole with me when i go south you can take some dogs and go east to king edward vii land you can go with prestrud and stubberud you can be the first men to go there but not to the south pole the norwegians stayed in framheim and waited they lay in bed listened to the wind outside and thought about scott and his motor sledges chapter seven motor sledges and mountains scott had two motor sledges now they were the first motor sledges in the antarctic the first on earth on october th the motor sledges started south from cape evans four men went with them but scott stayed at cape evans for another week oates was unhappy he wrote to his mother we had a very bad winter here i dont like scott we were here all winter but he didnt learn to ski or to drive dogs our equipment is bad and he doesnt think about other people im going to sleep in his tent on the journey but i dont want to on november st scott and oates and six more men left cape evans with eight sledges and eight ponies the ponies walked slowly because their feet went down into the snow it was hard work for them and they got tired very quickly they travelled thirteen or fourteen kilometres in a day behind the ponies came meares with one sledge and some dogs meares knew how to drive dogs every day meares started two hours after the ponies and arrived two hours before them after five days they found the motor sledges the norwegians began again on october th there were five men this time amundsen bjaaland wisting hassel and hanssen they had four sledges and fortyeight dogs there was a lot of wind and fog on the first day wistings sledge suddenly stopped and the back went down come on you dogs he said angrily pull pull at first nothing happened then slowly the sledge moved again wisting looked down over the side of the sledge under the snow there was a fifty metre hole did you see that amundsen said the ice wants to eat us men dogs sledges everything on the fourth day they reached the depot at degree south there was a bad snowstorm but they found the flags easily next day the men stayed in their tents and the dogs played in their holes under the snow they were all happy they had a lot of food they had good equipment and they were warm they could travel fast next morning the snowstorm stopped and the journey began again today everything is wonderful bjaaland wrote in his diary but where is scott in front of us or behind there was no one with the motor sledges they were broken scott looked at them angrily it doesnt matter he said teddy evans and his men are in front of us theyre good men theyre pulling their sledges themselves we can get to the pole on foot oates looked at meares oates and the ponies were tired but meares and his dogs were not the snow was home for them that night oates wrote three motor sledges at each ponies at each dogs at each well its not my money its scotts on november st one of the ponies died on november th the norwegians saw the mountains the mountains were very high some of the highest on earth bjaaland smiled there is good skiing up there roald he said but can dogs get up there too of course they can amundsen said come on they left hanssen with the dogs and skied a little way up the mountains it was difficult but the mountains were big and beautiful behind the mountains amundsen thought there was a high plateau of ice thats it amundsen said thats the road to the pole tomorrow we can bring the dogs and sledges up here but now lets have a ski race who can get back to camp first they laughed and skied happily down the white snow this is like home bjaaland thought but its bigger than norway and better in the next four days the dogs pulled the sledges eightyone kilometres and went up metres at last amundsen and bjaaland stood on the plateau behind the mountains they were tired happy men bjaaland looked back at the mountains can a motor sledge get up here he asked amundsen smiled no he said i dont think so and scott doesnt like dogs so his men are going to pull their sledges up these mountains themselves would you like to do that olav bjaaland didnt answer he smiled and skied happily away across the snow chapter eight across the plateau on november st the norwegians killed thirty dogs they were happy amundsen said and now theyre going to die quickly we need three sledges and eighteen dogs to go to the pole when the dogs were dead the other dogs ate them the men ate them too they were good friends bjaaland wrote in his diary and now they are good food two days later the dogs were fat then in a snowstorm they began the journey again after the snowstorm there was fog and in the fog they got lost on an ice river with hundreds of big holes in it they could see nothing and it was very dangerous in four days they moved nine kilometres but the ice is beautiful bjaaland wrote blue and green and white this is a wonderful place but i dont want to stay a long time after the ice there were strong winds and bad snowstorms they could see nothing in front of them but every day they travelled twentyfive or thirty kilometres then on december th the sun came out they were at degree south kilometres from the pole five more long days bjaaland wrote thats all now but where is scott for four days scotts men stayed in their tents near the mountains there is a bad snowstorm outside oates wrote its too cold for the ponies and our clothes and skis are bad too on december th oates killed the ponies they were tired and ill and they could not walk up to the plateau then meares and his dogs went back to cape evans we can pull the sledges ourselves scott said we can do it were all strong men there were two sledges and eight men they went twenty four kilometres a day on december st scott said to teddy evans and the men on the second sledge you cant ski well leave your skis here so they pulled their sledge twentyfour kilometres without skis next day scott went to teddy evanss tent you are ill teddy he said you cant come to the pole take two men and go back tomorrow teddy evans was very unhappy two men captain he said why not three because bowers is going to come with me scott said hes strong we need him but you have food on your sledge for four men not five evans said and bowers has no skis im the captain teddy scott said you do what i say take two men and leave bowers with me oates wrote to his mother i am going to the pole with scott i am pleased and i feel strong but in his diary he wrote my feet are very bad they are always wet now and they dont look good on january th scotts men left teddy evans and went on scott oates wilson and edgar evans had skis but bowers did not they were kilometres from the pole december th was a warm sunny day five norwegians skied over the beautiful white snow it was very quiet no one spoke they were excited and happy six more kilometres bjaaland thought is there a british flag i cant see a flag but look hassel said whats that over there bjaaland left his sledge and skied quickly away over the snow what is it he thought is it no its nothing he called theres nothing there nothing three kilometres two roald hanssen called to amundsen go in front of me please it helps my dogs thats not true bjaaland thought his dogs are running well today but hanssen wants amundsen to be first the first man at the south pole they skied on and on over the beautiful snow stop amundsen said he waited quietly for his men this is it he said bjaaland looked at him but theres nothing here he said amundsen smiled oh yes there is he said theres something very important here olav very very important whats that roald there with a norwegian flag on it us were here now isnt that important olav the four men stood on the snow and looked at him then slowly they all began to laugh chapter nine the end of the race the norwegians stayed two days at the pole they left a tent there with a norwegian flag on it inside the tent they left some food a letter for the king of norway and a letter for scott they left some more black flags near the pole and one twentyeight kilometres north then they skied away back to the north its a beautiful day bjaaland wrote the sun is warm the snow is good but the dogs run too quickly i cannot get in front of them they found their depots easily there were ten between the pole and framheim each depot had a lot of food they laughed and skied quickly down the mountains often they skied fifty kilometres a day on friday january th they came back to framheim it was four oclock in the morning inside the wooden house lindstrem the cook was asleep amundsen walked quietly to his bed good morning lindstrom he said is our coffee ready the black flags waited at the pole whats that captain bowers said over
