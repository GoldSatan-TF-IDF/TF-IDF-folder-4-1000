the phantoms of the fire clark ashton smith it was late summer and the georgetown road was deep with dust which had settled like a dun pall on the bordering chaparral and pines since he had walked all the way from auburn without securing a single lift the man who was trudging along the road with the broiling afternoon sun on his back was hardly less dusty than the trees he paused now and then to mop his face with a discoloured handkerchief or to peer rather wistfully at the occasional cars which passed him without offering to stop his clothing though not actually ragged was old and worn and had the indescribable shapelessness of clothing that has been slept in he was very thin stoopshouldered and discouragedlooking his general aspect was almost that of a professional tramp and the people of the countryside were suspicious of tramps well i guess ill have t walk all the way he said to himself whining a little even in his thoughts but it aint much further now gosh but things is hot an dry he looked about him at the familiar landscape of parched grass brushwood and yellow pines with an appraising eye wonder there aint been more fires there alluz is at this time o year the man was jonas mcgillicuddy and he was on his way home after a somewhat prolonged absence his return was unannounced and would prove as unexpected to his wife and three children as his departure had been tired of trying to extort a living from a small vineyard and pearorchard of rocky el dorado land and tired also of the perennial nagging of his frail sensitivenerved and sorely disappointed wife jonas had left abruptly three years before after a quarrel of more than customary bitterness and acerbity with his helpmate since then he had heard nothing from his family for the good and sufficient reason that he had not sought to communicate with them his various attempts to earn a livelihood had proved scarcely more successful than the fruitranching veature and he had drifted aimlessly and ineffectually from place to place from situation to situation a forlorn and increasingly desperate figure for a man of such shifting unstable temperament when all else had failed him and he had wearied of the hopeless struggle it was not unnatural to think of returning time had softened his memory of his wifes undependable temper of her shrewish outbursts but he had not forgotten her motherly ways when she was in a more tractable humour nor her excellent cooking now with empty pockets since his last money had sufficed merely to pay his trainfare to sacramento jonas was nearing the hills in which lay his forestsurrounded ranch beyond georgetown the country through which he tramped was sparsely peopled and there were great stretches of softly rolling hills and low valleys that had not known the touch of cultivation the ranches were often quite isolated beyond all in the hazy blue of the distance were the vague and spectral snows of the sierras gosh but one of matildas pear piesll taste good thought the wanderer his mouth began to water he was not reflective enough however to wonder just what his reception would be beyond an easy surmise that matilda might give him a terrific scolding for his absence but mebbe shell be mighty glad tsee me after all he consoled himself then he tried to picture his children the fiveyearold boy and the girlbabies of three and two respectively whom he had last seen guess theyll have forgotten they had a papa he mused the afternoon had been utterly still and airless with a sultry brooding in its silence now from the northeast along the road he was travelling there came a gust of wind and with it the unmistakable acrid odour of burnt grass and trees hell there has been a fire after all muttered jonas with an uneasy start he peered anxiously ahead but could see no smoke above the dun and greygreen hills guess its all out now anyway he came to the top of the low slope he was climbing and saw before him the burnt area which lay on both sides of the road and was of indeterminable extent the brown foliage of heatseared oaks and the black skeletons of bushes and pines were everywhere a few fallen logs and old stumps were still smoking a little as is their wont for days after the extinguishment of a forest fire lt was a scene of complete and irremediable desolation jonas hurried on with a sense of growing panic for he was now little more than a mile from his own property he thought of the yellow pines that stood so close and tall about his cabin the pines which he had wished to fell but had spared at the earnest solicitation of the natureloving matilda theyre so pretty jonas she had said pleadingly i just cant see them go hope the fire didnt get into them pines thought jonas now gosh but i wish id cut em down when i wuz plannin to it would have been a lot safer and id have had the money for the wood too the road was strewn in places with ashen leaves with the charcoal of fallen brands and several trees had crashed across it but had now been removed to permit the passage of traffic it was hotter than ever in this charred and blackened waste for the brief gust of wind had fallen the dust on jonas cheeks was runnelled with sweat which he no longer paused to wipe away irresponsible as he was a strange gravity had come over the wastrel and he felt an everdeepening premonition of calamity he came at last to the little byroad which turned off to his ranch from the georgetown highway here he found with a sinking heart the fire had also been and had left nothing but devastation in spite of his fatigue he almost ran with long shambling steps and rounding a turn in the byroad saw that the fire had stopped at the very verge of his own property the hillside orchard of stunted pear trees the straggling vines of mission and muscat grapes were quite as he remembered them and beyond in the grove of yellow pines he could see the wreathing smoke that arose from the chimney of his cabin panting heavily he paused with a sense of relief and thanksgiving as poignant as anything of which his dulled heart was capable the sun had almost touched the horizon as he climbed the winding road through the orchard and entered the grove above aisles of light perceptibly tinged with gold lay between the elongated shadows even to the sodden insensitive jonas the beauty of the woodland scene the magic of the sunset the high solemn darkgreen pines and the rich glow sifting among them on manzanitabushes and beds of brown needles were not without their charm he drew a long breath inhaling the clean balsams that the hot sun had drawn from the forest and feeling as he did so a vague pleasure now he could see his cabin a long fourroomed shack of plain unpainted boards and weatherdarkened shingles a woman in calico was standing in front of the steps two little girls were beside her and he wondered as to the whereabouts of the boy who had been a fragile youngster always ailing and fretful mebbe bill is sick agin mused jonas he was very glad to be home but he felt a little doubtful a trifle tremulous as to the greeting he would receive from matilda the woman looked up as he approached shading her eyes with her hand from the last rays of the sun which fell horizontally through the wood he could see her apron which was quite clean as always though worn and faded from many washings like her dress she did not seem to perceive him but was apparently staring with great intentness at something among the trees the children also stared and huddled closer to her clinging to the hem of her gown jonas tried to call out hello matilda but his throat was so dry and dusty that the words were no more than a hoarse whisper he started to clear his throat but the simple act was never finished for at that moment the whole scene before him the trees the cabin the woman and the children were lost in a roaring sheet of ruddy flame that seemed to come from all sides at once and blot out the entire world and the very sky as it towered fullgrown in what could have been no more than the fraction of a second a blast of intolerable heat fierce as the breath of a thousand furnaces blew in jonas face and swept him backwards like a hurricane the mighty roaring pounded in his ears like a sea and was mingled with human screams as he went down into pitchblack gulfs of unconsciousness it was day when jonas awoke but he was too confused for a few instants to realize that the light was slanting through the treetops from a different direction or that there was more of it than seemed normal in an evergreen forest when his wits returned sufficiently to permit the comprehension of the fact that it was morning he began to notice other things that were equally singular he found that he was lying on his back among burnt needles and above him towered the dark boles of fireswept trees with the pitiful stumps of their cauterized branches darkly indistinctly in a sort of dull astonishment he began to remember the events of the previous day his return at sunset to the cabin his glimpse of matilda and the two children and the allengulfing sheet of flame he looked instinctively at his clothes with the feeling that he must have been badly burnt but there was no trace of fire on his raiment and the black ashes about him were cold nor when he reared himself on his elbow and peered around was there the faintest thread of smoke to indicate a recent conflagration he arose and stepped towards the place where the cabin had stood it was a heap of ashes from which protruded the ends of charred beams my god muttered jonas he felt utterly dazed and his thoughts refused to align themselves failing to form any sort of intelligible order as jonas spoke a man arose from where he had been stooping behind the wreckage of the cabin furtively dropping some object which he held in his hands seeing jonas the man came forward hastily he was a gaunt individual in dirty overalls with the profile and the general air of a somewhat elderly and dilapidated buzzard jonas recognized him as samuel slocum one of his neighbours wal jonas mcgillicuddy so youve come back exclaimed this individual in raucous tones of unfeigned surprise yere a little too late though he went on without pausing to let jonas speak everythin burnt up clean four days ago but the cabin wuz here las night stammered jonas i came
