in the beginning was arnold bros the great de partment store it was the home of several thousand nomesas they called themselveswhod long ago given up life in the countryside and settled down under the floorboards of mankind not that they had anything to do with humans humans were big and slow and stupid nomes live fast to them ten years is like a cen tury since theyd been living in the store for more than eighty years theyd long ago forgotten that there were things like sun and rain and wind all there was was the storecreated by the legendary arnold bros as a proper place for nomes to live and then into the store from an outside the nomes didnt believe existed came masklin and his little tribe they knew what rain and wind were all right thats why theyd tried to get away from them with them they brought the thing for years they had thought of the thing as a sort of talisman or lucky charm only in the store near electric ity did it wake up and tell a few selected nomes things they hardly understood they learned that they had originally come from the stars in some sort of ship and that some where up in the sky that ship had been waiting for thousands of years to take them home and they learned that the store was going to be demolished in three weeks how masklin tricked bullied and persuaded the nomes into leaving the store by stealing one of its huge trucks is recounted in truckers they made it to an old quarry and for a little while things went well enough but when youre four inches high in a world full of giant people things never go very well for very long they found that humans were going to reopen the quarry at the same time they also found a scrap of newspaper that had a picture of richard arnold grandson of one of the brothers who founded ar nold bros the company that had owned the store was now a big international concern and grand son richard said the newspaperwas going to florida to watch the launch of its first commu nications satellite the thing admitted to masklin that if it could get into space it could call the ship he decided to take a few nomes and go to the airport and find some way of getting to florida to get the thing into the skywhich of course was ridiculous as well as impossible but he didnt know this so he tried to do it anyway so thinking that florida was five miles away and possibly a kind of orange juice anyway and that there were perhaps several hundred human beings in the world and not knowing where ex actly to go or what to do when they got there but determined to get there and do it anyway masklin and his companions set out the nomes that stayed behind fought the hu mans in diggers they defended their quarry as long as they could and fled on the cat the great yellow digging machine but this is masklins story the only time the nomes had seen the word florida be fore was on an old carton of orange juice when nomes get hold of an idea they dont let go without a struggle airports a place where people

click masklin slid cautiously down an old burger car ton hed been watching humans hundreds and hundreds of humans it was beginning to dawn on him that getting on a jet plane wasnt like stealing a truck angalo and gurder had nestled deep into the rubbish and were gloomily eating the remains of a cold greasy french fry this has come as a shock to all of us masklin thought i mean take gurder back in the store he was the abbot he believed that arnold bros made the store for nomes and he still thinks theres some sort of arnold bros somewhere watching over us because we were important and now were out here and all weve found is that nomes arent important at all wings and theres angalo he doesnt believe in ar nold bros but he likes to think arnold bros ex ists just so that he can go on not believing in him and theres me i never thought it would be this hard i thought jet planes were just trucks with more wings and less wheels theres more humans in this place than ive ever seen before how can we find grandson richard in a place like this i hope theyre going to save me some of that french fry angalo looked up seen him he said sarcastically masklin shrugged there are lots of humans with beards he said they all look the same to me i told you said angalo blind faith never works he glared at gurder he could have gone already said masklin he could have walked right past me so lets get back said angalo people will be missing us weve made the effort weve seen the airport weve nearly got stepped on dozens of times now lets get back to the real world what do you think gurder said masklin the abbot gave him a long despairing look i dont know he said i really dont know id hoped terry pratchett his voice trailed off he looked so downcast that even angalo patted him on the shoulder dont take it so hard he said you didnt re ally think some sort of grandson richard was going to swoop down out of the sky and carry us off to florida did you look weve given it a try it hasnt worked lets go home of course i didnt think that said gurder irri tably i just thought that maybe in some way thered be a way the world belongs to humans they built ev erything they run everything we might as well accept it said angalo masklin looked at the thing he knew it was listening even though it was just a small black cube it somehow always looked more alert when it was listening the trouble was it only spoke when it felt like it itd always give you just enough help and no more it seemed to be testing him the whole time somehow asking the thing for help was like admitting that youd run out of ideas but thing he said i know you can hear me be cause there must be loads of electricity in this building were at the airport we cant find grandson richard we dont know how to start looking please help us the thing stayed silent if you dont help us said masklin quietly well go back to the quarry and face the humans wings but that wont matter to you because well leave you here we really will and no nomes will ever find you again there will never be another chance well die out there will be no more nomes anywhere and it will be because of you and in years and years to come youll be all alone and useless and youll think perhaps i should have helped masklin when he asked me and then youll think if i had my time all over again i would have helped him well thing imagine all that has happened and youve magically got your wish help us its a machine snapped angalo you cant blackmail a machine one small red light lit up on the things black surface i know you can tell what other machines are thinking said masklin but can you tell what nomes are thinking read my mind thing if you dont think im serious you want nomes to act intelligently well i am acting intelligently im intelligent enough to know when i need help i need help now and you can help i know you can if you dont help us now well leave right now and forget you ever existed a second light came on very faintly masklin stood up and nodded to the other all right he said lets go the thing made a little electronic noise which terry pratchett was the machines equivalent of a nome clearing his throat how can i be of assistance it said angalo grinned at gurder masklin sat down again find grandson richard arnold he said this will take a long time said the thing oh a few lights moved on the things surface then it said have located a richard arnold aged he has just gone into the departure lounge for flight to miami florida that didnt take a very long time said mas klin it was three hundred microseconds said the thing thats long i dont think i understood all of it too mas klin added which parts didn t you understand nearly all of them said masklin all the bits after gone into someone with the right name is here and waiting in a special room to get on a big silver bird that flies in the sky to go to a place called florida said the thing what big silver bird said angalo it means jet plane its being sarcastic said masklin yeah how does it know all this stuff said angalo suspiciously this building is full of computers said the thing wings what like you the thing managed to look offended they are very very primitive it said but i can understand them if i think slowly enough their job is to know where humans are going thats more than most humans do said an galo can you find out how we can get to him said gurder his face alight hold on hold on said angalo quickly lets not rush into things here we came here to find him didnt we said gurder yes but what do we actually do well of course we we that is well we dont even know what a departure lounge is the thing said its a room where humans wait to get on an airplane said masklin gurder prodded angalo with an accusing fin ger youre frightened arent you he said youre frightened that if we see grandson richard itll mean there really is an arnold bros and youll have been wrong youre just like your father he could never stand being wrong either im frightened about you said angalo be cause youll see that grandson richard is just a human arnold bros was just a human too or terby pratchett two humans they just built the store for hu mans they didnt even know about nomes and you can leave my father out of this too the thing opened a small hatch on its top it did that sometimes when the hatches were shut you couldnt see where they were but whenever the thing was really interested in something it opened up and extended a small silver dish on a pole or a complicated arrangement of pipes this time it was a piece of wire mesh on a metal rod it started to turn slowly masklin picked it up while the other two argued he said quietly do you know where this lounge thing is yes said the thing lets go then angalo looked around hey what are you doing he said masklin ignored him he said to the thing and do you know how much time we have be fore he starts going to florida about half an hour nomes live ten times faster than humans theyre harder to see than a highspeed mouse thats one reason why most humans hardly ever see them the other is that humans are very good at not seeing things they know arent there and since sensible humans know that there are no such wings things as fourinchhigh people a nome who doesnt want to be seen probably wont be seen so no one noticed three tiny blurs darting across the floor of the airport building they dodged the rumbling wheels of luggage carts they shot between the legs of slowmoving hu mans they skidded around chairs they became nearly invisible as they crossed a huge echoing corridor and they disappeared behind a potted plant it has been said that everything everywhere af fects everything else this may be true or perhaps the world is just full of patterns for example in a tree nine thousand miles away from masklin high on a cloudy mountainside was a plant that looked like one large flower it grew wedged in a fork of trees its roots dangling in the air to trap what nourishment they could from the mists technically it was an epiphytic bromeliad although not knowing this made very little differ ence to the plant water condensed into a tiny pool in the center of the bloom and there were frogs living in it very very small frogs they had such a tiny life cycle it still had train ing wheels on it they hunted insects among the petals they laid their eggs in the central pool tadpoles grew terry pratchett up and became more frogs and they made more tadpoles and each eventually died and sank down and joined the compost at the base of the leaves which in fact helped nourish the plant and this had been the way things were for as far back as the frogs could remember except that on this day while it hunted for flies one frog lost its way and crawled around the side of one of the outermost petals or possibly leaves and saw something it had never seen before it saw the universe more precisely it saw the branch stretching away into the mists and several yards away glistening with drop lets of moisture in a solitary shaft of sunlight was another flower the frog sat and stared hngh hngh hngh gurder leaned against the wall and panted like a hot dog on a sunny day angalo was almost as badly out of breath but was going red in the face trying not to show it why didnt you tell us he demanded you were too busy arguing said masklin so i knew the only way to get you running was to start moving about three seconds frogs dont have good memories wings thank you very much gurder heaved why arent you puffed out said angalo im used to running fast said masklin peer ing around the plant okay thing now what along this corridor said the thing its full of humans squeaked gurder everywheres full of humans thats why were doing this said masklin he paused and then added look thing isnt there any other way we can go gurder nearly got squashed just now colored lights moved in complicated patterns across the thing then it said what is it you want to achieve we must find grandson richard panted gurder no going to the florida place is the impor tant thing said masklin it isnt said gurder i dont want to go to any florida masklin hesitated then he said this probably isnt the right time to say this but i havent been totally honest with you he told them about the thing and space and the ship in the sky around them there was the endless thundering noise of a building full of busy humans eventually gurder said youre not trying to find grandson richard at all terry pratchett i think hes probably very important said masklin hurriedly but youre right at florida theres a place where they have a sort of jet plane that goes straight up to put kind of bleeping radio things in the sky oh come on said angalo you cant just put things in the sky theyd fall down i dont really understand it myself masklin admitted but if you go up high enough there is no down i think anyway all we have to do is go to florida and put the thing on one of these go ingup jets and it can do the rest it says all said angalo it cant be harder than stealing a truck said masklin youre not suggesting we steal a plane said gurder by this time totally horrified wow said angalo his eyes lighting up as if by some internal power source he loved vehicles of all sortsespecially when they were traveling fast you would too wouldnt you said gurder accusingly wow said angalo again he seemed to be looking at a picture only he could see youre mad said gurder no one said anything about stealing a plane said masklin quickly we arent going to steal a plane were just going for a ride on one i hope wow wings and were not going to try to drive it angalo angalo shrugged all right he said but suppose im on it and the driver becomes ill then i expect ill have to take over i mean i drove the truck pretty well you kept running into things said gurder i was learning anyway theres nothing to run into in the sky except clouds and they look pretty soft said angalo theres the ground oh the ground wouldnt be a problem itd be too far away masklin tapped the thing do you know where the jet plane is thats going to florida yes lead us there then avoiding as many humans as you can and where does the orange juice come into all this said gurder im not too sure about the orange juice bit said masklin it was raining softly and because it was early evening lights were coming on around the air port absolutely no one heard the faint tinkle as a little ventilation grille dropped off an outside wall three blurred shapes lowered themselves down terry pratchett onto the concrete and sped away toward the planes angalo looked up and up some more and there was still more up to come he ended up with his head craned right back he was nearly in tears oh wow he kept saying its too big muttered gurder trying not to look like most of the nomes who had been born in the store he hated looking up and not seeing a ceiling angalo was the same but more than being outside he hated not going fast ive seen them go up in the sky said masklin they really do fly honestly wow it loomed over them so big that you had to keep on stepping back and back to see how big it was rain glistened on it the airport lights made smears of green and white bloom on its flanks it wasnt a thing it was a bit of shaped sky of course they look smaller when theyre a long way off masklin muttered he stared up at the plane hed never felt smaller in his life i want one moaned angalo clenching his fists look at it it looks as though its going too fast even when its standing still how do we get on it then said gurder wings cant you just see their faces back home if we turned up with this said angalo yes i can horribly clearly said gurder but how do we get on it we could angalo began he hesitated why did you have to ruin everything he snapped theres the holes where the wheels stick through said masklin i think we could climb up there wo said the thing which was tucked under masklins arm you would not be able to breathe you must be properly inside where the planes go the air is thin i should hope so said gurder stoutly thats why its air you would not be able to breathe said the thing patiently yes i would said gurder ive always been able to breathe you get more air close to the ground said an galo i read that in a book you gets lots of air low down and not much when you go up why not said gurder dunno its frightened of heights i guess masklin waded through the puddles on the con crete so that he could see down the far side of the aircraft some way away a couple of humans were using some sort of machines to load boxes into a hole in the side of the plane he walked back terry pratchett around the huge tires and squinted up at a long high tube that stretched from the building he pointed i think thats how humans are loaded onto it he said what through a pipe like water said an galo its better than standing out here getting wet anyway said gurder im soaked through al ready there are stairs and wires and things said masklin it shouldnt be too difficult to climb up there theres bound to be a gap we can slip in by he sniffed there always is he added when humans build things lets do it said angalo oh wow but youre not to try to steal it said masklin as they helped the slightly plump gurder lumber into a run its going where we want to go any way not where i want to go moaned gurder i want to go home and youre not to try to drive it theres not enough of us anyway i expect its a lot more complicated than a truck its ado you know what its called thing a concorde there said masklin its a concorde what ever that is and youve got to promise not to steal it two concorde it goes faster than a bullet and you get smoked salmon from a scientific encyclopedia for the enquiring young nome by angalo de haberdasheri squeezing through a gap in the humanswalking ontoplanes pipe wasnt as hard as coming to terms with what was on the other side the floor of the sheds in the quarry had been bare boards or stamped earth in the airport build ing it was squares of a sort of shiny stone but here gurder flung himself face down and buried his nose in it carpet he said almost in tears carpet i never thought id see you again oh get up said angalo embarrassed at the abbot acting like that in front of someone who however much of a friend he was hadnt been born a store nome terry pratchett wings gurder stood up awkwardly sorry he mum bled brushing himself off dont know what pos sessed me there it just took me back thats all real carpet havent seen real carpet for months he blew his nose noisily we had some beauti ful carpets in the store you know beautiful some of them had patterns on them masklin looked up the pipe it was like one of the stores corridors and was quite brightly lit lets move on he said its too exposed here where are all the humans thing they will be arriving shortly how does it knoisv gurder complained it listens to other machines said masklin there are also many computers on this plane said the thing well thats nice said masklin vaguely youll have someone to talk to then they are quite stupid said the thing and man aged to express disdain without actually having anything to express it with a few feet away the corritlor opened into a new space masklin could see a curtain and what looked like the edge of a chair all right angalo he said lead the way i know you want to it was two minutes later the three of them were sitting under a seat masklin had never really thought about the in sides of aircraft hed spent days up on the cliff behind the quarry watching them take off of course hed assumed there were humans inside humans got everywhere but hed never really thought about the insides if ever there was any thing that looked made up of outsides it was a plane but it had been too much for gurder he was in tears electric light he moaned and more carpets and big soft seats theyve even got antimacassars on them and there isnt any mud anywhere there are even signs there there said angalo helplessly patting him on the shoulder it was a good store i know he looked up at masklin youve got to admit its unsettling he said i was expecting well wires and pipes and ex citing levers and things not something like the arnold bros furnishings department we shouldnt stay here said masklin therell be humans all over the place pretty soon remember what the thing said they helped gurder up and trotted under the rows of seats with him between them but it wasnt like the store in one important way mas klin realized there werent many places to hide in the store there was always something to get behind or under or wriggle through he could already hear distant sounds in the terry pratchett end they found a gap behind a curtain in a part of the aircraft where there were no seats masklin crawled inside pushing the thing in front of him they werent distant sounds now they were very close he turned his head and saw a human foot a few inches away at the back of the gap there was a hole in the metal wall where some thick wires passed through it was just big enough for angalo and masklin and big enough for a terrified gurder with the two of them pulling on his arms there wasnt too much room but at least they couldnt be seen they couldnt see either they lay packed to gether in the gloom trying to make themselves comfortable on the wires after a while gurder said i feel a bit better now masklin nodded there were noises all around them from some where far below came a series of metallic clanks there was the mournful sound of human voices and then a jolt thing he whispered yes whats happening the plane is getting ready to become airborne oh do you know what that means no not really wings it is going to fly in the air borne means to be carried and air means air to be borne in the air airborne masklin could hear angalos breathing he settled himself as best he could between the metal wall and a thick bundle of wires and stared into the darkness the nomes didnt speak after a while there was a faint jerk and a sensation of movement nothing else happened it went on not happen ing eventually gurder his voice trembling with terror said is it too late to get off if we a sudden distant thundering noise finished the sentence for him a dull rumbling shook every thing around them very gently but very firmly then there was a heavy pause like the moment a ball must feel between the time its thrown up and the time it starts to come down and some thing picked up all three of them and slid them into a struggling heap the floor tried to become the wall the nomes hung on to one another stared into one anothers faces and screamed after a while they stopped there didnt seem much point in continuing besides they were out of breath the floor very gradually became a proper floor again and didnt show any further ambitions to become a wall terby pratchett masklin pushed angalos foot off his neck i think were flying he said is that what it was said angalo weakly it looks kind of more graceful when you see it from the ground is anyone hurt gurder pulled himself upright im all bruises he said he brushed himself down and then because there is no changing nomish nature he added is there any food around they hadnt thought about food masklin stared behind him into the tunnel of wires maybe we wont need any he said uncer tainly how long will it take to get to florida thing the captain has just said it will be many hours said the thing well starve to death said gurder maybe theres something to hunt said an galo hopefully i shouldnt think so masklin said this doesnt look a mouse kind of place the humansll have food said gurder hu mans always have food i knew you were going to say that said an galo an hour lasts nearly as long as half a day to a nome wings its just common sense i wonder if we can see out a window said angalo id like to see how fast were going all the trees and things whizzing past and so on look said masklin before things got out of hand lets just wait for a while eh everyone calm down have a bit of a rest then maybe we can look for some food they settled down again at least it was warm and dry back in the days when hed lived in a hole in a bank masklin had spent far too much time cold and wet to turn up his nose at a chance to sleep warm and dry he dozed airborne air born perhaps there were hundreds of nomes who lived in the airplanes in the same way that nomes had lived in the store perhaps they got on with their lives under the carpeted floor somewhere while they were whisked to all the places masklin had seen on the only map the nomes had ever found it had been in a pocket diary and the names of the faraway places written on it were like magicafrica australia china equator printed in hong kong iceland perhaps theyd never looked out the windows perhaps theyd never known that they were mov ing at all terry pratchett he wondered if this was what grimma had meant by all the stuff about the frogs in the flower shed read it in a book you could live your whole life in some tiny place and think it was the whole world the trouble was hed been angry he hadnt wanted to listen well he was out of the flower now and no mis take the frog had brought some other young frogs to its spot among the leaves at the edge of the world of the flower they stared at the branch there wasnt just one flower out there there were dozens although the frogs werent able to think like this because frogs cant count beyond one they saw lots of ones they stared at them staring is one of the few things frogs are good at thinking isnt it would be nice to say that the tiny frogs thought long and hard about the new flower about life in the old flower about the need to explore about the possibility that the world was bigger than a pool with petals around the edge in fact what they thought was mipmip mipmip mipmip but what they felt was too big for one flower to contain wings carefully slowly not at all certain why they plopped down onto the branch there was a polite beeping from the thing you may be interested to know it said that weve broken the sound barrier masklin turned wearily to the others all right own up he said who broke it dont look at me said angalo i didnt touch anything masklin crawled to the edge of the hole and peered out there were human feet out there female hu man feet by the look of it they usually were the ones with the less practical shoes you could learn a lot about humans by looking at their shoes it was about all a nome had to look at most of the time the rest of the human was normally little more than the wrong end of a pair of nostrils a long way up masklin sniffed theres food somewhere he said what kind said angalo never mind what kind said gurder pushing him out of the way whatever it is im going to eat it get back masklin snapped pushing the thing into angalos arms ill go angalo dont let him go he darted out ran for the curtain and slid be terry pratchett hind it after a few seconds he moved just enough to let one eye and a frowning eyebrow show the room was some sort of food place human females were taking trays of food out of the wall nomish sense of smell is sharper than a foxs it was all masklin could do not to dribble he had to admit itit was all very well hunting and grow ing things but what you got wasnt a patch on the food you found around humans one of the females put the last tray on a trolley and wheeled it past masklin the wheels were al most as tall as he was as it squeaked past he jumped out of his hiding place and leapt onto it squeezing himself among the bottles it was a stupid thing to do he knew it was just better than being stuck in a hole with a couple of idiots rows and rows of shoes some black some brown some with laces some without quite a few of them without feet in them because the hu mans had taken them off masklin looked up as the trolley inched for ward rows and rows of legs some in skirts but most in trousers masklin looked up farther nomes rarely saw humans sitting down rows and rows of bodies topped with rows and rows of heads with faces at the front rows and rows of wings masklin crouched back among the bottles grandson richard was watching him it was the face in the newspaper it had to be there was the little beard and the smiling mouth with lots of teeth in it and the hair that looked as though it had been dramatically carved out of something shiny rather than grown in the normal way grandson richard the face stared at him for a moment and then looked away he cant have seen me masklin told himself im hidden away here what will gurder say when i tell him hell go mad thats what i think ill keep it to myself for a while that might be an amazingly good idea weve got enough to worry about as it is thirtynine either thereve been thirtyeight other grandson richards and i dont think thats what it means or its a newspaper human way of saying hes thirtynine years old nearly half as old as the store and the store nomes say the store is as old as the world i know that cant be true but i wonder what it feels like to live nearly forever he burrowed farther into the things on the shelf mostly they were bottles but there were a few bags containing knobbly things a bit smaller terry pratchett than masklins fist he stabbed at the paper with his knife until hed cut a hole big enough and pulled one of them out it was a salted peanut well it was a start he grabbed the packet just as a hand reached past it was close enough to touch it was close enough to touch him he could see the red of its fingernails as they slid by him closed slowly over another packet of nuts and withdrew it dawned on masklin later that the givingout food female wouldnt have been able to see him she just reached down into the tray for what she knew would be there and this almost certainly didnt include masklin thats what he decided later at the time with a human hand almost brushing his head it all looked a lot different he took a running dive off the trolley rolled when he hit the carpet and scurried under the nearest seat he didnt even wait to catch his breath experi ence had taught him that it was when you stopped to catch your breath that things caught you he charged from seat to seat dodging giant feet dis carded shoes dropped newspapers and bags by the time he crossed the bit of aisle to the food place he was a blur even by nome standards he didnt stop even when he reached the hole he just wings leapt and went through it without touching the sides a peanut said angalo between three thats not a mouthful each what do you suggest said masklin bitterly do you want to go to the givingoutfood female and say theres three small hungry people down here angalo stared at him masklin had got his breath back now but was still very red in the face you know that could be worth a try he said what well if you were a human would you expect to see nomes on a plane said angalo of course i wouldnt i bet youd be amazed if you did see one eh are you suggesting we deliberately show our selves to a human gurder said suspiciously weve never done that you know i nearly did just now said masklin i wont do that again in a hurry weve always preferred to starve to death on one peanut you mean gurder looked longingly at the piece of nut in his hand theyd eaten peanuts in the store of course around christmas fayre when the food hall was crammed with food you didnt normally see in the other seasons they made a nice end to a terry pratchett meal probably they made a nice start to a meal too what they didnt make was a meal whats the plan he said wearily one of the givingoutfood humans was pulling trays off a shelf when a movement made it look up its head turned very slowly something small and black was being lowered down right by its ear it stuck tiny thumbs in small ears wagged its fingers and stuck out its tongue thrrrrrrrrp said gurder the tray in the humans hands crashed onto the floor in front of it it made a long drawnout noise that sounded like a highpitched foghorn and backed away raising its hands to its mouth fi nally it turned very slowly like a tree about to fall and fled between the curtains when it came back with another human being the little figure had gone so had most of the food i dont know when i last had smoked salmon said gurder happily mmmph said angalo youre not supposed to eat it like that said gurder severely youre not supposed to shove it all in your mouth and then cut off whatever wont fit whatever will people think wings sno people here said angalo indistinctly sjust you an masklin masklin cut the lid off a container of milk it was practically nomesized this is more like it eh said gurder proper food the natural way out of tins and things none of this having to clean the dirt off it like in the quarry and its nice and warm in here too its the only way to travel anyone want some of this he prodded a dish vaguely not sure of what was in itstuff the others shook their heads the dish con tained something shiny and wobbly and pink with a cherry on it and in some strange way it man aged to look like something you wouldnt eat even if it was pushed onto your plate after a weeks starvation diet what does it taste like said masklin after gurder had chewed a mouthful tastes like pink said gurder anyone fancy the peanut to finish with said angalo he grinned no ill chuck it away shall i no said masklin they looked at him sorry he said i mean you shouldnt its wrong to waste good food little dishes of strange wobbly stuff tasting like pink turn up in nearly every meal on all airplanes no one knows why theres probably some sort of special religious reason terry pratchett its wicked said gurder primly mmm dont know about wicked said mas klin never been very clear on wicked but its stupid put it in your pack you never know when you might need it angalo stretched his arms and yawned a wash would be nice he said didnt see any water masklin said theres probably a sink or a bathroom somewhere but i wouldnt know where to start looking talking of bathrooms said angalo right down the other end of the pipe please said gurder and keep away from any wiring volunteered the thing angalo nodded in a puzzled fashion and crawled away into the darkness gurder yawned and stretched his arms wont the givingoutfood humans look for us he said i dont think so said masklin back when we used to live outside im sure humans saw us some times i dont think they really believe their eyes they wouldnt make those weird garden orna ments if theyd ever seen a real nome gurder reached into his robe and pulled out the picture of grandson richard even in the dim light in the pipe masklin recognized it as the hu man in the seat he hadnt got creases on his face from being folded up and he wasnt made up of hundreds of tiny dots but apart from that wings do you think hes here somewhere said gurder wistfully could be could be said masklin feeling wretched but look gurder maybe angalo goes a bit too far but he could be right maybe grandson richard is just another human be ing you know probably humans did build the store just for humans your ancestors just moved in because well it was warm and dry and im not listening you know said gurder im not going to be told that were just things like rats and mice were special the thing is quite definite about us coming from somewhere else gurder said masklin meekly the abbot folded up the picture maybe we did maybe we didnt he said that doesnt mat ter angalo thinks it matters if its true dont see why theres more than one kind of truth gurder shrugged i might say youre just a lot of dust and juices and bones and hair and thats true and i might say youre something in side your head that goes away when you die thats true too ask the thing colored lights flickered across the things sur face masklin looked shocked ive never asked it that sort of question he said terry pratchett why not its the first question pd ask itll probably say something like does not compute or inoperative parameters thats what it says when it doesnt know and doesnt want to admit it thing the thing didnt reply its lights changed their pattern thing masklin repeated i am monitoring communications it often does that when its feeling bored said masklin to gurder it just sits there listening to invisible messages in the air pay attention thing this is important we want the lights moved a lot of them went red thing we the thing made the little clicking noise that was the equivalent of clearing its throat a nome has been seen in the pilots cabin listen thing we what j repeat a nome has been seen in the pilots cabin masklin looked around wildly angalo that is an extreme probability said the thing traveling humans large nomelike creatures many humans spend a lot of time traveling from place to place which is odd because there are usu ally too many humans at the place theyre going to anyway also see under animals intelligence evolu tion and custard from a scientific encyclopedia for the enquiring young nome by angalo de haberdasheri the sound of masklins and gurders voices ech oed up and down the pipe as they scrambled over the wires i thought he was taking too long you shouldnt have let him go off by himself you know what hes like about driving things j shouldnt have let him hes just got no sense ofwhich way now were been searching for ages angalo had said he thought the inside of a plane terry pratcuktt would be a mass of wires and pipes he was nearly right the nomes squeezed their way through a narrow cablehung wodd under the floor im too old for this there comes a time in a nomes life when he shouldnt crawl around the inside of terrible flying machines how many time ha e you done it once too often we are getting closer said the thing this is what comes of showing ourselves its a judgment declared gurder whose said masklin grimly helping him up what do you mean there has to be someone to make a judgment i meant just a judgment in general masklin stopped where to now thing the message told the gwingoutfood humans that a strange little creature was on the flight deck said the thing that is where are there are many com puters here theyre talking to you are they a little they are like children mostly they listen said the thing smugly they are not very intelli gent what are we going to do said gurder were going to masklin hesitated the word rescue was looking up somewhere in the sentence ahead it was a good dramatic word wings he longed to say it the trouble was that there was another simpler nastier word a little farther beyond it was how i dont think theyd try to hurt him he said hoping it was true maybe theyll put him some where we ought to find somewhere where we can see whats happening he looked helplessly at the wires and intricate bits of metal in front of them youd better let me lead then said gurder in a matteroffact voice why you might be very good at wideopen spaces said the abbot pushing past him but in the store we know all about getting around inside things he rubbed his hands together right he said and then grabbed a cable and slid through a gap masklin hadnt even noticed was there used to do this sort of thing when i was a boy he said we used to get up to all sorts of tricks yes said masklin down this way i think mind the wires oh yes up and down the elevator shafts in and out of the telephone switchboard i thought you always said kids spent far too much time running around and getting into mis chief these days tebky pratchett ah yes well thats juvenile delinquency said gurder sternly its quite different from our youthful high spirits lets try up here they crawled between two warm metal walls there was daylight ahead masklin and gurder lay down and pulled them selves forward there was an oddshaped room not a lot bigger than the cab of the truck itself like the cab it was really just a space where the human drivers fitted into the machinery there was a lot of that it covered the walls and ceiling lights and switches dials and levers masklin thought if dorcas were here wed never get him to leave angalos here somewhere and we want him to leave there were two humans kneeling on the floor one of the givingoutfood females was standing by them there was a lot of mooing and growling going on human talking muttered masklin i wish we could understand it very well said the thing stand by you can understand human noises certainly they re only nome noises slowed down what what you never told us that you never told us that before wings there are many billions of things i have not told you where would you like me to start you can start by telling me what theyre saying now said masklin please one of the humans has just said it must have been a mouse or something and the other one said you show me a mouse wearing clothes and ill admit it was a mouseand the givingoutfood female said it was no mouse i saw it blew a raspberry at me whats a raspberry the small red fruit of the plant rubus idaeus masklin turned to gurder did you me what fruit listen if thered been any fruit around id have eaten it i just went thrrrrrr rrp one of the humans has just said i looked around and there it was staring out the window thats angalo all right said gurder now the other kneelingdown human has said well whatever it is its behind this panel and it cant go any where its taking off a bit of the wall said masklin oh no its reaching inside the human mooed the human said it bit me the little devil bit me said the thing conversationally yep thats angalo said gurder his father was like that too a fighter in a tight corner but they dont know what theyve got said terry pratchett masklin urgently theyve seen him but he ran away theyre arguing about it they dont really believe in nomes if we can get him out before hes caught theyre bound to think it was a mouse or something i suppose we could get around there inside the walls said gurder but itd take too long masklin looked desperately around the cabin besides the three people trying to catch angalo there were two humans up at the front they must be the drivers he thought im right out of ideas he said can you think of anything thing there is practically no limit to what i can think of i mean is there anything you can do to help us rescue angalo yes youd better do it then yes a moment later they heard the low clanging of alarms lights began to flash the drivers shouted and leaned forward and started doing things to switches whats going on said masklin it is possible that the humans are startled that they are no longerlying this machine said the thing theyre not who is then the lights rippled smoothly across the thing lam wings one of the frogs fell off the branch and disap peared quietly into the leafy canopy far below since very small light animals can fall a long way without being hurt its quite likely that it sur vived in the forest world under the tree and had the second most interesting experience any tree frog has ever had the rest of them crawled onward they were going to have the most interesting experience any frog ever had anywhere one which would go down in frog history and be remembered for maybe even for minutes masklin helped gurder along another metal channel full of wires overhead they could hear human feet and the growling of humans in trou ble i dont think theyre very happy about it said gurder but they havent got time to look for some thing that was probably a mouse said masklin its not a mouse its angalo but afterward theyll think it was a mouse i dont think humans want to know things that dis turb them sound just like nomes to me said gurder masklin looked at the thing under his arm are you really driving the concorde he said yes i thought to drive things you had to turn terry pratchett wheels and change gears and things said mas klin that is all done by machines the humans press but tons and turn wheels just to tell machines what to do so what are you doing then said the thing am being in charge masklin listened to the muted thunder of the engines is that hard he said not in itself however the humans keep trying to interfere i think wed better find angalo quickly then said gurder come on they inched their way along another cable tun nel they ought to thank us for letting our thing do their job for them said gurder solemnly i dont think they see it like that exactly said masklin we are flying at a height of feet at miles per hour said the thing when they didnt comment it added thats very high and very fast thats good said masklin who realized that some sort of remark was expected very very fast the two nomes squeezed through the gap be tween a couple of metal plates faster than a bullet in fact amazing said masklin wings twice the speed of sound in this atmosphere the thing went on wow wonder if i can put it another way said the thing and it managed to sound slightly annoyed it could get from the store to the quarry in under fif teen seconds good job we didnt meet it coming the other way then said masklin oh stop teasing it said gurder it wants you to tell it its a good boything he corrected himself do not said the thing rather more quickly than usual i was merely pointing out that this is a very specialized machine and requires skillful control perhaps you shouldnt talk so much then said masklin the thing rippled its lights at him that was nasty said gurder well ive spent a year doing what the things told me and ive never had so much as a thank you said masklin how high are feet anyway ten miles twice as far as the distance from the store to the quarry gurder stopped up he said were that far he looked down at the floor oh he said now dont you start said masklin quickly terry pratchett weve got enough problems with angalo stop holding on to the wall like that gurder had gone white we must be as high as all those fluffy white cloud things he breathed wo said the thing thats some comfort then said gurder they re all a long way below us oh masklin grabbed the abbots arm angalo remember he said gurder nodded slowly and inched his way for ward holding on to things with his eyes closed we mustnt lose our heads said masklin even if we are up so high he looked down the metal below him was quite solid you needed to use imagination to see through it to the ground below the trouble was that he had a very good imagi nation ugh he said come on gurder give me your hand its right in front of you sorry didnt see it with my eyes shut they spent what seemed like ages cautiously moving up and down among the wiring until eventually gurder said its no good there isnt a hole big enough to get through hed have found it if there was wings then weve got to find a way into the cab and get him out that way said masklin with all those humans in there theyll be too busy to notice us right thing right there is a place so far up there is no down a little lower a white dart seared across the top of the sky outrunning the night overtaking the sun crossing in a few hours an ocean that was once the edge of the world masklin lowered himself carefully to the floor and crept forward the humans werent even looking in his direction i hope the thing really knows how to drive this plane he thought he sidled along toward the panels where with any luck angalo was hiding this wasnt right he hated being exposed like this of course it had probably been worse in the days when he used to have to hunt alone if any thing had caught him then he would never have known it hed have been a mouthful whereas no one knew what humans would do to a nome if they caught one he darted into the blessed shadows angalo he whispered terry pratchett after a while a voice from behind the wiring said who is it masklin straightened up how many guesses do you want he said in his normal voice angalo dropped down they chased me he said and one of them stuck its arm i know come on while theyre busy whats happening said angalo as they hur ried out into the light the thing is flying us how its got no arms it cant change gears or anything apparently its being bossy to the computers that do all that come on i looked out the window bubbled angalo theres sky all over the place dont remind me said masklin let me just have one more look angalo be gan listen gurders waiting for us and we dont want any more trouble but this is better than any truck there was a strangled kind of noise the nomes looked up one of the humans was watching them its mouth was open and it had an expression on its face of someone who is going to have a lot of diffi wings culty explaining what they have just seen espe cially to themselves the human was already getting to its feet angalo and masklin looked at one another run they shouted gurder was lurking suspiciously in a patch of shadow by the door when they came past arms and legs going like pistons he caught up the skirts of his robe and scurried after them whats happening whats happening theres a human after us dont leave me behind dont leave me be hind masklin was just ahead of the other two as they raced up the aisle between the rows of humans who paid no attention at all to three tiny blurs running between the seats we shouldnt have stood around looking masklin gasped we might never have a chance like that again panted angalo youre rightv the floor tilted slightly thing what are you doing creating a distraction dont everyone this way masklin darted between two seats around a pair of giant shoes and threw himself flat on the car terry pratchett pet the others hurled themselves down behind him two huge human feet were a few inches away from them masklin pulled the thing up close to his face let them have their airplane back he said was hoping to be allowed to land it said the thing even though its voice was always flat and expressionless masklin still thought that it sounded wistful do you know how to land one of these things said masklin i should like the opportunity to learn let them have it back right now there was a faint lurch and a change in the pat tern of the lights on the things surface masklin breathed out now will everyone act sensibly for five min utes he said sorry masklin said angalo he tried to look apologetic but it didnt work masklin recognized the wideeyed slightly mad smile of someone very nearly in their own personal heaven it was just that do you know its even blue below us its like theres no ground down there at all and if the thing tries any more flying lessons we might all find out if thats true said masklin gloomily so lets just sit down and be quiet shall we wings they sat in silence for a long time under the seat then gurder said that human there has got a hole in its sock what about it said angalo dunno really its just that you never think of humans as having holes in their socks where you get socks holes arent far behind said masklin theyre good socks though said angalo masklin stared at them they just looked like basic socks to him nomes in the store used them as sleeping bags how can you tell he said theyre histyle odorprufe said angalo guaranteed polysomething we used to sell them in the store they cost a lot more than other socks look you can see the label gurder sighed it was a good store he muttered and those shoes said angalo pointing to the great white shapes like beached boats a little way away see them crucial street drifters with real rubber soul very expensive never approved of them myself said gurder too flashy i preferred mens brown laced a nome can get a good nights sleep in one of those those drifter things are store shoes too are they said masklin carefully terry pratchett oh yes special range hmm masklin got up and walked over to a large leather bag half wedged under the seat the others watched him scramble up it and then pull himself up until he could very quickly glance over the armrest he slid back down well well he said in a mad cheerful voice thats a store bag isnt it he said gurder and angalo gave it a critical look never spent much time in travel accesso ries said angalo but now that you mention it it could be the special calfskin carryon bag for the discerning executive gurder added yes could be have you wondered how were going to get off said masklin same way as we got on said angalo who hadnt i think that could be difficult i think the hu mans might have other ideas said masklin i think in fact they might start looking for us even if they think were mice i wouldnt put up with mice on something like this if i were them you know what mice are like for widdling on wires could be dangerous when youre ten miles high a mouse going to the bathroom inside your computer so i think the humans will take it very seriously so we ought to get off when the humans do wings wed get stamped on said angalo i was thinking maybe we could sort of get in this bag sort of thing said masklin ridiculous said gurder masklin took a deep breath it belongs to grandson richard you see he said i checked he added watching the expressions on their faces i saw him before and hes in the seat up there grandson richard he went on hes up there right now reading a paper up there him gurder had gone red he prodded masklin with a finger do you expect me to believe he said that richard arnold the grandson of arnold bros has boles in his socks thatd make them holy socks said angalo sorry sorry just trying to lighten the mood a bit you dont have to glare at me like that climb up and see for yourself said masklin ill help you only be careful they hoisted gurder up he came down quietly well said angalo its got r a in gold letters on the bag too said masklin he made frantic signs to angalo gurder was looking as though he had seen a ghost yes you can get that said angalo hurriedly gold monogram at only five ninetynine ex tra it used to say on the sign terry pratchett speak to us gurder said masklin dont just sit there looking like that this is a very solemn moment for me said gurder i thought i could cut through some of the stitching and we could get in at the bottom said masklin i am not worthy said gurder probably not said angalo cheerfully but we wont tell anyone and grandson richard will be helping us you see said masklin hoping that gurder was in a state to take all this in he wont know it but hell be helping us so itll all be right probably its meant not meant by anyone he told himself conscien tiously just meant in general gurder considered this well all right he said but no cutting the bag we can get in through the zipper all right they did it stuck a bit halfway since zippers always do but it didnt take long to get an opening big enough for the nomes to climb down inside what shall we do if he looks in said angalo nothing said masklin just smile i sup pose the tree frogs were far out on the branch now what had looked like a smooth expanse of gray green wood was close up a maze of rough bark wings roots and clumps of moss it was unbearably frightening for frogs who had spent their lives in a world with petals around it but they crawled onward they didnt know the meaning of the word retreat if it came to that they didnt know the meaning of the word bromeliad or frog or any other word hotels a place where traveling humans are parked at night other humans bring them food includ ing the famous bacon lettuce and tomato sandwich there are beds and towels and special things that rain on humans to get them clean from a scientific encyclopediaor the enquiring young nome by angalo de haberdasheri blackness its very dark in here masklin yes and i cant get comfortable well youll have to make the best of it a hairbrush ive just sat down on a hair brush we will be landing shortly good and theres a tube of something im hungry isnt there anything to eat ive still got that peanut wings where where now youve made me drop it gurder yes what are you doing are you cutting some thing hes cutting a hole in his sock silence well what of it i can if i want to its my sock more silence i shall just feel better for doing it still more silence its just a human gurder theres nothing spe cial about it were in its bag arent we yes but you said yourself that arnold bros is something in our heads didnt you yes well then this just makes me feel better thats all sub ject closed were about to land how will we know when am sure i could have done it better eventually is this the florida place angalo get your foot out of my face yes this country traditionally welcomes immi grants is that what we are terry pratchett technically you are en route to another destination which the stars oh thing yes is there any record of nomes being here be fore what do you mean were the nomes yes but there may have been others were all that there is arent we tiny colored lights flickered in the darkness of the bag thing masklin repeated am searching available data conclusion no reli able sighting of nomes all recorded immigrants have been in excess of four inches high oh i just wondered i wondered if we were all that there was you heard the thing no reliable sightings it said no one saw us until today thing do you know what happens next we will pass through immigration and customs are you now or have you ever been a member of a subver sive organization silence what us why are you asking us that it is the sort of question that gets asked i am moni toring communications oh well i dont think we have have we wings no no no i didnt think we were what does subver sive mean the question seeks to establish whether you ve come here to overthrow the government of the united states i dont think we want to do that do we no no no we dont they dont have to worry about us very clever idea though what is asking the questions when people arrive if anyone was coming here to do some subversive overthrowing everyoned be down on him like a pound of bricks as soon as he answered yes its a sneaky trick isnt it said angalo in an admiring tone of voice no we dont want to do any overthrowing said masklin to the thing we just want to steal one of their goingstraightup jets what are they called again space shuttles right and then well be off we dont want to cause any trouble the bag bumped around and was put down there was a tiny sawing noise totally unheard terry pratchett amid the noise of the airport a very small hole appeared in the leather an eye appeared whats he doing said gurder stop pushing said masklin i cant concen trate now it looks like were in a line of humans weve been waiting for ages said angalo i expect everyones being asked if theyre going to do any overthrowing said gurder wisely i hardly like to bring this up said angalo but how are we going to find this shuttle well sort that out when the time comes said masklin uncertainly the times come said angalo hasnt it masklin shrugged helplessly you didnt think wed arrive in this florida place and thered be signs up saying this way to space did you said angalo sarcastically masklin hoped his thoughts didnt show up on his face of course not he said well what do we do next angalo insisted we we we ask the thing said masklin he looked relieved thats what well do thing yes masklin shrugged what do we do next now that said angalo is what i call plan ning the bag shifted grandson richard was moving up the line thing i said what do we do wings nothing how can we do nothing by performing an absence of activity what good is that the paper said richard arnold was going to florida for the launch of the communications satellite therefore he is going to the place where the satellite is now ergo we will go with him whos ergo said gurder looking around the thing flickered its lights at him it means therefore it said masklin looked doubtful do you think hell take this bag with him uncertain there wasnt a lot in the bag masklin had to admit it contained mainly socks papers a few odds and ends like hairbrushes and a book called the spy with no trousers this last item had caused them some concern when the bag had been un zipped just after the plane landed but grandson richard had thrust it in among the papers without glancing inside now that there was a lit tle light to see by angalo was trying to read it occasionally hed mutter under his breath it seems to me masklin said eventually that grandson richard isnt going to go straight off to watch the satellite fly away im sure hell go somewhere and sleep first do you know when this shuttle jet flies thing uncertain i can talk to other computers only when terry pratchett they are within my range the computers here know only about airport matters hes going to have to go to sleep soon any way said masklin humans sleep through most of the night i think thats when wed better leave the bag and then we can talk to him said gurder the others stared at him well thats why we came isnt it said the abbot originally to ask him to save the quarry hes a human snapped angalo even you must realize that by now hes not going to help us why should he help us hes just a human whose ancestors built a store why do you go on believing hes some sort of great big nome in the sky because i havent got anything else to believe in shouted gurder and if you dont believe in grandson richard why are you in his bag thats just a coincidence you always say that you always say its just a coincidence the bag moved so they lost their balance again and fell over were moving said masklin still peering out the hole and almost glad of anything that would stop the argument were walking across the floor theres a lot of humans out there a lot of humans wings there always are sighed gurder some of them are holding up signs with names on them thats just like humans gurder added the nomes were used to humans with signs some of the humans in the store used to wear their names all the time humans had strange long names like mrs j e williams supervisor and hello my name is tracey no one knew why hu mans had to wear their names perhaps theyd for get them otherwise hang on said masklin this cant be right one of them is holding up a sign saying richard arnold were walking toward it were talking to it the deep muffled rumble of the human voice rolled above the nomes like thunder hoomvoomboom foomhoomzoomboom hoomzoomboomfoom boom can you understand it thing said masklin yes the one with the sign is here to take our human to a hotel its a place where humans sleep and are fed all the rest of it is just the things humans say to each other to make sure that they re still alive what do you mean said masklin they say things like how are you and have a nice day and what do you think of this weather then what these sounds mean is i am alive and so are you terry pratchett yes but nomes say the same sorts of things thing its called getting along with people you might find it worth a try the bag swung sideways and hit something the nomes clung desperately to the insides an galo clung with one hand he was trying to keep his place in the book im getting hungry again said gurder isnt there anything to eat in this bag theres some toothpaste ill give the toothpaste a miss thanks now there was a rumbling noise angalo looked up i know that sound he said infernal com bustion engine were in a vehicle again said gurder well get out as soon as we can said masklin what kind of truck is it thing said gurder it is a helicopter its certainly noisy said gurder who had never come across the word it is a plane without wings said angalo who had gurder gave this a few moments careful and terrified thought thing he said slowly yes what keeps it up in the gurder began science oh well science good thats all right then wings the noise went on for a long time after a while it became part of the nomes world so that when it stopped the silence came as a shock they lay in the bottom of the bag too discour aged even to talk they felt the bag being carried put down picked up carried again put down picked up one more time and then thrown onto something soft and then there was blessed stillness eventually gurders voice said all right what flavor toothpaste masklin found the thing among the heap of pa per clips dust and screwed up bits of paper at the bottom of the bag any idea where we are thing he said room cocoa beach new horizons hotel said the thing i am monitoring communications gurder pushed past masklin ive got to get out he said i cant stand it in here anymore give me a leg up angalo i reckon i can just reach the top of the bag there was the long drawnout rumble of the zipper light flooded in as the bag was opened the nomes dived for whatever cover was avail able masklin watched a hand taller than he was reached down close around the smaller bag with the toothpaste and flannel in it and pull it out the nomes didnt move terby pratchett after a while there came the distant sound of rushing water the nomes still didnt move boomboom foom zoomboomboom choom zoom hoooom the human noise rose above the gushing it ech oed even more than normal it sounds like its singing whis pered angalo hoom hoomboomboom boom zoomhoom boom hoooooooooommm boom whats happening thing masklin hissed he has gone into a room to have water showering on himself said the thing what does it want to do that for assume he wants to keep clean so is it safe to get out of the bag now safe is a relative word what what like uncle you mean mean that nothing is totally safe but i suggest that the human will be wetting himself for some time yeah theres a lot of human to clean said angalo come on lets do it the bag was lying on a bed it was easy enough to climb down the covers onto the floor hoomhoom boooooom boom what do we do now said angalo after weve eaten that is said gurder firmly masklin trotted across the thick carpet there was a tall glass door in the nearest wall it was wings slightly open letting in a warm breeze and the sounds of the night a human would have heard the click and buzz of crickets and other small mysterious creatures whose role in life is to sit in bushes all night and make noises that are a lot bigger than they are but nomes hear sounds slowed down and stretched out and deeper like a record player on the wrong speed the dark was full of the thud and growl of the wilderness gurder joined masklin and squinted anxiously into the blackness could you go out there and see if there is some thing to eat he said ive a horrible feeling said masklin that if i go out there now there will be something to eat and itll be me behind them the human voice sang on boomhoomhoombooooooommm womp whats the human singing about thing said masklin it is a little difficult to follow however it appears that the singer wishes it to be known that be did some thing bis way did what insufficient data at this point but whatever it was be did it at a each step on lifes highway and b not in a shy way there was a knock at the door the singing stopped so did the gushing of the water the nomes ran for the shadows sounds a bit dangerous angalo whispered walking along highways i mean each step along lifes sidewalk would be safer grandson richard came out of the shower room with a towel around his waist he opened the door another human with all his clothes on came in with a tray there was a brief exchange of hoots and the clothed human put down the tray and went out again grandson richard disap peared into the shower room again bubbuh hubhub boom hooooomm food gurder whispered i can smell it theres food on that tray a bacon lettuce and tomato sandwich with cole slaw said the thing and coffee and orange juice how did you know said all three nomes in unison he ordered it when be checked in coleslaw moaned gurder ecstatically ba con coffee and orange juice said angalo hah masklin stared upward the tray had been left on the edge of a table there was a lamp near it masklin had lived in the store long enough to know that where there was a lamp there was a wire hed never found a wire he couldnt climb regular meals that was the problem hed wings never been used to them when hed lived out side hed got accustomed to going for days with out food and then when food did turn up eating until he was greasy to the eyebrows but the store nomes expected something to eat several times an hour the store nomes ate all the time they only had to miss half a dozen meals and they started to complain i think i could get up there he said yes yes said gurder but is it all right to eat grandson richards sandwich masklin added gurder opened his eyes he blinked thats an important theological point he muttered but im too hungry to think about it so lets eat it first and then if it turns out to be wrong to eat it i promise to be very sorry boomboom whop whop foom boom the human says that the end is now near and he is facing a curtain the thing translated this may be a shower curtain masklin pulled himself up the wire and onto the table feeling very exposed it was obvious that the floridians had a differ ent idea about sandwiches sandwiches had been sold back in the stores food hall the word meant something thin between two slices of damp bread floridian sandwiches on the other hand filled up an entire tray and if there was any bread it was lurking deep in a jungle of cress and lettuce terry pratchett he looked down hurry up said angalo the waters stopped again boomboom hoom whop boom whop masklin pushed aside a drift of green stuff grabbed the sandwich hauled it to the edge of the tray and pushed it down onto the floor foom boom boom hoooooooooooommmmm whop the shower room door opened come on come o angalo yelled grandson richard came out he took a few steps and stopped he looked at masklin masklin looked at him there are times when time itself pauses masklin realized that he was standing at one of those points where history takes a deep breath and decides what to do next i can stay here he thought i can use the thing to translate and i can try to explain everything to him i can tell him how important it is for us to have a home of our own i can ask him if he can do something to help the nomes in the quarry i can tell him how the store nomes thought that his grandfather created the world hell probably en joy knowing that he looks friendly for a human he might help us or hell trap us somehow and call other hu mans and theyll all start milling around and moo wings ing and well be put in a cage or something and prodded itll be just like the concorde drivers they probably didnt want to hurt us they just didnt understand what we were and we havent got time to let them find out its their world not ours its too risky no i never realized it before but weve got to do it our way grandson richard slowly reached out a hand and said whoomp masklin took a running jump nomes can fall quite a long way without being hurt and in any case a bacon lettuce and tomato sandwich broke his fall there was a blur of activity and the sandwich rose on three pairs of legs it raced across the floor leaking mayonnaise grandson richard threw a towel at it he missed the sandwich leapt over the doorway and van ished into the chirping velvety dangerous night there were other dangers besides falling off the branch one of the frogs was eaten by a lizard several others turned back as soon as they were out of the shade of their bromeliad because as they pointed out mipmip mipmip the frog in the lead looked back at his dwin dling group there was one and one and one and one and one which added terry pratchett up toit wrinkled its forehead in the effort of cal culationyes one some of the one were getting frightened the leading frog realized that if they were ever going to get to the new flower and survive there thered need to be a lot more than one frog they need at least one or possibly even one he gave them a croak of encouragement mipmip he said florida a place where alligators long necked turtles and space shuttles may be found a place that is warm and wet and there are geese only foolish people think it is really an orange drink bacon lettuce and tomato sandwiches may be found here also a lot more interesting than many other places the shape when seen from the air is like a bit stuck on a bigger bit from a scientific encyclopedia for the enquiring young nome by angalo de haberdasheri let the eye of your imagination be a camera this is the globe of the world a glittering blue and white ball like the ornament on some unimag inable christmas tree find a continent focus this is a continent a jigsaw of yellows greens and browns find a place focus this is a bit of the continent sticking out into the warmer sea to the southeast most of its inhab itants call it florida actually they dont most of its inhabitants dont call it anything they dont even know it exists most of them have six legs and buzz a lot of them have eight legs and spend a lot of time in webs waiting for sixlegged inhabitants to arrive for lunch many of the rest have four legs and bark or moo or even lie in swamps pretending to be logs in fact only a tiny proportion of the in habitants of florida have two legs and even most of them dont call it florida they just go tweet and fly around a lot mathematically an almost insignificant number of living things in florida call it florida but theyre the ones who matter at least in their opinion and their opinion is the one that matters in their opinion find a highway focus traffic swish ing quietly through the soft warm rain focus high weeds on the bank focus grass moving in a way that isnt quite like grass mov ing in the wind focus a pair of tiny eyes focus focus focus click masklin crept back through the grass to the nomes camp if thats what you could call a tiny dry space under a scrap of thrownaway plastic it had been hours since theyd run away from grandson richard as gurder kept on putting it the sun was rising behind the rain clouds theyd crossed a highway while there was no traffic theyd blundered around in damp under growth scurrying away from every chirp and mysterious croak and finally theyd found the plastic and theyd slept masklin stayed on guard for a while but he wasnt certain what he was guarding against there was a positive side the thing had been listening to radio and television and had found the place the goingstraightup shuttles went from it was only eighteen miles away and theyd defi nitely made progress theyd goneoh call it half a mile and at least it was warm even the rain was warm and the bacon lettuce and tomato sandwich was holding up but there were still almost eighteen miles to go when did you say the launch is said masklin four hours time said the thing that means well have to travel at more than four miles an hour said angalo gloomily masklin nodded a nome trying hard could probably cover a mile and a half in an hour over open ground he hadnt given much thought to how they could get the thing into space if hed thought about it at all hed imagined that they could find the shuttle plane and wedge the thing on it some terry pratchett where if possible maybe they could go too al though he wasnt too sure about that the thing said it was cold in space and there was no air you could have asked grandson richard to help us said gurder why did you run away i dont know said masklin i suppose i thought we ought to be able to help ourselves but you used the truck nomes lived in the store you used the concorde you re eating human food masklin was surprised the thing didnt often argue like that thats different he said how they didnt know about us we took what we wanted we werent given it they think its their world thing they think everything in it belongs to them they name everything and own every thing i looked up at him and i thought heres a human in a humans room doing human things how can he ever understand about nomes how can he ever think tiny people are real people with real thoughts i cant just let a human take over not just like that the thing blinked a few lights at him weve come too far not to finish it ourselves masklin mumbled he looked up at gurder anyway when it came to it i didnt exactly see you rushing up ready to shake him by the finger he said wings i was embarrassed its always embarrassing meeting deities said gurder they hadnt been able to light a fire everything was too wet not that they needed a fire it was just that a fire was more civilized someone had managed to light a fire there at some time though because there were still a few damp ashes i wonder how things are back home said an galo after a while all right i expect said masklin do you really well more hope than expect to tell the truth i expect your grimmas got everyone orga nized said angalo trying to grin shes not my grimma snapped masklin isnt she whose is she then shes masklin hesitated hers i sup pose he said lamely oh i thought the two of you were set to angalo began were not i told her we were going to get mar ried and all she could talk about was frogs said masklin thats females for you said gurder didnt i say that letting them learn to read was a bad idea it overheats their brains she said the most important thing in the world was little frogs living in a flower masklin went on trying to listen to the voice of his own mem terry pratchett ory he hadnt been listening very hard at the time hed been too angry sounds like you could boil a kettle on her head said angalo it was something shed read in a book she said my point exactly said gurder you know i never really agreed with letting everyone learn to read it unsettles people masklin looked gloomily at the rain come to think of it he said it wasnt frogs exactly it was the idea of frogs she said there are these hills where its hot and rains all the time and in the rain forests there are these very tall trees and right in the top branches of the trees there are these like great big flowers called bromeliads i think and water gets into the flow ers and makes little pools and theres a type of frog that lays eggs in the pools and tadpoles hatch and grow into new frogs and these little frogs live their whole lives in the flowers right at the top of the trees and dont even know about the ground and once you know the world is full of things like that your life is never the same he took a deep breath something like that anyway he said gurder looked at angalo didnt understand any of it he said its a metaphor said the thing no one paid it any attention wings masklin scratched his ear it seemed to mean a lot to her he said its a metaphor said the thing women always want something said angalo my wife is always on about dresses im sure he would have helped said gurder if wed talked to him hed probably have given us a proper meal and and given us a home in a shoebox said masklin and given us a home in a shoebox said gurder automatically no i mean maybe i mean why not a decent hours sleep for a change and then we wed be carried around in his pocket said masklin not necessarily not necessarily we would because hes big and were small launch in three hours and fiftyseven minutes said the thing their temporary camp overlooked a ditch there didnt seem to be any winter in florida and the banks were thick with greenery something like a flat plate with a spoon on the front sculled slowly past the spoon stuck out of the water for a moment looked at the nomes vaguely and then dropped down again what was that thing thing said masklin the thing extended one of its sensors a longnecked turtle oh terry pratchett the turtle swam peacefully away lucky really said gurder what said angalo its having a long neck like that and being called a longnecked turtle itd be really awkward having a name like that if it had a short neck launch in three hours and fiftysix minutes masklin stood up you know said angalo i really wish i could have read more of the spy with no trousers it was getting exciting come on he said lets see if we can find a way angalo who had been sitting with his chin in his hands gave him an odd look what now weve come too far just to stop havent we they pushed their way through the weeds af ter a while a fallen log helped them across the ditch much greener here than at home isnt it said angalo masklin pushed through a thick stand of leaves warmer too said gurder theyve got the heating fixed here for generations the store nomes had known that tempera ture was caused by air conditioning and the heating system like many of them gurder never quite gave up certain habits of thinking wings no one fixes heating outside it just happens said angalo if i get old this is the kind of place id like to live if i had to live outside gurder went on ignoring him its a wildlife preserve said the thing gurder looked shocked what like jam made of animals no it is a place where animals can live unmolested youre not allowed to hunt them you mean yes youre not allowed to hunt anything mas klin said gurder masklin grunted there was something nagging at him he couldnt quite put his finger on it probably it was to do with the animals after all apart from turtles with long necks he said what other animals are there here thing the thing didnt answer for a moment then it said i find mention of sea cows and alligators masklin tried to imagine what a sea cow looked like but they didnt sound too bad hed met cows before they were big and slow and didnt eat nomes except by accident whats an alligator he said the thing told him what said masklin what said angalo terry pratchett what said gurder he pulled his robe tightly around his legs you idiot shouted angalo me said masklin hotly how should i know how should i know is it my fault did i miss a sign at the airport saying welcome to floridia home of large meateating reptiles up to twelve feet long they watched the grasses a damp warm world inhabited by insects and turtles was suddenly a disguise for horrible terrors with huge teeth somethings watching us masklin thought i can feel it the three nomes stood backtoback masklin crouched down slowly and picked up a stone the grass moved the thing did say they dont all grow to twelve feet said angalo in the silence we were blundering around in the darkness said gurder with things like that around the grass moved again it wasnt the wind that was moving it pull yourself together muttered angalo if it is alligators said gurder trying to look noble i shall show them how a nome can die with dignity please yourself said angalo his eyes scan ning the undergrowth im planning to show them how a nome can run away with speed the grasses parted wings a nome stepped out there was a crackle behind masklin his head spun around another nome stepped out and another and another fifteen of them the three travelers swiveled like an animal with six legs and three heads it was the fire that i saw masklin told himself we sat right down by the ashes of a fire and i looked at them and i didnt wonder who could have made them the strangers wore gray they seemed to be all sizes and every single one of them had a spear i wish i had mine masklin thought trying to keep as many of the strangers as possible in his line of sight they werent pointing their spears at him the trouble was they werent exactly not pointing them either masklin told himself that it was very rare for a nome to kill another nome in the store it was considered bad manners while outside well there were so many other things that killed nomes in any case besides it was wrong there didnt have to be any other reasons he just had to hope that these nomes felt the same way do you know these people said angalo terry pratchett me said masklin of course not how could i theyre outsiders i dunno i suppose i thought all outsiders would know each other never seen them before in my life said mas klin i think said angalo slowly and deliberately that the leader is that old guy with the big nose and the topknot with a feather in it what do you think masklin looked at the tall thin old nome who was scowling at the three of them he doesnt look as if he likes us very much i dont like the look of him at all said angalo have you got any suggestions thing said masklin they are probably as frightened of you as you are of them i doubt it said angalo tell them you will not harm them id much rather they told me theyre not going to harm us masklin stepped forward and raised his hands we are peaceful he said we dont want any one to be hurt including us said angalo we really mean it several of the strangers backed away and raised their spears wings ive got my hands raised said masklin over his shoulder why should they be so upset because youre holding a large rock said an galo flatly i dont know about them but if you walked toward me holding something like that pd be pretty scared im not sure i want to let go of it said mas klin perhaps they dont understand us gurder moved he hadnt said a word since the arrival of the new nomes hed just gone very pale now some sort of internal timer had gone off he gave a snort leapt forward and he bore down on topknot like an enraged balloon how dare you accost us youyou outsider he screamed angalo put his hands over his eyes masklin got a firm hold on his rock er gurder he began topknot backed away the other nomes seemed puzzled by the small explosive figure that was sud denly among them gurder was in the grip of the kind of anger that is almost as good as armor topknot screeched something back at gurder dont you harangue me you grubby heathen said gurder do you think all these spears really frighten us yes whispered angalo he sidled closer to masklin whats got into him he said terby pbatchett topknot shouted something at his nomes a couple of them raised their spears uncertainly several of the others appeared to argue this is getting worse said angalo yes said masklin i think we should a voice behind them snapped out a command all the floridians turned so did masklin two nomes had come out of the grass one was a boy the other was a small dumpy woman the sort youd cheerfully accept an apple pie from her hair was tied in a bun and like topknots it had a long gray feather stuck through it the floridians looked sheepish topknot spoke at length the woman said a couple of words topknot spread his arms above him and muttered something at the sky the woman walked around masklin and angalo as if they were items on display when she looked masklin up and down he caught her eye and thought she looks like a little old lady but shes in charge if she doesnt like us were in a lot of trouble she reached up and took the stone out of his hand he didnt resist then she touched the thing it spoke what it said sounded very much like the words the woman had just used she pulled her hand away sharply and looked at the thing with her head on one side then she stood back at another command the floridians formed not wings a line but a sort of v shape with the woman at the tip of it and the travelers inside it are we prisoners said gurder who had cooled off a bit i dont think so said masklin not exactly prisoners yet the meal was some sort of a lizard masklin quite enjoyed it it reminded him of his days as an outsider the other two ate it only because not eating it would be impolite and it probably wasnt a good idea to be impolite to people who had spears when you didnt the floridians watched them solemnly there were at least thirty of them all wearing identical gray clothes they looked quite like the store nomes except for being slightly darker and much skinnier many of them had large impres sive noses which the thing said was perfectly okay and all because of genetics the thing was talking to them occasionally it would extend one of its sensors and use it to draw shapes in the dirt things probably telling them wecomefrom placebilongfaronbigbirdthatdoesntgoflap said angalo a lot of the time the thing was simply repeat ing the womans own words back at her eventually masklin couldnt stand it anymore terry pratchett whats happening thing he said whys the woman doing all the talking she is the leader of this group said the thing a woman are you serious i am always serious its built in oh angalo nudged masklin if grimma ever finds out were in real trouble he said her name is verysmalltree or shrub the thing went on and you can understand her said masklin gradually their language is very close to original nomish what do you mean original nomish the language your ancestors spoke masklin shrugged there was no point in trying to understand that now have you told her about us he said yes she says topknot who had been muttering to himself stood up suddenly and spoke very sharply at great length with a lot of pointing to the ground and to the sky the thing flashed a few lights he says you are trespassing on the land belonging to the maker of clouds he says that is very bad he said the maker of clouds will be very angry there was a general murmur of agreement from many of the nomes wings shrub spoke to them sharply masklin stuck out a hand to stop gurder from getting up what does er shrub think he said dont think she is very sympathetic to the topknot person his name is personwboknowswhatthemaker ofcloudsisthinking and what is the maker of clouds its bad luck to say its true name it made the ground and it is still making the sky it topknot spoke again he sounded angry we need to be friends with these people mas klin thought there has to be a way the maker of clouds ismasklin thought harda sort of arnold bros yes said the thing a real thing think so are you prepared to take a risk what i think i know the identity of the maker of clouds i think i know when it will make some more sky what when said masklin in three hours and ten minutes masklin hesitated hold on a moment he said slowly that sounds like the same sort of time that yes all three of you please get ready to run i will now write the name of the maker of clouds why will we have to run they might get very angry but we havent time to waste terry pratchett the thing extended a sensor it wasnt in tended as a writing implement and the shapes it drew were angular and hard to read it scrawled four shapes in the dust the effect was instantaneous topknot started to shout again some of the floridians leapt to their feet masklin grabbed the other two travelers im really going to thump that old nome in a minute said gurder how can anyone be so narrowminded shrub sat silent while the row went on around her then she spoke very loud but very calmly she is telling them said the thing that it is not wrong to write the name of the maker of clouds it is often written by the maker of clouds itself how fa mous the maker of clouds must be that even these strangers know its name she says that seemed to satisfy most of the nomes topknot started to grumble to himself masklin relaxed a bit and looked down at the figures in the sand n a a he said its an s said the thing not an but youve only been talking to them for a lit tle while said angalo how can you know something like this because i know bow nomes think said the thing you always believe what you read and you w all got very literal minds very literal minds indeed geese a type of bird which is slower than the con corde and you dont get anything to eat according to nomes who know them well a goose is the most stupid bird there is except for a duck geese spend a lot of time flying to other places as a form of transport the goose leaves a lot to be de sired if it werent for the nomes telling them what to do geese would just fly around lost and honking the whole time if you want my scientific opinion from a scientific encyclopedia for the enquiring young nome by angalo de haberdasheri in the beginning said shrub there was nothing but ground nasa saw the emptiness above the ground and decided to fill it with sky it built a place in the middle of the world and sent up tow ers full of clouds sometimes they also carried stars because at night after one of the cloud tow ers had gone up the nomes could sometimes see new stars moving across the sky the land around the cloud towers was nasas special country there were more animals there and fewer humans it was a pretty good place for nomes some of them believed that nasa had ar ranged it all for precisely that reason shrub sat back and does she believe that said masklin he looked across the clearing to where gurder and topknot were arguing they couldnt understand what one another was saying but they were still arguing the thing translated shrub laughed she says days come days go who needs to believe anything she sees things happen with her own eyes and these are things she knows happen belief is a wonderful thing for those who need it she says but she knows this place belongs to nasa because its name is on signs angalo grinned he was nearly in tears they live right by the place the goingup jets go from and they think its some sort of magic place he said isnt it said masklin almost to himself anyway its no more strange than thinking the store was the whole world thing how do they watch the goingup jets theyre a long way away wings not far at all eighteen miles is not far at all she says she says they can be there in little more than an hour shrub nodded at their astonishment and then without another word stood up and walked away through the bushes she signaled the nomes to fol low her half a dozen floridians trailed after their leader making the shape of a v with her at the point after a few yards the greenery opened out again beside a small lake the nomes were used to large bodies of water there were reservoirs near the airport they were even used to ducks but the things paddling enthusiastically toward them were a lot bigger than ducks besides ducks were like a lot of other animals and recognized in nomes the shape if not the size of humans and kept a safe distance away from them they didnt come baring toward them as if the mere sight of them was the best thing that had happened all day some of them were almost flying in their desire to get to the nomes masklin looked around automatically for a weapon shrub grabbed his arm shook her head and said a couple of words theyre friendly the thing translated they dont look it they re geese said the thing quite harmless terry pratchett except to grass and minor organisms they fly here for the winter the geese arrived with a bow wave that surged over the nomes feet and arched their necks down toward shrub she patted a couple of fearsome looking beaks masklin tried hard not to look like a minor or ganism they migrate here from colder climates the thing went on they rely on the floridians to pick the right course for them oh good thats masklin stopped while his brain caught up with his mouth youre going to tell me they fly on them right certainly they travel with the geese incidentally you have two hours and fortyone minutes to launch i want to make it absolutely clear said an galo slowly as a great feathery head explored the waterweeds a few inches away that if youre sug gesting that we ride on a geese a goose one geese is a goose you can think again or compute or whatever it is you do you have a better suggestion of course said the thing if it had a face it would have been sneer ing suggesting we dont ride on them strikes me as a whole lot better yes said angalo i dunno said masklin who had been watch wings ing the geese speculatively i might be prepared to give it a try the floridians have developed a very interesting re lationship with the geese said the thing the geese provide the nomes with wings and the nomes provide the geese with brains they fly north to canada in the sum mer and back here for the winter geese like nomes geese that carry nomes are steered to better feeding grounds and find that their nests get protected from rats and other creatures geese are bright enough to learn that geese with nomes around have a better life and the names get free transport and a warm place to sleep its almost a symbiotic relationship although of course theyre not familiar with the term arent they silly old them angalo muttered i dont understand you angalo said masklin youre mad for riding in machines with whirring bits of metal pushing them along yet youre wor ried about sitting on a perfectly natural bird thats because i dont understand how birds work said angalo ive never seen an exploded working diagram of a goose the geese are the reason the floridians have never bad much to do with humans the thing continued as i said their language is almost original nomisb yes and i still dont understand that said masklin i mean nomes ought to speak the same language yes no you remember that i told you once that nomes terry pratchett used to be able to talk to humans and taught them lan guages yes said masklin and then the humans changed the language over hundreds of years names who lived near humans changed too but the floridians never had much to do with humans so their form of the language is still very much as it used to be shrub was watching them carefully there was something about the way she was treating them that still seemed odd to masklin it wasnt that she hadnt been afraid of them or aggressive or un pleasant shes not surprised he said aloud shes in terested but shes not surprised they were upset because we were here not because we existed how many other nomes has she met the thing had to translate it was a word that masklin had only known for a year thousands the leading tree frog was trying to wrestle with a new idea it was very dimly aware that it needed a new type of thought there had been the world with the pool in the middle and the petals around the edge one but farther along the branch was another world from here it looked tantalizingly like the flower they had left one wings the leading frog sat in a clump of moss and swiveled each eye so that it could see both worlds at the same time one there and one there one and one the frogs forehead bulged as it tried to get its mind around a new idea one and one were one but if you had one here and one there the other frogs watched in bewilderment as their leaders eyes whizzed around and around one here and one there couldnt be one they were too far apart you needed a word that meant both ones you needed to say you needed to say the frogs mouth widened it grinned so broadly that both ends almost met behind its head it had worked it out mipmip it said it meant one and one more one gurder was still arguing with topknot when they got back how do they manage to keep it up they dont understand what each others saying said an galo best way said masklin gurder were ready to go come on gurder looked up he was very red in the face the two of them were crouched either side of a mass of scrawled diagrams in the dirt terry pratchett i need the thing he said this idiot refuses to understand anything you wont win any arguments with him said masklin shrub says he argues with all the other nomes they meet he likes to what other nomes said gurder theres nomes everywhere gurder thats what shrub says theres other groups even in floridia andandand in canadia where the floridians go in the summer there were proba bly even other nomes back home we just never found them he pulled the abbot to his feet and we havent got a lot of time left he added im not going up on one of those things the geese gave gurder a puzzled look as if he were an unexpected frog in their waterweed im not very happy about it either said mas klin but shrubs people do it all the time you just snuggle down in the feathers and hang on snuggle shouted gurder ive never snug gled in my life you rode on the concorde angalo pointed out and that was built and driven by humans gurder glared like someone who wasnt going to give in easily well who built the geese he demanded wings angalo grinned at masklin who said what dunno other geese i expect geese geese and what do they know about de signing for air safety listen said masklin they can take us all the way across this place the floridians fly thou sands of miles on them thousands of miles with out even any smoked salmon or pink wobbly stuff its worth trying it for eighteen miles isnt it gurder hesitated topknot muttered something gurder cleared his throat very well he said haughtily im sure if this misguided individual is in the habit of flying on these things i should have no difficulty whatso ever he stared up at the gray shapes bobbing out in the lagoon do the floridians talk to the crea tures the thing tried this on shrub she shook her head no she said geese were quite stupid friendly but stupid why talk to something that couldnt talk back have you told her what were doing said masklin no she hasnt asked how do we get on shrub stuck her fingers in her mouth and whis tled half a dozen geese waddled up the bank close up they didnt look any smaller i remember reading something about geese terry pratchett once said gurder in a sort of dreamy terror it said they could break a humans arm with a blow of their nose wing said angalo looking up at the feathery gray bodies looming over him it was their wing and it was swans that do that said masklin weakly geese are the ones you mustnt say boo to gurder watched a long neck weave back and forth above him wouldnt dream of it he said a long time after when masklin came to write the story of his life he described the flight of the geese as the fastest highest and most terrifying of all people said hold on thats not right you said the plane went so fast that it left its sound behind and so high up there was blue all around it and he said thats the point it went so fast you didnt know how fast it was going it went so high you couldnt see how high it was it was just something that happened and the concorde looked as though it was meant to fly when it was on the ground it looked kind of lost the geese on the other hand looked as aerody namic as a pillow they didnt roll into the sky and sneer at the clouds like the plane did no they ran across the top of the water and hammered des wings perately at the air with their wings and then just when it was obvious they werent going to achieve anything they suddenly did the water dropped away and there was just the slow creak of wings pulling the goose up into the sky masklin would be the first to admit that he didnt understand about jets and engines and ma chines so maybe that was why he didnt worry about traveling in them but he thought he knew a thing or two about muscles and the knowledge that it was only a couple of big muscles that were keeping him alive was not comforting each traveler shared a goose with one of the floridians they didnt do any steering as far as masklin could see that was all done by shrub who sat far out on the neck of the leading goose he never found out how she steered maybe by orders in some language the geese and the geese nomes shared maybe by little movements maybe by some sort of science it was a mystery but thenhe told himselfshrub probably wouldnt know how to drive a truck shed probably be very impressed he told himself that made him feel a bit better the ones behind shrubs bird followed their leader in a perfect v shape masklin buried himself in the feathers it was comfortable if a bit cold floridians he learned later had no difficulty sleeping on a flying goose the mere thought made masklins hands sweat terry pratchett he peered out just long enough to see distant trees sweeping by much too fast and stuck his head down again how long have we got thing he said estimate arrival in the vicinity of the launch pad one hour from launch i suppose theres absolutely no possibility that launches have anything to do with lunches said masklin wistfully wo pity wellhave you any suggestions about how we get on the machine that is almost impossible i thought youd say that but you could put me on the thing added yes but how tie you to the outside wo get me close enough and i will do the rest what rest call the ship yes where is the ship im amazed satellites and things havent bumped into it it is waiting youre a great help sometimes thank you that was meant to be sarcastic i know there was a rustling beside masklin and his floridian corider pushed aside a feather it was the boy he had seen with shrub hed said noth i wings ing but just stared at masklin and the thing now he grinned and said a few words he wants to know if you feel sick i feel fine masklin lied whats his name his name is pion he is shrubs oldest son pion gave masklin another encouraging grin he wants to know what it is like in a jet said the thing he says it sounds exciting they see them some times but they keep away from them the goose canted sideways masklin tried to hang on with his toes as well as his fingers it must be much more exciting than geese he says said the thing oh i dont know said masklin weakly landing was much worse than flying it would have been better on water masklin was told later but shrub had brought them down on land the geese didnt like that much it meant that they had almost to stand on the air flapping furiously and then drop the last few inches pion helped masklin down onto the ground which seemed to him to be moving from side to side the other travelers tottered toward him through the throng of birds the ground panted angalo it was so close no one seemed to mind he sagged to his knees and they made honking noises he said and kept swinging from side to side and theyre all knobbly under the feathers terry pratchett masklin flexed his arms to let the tension out the land around them didnt seem a lot differ ent from the place theyd left except that the vege tation was lower and masklin couldnt see any wa ter shrub says that this is as close as the geese can go the thing said it is too dangerous to go any farther shrub nodded and pointed to the horizon there was a white shape on it that said masklin thats it said angalo yes doesnt look very big said gurder quietly its still quite a long way off said masklin i can see helicopters said angalo no won der shrub didnt want to take the geese any closer and we must be going said masklin weve got an hour and i reckon thats barely enough er wed better say goodbye to shrub can you ex plain thing tell her thatthat well try to find her again afterward if everythings all right i suppose if there is any afterward gurder added he looked like a badly washed dishcloth shrub nodded when the thing had finished translating and then pushed pion forward the thing told masklin what she wanted what we cant take him with us said mas klin wings young names in shrubs people are encouraged to travel said the thing pion is only fourteen months old and already he has been to alaska try to explain that were not going to a laska said masklin try to make her under stand that all sorts of things could happen to him the thing translated she says that is good a growing boy should always seek out new experiences what are you translating me properly said masklin suspiciously yes well have you told her its dangerous yes she says that danger is what being alive is all about but he could be killed masklin shrieked then he will go up into the sky and become a star is that what they believe yes they believe that the operating system of a nome starts off as a goose if it is a good goose it becomes a nome when a good nome dies nasa takes it up into the sky and it becomes a star whats an operating system said masklin this was religion he always felt out of his depth with religion the thing inside you that tells you what you are said the thing it means a soul said gurder wearily never heard such a lot of nonsense said an galo cheerfully at least not since we were in the tebky pratchett store and believed we came back as garden orna ments eh he nudged gurder in the ribs instead of getting angry about this gurder just looked even more despondent let the lad come if he likes angalo went on he shows the right spirit he reminds me of me when i was like him his mother says that if he gets homesick be can al ways find a goose to bring him back said the thing masklin opened his mouth to speak but there were times when you couldnt say anything because there was nothing to say if you had to explain anything to someone else then there had to be something you were both sure of someplace to start and masklin wasnt sure that there was anyplace like that around shrub he wondered how big the world was to her probably bigger than he could imagine but it stopped at the sky oh all right he said but we have to go right away no time for long tearful pion nodded to his mother and came and stood by masklin who couldnt think of anything to say even later on when he understood the geese nomes better he never quite got used to the way they cheerfully parted from one another dis tances didnt seem to mean much to them come on then he managed gurder glowered at topknot who had insisted wings on coming this far i really wish i could talk to that nome he said shrub told me hes quite a decent nome re ally said masklin hes just a bit set in his ways just like you said angalo me im not gurder began of course youre not said masklin sooth ingly now lets go they jogged through scrub two or three times as high as they were well never have time gurder panted save your breath for running said angalo do they have smoked salmon on shuttles said gurder dunno said masklin pushing his way through a particularly tough clump of grass no they dont said angalo authoritatively i remember reading about it in a book they eat out of tubes the nomes ran in silence while they thought about this what toothpaste said gurder after a while no not toothpaste of course not toothpaste im sure not toothpaste well what else do you know that comes in tubes angalo thought about this glue he said uncertainly terry pratchett doesnt sound like a good meal to me tooth paste and glue the people who drive the space jets must like it they were all smiling in the picture i saw said angalo that wasnt smiling that was probably just them trying to get their teeth apart said gurder no youve got it all wrong angalo decided thinking fast they have to have their food in tubes because of gravity what about gravity there isnt any any what gravity so everything floats around what in water said gurder no in air because theres nothing to hold it on the plate you see oh gurder nodded is that where the glue comes in masklin knew that they could go on like this for hours what these sounds mean he thought is i am alive and so are you and were all very wor ried that we might not be alive for much longer so well just keep talking because thats better than thinking it all looked better when it was days or weeks away but now when it was how long thing forty minutes wings weve got to have another rest gurder isnt running hes just falling upright they collapsed in the shade of a bush the shut tle didnt look much closer but they could see plenty of other activity there were more helicop ters according to pion who climbed up the bush there were humans much farther off i need to sleep said angalo didnt you sleep on the goose said masklin did you angalo stretched out in the shade how are we going to get on the shuttle thing he said masklin shrugged well the thing says we dont have to get on it we just have to put the thing on it angalo pushed himself up on his elbows you mean we dont get to ride on it i was looking forward to that i dont think its like the truck angalo i dont think they leave a window open for anyone to sneak in said masklin i think itd take more than a lot of nomes and some string to fly it any way you know that was the best time of my life when i drove the truck said angalo dreamily when i think of all those months i lived in the store not even knowing about the outside masklin waited politely his head felt heavy well he said terry pratchett well what what happens when you think of all those months in the store not knowing about the out side it just seems like a waste pion curled up and started to snore angalo yawned they hadnt slept for hours nomes slept mainly at night but needed catnaps to get through the long day even masklin was nodding thing he remembered to say wake me up in ten minutes will you satellites they are in space and stay there by going so fast that they never stay in one place long enough to fall down televisions are bounced off them from a scientific encyclopediaor the enquiring young nome by angalo de haberdasheri it wasnt the thing that woke masklin up it was gurder masklin lay with his eyes half closed listening gurder was talking to the thing in a low voice i believed in the store he said and then i found out it was just aa sort of thing built by humans and i thought grandson richard was some special person and he turned out to be a human who sings when he wets himself takes a shower and now theres thousands of nomes in the world thousands believing all sorts of things terby pbatchett that stupid topknot person believes that the go ingup shuttles make the sky do you know what i thought when i heard that i thought if hed been the one arriving in my world instead of the other way around hed have thought i was just as stu pid i am just as stupid thing i was maintaining a tactful silence angalo believes in silly machinery and mas klin believes in oh i dont know space or not believing in things and it all works for them i try to believe in important things and they dont last for five minutes wheres the fairness in that only another tactful and understanding silence suf fices at this point i just wanted to make some sense out of life this is a commendable aim i mean what is the truth of everything there was a pause then the thing said re call your conversation with masklin about the origin of names you wanted to ask me i can answer now i was made i know this is true i know that i am a thing made of metal and plastic but also that i am something which lives inside that metal and plastic it is impossibleor me not to be absolutely certain of it this is a great comfort as to names i have data that says nomes originated on another world and came here thousands of years ago this may be true it may not be true i am not in a position to judge i knew where i was back in the store said gurder half to himself and even in the quarry wings it wasnt too bad i had a proper job i was impor tant to people how can i go back now knowing that everything i believed about the store and ar nold bros and grandson richard is just is just an opinion cannot advise i am sorry masklin decided it was a diplomatic time to wake up he made a grunting noise just to be sure that gurder heard him the abbot was very red in the face i couldnt sleep he said shortly masklin stood up how long thing twentyseven minutes why didnt you wake me up wished you to be refreshed but its still a long way off well never get you onto it in time wake up you masklin prodded angalo with his foot come on well have to run wheres pion oh there you are come on gurder they jogged on through the scrub in the dis tance there was the low mournful howl of sirens youre cutting it really fine masklin said an galo faster run faster now that they were closer masklin could see the shuttle it was quite high up there didnt seem to be anything useful at ground level i hope youve got a good plan thing he terry pratchett panted as the four of them dodged between the bushes because ill never be able to get you all the way up there do not worry we are nearly close enough what do you mean its still a long way off is close enough for me to get on what is it going to do take a flying leap said angalo put me down masklin obediently put the black box on the ground it extended a few of its probes which swung around slowly for a while and then pointed toward the goingup jet what are you playing at said masklin this is wasting timev gurder laughed although not in a very happy way i know what its doing he said its sending itself onto the shuttle right thing j am transmitting an instruction subset to the com puter on the communications satellite said the thing the nomes said nothing or to put it another way yes i am turning the satellite computer into a part of me although not a very intelligent one can you really do that said angalo certainly wow and you wont miss the bit youre send ing no because it will not leave me wings youre sending it and keeping it at the same time yes angalo looked at masklin did you understand any of that he de manded i did said gurder the things saying its not just a machine its a sort ofa sort of collec tion of electric thoughts that lives in a machine i think lights flickered around on top of the thing does it take a long time to do said masklin yes please do not take up vital communication power at this point i think he means he doesnt want us to talk to him said gurder hes concentrating it said angalo its an it and it made us run all the way here just so we can hurry up and wait it probably has to be close up to do what ever it is its doing said masklin how longs it going to take said angalo it seems ages since it was twentyseven minutes ago twentyseven minutes at least said gurder yeah maybe more pion pulled at masklins arm pointed to the looming white shape with his other hand and rat tled off a long sentence in floridian or if the thing was right nearly original nomish terry pratchett i cant understand you without the thing said masklin sorry no speaka da gooseoh said angalo a look of panic spread across the boys face he shouted this time and tugged harder i think he doesnt want to be near the goingup jets when they start up said angalo hes prob ably afraid of the noise dont like the noise right he said pion nodded furiously they didnt sound too bad at the airport said angalo more of a rumble i expect they might frighten unsophisticated people i dont think shrubs people are particularly unsophisticated said masklin thoughtfully he looked up at the white tower it had seemed a long way away but in some ways it might be quite close really very close how safe do you think it is here he said when it goes up i mean oh come o said angalo the thing wouldnt have let us come right here if it wasnt safe for nomes sure sure said masklin right youre right silly to dwell on it really pion turned and ran the other three looked back at the shuttle lights moved in complicated patterns on the top of the thing somewhere another siren sounded there was a sensation of power as though the biggest spring in the world was being wound up when masklin spoke the other two seemed to hear him speak their own thoughts exactly how good he said very slowly do you think the thing is at judging how close nomes can stand to a goingup jet when it goes up i mean how much experience has it got do you think they looked at one another maybe we should back off a little bit gurder suggested they turned and walked away then each one of them couldnt help noticing that the others seemed to be walking faster and faster faster and faster then as one nome they gave up and ran for it fighting their way through the scrub and grass skidding on stones elbows going up and down like pistons gurder who was normally out of breath at anything above walking pace bounded along like a balloon have you anyany idea howhow close angalo panted the sound behind them started like a hiss like the whole world taking a deep breath then it turned into not noise but something more like an invisible hammer that smacked into both ears at once space there are two types a something contain ing nothing and b nothing containing everything it is what you have left when you havent got any thing else there is no air or gravity which is what holds people onto things if there werent space everything would be in one place it is de signed to be a place for satellites shuttles planets and the ship from a scientific encyclopedia for the enquiring young nome by angalo de haberdasheri after some time when the ground had stopped shaking the nomes picked themselves up and stared blearily at one another said gurder what said masklin his own voice sounded a long way away and muffled said gurder said angalo wings i what i cant hear you can you hear me a masklin saw gurders lips move he pointed to his own ears and shook his head weve gone deaf i ti y deaf i said masklin looked up smoke billowed overhead and out of it rising fast even to a nomes highspeed senses was a long growing cloud tipped with fire the noise dropped to something merely very loud and then very quickly disappeared masklin stuck a finger in his ear and wiggled it around the absence of sound was replaced by the terri ble hiss of silence anyone listening he ventured anyone hearing me that said angalo his voice sounding blurred and unnaturally calm was pretty loud i dont reckon many things come much louder masklin nodded he felt as though hed been pounded hard by something you know about these things he said weakly humans ride on them do they oh yes right at the top no one makes them do it terry pratchett er i dont think so said angalo i think the book said a lot of them want to do it they want to do it angalo shrugged thats what it said there was only a distant dot now at the end of a widening white cloud of smoke masklin watched it we must be mad he thought were tiny and its a big world and we never stop to learn enough about where we are before we go somewhere else at least back when i lived in a hole i knew every thing there was to know about living in a hole and now its a year later and im at a place so far away i dont even know how far away it is watch ing something i dont understand go to a place so far up there is no down and i cant go back ive got to go right on to the end of whatever all this is because i cant go back i cant even stop so thats what grimma meant about the frogs once you know things youre a different person you cant help it he looked back down something was missing the thing he ran back the way theyd come the little black box was where hed left it the rods had withdrawn into it and there werent any lights thing he said uncertainly one red light came on faintly masklin sud denly felt cold despite the heat around him wings are you all right he said the light flickered too quick used too much povo it said pow said masklin he tried hard not to won der why the word hadnt been much more than a growl the light dimmed thing thing he tapped gently on the box did it work is the ship coming what do we do now wake up thing the light went out masklin picked the thing up and turned it over and over in his hands thing masklin and gurder hurried up with pion be hind them did it work said angalo cant see any ship yet masklin turned his face toward them the things stopped he said stopped all the lights have gone out well what does that mean angalo started to look panicky i dont know is it dead said gurder it can die its existed for thousands of years gurder shook his head sounds like a good rea son for dying he said but its aa thing terry pratchett angalo sat down with his arms around his knees did it say if it got everything sorted out whens the ship coming listen dont you care its run out of pow pow it must mean electricity it kind of sucks it out of wires and stuff i think it can store it for a while too and now it must have run out they looked at the black box it had spent thou sands of years being handed down from nome to nome without ever saying a word or lighting a light it had only woken up again when it had been brought into the store near electricity it looks creepy sitting there doing nothing said angalo cant we find it some electricity said gurder around here there isnt any angalo snapped were in the middle of nowhere masklin stood up and gazed around it was just possible to see some buildings in the distance there was a movement of vehicles around them what about the ship said angalo is it on its way i dont know how will it find us i dont know whos driving it i dont masklin stopped in horror no wings one i mean who could be driving it there hasnt been anyone on it for thousands of years who was going to bring it here then i dont know the thing maybe you mean its on its way and no ones driving it yes no i dont know angalo squinted up at the blue sky oh wow he said glumly we need to find some electricity for the thing said masklin even if its managed to summon the ship the ship will still need to be told where we are if it summoned the ship said gurder it might have run out of pow before it had time we cant be sure said masklin anyway we must help the thing i hate to see it like that pion who had disappeared into the scrub came back dragging a lizard ah said gurder without any enthusiasm here comes lunch if the thing were talking we could tell pion you can get awfully tired of lizard in time said angalo in about two seconds said gurder come on said masklin wearily lets go and find some shade and think up another plan oh a plan gurder said as if that was worse than lizard i like plans they atenot very welland lay back watch terry pratchett ing the sky the brief sleep on the way hadnt been enough it was easy to doze i must say these floridians have got it all worked out said gurder lazily its cold back home and here theyve got the heating turned up just right i keep telling you its not the heating said angalo straining his eyes for any sign of a de scending ship and the wind isnt the air condi tioning either its the sun that makes you warm i thought that was just for lighting said gurder and its where all the heat comes from said angalo i read it in a book its a great ball of fire bigger than the world gurder eyed the sun suspiciously oh yes he said what keeps it up nothing its just kind of there gurder squinted at the sun again is this generally known he said i suppose so it was in the book for anyone to read i call that irresponsible thats the sort of thing that can really upset peo ple there are thousands of suns up there masklin says gurder sniffed yes hes told me its called the glaxie or something personally im against it angalo chuckled wings i dont see whats so funny said gurder coldly tell him masklin said angalo its all very well for you gurder muttered you just want to drive things fast want to make sense of them maybe there are thousands of suns but why cant see that it matters said angalo lazily its the only thing that does matter tell him masklin they both looked at masklin at least where masklin had been sitting hed gone beyond the top of the sky was the place the thing had called the universe it contained ac cording to the thing everything and nothing and there was very little everything and more nothing than anyone could imagine for example it was often said that the sky was full of stars it was untrue the sky was full of sky there were unlimited amounts of sky and really by comparison very few stars it was amazing therefore that they made such an impression thousands of them looked down now as some thing round and shiny drifted around the earth it had arnsat painted on its side which was a bit of a waste of paint since stars cant read it unfolded a silver dish terry pratchett it should then have turned to face the planet below it ready to beam down old movies and new news it didnt it had new orders little puffs of gas jetted out as it turned around and searched the sky for a new target by the time it had found it a lot of people in the old movies and new news business were shouting very angrily at one another on telephones and some of them were feverishly trying to give it new instructions but that didnt matter because it wasnt listen ing anymore masklin galloped through the scrub theyd argue and bicker he thought ive got to do this quickly i dont think weve got a lot of time it was the first time hed been really alone since the days back when hed lived in a hole and had to go out hunting by himself because there was no one else had it been better then at least it had been simpler you just had to try to eat without being eaten just getting through the day was a triumph everything had been bad but at least it had been a kind of understandable nomesized badness in those days the world ended at the highway on one side and the woods beyond the field at the other side now it had no kind of boundaries at wings all and more problems than he knew what to do with but at least he knew where to find electricity you found it near buildings with humans in them the scrub ahead of masklin opened out onto a track he turned onto it and ran faster go along any track and youd find humans on it somewhere there were footsteps behind him he turned around and saw pion the young floridian gave him a worried smile go away masklin said go on go go back why are you following me go away pion looked hurt he pointed up the track and said something i dont understand shouted masklin pion stuck a hand high above his head palm downward humans masklin guessed yes i know i know what im doing go back pion said something else masklin lifted up the thing talking box no go he said helplessly good grief why should i have to speak like this you must be at least as intelligent as me go on go away go back to the others he turned and ran he looked back briefly and saw pion watching him how much time have i got he wondered thing terry pratchett once told me the ship flies very fast maybe it could be here any minute maybe its not coming at all he saw figures looming over the scrub yes fol low any track and sooner or later you find hu mans they get everywhere yes maybe the ship isnt coming at all if it isnt he thought then what im going to do now is probably the most stupid thing any nome has ever done anywhere in the total history of nomekind he stepped out into a circle of gravel a small truck was parked in it with the name of the flo ridian god nasa painted on the side close by a couple of humans were bent over a piece of ma chinery on a tripod they didnt notice masklin he walked closer his heart thumping he put down the thing we used to talk he said well maybe its time to try again he cupped his hands around his mouth he tried to shout as clearly and as slowly as pos sible hey there you humans he did what shouted angalo pion ran through his pantomime of gestures again wings talked to bumansy said angalo went in a thing with wheels i thought i heard a truck engine said gurder angalo pounded a fist into his palm he was worried about the thing he said he wanted to find it some electricity but we must be miles from any buildings said gurder not the way masklins going angalo snarled i knew it would come to this gurder moaned showing ourselves to humans we never used to do that sort of thing in the store what are we going to doy masklin thought up to now its not too bad the humans hadnt really known what to do about him theyd even backed away and then one of them had rushed to the truck and talked into a machine on a string probably some sort of telephone masklin thought knowledgeably when he hadnt moved one of the humans had fetched a box out of the back of the truck and crept toward him as if expecting masklin to ex plode in fact when he waved the human jumped back clumsily the other human said something and the box was cautiously put down on the gravel a few feet from masklin then both humans watched him expectantly he kept smiling to put them at their ease and terry pratchett climbed into the box then he gave them another wave one of the humans reached down gingerly and picked up the box lifting it up in the air as though masklin was something very rare and delicate he was carried to the truck the human got in and still holding the box with exaggerated care placed it on its knees a radio crackled with deep human voices well no going back now knowing that mas klin very nearly relaxed perhaps it was best to look at it as just another step along lifes sidewalk they kept staring at him as if they didnt be lieve what they were seeing the truck lurched off after a while it turned onto a concrete road where another truck was waiting a human got out spoke to the driver of masklins truck laughed in a slow human way looked down at masklin and stopped laughing very suddenly it almost ran back to its own truck and started speaking into another telephone i knew this would happen masklin thought they dont know what to do with a real nome amazing but just so long as they take me somewhere where theres the right kind of electricity dorcas the engineer had once tried to explain electricity to masklin but without much success because dorcas wasnt too certain about it either wings there seemed to be two kinds straight and wig gly the straight kind was very boring and stayed in batteries the wiggly kind was found in wires in the walls and things and somehow the thing could steal some of it if it was close enough dor cas used to talk about wiggly electricity in the same tone of voice gurder used for talking about arnold bros hed tried to study it back in the store if it was put into freezers it made things cold but if the same electricity went into an oven it made things hot so how did it know dorcas used to talk masklin thought i said used to i hope he still does he felt lightheaded and oddly optimistic part of him was saying thats because if you for one second think seriously about the position youve put yourself in youll panic keep smiling the truck purred along the road with the other truck following it masklin saw a third truck rattle down a side road and pull in behind them there were a lot of humans on it and most of them were watching the skies they didnt stop at the nearest building but drove on to a bigger one with many more vehicles outside more humans were waiting for them one of them opened the truck door doing it very slowly even for a human the human carrying masklin got out of the truck terry pratchett masklin looked up at dozens of staring faces he could see every eyeball every nostril every one of them looked worried at least every eyeball did the nostrils just looked like nostrils they were worried about him keep smiling he stared back up at them and still almost gig gling with repressed panic said can i help you gentlemen science a way of finding things out and then mak ing them work there is a lot more science than you think from a scientific encyclopedia for the enquiring young nome by angalo de haberdasheri gurder angalo and pion sat under a bush it gave them a bit of shade the cloud of gloom over them was almost as big well never even get home without the thing said gurder then well get him out said angalo thatll take forever yeah well thats nearly as long as weve got here if we cant get home angalo had found a pebble that was almost the right shape to attach to a twig with strips torn off his coat hed never seen a stone ax in his life but he had a definite feeling terry pbatchett that there were useful things that could be done with a stone tied to the end of a stick i wish youd stop fiddling with that thing gurder said whats the big plan then us against the whole of floridia not necessarily you neednt come calm down mr totherescue one idiots enough i dont hear you coming up with any better ideas angalo swished the ax through the air once or twice i havent got any a small red light started to flash on the thing after a while a small square hole opened up and there was a tiny whirring sound as the thing extended a little lens on a stick this turned around slowly then the thing spoke where it asked is this place it tilted the lens up and there was a pause while it surveyed the face of the human looking down at it and why it added im not sure said masklin were in a room in a big building the humans havent hurt me i think one of them has been trying to talk to me we appear to be in some sort of glass box said the thing they even gave me a little bed said masklin wings and i think the thing over there is some kind of lavatory but look what about the ship expect it is on its way said the thing calmly expect expect you mean you dont know many things can go wrong if they have gone right the ship will be here soon if they dont im stuck here for life said mas klin bitterly i came here because of you you know yes i know thank you masklin relaxed a bit theyre being quite kind he said he thought about this at least i think so he added its hard to tell he looked through the transparent wall a lot of humans had been in to look at him in the last few minutes he wasnt quite certain whether he was an honored visitor or a prisoner or maybe something in between it seemed the only hope at the time he said lamely am monitoring communications youre always doing that a lot of them are about you all kinds of experts are rushing here to have a look at you what kind of experts experts in nomes experts in talking to creaturesrow other worlds humans havent met anyone from another world but they ve still got experts in talking to them tebby pbatchett all this had better work said masklin so berly humans really know about nomes now but not what nomes are they think you have just arrived well thats true not arrived here arrived on the planet arrived from the stars but weve been here for thousands of years we live here humans find it a lot easier really to believe in little people from the sky than little people from the earth they would prefer to think of little green men than lepre chauns masklins brow wrinkled i didnt understand any of that he said dont worry about it it doesnt matter the thing let its lens swivel around to see more of the room very nice very scientific it said then it focused on a wide plastic tray next to masklin what is that oh fruit and nuts and meat and stuff said masklin i think theyve been watching me to see what i eat i think these are quite bright humans thing i pointed to my mouth and they under stood i was hungry ah said the thing take me to your larder pardon wings will explain i have told you that i monifof com munications all the time there is a joke that is a humorous anecdote or story known to humans it concerns a ship from another world landing on this planet and strange creatures get out and say to a gas pump garbage can slotmachine of similar mechanical device take me to your leader i surmise this is because they are unaware of the shape of humans i have substituted the similar word larder referfwg to a place where food is stored this is a humorous p i or play on words for hilarious effect it paused oh said masklin he thought about it these would be the little green men you men tioned verywait a moment wait a moment what what said masklin urgently can bear the ship masklin listened as hard as he could i cant hear a thing he said not sound radio where is it where is it thing youve always said the ships up there but where the remaining tree frogs crouched among the moss to escape the heat of the afternoon sun low in the eastern sky was a sliver of v hite it would be nice to think that the tree frogs had legends about it it would be nice to think that tebby pratchett they thought the sun and moon were distant flow ersa yellow one by day a white one by night it would be nice to think they had legends about them and said that when a good frog died its soul would go to the big flowers in the sky the trouble is that its frogs were talking about here their name for the sun was mip mip their name for the moon was mipmip their name was everything was mipmip and when youre stuck with a vocabulary of one word its pretty hard to have legends about anything at all the leading frog however was dimly aware that there was something wrong with the moon it was growing brighter we left the ship on the moon said masklin why thats what your ancestors decided to do said the thing so they could keep an eye on it i assume masklins face lit up slowly like clouds at sun rise you know he said excitedly right back be fore all this right back when we used to live in the old hole i used to sit out at nights and watch the moon perhaps in my blood i really knew that up there wo what you were experiencing was probably primi tive superstition said the thing masklin deflated oh sorry wings and now please be quiet the ship is feeling lost and wants to be told what to do it has just woken up after fifteen thousand years im not very good at mornings myself mas klin said there is no sound on the moon but this doesnt matter because there is no one to hear anything sound would just be a waste but there is light fine moondust billowed high across the ancient plains of the moons dark crescent expanding in boiling clouds that went high enough to catch the rays of the sun they glittered down below something was digging itself out we left it in a holey said masklin lights rippled back and forth across all surfaces of the thing dont say thats why you always lived in holes it said other nomes dont live in holes no thats true said masklin i ought to stop thinking only about the he suddenly went quiet he stared out of the glass tank where a human was trying to interest him in marks on a blackboard youve got to stop it he said right now stop the ship weve got it all wrong thing we cant go it doesnt belong to just us we cant take the ship terry pratchett the three nomes lurking near the shuttle launching place watched the sky as the sun neared the horizon the moon sparkled like a christmas decoration it must be caused by the ship said angalo it must be he beamed at the others thats it then its on its way i never thought it would work gurder said angalo slapped pion on the back and pointed see that my lad he said thats the ship that is ours gurder rubbed his chin and nodded thought fully at pion yes he said thats right ours masklin says theres all kinds of stuff up there said angalo dreamily and masses of space thats what space is well known for lots of space masklin said the ship goes faster than light goes which is probably wrong otherwise howd you see anything youd turn the lights on and all the light would drop backward out of the room but its pretty fast gurder looked back at the sky again something at the back of his mind was pushing its way to the front and giving him a curious gray feeling our ship he said the one that brought nomes here yeah thats right said angalo hardly hearing him wings and itll take us all back gurder went on thats what masklin said and all nomes said gurder his voice was as flat and heavy as a sheet of lead sure why not i expect ill soon work out how to drive it back to the quarry and we can pick them all up and pion here of course what about pions people said gurder oh they can come too said angalo expan sively theres probably even room for their geese and the others angalo looked surprised what others shrub said there were lots of other groups of nomes everywhere angalo looked blank oh them well i dont know about them but we need the ship you know what its been like ever since we left the store but if we take the ship away what will they have if they need it masklin had just asked the same question the thing said what did you say the thing sounded tetchy if i lose concentra tion there might not be a ship for anyone it said am sending fifteen thousand instructions per second masklin said nothing thats a lot of instructions the thing added terry pratchett by rights the ship must belong to all the nomes in the world said masklin oh shut up and tell me when the ship is going to get here which do you want me to do what i can shut up or can tell you when the ship is going to arrive i cant do both please tell me when the ship is going to ar rive said masklin patiently and then shut up four minutes four minutes i could be three seconds off said the thing but i calculate it as four minutes only now its three minutes thirtyeight seconds itll be three minutes and thirty seven seconds any second now i cant hang around in here if its coming that soon said masklin all thoughts of his duty to the nomes of the world temporarily forgotten how can i get out this things got a lid on do you want me to shut up first or get you out and then shut up said the thing please have the humans seen you move said the thing what do you mean do they know bow fast you can run i dont know said masklin i suppose not wings get ready to run then but first put your hands over your ears masklin thought it would be best to obey the thing could be deliberately infuriating at times but it didnt pay to ignore its advice lights on the thing made a brief starshaped pattern it started to wail the sound went up and then went beyond masklins hearing he could feel it even with his hands over his ears it seemed to be making unpleasant bubbles in his head he opened his mouth to shout at the thing and the walls exploded one moment there was glass and the next there were bits of glass drifting out like a jigsaw puzzle where every piece had sud denly decided it wanted some personal space the lid slid down almost hitting him now pick me up and run ordered the thing before the shards had spilled across the table humans around the room were turning to look in that slow clumsy way humans had masklin grabbed the thing and took off across the polished surface down he said were high up how do we get down he looked around desperately there was some sort of machine at the other end of the table covered with little dials and lights hed watched one of the humans using it wires he said theres always wires he skidded around dodged easily around a gi terry pratchett ant hand as it tried to grab him and hared along the table ill have to throw you over he panted i cant carry you down til be all right masklin slid to a stop by the table edge and threw the thing down there were wires running down toward the floor he leapt for one swung around madly and then half fell and half slid down it humans were lurching toward him from every where he picked up the thing again hugging it to his chest and darted forward there was a foot brown shoe dark blue sock he zigged there were two more feetblack shoes black socks and they were about to trip over the first foot he zagged there were more feet and hands reaching vainly down masklin was a blur dodging and weaving between feet that could flatten him and then there was nothing but open floor somewhere an alarm sounded its shrill note sounding deep and awesome to masklin head for the door suggested the thing but more humansll be coming in hissed masklin thats good because were going out masklin reached the door just as it opened a gap of a few inches appeared with more feet be hind it wings there wasnt any time to think masklin ran over the shoe jumped down on the other side and ran on where now where now outside which way is that every way thank you very much doors were opening all along the corridor hu mans were coming out the problem was not evading captureit would take a very alert hu man even to see a nome running at full speed let alone catch onebut simply avoiding being trod den on by accident why dont they have mouse holes every building should have mouse holes masklin moaned a boot stamped down an inch away he jumped the corridor was filling with humans another alarm started to sound whys all this happening i cant be causing all this there cant be all this trouble over just one nome its the ship they have seen the ship a shoe almost awarded masklin the prize for the most perfectly flattened nome in florida as it was he almost ran into it unlike most shoes it had a name on it it was a crucial street drifter with real rubber soul tebby pratchett patd the sock above it looked as though it could be a histyle odorprufe made of guaranteed polyputheketlon the most expensive sock in the world masklin looked farther up beyond the great sweep of blue trouser and the distant clouds of sweater was a beard it was grandson richard just when you thought there was no one watch ing over nomes the universe went and tried to prove you wrong masklin took a standing jump and landed on the trouser leg just as the foot moved it was the safest place humans didnt often tread on other hu mans the foot took a step and came down again mas klin swung backward and forward trying to pull himself up the rough cloth there was a seam an inch away he managed to grab it the stitches gave a better handhold grandson richard was in a crush of people all heading the same way several other humans banged into him almost jarring masklin loose he kicked his boots off and tried to grip with his toes there was a slow thumping as grandson rich ards feet hit the ground masklin reached a pocket got a decent foothold and climbed on a bulky label helped him up to the belt masklin was used to labels in the store but this was pretty big even by big label stan wings dards it was covered in lettering and had been riveted to the trousers as if grandson richard were some sort of machine grossbergers hagglers the first name in jeans he read and theres lots of stuff about how good they are and pictures of cows and things why dyou think he wants labels all over himself perhaps if he hasnt got labels be doesn t know what his clothes are said the thing good point hed probably put his shoes on his head masklin glanced back at the label as he grabbed the sweater it says here that these jeans won a gold medal in the chicago exhibition in he said theyve certainly lasted well humans were streaming out of the building the sweater was much easier to climb masklin hauled himself up quickly grandson richard had quite long hair which also helped when it was time to climb up onto the shoulder a doorframe passed briefly overhead and then the deep blue of the sky how long thing masklin asked grandson richards ear was only a few inches away fortythree seconds the humans spilled out of the wide concrete space in front of the building some more hurried out of the building carrying machinery they terry pratchett kept running into one another because they were all staring at the sky another group was clustered around one hu man who was looking very worried whats going on thing masklin whispered the human in the middle of the group is the most important one here it came to watch the shuttle launch now all the others are telling it that its got to be the one to welcome the ship thats a bit of cheek its not their ship yes but they think its coming to talk to them why should they think that because they think they re the most important crea tures on the planet hah amazing isnt it said the thing everyone knows nomes are more important said masklin at least every nome does he thought about this for a moment and shook his head so thats the head human is it is it some sort of extra wise one or something dont think so the other humans around it are trying to explain to it what a planet is doesnt it know many humans dont mistervicepresident is one of them youre talking to the ship again yes six seconds its really coming yes tea gravity this is not properly understood but it is what makes small things like nomes stick to big things like planets because of science this hap pens whether you know about gravity or not which goes to show that science is happening all the time from a scientific encyclopedia for the enquiring young nome by angalo de haberdasheri angalo looked around gurder come on gurder leaned against a tuft of grass and fought to get his breath back its no good he wheezed what are you thinking of we cant fight humans alone weve got pion and this is a pretty good ax oh thats really going to scare them a stone ax if you had two axes i expect theyd give in right away terry pratchett angalo swung it backward and forward it had a comforting feel youve got to try he said simply come on pion what are you watching geese pion was staring at the sky theres a dot up there said gurder squint ing its probably a bird said angalo doesnt look like a bird then its a plane doesnt look like a plane now all three of them were staring upward their upturned faces forming a triangle there was a black dot up there you dont think he actually managed it do you said angalo uncertainly what had been a dot was now a small dark cir cle its not moving though said gurder its not moving sideways anyway said an galo still speaking very slowly its moving more sort of down what had been a small dark circle was a larger dark circle with just a suspicion of smoke or steam around its edges it might be some sort of weather said angalo you knowspecial floridian weather oh yeah one great big hailstone right its the ship coming for us wings it was a lot bigger now and yet and yet still a very long way off if it could come for us just a little way away i wouldnt mind gurder quavered i wouldnt mind walking a little way yeah said angalo beginning to look desper ate its not so much coming as as dropping said gurder he looked at angalo shall we run he said its got to be worth a try said angalo where shall we run to lets just follow pion shall we he started running a while ago masklin would be the first to admit that he wasnt too familiar with forms of transport but what they all seemed to have in common was a front which was in front and a back which wasnt the whole point was that the front was where they went forward from the thing dropping out of the sky was a disc just a top connected to a bottom with edges around the sides it didnt make any noise but it seemed to be impressing the humans no end thats it he said yes oh and then things seemed to come into focus the ship wasnt big it was so big it needed a terry pratchett new word it wasnt dropping through the thin wisps of cloud up there it was simply pushing them aside just when you thought youd got some idea of the size a cloud would stream past and the perspective would come back there had to be a special word for something as big as that is it going to crash he whispered i shall land it on the scrub said the thing i dont want to frighten the humans run what do you think im doing its still right above us im running im running i cant run any faster a shadow fell across the three running nomes all the way to floridia to be squashed under our own ship moaned angalo you never really believed in it did you well now youre going to believe in it really hard the shadow deepened they could see it racing across the ground ahead of themgray around the edges spreading into the darkness of night their own private night the others are still out there somewhere said masklin ah said the thing i forgot youre not suppose to forget things like that wings ive been very busy lately i cant think of every thing just nearly everything just dont squash anyone shall stop it before it lands dont worry the humans were all talking at once some of them had started to run toward the falling ship some were running away from it masklin risked a glance at grandson richards face it was watching the ship with a strange rapt expression as masklin stared the big eyes swiveled slowly sideways the head turned around grandson richard stared down at the nome on his shoul der for the second time the human saw him and this time there was nowhere to run masklin rapped the thing on its lid can you slow my voice down he said quickly an amazed expression was forming on the humans face what do you mean i mean you just repeat what i say but slowed down and louder so itso he can understand it you want to communicate with a human yes can you do it strongly advise against it it could be very danger ous masklin clenched his fists compared to what thing compared to what how much more dan terry pratchett gerous than not communicating thing do it right now tell him tell him were not try ing to hurt any humans right now i can see his hand moving already do it he held the box right up to grandson richards ear the thing started to speak in the low slow tones of human speech it seemed to go on for a long time the humans expression froze what did you say what did you say said masklin said if he harms you in any way i shall explode and blow his head off said the thing you didnt i did you call that communicating yes i call it very effective communicating but its a dreadful thing to say anyway you never told me you could explode cant but he doesn t know that hes only human said the thing the ship slowed its fall and drifted down across the scrubland until it met its own shadow beside it the tower where the shuttle had been launched looked like a pin alongside a very large black plate you landed it on the ground i told you not to said masklin its not on the ground it is floating just above the ground it looks as though its on the ground to me wings it is floating just above it repeated the thing patiently grandson richard was looking down the length of his nose at masklin he looked puzzled what makes it float masklin demanded the thing told him auntie who whos she there are relatives on board not auntie anti antigravity but theres no flames or smoke flames and smoke are not essential vehicles were screaming toward the bulk of the ship um exactly how far off the ground did you stop it masklin inquired four inches seemed adequate angalo lay with his face pressed into the sandy soil to his amazement he was still alive or at least if he was dead then he was still able to think per haps he was dead and this was wherever you went afterward it seemed pretty much like where hed been be fore lets see now hed looked up at the great thing dropping out of the sky right toward his head and had flung himself down expecting at any second to become just a little greasy mark in a great big hole terry pratchett no he probably hadnt died hed have remem bered something important like that gurder he ventured is that you said gurders voice i hope so pion pion said pion somewhere in the darkness angalo pushed himself up onto his hands and knees any idea where we are he said in the ship suggested gurder dont think so said angalo theres soil here and grass and stuff then where did the ship go whys it all dark angalo brushed the dirt off his coat dunno maybe maybe it missed us maybe we were knocked out and now its nighttime i can see a bit of light around the horizon said gurder thats not right is it thats not how nights are supposed to be angalo looked around there was a line of light in the distance and there was also a strange sound so quiet that you could miss it but that once you had noticed it also seemed to fill up the world he stood up to get a better view there was a faint thump ouch angalo reached up to rub his head his hand wings touched metal crouching a little he risked turn ing his head to see what it was hed hit he got very thoughtful for a while then he said gurder youre going to find this amazingly hard to believe this time said masklin to the thing i want you to translate exactly do you understand dont try to frighten him humans had surrounded the ship at least they were trying to surround it but youd need an aw ful lot of humans to surround something the size of the ship so they were just surrounding it in places more trucks were arriving many of them with sirens blaring grandson richard had been left standing by himself watching his own shoul der nervously besides we owe him something said masklin we used his satellite and we stole things you said you wanted to do it your way no help from humans you said said the thing its different now there is the ship said masklin weve made it were not begging any more may i point out that youre sitting on his shoulder not him on yours said the thing never mind that said masklin tell it mean ask him to walk toward the ship and say terry pratchett please and say that we dont want anyone to get hurt including me he added grandson richards reply seemed to take a long time but he did start to walk toward the crowds around the ship what did he say said masklin hanging on tightly to the sweater don believe it said the thing he doesnt believe me he said his grandfather always talked about the lit tle people but he never believed it until now he said are you like the ones in the old store masklins mouth dropped open grandson rich ard was watching him intently tell him yes masklin croaked very well but i do not think itll be a good idea the thing boomed grandson richard rum bled a reply he says his grandfather made jokes about little people in the store said the thing he used to say they brought him luck masklin felt the horrible sensation in his stom ach that meant the world was changing again just when he thought he understood it did his grandfather ever see a nome he said he says no but he says that when his grandfather and his grandfathers brother were starting the store and stayed late every night to do the office work they used to hear sounds in the walls and they used to tell each other there were little store people it was a sort of joke wings he says that when he was small bis grandfather used to tell him about little people who came out at night to play with the toys but the store nomes never did things like that said masklin didn t say the stories were true the ship was a lot closer now there didnt seem to be any doors or windows anywhere it was as featureless as an egg masklins mind was in turmoil hed always be lieved that humans were quite intelligent after all nomes were very intelligent rats were quite intelligent and foxes were intelligent more or less there ought to be enough intelligence slosh ing around in the world for humans to have some too but this was something more than intelli gence he remembered a book called gullivers travels it had been a big surprise to the nomes there had never been an island of small people he was cer tain of that it was aaa madeup thing there had been lots of books in the store that were like that theyd caused no end of problems for the nomes for some reason humans needed things that werent true they never really thought nomes existed he thought but they wanted to believe that we did tell him he said tell him i must get into the ship terry pratchett grandson richard whispered it was like listening to a gale he says there are too many people why are all the humans around it said mas klin bewildered why arent they frightened grandson richards reply was another gale he says they think some creatures from another world will come out and talk to them why dont know said the thing perhaps they don y want to be alone but theres no one in it its our ship mas klin began there was a wail the crowd put their hands over their ears lights appeared on the darkness of the ship they twinkled all over the hull in patterns that raced backward and forward and disappeared there was another wail there isnt anyone in it is there said mas klin no nomes were left on it in hibernation or anything high up on the ship a square hole opened there was a whiffling noise and a beam of red light shot out and set fire to a patch of scrub sev eral hundred yards away people started to run the ship rose a few feet wobbling alarmingly it drifted sideways a little then it went straight up so fast that it was just a blur and jerked to a wings halt high over the crowd and then it turned over and then it went on its edge for a while it floated back down again and landed more or less that is one side touched the ground and the other rested on the air on nothing the ship spoke loudly to the humans it must have sounded like a high pitched chattering what it actually said was sorry sorry is this a microphone cant find the button that opens the door lets try this one another square hole opened brilliant blue light flooded out the voice boomed out across the country again got it there was the distorted thudthud of someone not certain if their microphone was working and tapping it experimentally masklin are you out there thats angalo said masklin no one else drives like that thing tell grandson richard i must get on the ship please the human nodded humans were milling around the base of the ship the doorway was too high up for them to reach with masklin hanging on grimly grandson richard pushed his way through the throng the ship wailed again er came angalos hugely amplified voice ap parently talking to someone else im not sure terry pratchett i about this switch but maybe its certainly im going to press it why shouldnt i press it its next to the door one it must be safe look shut up a silver ramp wound out of the doorway it looked big enough for humans see see said angalos voice thing can you speak to angalo said mas klin can you tell him im out here trying to get to the ship wo he appears to be randomly pressing buttons it is to be hoped that he does not press the wrong ones i thought you could tell the ship what to do said masklin the thing managed to sound shocked not when a nome is in it it said cant tell it not to do what a nome tells it to do thats what being a machine is all about grandson richard was shoving his way through the pushing shouting mass of humans but it was hard going masklin sighed ask grandson richard to put me down he said then he added and say thank you say it it would have been nice to talk more the thing did the translation grandson richard looked surprised the thing spoke again then he reached up a hand toward masklin if he had to make a list of terrifying moments wings masklin would have put this one at the top hed faced foxes hed helped to drive the truck hed flown on a goosebut none of them were half so bad as letting a human being actually touch him the huge whorled fingers uncurled and passed on either side of his waist he shut his eyes angalos booming voice said masklin mas klin if anything bads happened to you theres going to be trouble grandson richards finger gripped masklin lightly as though the human was holding some thing very fragile masklin felt himself being slowly lowered toward the ground he opened his eyes there was a forest of hu man legs around him he looked up into grandson richards huge face and trying to make his voice as deep and slow as possible said the last word any nome said to any human goodbye then he ran through the maze of feet several humans with officiallooking trousers and big boots were standing at the bottom of the ramp masklin scurried between them and ran on upward ahead of him blue light shone out of the open hatchway as he ran he saw two dots appear on the lip of the entrance the ramp was long masklin hadnt slept for hours he wished hed got some sleep on the bed terry pratchett when the humans were studying it had looked quite comfortable suddenly all his legs wanted to do was go some where close and lie down he staggered to the top of the ramp and the dots became the heads of gurder and pion they reached out and pulled him into the ship he turned around and looked down into a sea of human faces below him hed never looked down on a human before they probably couldnt even see him theyre waiting for the little green men he thought are you all right said gurder urgently did they do anything to you im fine im fine murmured masklin no one hurt me you look dreadful we should have talked to them gurder said masklin they need us are you sure youre all right said gurder peering anxiously at him masklins head felt full of cotton wool you know how you believed in arnold bros est he managed to say yes said gurder masklin gave him a mad triumphant grin well he believed in you too how about that and masklin folded up very gently the ship the machine used by nomes to leave earth we dont yet know everything about it but since it was built by nomes using science we will from a scientific encyclopedia for the enquiring young nome by angalo de haberdasheri the ramp wound in the doorway shut the ship rose in the air until it was high above the build ings and it stayed there while the sun set the humans below tried shining colored lights at it and playing tunes at it and eventually just speaking to it in every language known to hu mans it didnt seem to take any notice masklin woke up he was on a very uncomfortable bed it was all soft he hated lying on anything softer than the terry pbatchett ground the store nomes liked sleeping on fancy bits of carpet but masklins bed had been a bit of wood hed used a piece of rag for a cover and thought that was luxury he sat up and looked around the room it was fairly empty there was just the bed a table and a chair a table and a chair in the store the nomes had made their furni ture out of matchboxes and cotton reels the nomes living outside didnt even know what fur niture was this looked rather like human furniture but it was nomesized masklin got up and padded across the metal floor to the door nomesized again a doorway made by nomes for nomes to walk through it led into a corridor lined with doors there was an old feel about it it wasnt dirty or dusty it just felt like somewhere that had been absolutely clean for a very very long time something purred toward him it was a small black box rather like the thing mounted on little treads a little revolving brush on the front was sweeping dust into a slot at least if there had been any dust it would have been sweeping it masklin wondered how many times it had indus triously cleaned this corridor while it waited for nomes to come back it bumped into his foot beeped at him and then wings bustled off in the opposite direction masklin fol lowed it after a while he passed another one it was moving along the ceiling with a faint clicking noise cleaning it he turned the corner and almost walked into gurder youre up yes said masklin er were on the ship right its amazing gurder began he looked wildeyed and his hair was sticking up at all an gles im sure it is said masklin reassuringly but theres all these and theres great big and there are these huge and youd never believe how wide and theres so much gurders voice trailed off he looked like a nome who would have to learn new words before he could describe things its too big he blurted out he grabbed mas klins arm come on he said and half ran along the cor ridor how did you get on said masklin trying to keep up it was amazing angalo touched this panel thing and it just moved aside and then we were inside and there was an elevator thing and then we were in this great big room with a seat and terry pratchett angalo sat down and all these lights came on and he started pressing buttons and moving things didnt you try to stop him gurder rolled his eyes you know angalo and machines he said but the thing is trying to get him to be sensible otherwise wed be crashing into stars by now he added gloomily he led the way through another arch into well it had to be a room it was inside the ship it was just as well he knew that masklin thought because otherwise hed think it was outside it stretched away as big as one of the departments in the store vast screens and complicatedlooking panels covered the walls most of them were dark shad owy gloom stretched away in every direction ex cept for a little puddle of light in the very center of the room it illuminated angalo in a big padded chair he had the thing in front of him on a sloping metal board studded with switches he had obviously been arguing with it when masklin walked up he glared at him and said it wont do what i tell it the thing looked as small and black and square as it could he wants to drive the ship it said youre a machine you have to do what youre told snapped angalo im an intelligent machine and i dont want to end wings up very flat at the bottom of a deep hole said the thing you cant pilot the ship yet how do you know you wont let me try i drove the truck didnt i it wasnt my fault all those trees and streetlights and things got in the way he added after catching masklins eye i expect the ship is more difficult said mas klin diplomatically but im learning about it all the time said angalo its easy all the buttons have got little pictures on them look he pressed a button one of the big screens lit up showing the crowds outside the ship theyve been waiting there for ages said gurder what do they want said angalo search me said gurder who knows what humans want masklin stared at the throng below the ship theyve been trying all sorts of stuff said an galo flashing lights and music and stuff like that and radio too the thing says havent you tried talking back to them said masklin no havent got anything to say said angalo he rapped on the thing with his knuckles right mr clever if im not going to do the driving who is me terry pratchett how there is a slot by the seat i see it its the same size as you put me in it angalo shrugged and picked up the thing it slid smoothly into the floor until only the top of it was showing look er said angalo cant i do something operate the windshield wipers or something id feel like a twerp sitting here doing nothing the thing didnt seem to hear him its light flickered on and off for a moment as if it were making itself comfortable in a mechanical kind of way then it said in a much deeper voice than it had ever used before right lights came on all over the ship they spread out from the thing like a tide panels lit up like little skies full of stars big lights in the ceiling flickered on there was a distant banging and fiz zing as electricity was woken up and the air be gan to smell of thunderstorms its like the store at christmas fayre said gurder science breathed angalo all systems in working order boomed the thing name our destination what said masklin and dont shout where are we going said the thing you have to name our destination wings its got a name already its called the quarry isnt it said masklin where is it said the thing its masklin waved an arm vaguely well its over that way somewhere which way how should i know how many ways are there thing are you telling us you dont know the way back to the quarry said gurder that is correct were lost wo i know exactly what planet ise re on said the thing we cant be lost said gurder were here we know where we are we just dont know where we arent cant you find the quarry if you go up high enough said angalo you ought to be able to see it if you go up high enough very well can i do it said angalo please press down with your left foot and pull back on the green lever then said the thing there wasnt so much a noise as a change in the type of silence masklin thought he felt heavy for a moment but then the sensation passed the picture in the screen got smaller now this is what i call proper flying said terby pratchett angalo happily with real science no noise and none of that stupid flapping yes wheres pion said masklin he wandered off said gurder i think he was going to get something to eat on a machine that no nome has been on for fifteen thousand years said masklin gurder shrugged well maybe theres some thing at the back of a cupboard somewhere he said i want a word with you masklin yes gurder moved closely and glanced over his shoulder at angalo who was lying back in the control seat with a look of dreamy contentment on his face he lowered his voice we shouldnt be doing this he said i know its a dreadful thing to say after all weve been through but this isnt just our ship it belongs to all nomes everywhere he looked relieved when masklin nodded a year ago you didnt even believe there were any other nomes anywhere masklin said gurder looked sheepish yes well that was then this is now i dont know what i believe in anymore except that there must be thousands of nomes out there we dont know about there might even be other nomes living in stores were just the lucky ones who had the thing so if we wings take the ship away there wont be any hope for them i know i know said masklin wretchedly but what can we do we need the ship right now anyway how could we find these other nomes weve got the ship said gurder masklin waved a hand at the screen where the landscape was spreading out and becoming misty itd take forever to find nomes down there you couldnt do it even with the ship youd have to be on the ground nomes keep hidden you nomes in the store didnt know about my people and we lived a few miles away wed never have found pions people except by accident besideshe couldnt resist prodding gurder gentlytheres a bigger problem too you know what we nomes are like those other nomes probably wouldnt even believe in the ship he was immediately sorry hed said that gurder looked more unhappy than hed ever seen him thats true the abbot said i wouldnt have believed it im not sure i believe it now and im in it maybe when weve found somewhere to live we can send the ship back and collect any other nomes we can find masklin hazarded im sure angalo would enjoy that gurders shoulders began to shake for a mo ment masklin thought the nome was laughing terry pratchett and then he saw the tears rolling down the ab bots face um he said not knowing what else to say gurder turned away im sorry he muttered its just that theres so much changing why cant things stay the same for five minutes every time i get the hang of an idea it suddenly turns into something different and turn into a fool all i want is something real to believe in wheres the harm in that i think you just have to have a flexible mind said masklin knowing even as he said the words that this probably wasnt going to be a lot of help flexible flexible my minds got so flexible i could pull it out of my ears and tie it under my chin snapped gurder and it hasnt done me a whole lot of good let me tell you id have done better just believing everything i was taught when i was young at least id be wrong only once this way im wrong all the time he stamped away down one of the corridors masklin watched him go not for the first time he wished he believed in something as much as gurder did so he could complain to it about his life he even wished he were back yes back in the hole it hadnt been too bad apart from people being cold and wet and getting eaten all the time but at least hed been with grimma they would have been cold and wings wet and hungry together he wouldnt have been so lonely there was a movement by him it turned out to be pion holding a tray of what had to be fruit masklin decided he put aside being lonely for a moment and realized that hunger had been waiting for an opportunity to make itself felt hed never seen fruit that shape and color he took a slice from the proffered tray it tasted like a nutty lemon its kept well considering he said weakly where did you get it it turned out to come from a machine in a nearby corridor it looked fairly simple there were hundreds of pictures of different sorts of food if you touched a picture there was a brief humming noise and then the real food dropped onto a tray in a slot masklin tried pictures at ran dom and got several different sorts of fruit a squeaky green vegetable thing and a piece of meat that tasted rather like smoked salmon i wonder how it does it he said aloud a voice from the wall beside him said would you understand if i told you about molecular breakdown and reassembly from a wide range of raw materials no said masklin truthfully then its all done by science oh well thats all right then that is you thing isnt it yes tebby pratchett chewing on the fishmeat masklin wandered back to the control room and offered some of the food to angalo the big screen was showing noth ing but clouds wont see any quarry in all this he said angalo pulled one of the levers back a bit there was that brief feeling of extra weight again they stared at the screen wow said angalo that looks familiar said masklin he patted his clothes until he found the folded crumpled map theyd brought all the way from the store he spread it out and glanced from it to the screen the screen showed a disc made up mainly of different shades of blue and wispy bits of cloud any idea what it is said angalo no but i know what some of the bits are called said masklin that one thats thick at the top and thin at the bottom is called south amer ica look its just like it is on the map only it should have the words south america written on it still cant see the quarry though said an galo masklin looked at the image in front of them south america grimma had talked about south america hadnt she thats where the frogs lived in flowers shed said that once you knew about wings things like frogs living in flowers you werent the same person he was beginning to see what she meant never mind about the quarry for now he said the quarry can wait we should get there as soon as possible for every body s sake said the thing masklin thought about this for a while it was true he had to admit all kinds of things might be happening back home he had to get the ship back quickly for everybodys sake and then he thought ive spent a long time do ing things for everybodys sake just for once im going to do something for me i dont think we can find other nomes with this ship but at least i know where to look for frogs thing he said take us to south america and dont argue frogs some people think that knowing about frogs is important they are small and green or yellow and have four legs they croak young frogs are tadpoles in my opinion this is all there is to know about frogs from a scientific encyclopediaor the enquiring young nome by angalo de haberdasheri find a blue planet focus this is a planet most of it is covered with wa ter but its still called earth find a country focus blues and greens and browns under the sun and long wisps of rain cloud being torn by the mountains focus on a mountain green and dripping and theres a focus tree hung with moss and covered with flowers and focus on a flower with a little pool in it is an epiphytic bromeliad wings its leaves although they might be petals hardly quiver at all as three very small and very golden frogs pull themselves up and gaze in astonishment at the fresh clear water two of them look at their leader waiting for it to say something suitable for this historic occasion its going to say mipmip and then they slide down the leaf and into the water although the frogs can spot the difference be tween day and night theyre a bit hazy on the whole idea of time they know that some things happen after other things really intelligent frogs might wonder if there is something that prevents everything happening all at once but thats about as close as they can get to it so how long it was before a strange night came in the middle of the day is hard to tell from a frog point of view a wide black shadow drifted over the treetops and came to a halt after a while there were voices the frogs could hear them although they didnt know what they meant or even what they were they didnt sound like the kind of voices frogs were used to what they heard went like this how many mountains are there anyway i mean its ridiculous who needs this many moun tains i call it inefficient one would have done terry pratchett ill go mad if i see another mountain how many more have we got to search i like them and some of the trees are the wrong height i like them too gurder and i dont trust angalo doing the driving i think hes getting better gurder well i just hope no more airplanes come flying around thats all gurder and masklin swung in a crude basket made out of bits of metal and wire it hung from a square hatchway under the ship there were still huge rooms in the ship that they hadnt explored yet odd machines were ev erywhere the thing had said the ship had been used for exploring masklin hadnt quite trusted any of it there probably were machines that could have lowered and pulled up the basket easily but hed preferred to loop the wire around a pillar inside the ship and with pion helping inside to pull themselves up and down by sheer nomish effort the basket bumped gently on the tree branch the trouble was that humans wouldnt leave them alone no sooner had they found a likely looking mountain than airplanes or helicopters would buzz around like insects around an eagle it was distracting masklin looked along the branch gurder was right this would have to be the last mountain wings but there certainly were flowers here he crawled along the branch until he reached the nearest flower it was three times as high as he was he found a foothold and pulled himself up there was a pool in there six little yellow eyes peered up at him masklin stared back so it was true after all he wondered if there was anything he should say to them if there was anything they could pos sibly understand it was quite a long branch and quite thick but there were tools and things in the ship they could let down extra wires to hold the branch and winch it up when it was cut free it would take some time but that didnt matter it was impor tant the thing had said there were ways of growing plants under lights the same color as the sun in pots full of a sort of weak soup that helped plants grow it should be the easiest thing to keep a branch alive the easiest thing in the world if they did everything carefully and gently the frogs would never know if the world was a bathtub the progress of the ship through it would be like the soap shooting backward and forward and never being where anyone expected it to be you could spot where it terry pratchett had just been by airplanes and helicopters taking off in a hurry or maybe it was like the ball in a roulette wheel bouncing around and looking for the right number or maybe it was just lost they searched all night if there was a night it was hard to tell the thing tried to explain that the ship went faster than the sun although the sun actually stood still some parts of the world had night while other parts had day this gurder said was bad organization in the store he said it was always dark when it should be even if it was just somewhere built by humans it was the first time theyd heard him admit the store was built by humans there didnt seem to be anywhere that looked familiar masklin scratched his chin the store was in a place called blackbury he said i know that much so the quarry couldnt have been far away angalo waved his hand irritably at the screens yes but its not like the map he said they dont stick names on places its ridiculous hows anyone supposed to know where anywhere is all right said masklin but youre not to fly down low again to try to read the signposts every wings time you do that humans rush out into the streets and we get lots of shouting on the radio thats right said the thing people are bound to get excited when they see a tenmillionton starship try ing to fly down the street i was very careful last time said angalo stoutly i even stopped when the traffic lights went red i dont see why there was such a fuss all the trucks and cars started crashing into one another too and you call me a bad driver gurder turned to pion who was learning the language fast the geese nomes did they were used to meeting nomes who spoke other lan guages your geese never got lost he said how did they manage it they just did not get lost said pion they knew always where they going it can be like that with animals said masklin theyve got instincts its like knowing things without knowing you know them i dont know said gurder why doesnt the thing know it could find floridia so somewhere important like blackbury ought to be no trouble i can find no radio messages about blackbury there are plenty about florida said the thing at least land somewhere said gurder angalo pressed a couple of buttons theres just sea under us right now he said andwhats that terry pratchett below the ship and a long way off something tiny and white skimmed over the clouds could be goose said pion i dont think so said angalo carefully he twiddled a knob im really learn ing about this stuff he said the picture of the screen flickered a bit and then expanded there was a white dart sliding across the sky is it the concorde said gurder yes said angalo its going a bit slow isnt it only compared to us said angalo follow it said masklin we dont know where its going said angalo in a reasonable tone of voice i do said masklin you looked out the win dow when we were on the concorde we were going toward the sun yes it was setting said angalo well its morning now its going toward the sun again masklin pointed out well what about it it means its going home angalo bit his lip while he worked this out i dont see why the sun has to rise and set in different places said gurder who refused even to try to understand basic astronomy going home said angalo ignoring him right i see it so we go with it yes wings yes angalo ran his hands over the ships controls right he said here we go i expect the con corde drivers will probably be quite pleased to have some company up here the ship drew level with the plane its moving around a lot said angalo and its starting to go faster too i think they may be worried about the ship said masklin cant see why said angalo cant see why at all were not doing anything except following them i wish we had some proper windows said gurder wistfully we could wave have humans ever seen a ship like this be fore angalo asked the thing no but they ve made up stories about ships coming from other worlds yes theyd do that said masklin half to him self thats just the sort of thing theyd do sometimes they say the ships will contain friendly people thats us said angalo and sometimes they say they will contain monsters with wavy tentacles and big teeth the nomes looked at one another gurder cast an apprehensive eye over his shoul der terry pratchett then they all stared at the passages that radi ated off the control room like alligators said masklin worse er gurder said we did look in all the rooms didnt we its something they made up gurder its not real said masklin whoever would want to make up something like that humans would said masklin huh said angalo nonchalantly trying to swivel around in the chair in case any tentacled things with teeth were trying to creep up on him i cant see why i think i can ive been thinking about humans a lot cant the thing send a message to the con corde drivers said gurder something like dont worry we havent got any teeth and tenta cles guaranteed they probably wouldnt believe us said an galo ifhad teeth and tentacles all over the place thats just the sort of message id send cunning the concorde screamed across the top of the sky breaking the transatlantic record the ship drifted along behind it i reckon said angalo looking down that humans are just about intelligent enough to be crazy wings i think said masklin that maybe theyre in telligent enough to be lonely the plane touched down with its tires scream ing fire engines raced across the airport and there were other vehicles behind them the great black ship shot over them turned across the sky like a frisbee and slowed theres the reservoir said gurder right un der us and thats the railway line and thats the quarry its still there of course its still there idiot muttered an galo as he headed the ship toward the hills which were patchy with melting snow some of it said masklin a pall of black smoke hung over the quarry as they got closer they saw it was rising from a burning truck there were more trucks around it and also several humans who started to run when they saw the shadow of the ship lonely eh snarled angalo if theyve hurt a single nome theyll wish theyd never been born if theyve hurt a single nome theyll wish fd never been born said masklin but i dont think anyones down there they wouldnt hang around if the humans came and who set fire to the truck yay said angalo waving a fist in the air masklin scanned the landscape below them somehow he couldnt imagine people like terry pratchett grimma and dorcas sitting in holes waiting for humans to take over trucks didnt just set fire to themselves a couple of buildings looked damaged too humans wouldnt have done that would they he stared at the field by the quarry the gate had been smashed and a pair of wide tracks led through the slush and mud i think they got away in another truck he said what do you mean yayy said gurder lagging a bit behind the conversation across the fields said angalo itd get stuck wouldnt it masklin shook his head perhaps even a nome could have instincts follow the tracks he said urgently and quickly quickly quickly do you know how difficult it is to make this thing go slow angalo nudged a lever the ship lurched up the hillside straining at the indignity of restraint theyd been up here before on foot months ago it was hard to believe the hills were quite flat on the top forming a kind of plateau overlooking the airport there was the field where there had been potatoes there was the thicket where theyd hunted and the wood where theyd killed a fox for eating nomes and there there was something small and yellow rolling across the fields wings angalo craned forward looks like some kind of a machine he admit ted fumbling for levers without taking his eyes off the screen weird kind of one though there were other things moving on the roads down there they had flashing lights on top those cars are chasing it do you think said angalo maybe they want to talk to it about a burning truck said masklin can you get to it before they do angalo narrowed his eyes listen i think we can get to it before they do even if we go via floridia he found another lever and gave it a nudge there was the briefest flicker in the landscape and the truck was now right in front of them see he said move in more said masklin angalo pressed a button see the screen can show you below he be gan theres nomes said gurder yeah and those cars are running away shouted angalo thats it run away otherwise its teeth and tentacles time so long as the nomes dont think that too said gurder masklin do you think once again masklin wasnt there terry pratchett i should have thought about this before he thought the piece of branch was thirty times longer than a nome theyd been keeping it under lights and it seemed to be growing quite happily with one end in a pot of special plant water the nomes who had once flown in the ship had grown lots of plants that way pion helped him drag the pot toward the hatch the frogs watched masklin with interest when it was positioned as well as the two of them could manage masklin let the hatch open it wasnt one that slid aside the ancient nomes had used it as some kind of elevator but it didnt have wiresit went up and down by some force as mysterious as aunties gravy or whatever that was it dropped away masklin looked down and saw the yellow truck roll to a halt when he straightened up pion was giving him a puzzled look flower is a message said the boy yes kind of not using words no said masklin why not masklin shrugged dont know how to say them it nearly ends there but it shouldnt end there wings nomes swarmed all over the ship if there were any monsters with tentacles and teeth theyd have been overwhelmed by sheer force of nome young nomes filled the control room where they were industriously trying to press buttons dorcas and his trainee engineers had disappeared in search of the ships engines voices and laugh ter echoed along the gray corridors masklin and grimma sat by themselves watch ing the frogs in their flower i had to see if it was true said masklin the most wonderful thing in the world said grimma you know a bromeliad looks quite dif ferent from what i expected no i think there are probably much more wonderful things in the world said masklin but its pretty good all the same grimma told him about events in the quarry the fight with the humans and the stealing of the cat to escape her eyes gleamed when she talked about fighting humans masklin looked at her with his mouth open in admiration she was muddy her dress was torn her hair looked like it had been combed with a hedge but she crackled with so much internal energy that she nearly was throw ing off sparks its a good thing we got here in time he thought humans ought to thank me what are we going to do now she said i dont know said masklin try to find terry pratchett home i suppose or a home according to the thing theres lots of worlds out there with nomes on them just nomes i mean or we can find one all to ourselves a new home that might be even better you know said grimma i think the store nomes would be happier just staying on the ship thats why they like it so much its like being in the store all the outside is outside then id better go along to make sure they re member that there is an outside its sort of my job i suppose said masklin and when weve found somewhere i want to bring the ship back why whatll be here said grimma other nomes oh yes said grimma and humans said masklin we should talk to them what they really want to believe in i mean they spend all their time making up stories about things that dont exist they think its just them selves in the world we never thought like that we always knew there were humans theyre terribly lonely and dont know it he waved his hands vaguely its just that i think we might get along with them he finished theyd turn us into pixies not if we come back in the ship if theres one wings thing even humans can tell its that the ship isnt very pixieish grimma reached out and took his hand well if thats what you really want to do it is ill come back with you there was a sound behind them it was gurder the abbot had a bag slung around his neck and had the drawn determined look of someone who is going to see it through no matter what er ive come to say goodbye he said what do you mean said masklin i heard you say youre coming back in the ship yes but please dont argue gurder looked around ive been thinking about this ever since we got on the ship there are other nomes out there someone ought to tell them about the ship coming back we cant take them now but someone ought to find all the other nomes in the world and make sure that they know about the ship someone ought to be telling them about whats really true it should be me dont you think ive got to be useful for something all by yourself said masklin gurder rummaged in the bag no im taking the thing he said producing the black cube terry pratchett er masklin began dont worry said the thing have copied my self into the ships own computers i can be here and there at the same time its something i really want to do said gurder helplessly masklin thought about arguing and then thought why gurder will probably be happier like this anyway its true this ship belongs to all nomes were just borrowing it for a while so gurders right someones got to find the rest of them wherever they are in the world and tell them the truth about nomes i cant think of any one better for the job than gurder its a big world you need someone really ready to believe really hard do you want anyone to go with you he said no i expect ill find some nomes out there to help me ive been talking to pion he leaned closer to tell the truth he said im looking forward to it er yes theres a lot of world though said masklin you cant be sure youll find any help ill have to hope then well if youre sure said masklin doubtfully yes more sure than anything i can remem ber said gurder and ive been pretty sure of a lot of things in my time as you know wings wed better find somewhere suitable to set you down said masklin thats right said gurder he tried to look brave somewhere with a lot of geese he said they left him at sunset by a lake it was a brief parting if the ship stayed any where for more than a few minutes now humans would flock toward it you were wrong to let him go said grimma as they closed the hatch he doesnt even know how to steer a goose i told him that and he said that pion gave him a few hints and if he couldnt find any goose nomes then hed learn himself said masklin he said that if the floridians could do it then he could too he was very definite about it hed learn gurder just like that said grimma well you learned how to drive the cat said masklin huh that was different i had to maybe there are things he has to do too hes got a chance why should we try to stop him but were his friends thats what i mean said masklin the last they saw of gurder was a small wav ing figure on the shore and then there was just a lake turning into a green dot on a dwindling land terry pratchett scape a world unfolded with one invisible nome in the middle of it and then there was nothing the control room was full of nomes watching the landscape unroll as the ship rose grimma stared at it i never realized it looked like that said grimma theres so much of it its pretty big said masklin youd think one world would be big enough for all of us said grimma oh i dont know said masklin maybe one world isnt big enough for anyone where are we heading angalo angalo rubbed his hands and pulled every lever right back so far up he said with satisfaction that there is no down the ship curved away toward the stars below the world stopped unrolling because it had reached its edges and became a black disc against the sun nomes and frogs looked down on it and the sunlight caught it and made it glow around the rim sending rays up into the darkness so that it looked exactly like a flower about the author terry pratchett is the author of the im mensely satisfying group of
