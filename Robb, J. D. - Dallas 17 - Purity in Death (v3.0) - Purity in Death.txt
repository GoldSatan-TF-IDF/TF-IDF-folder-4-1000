prologue the heat was murder july flexed her sweaty muscles eyed the goal and dropkicked new york into the sweltering steambath of summer some managed to escape fleeing to their shore homes where they could sip cold drinks and bask in ocean breezes while they did their business via telelink some loaded up on supplies and hunkered down inside their aircooled homes like tribes under siege but most just had to live through it with humatures into the triple digits and no end in sight moods turned surly deodorants failed and petty annoyances elbowed even the mildest of souls toward violence emergency medical centers were jammed with the wounded soldiers of summer many who under normal conditions wouldnt so much as jaywalk saw the inside of police stations and holding tanks forced to call lawyers to explain why they had attempted to throttle a coworker or shove a complete stranger under the wheels of a rapid cab usually once cooled off they didnt know why but sat or stood blankfaced and baffled like someone coming out of a trance but louie k cogburn knew just what he was doing why he did it and how he intended to keep right on doing it he was a smalltime illegals dealer who primarily hawked zoner and jazz to increase his profit margin louie cut the zoner with dried grass scored from city parks and the jazz with baking powder he bought in warehousesized bins his target clientele were middleclass kids between the ages of ten and twelve in the three school districts closest to his lower east side apartment this cut down on travel time and expense he preferred straight middleclass as the poor generally had their own suppliers within the family ranks and the rich copped to the grass and baking powder too quickly the target age group fit louies brand of logic he liked to say if you hooked em young you had a client for life so far this credo hadnt proved out for him as louie had yet to maintain a business relationship with a client through high school graduation still louie took his business seriously every evening when his potential clients were doing their homework he did his he was proud of his bookkeeping and would certainly have earned more per annum as a number cruncher for any midlevel firm than he did dealing but he was a man who felt real men worked for themselves just lately if thered been a wash of dissatisfaction a touch of irritability a jagged edge of despair after he spent an hour running his business programs on his thirdhand desktop he put it off to the heat and the headache the vicious bastard of a headache no dose of his own products could ease he lost three days of work because the pain had become the focus of his world he holed up in his studio flop stewing in the heat blasting his music to cover up the raging storm in his head somebody was going to pay for it thats all he knew somebody goddamn lazyassed super hadnt fixed the climate control he thought this with growing anger while his beady reddened eyes scanned numbers he sat in his underwear by the single open window of his oneroom apartment no breeze came through it but the street noise was horrendous shouts horns squealing tires on pavement he turned up the trash rock he played out of his ancient entertainment unit to drown out the noise to beat at the pain blood trickled out of his nose but he didnt notice louie k rubbed a lukewarm bottle of homebrew over his forehead he wished he had a blaster if he had a goddamn blaster hed lean out the goddamn window and take out a goddamn city block his most violent act to date had been to kick a delinquent client off his airboard but the image of death and destruction fueled him now as he sweated over his books and madness bloomed in his brain like black roses his face was pale as wax rivulets of sweat pouring down from his matted brown hair streaming down his narrow cheeks his ears rang and what felt like an ocean of grease swayed in his belly heat was making him sick he thought he got sick he lost money ought to take it out of the supers hide ought to his hands trembled as he stared at the screen stared at the screen couldnt take his eyes from the screen he had an image of himself going to the window climbing out on the ledge beating his fists at that hot wall of air at the noise at the people below a blaster in his hands doling out death and destruction as he screamed at them screamed and screamed as he leaped hed land on his feet and then the pounding on his door had him spinning around with his teeth bared he climbed back in the window louie k you asshole turn that fucking music down in there go to hell he muttered as he hefted the ball bat he often took to recreation areas to insinuate himself with potential clients go to hell go to hell lets all go to hell you hear me goddamn it yeah i hear you there were spikes big iron spikes drilling into his brain he had to get them out on a thin scream he dropped the bat to tear at his own hair but the pounding wouldnt stop suze is calling the cops you hear me louie you dont turn that shit down suze is calling the cops each word was punctuated with a fist against the door with the music the pounding the shouts the spikes all hammering in his head the sweat drowning him louie picked up the bat again he opened the door and started swinging chapter lieutenant eve dallas loitered at her desk she was stalling and she wasnt proud of it the idea of changing into a fancy dress driving uptown to meet her husband and a group of strangers for a business dinner thinly disguised as a social gathering had all the appeal of climbing in the nearest recycler and turning on shred right now cop central was very appealing shed caught and closed a case that afternoon so there was paperwork it wasnt all stalling but as the bevy of witnesses had all agreed that the guy whod taken a header off a sixstory people glide had been the one whod started the pushyshovey match with the two tourists from toledo it wasnt much of a time sucker for the past several days every case shed caught had been a variation on the same theme domestics where spouses had battled to the death street brawls turned lethal even a deadly combat at a corner glidecart over ice cones heat made people stupid and mean she thought and the combination spilled blood she was feeling a little mean herself at the idea of dressing up and spending several hours in some snooty restaurant making small talk with people she didnt know thats what you got she thought in disgust when you marry a guy who had enough money to buy a couple of continents roarke actually liked evenings like this the fact that he did never failed to baffle her he was every bit at home in a fivestar restaurant one he likely owned anyway nibbling on caviar as he was sitting at home chowing down on a burger and she supposed as their marriage was approaching its second year shed better stop crabbing about it resigned she pushed back from the desk youre still here her aide peabody stopped in the doorway of her office i thought you had some fancy dinner deal uptown i got time a glance at her wrist unit brought on a little tug of guilt okay she was going to be late but not very i just finished up on the glide diver peabody whose summer blues defied all natural order and managed to stay crisp in the wilting heat kept her dark eyes sober you wouldnt be stalling would you lieutenant one of the residents of our city who i am sworn to serve and protect ended up squished like a bug on fifth avenue i think he deserves an extra thirty minutes of my time it must be really rough forced to put on a beautiful dress stick some diamonds or whatever all over you and choke down champagne and lobster croquettes beside the most beautiful man ever born on or off planet i dont know how you get through the day with that weight on your shoulders dallas shut up and here i am free to squeeze into the local pizza place with mcnab where we will split the pie and the check peabody shook her head slowly the dark bowl of hair under her cap swayed in conceit i cant tell you how guilty i feel knowing that you looking for trouble peabody no sir peabody did her best to look pious just offering my support and sympathy at this difficult time kiss ass torn between annoyance and amusement eve started to shove by her desk link beeped shall i get that for you sir and tell them youve gone for the day didnt i tell you to shut up eve turned back to the desk took the transmission homicide dallas sir lieutenant she recognized officer troy truehearts face as it popped onscreen though shed never seen its young allamerican features so strained trueheart lieutenant he repeated after an audible swallow i have an incident in response to oh gosh i killed him officer she pulled his location onscreen as she spoke are you on duty no sir yes sir i dont know exactly pull yourself together trueheart she slapped out the order watched his head jerk as if hed felt it physically report sir i had just clocked off shift and was on my way home on foot when a female civilian shouted for assistance from a window i responded on the fourth floor of the building in question an individual armed with a bat was assaulting the female another individual male was unconscious or dead in the hallway bleeding from the head i entered the apartment where the assault was taking place and lieutenant i tried to stop him he was killing her he turned on me ignored all warnings and orders to desist i managed to draw my weapon to stun i swear i intended to stun but hes dead trueheart look at me listen to me secure the building call in the incident through dispatch and inform them that youve reported to me and im on my way ill call for medical assistance you hold the scene trueheart hold it by the book do you understand yes sir i shouldve called dispatch first i shouldve you stand trueheart im on the way peabody eve commanded as she strode out the door yes sir im with you there were two blackandwhites nosetonose and a medivan humped between them at the curb when eve pulled up the neighborhood was the type where people scattered rather than gathered when cops showed up and as a result there was no more than a smattering of gawkers on the sidewalk who had to be told to stay back the two uniforms who flanked the entrance eyed her then exchanged a look she was brass and the one who could well put one of their own ranks balls in the blender she could feel the chill as she approached cop shouldnt get hassled by cops for doing the job one of them muttered eve paused in midstride and stared him down he saw rank in the form of a long leanly built woman with eyes of gilded brown that were as flat and expressionless as a snakes as they met his her hair short and choppy was nearly the same color and framed a narrow face offset by a wide mouth that was now firmed into one thin line there was a shallow dent in a chin that looked like it could hold its own against a fist under her stare he felt himself shrink cop shouldnt slap at a cop for doing hers she said coldly you got a problem with me officer wait until i do that job then mouth off she moved into the shoe box lobby punched a finger on the up button of the single elevator she was already steaming but it had little to do with the oppressive heat what is it with some uniforms that they want to bite your throat when youre rank its just nerves dallas peabody replied as they stepped onto the elevator most of the uniforms out of central know trueheart and you gotta like him a uniform terminates on his own like this testings going to be brutal testings brutal anyway the best we can do for him is to keep this clean and ordered hes already screwed up by tagging me before he called it in is he going to take heat for that youre the one who pulled him out of the sidewalk scooper detail and into central last winter internal ought to understand iab isnt big on understanding so lets hope it doesnt go there she stepped off the elevator studied the scene hed been smart enough cop enough she noted with some relief not to disturb the bodies two men lay sprawled in the corridor one of them facedown in a pool of congealing blood the other was faceup staring with some surprise at the ceiling through an open doorway beside the bodies she could hear the sounds of weeping and groaning the door across was also open she noted several fresh holes and dents in the hallway walls splinters of wallboard splatters of blood and what had once been a baseball bat was now a broken club covered with blood and brain matter straight as a soldier pale as a ghost trueheart stood at the doorway his eyes still held the glassy edge of shock lieutenant hold it together trueheart record on peabody eve crouched down to examine the two bodies the bloodied one was big and beefy the kind of mixed fat and muscle build that could usually plow through walls if annoyed enough the back of his skull looked like an egg that had been cracked with a brick the second body wore only a pair of grayed jockey shorts his thin boney frame showed no wounds no bruising no damage thin trickles of blood had seeped out of his ears his nostrils officer trueheart do we have identification on these individuals sir the um initial victim has been identified as ralph wooster who resided in apartment e the man i he broke off as eves head whipped up as her eyes drilled into his and the second individual trueheart wet his lips the second individual is identified as louis k cogburn of apartment f and who is currently wailing inside apartment e suzanne cohen cohabitation partner of ralph wooster she called for aid out the window of said apartment louis cogburn was assaulting her with what appeared to be a club or bat when i arrived onscene at that time he broke off again when eve held up a finger preliminary examination of victims indicates a mixedrace male midthirties approximately two hundred and thirty pounds approximately six foot one has suffered severe trauma to head face and body a bat apparently wooden and marked with blood and brain matter would appear to be the assault weapon the second male also midthirties caucasian approximately one hundred and thirty pounds approximately five foot eight is identified as the assailant cause of death as yet undetermined second vic bled from ears and nose there is no visual trauma or wound she straightened peabody i dont want these bodies touched ill do the field exam after i talk to cohen officer trueheart did you discharge your weapon during the course of this incident yes sir i i want you to surrender that weapon to my aide who will bag it at this time there were grumblings from the two uniforms at the end of the hall but she ignored them as she held truehearts gaze you are not obliged to surrender your weapon without representation present you may request a representative im asking you to give your weapon to peabody so theres no question as to the sequence of this investigation through the shock she saw his absolute trust in her yes sir when he reached down for his weapon she put a hand on his arm since when are you a southpaw trueheart my right arms a little sore were you injured during the course of this incident he got a couple of swings in before the individual you were obliged to draw on assaulted you in the due course of your duties she wanted to shake him why the hell didnt you say so it happened awfully fast lieutenant he rushed me came in swinging and take off your shirt sir lose the shirt trueheart peabody record here he blushed god what an innocent eve thought as trueheart unbuttoned his uniform shirt she heard peabody suck in a breath but whether it was for truehearts undeniably pretty chest or the bruising that exploded over his right shoulder and mottled the arm to the elbow she couldnt be sure he got in a couple of good swings by the look of it i want the mts to take a look at you next time youre hurt on the job officer make it known stand by apartment e was in a shambles though from what was left of the decor eve imagined housekeeping wasnt a high priority of its residents still it was doubtful the place was normally a minefield of broken glass or the walls decorated with surreal paintings of blood splatters the woman on the gurney looked like shed known better days as well a bandage streaked across her left eye and above it below it the skin was raw she coherent eve asked one of the medical technicians just kept her from going all the way under since we figured youd want a word with her make it snappy though he told her we need to get her in shes got a detached cornea shattered cheekbone broken arm guy whaled on her good and proper five minutes miss cohen eve stepped up leaned down im lieutenant dallas can you tell me what happened he went crazy i think he killed ralph just went crazy louis cogburn louie k yeah she moaned ralph was pissed music up so loud you couldnt think straight fucking hot just wanted a couple of brews and a little quiet what the hell louie k he mostly plays the music loud but this was busting our eardrums hes had it wailing for days what did ralph do eve prompted ms cohen ralph went and banged on the door told him to cut it back next i knew louie came busting out swinging a bat or something looked crazy blood was flying he was screaming i was scared really scared so i slammed the door and ran to the window called for help i could hear him screaming out there and these awful thumping sounds i couldnt hear ralph i kept calling for help then he came in who came in louie k didnt even look like louie had blood all over him and something was wrong with his eyes he come at me with the bat i ran tried to run he was smashing everything and screaming about spikes in his head he hit me and i dont remember after that hit me in the face and i dont remember until the mts started working on me did you see or speak with the officer who responded to your call for help i didnt see nothing but stars ralphs dead isnt he a single tear slid down her cheek they wont tell me but louied never have gotten past him less he was dead yeah im sorry did ralph and louie have a history of altercations you mean did they go at it before yelled at each other sometimes about the music but theyd more likely have a couple brews or smoke a little zoner louies just a little squirt of a guy he never caused no problems around here lieutenant one of the mts moved in weve got to transport her all right send somebody in to take a look at my officer he caught a couple solids in the arm and shoulder eve stepped back then moved to the door behind them trueheart youre going to give me a report on record i want it clear i want it detailed yes sir i clocked off at eighteenthirty and proceeded southeast from central on foot what was your intended destination he flushed a little color came and went in his face i was ah proceeding to the home of a friend where i had arrangements for dinner you had a date yes sir as i approached this building i heard calls for assistance and looking up saw a woman leaning out of the window she appeared to be in considerable distress i entered the building proceeded to the fourth floor where i could hear the sounds of an altercation several individuals came to their doors but no one attempted to come out i called requests for someone to call nineeleven did you take the stairs or the elevator details she thought she needed to take him through every detail the stairs sir i thought it would be faster when i reached this floor saw the male identified as ralph wooster lying on the floor of the corridor between apartments e and f i did not at that time check him for injuries as i could hear screaming and breaking glass emitting from e i responded to this immediately and witnessed the individual identified as louis k cogburn assaulting a woman with what appeared to be a baseball bat the weapon was he paused a moment swallowed hard the weapon was covered with what appeared to be blood and gray matter the woman was unconscious on the floor with cogburn above her he held the bat over his head as if preparing to strike another blow i drew my weapon at this time called for the assailant to cease and desist identifying myself as police trueheart had to stop now and rubbed the back of his hand over his mouth the look he sent her was both helpless and pleading lieutenant it all happened fast from there just tell it he turned away from the woman he was screaming something about spikes in his head about blasting out the window crazy stuff then he lifted the bat again shifting so it looked like he was going to strike the woman i moved in to prevent this and he charged me i tried to evade to get the bat he landed a couple of blows i believe it broke at that time and i fell back knocked something over hit the wall i saw him coming at me again i yelled at him to stop trueheart took a steadying breath but it didnt stop the quaver in his voice he cocked the bat back like he was swinging for home and i discharged my weapon its set on low stun lieutenant the lowest setting you can see what happened next he screamed he screamed like ive never heard anything like it he screamed and he ran out into the hall i pursued but he went down i thought he was stunned just stunned but when i got down to put restraints on him i saw he was dead i checked his pulse he was dead i got jumbled up sir i got jumbled up i know it was incorrect procedure to tag you before calling never mind that officer were you at the time you deployed your weapon in fear for your life and or the lives of civilians yes sir yes sir i was did louis k cogburn ignore any and all of your warnings to cease and desist and surrender his weapon yes sir he did you eve pointed to one of the uniforms down the hall escort officer trueheart downstairs medical attention for his injuries has been called for put him in one of the blackandwhites until the mts can see him stay with him until im done in here trueheart call your representative but sir im advising you to call your representative she said im stating here for the record that in my opinion after a cursory examination of the evidence after an interview with suzanne cohen your account of this incident is satisfactory the deployment of your weapon appears to have been necessary to protect your life and the life of civilians thats all i can tell you until my onscene investigation into this matter is complete now i want you to go get off your feet call your rep and let the mts take care of you yes sir thank you sir come on trueheart the other uniform patted trueheart on the back officer any of the beat cops know these dead guys the uniform glanced back at eve proctor has this sector he might get him she said as she sealed up and walked into f hes awful shook peabody said hell have to get over it she scanned the room it was a filthy mess smelling ripely of spoiled food and dirty laundry the cramped kitchen area consisted of a twofoot counter a miniautochef and minifridgie a huge tin sat on the counter eve lifted her brows as she read the label you know i just dont see our louie k baking a lot of cakes she opened one of the two cupboards and perused the neat line of sealed jars looks like louie was in the illegals line funny everything in heres neat as aunt marthas and the rest of the place is a pigsty she turned around no dust on the furniture though thats funny too you wouldnt figure a guy who sleeps on sheets that smell like a swamp would bother chasing dust she opened the closet tidy in here too clothes show a lack of fashion taste but theyre all clean look at that window peabody yes sir glass is clean inside and out somebody washed them within the last couple weeks why do you wash your windows and leave what the hell is this unidentified spilled food substance all over the floor maids week off yeah somebodys week off thats about how long this underwears been piled here she glanced at the door when a uniform stepped in you proctor yes sir you know those two dead guys i know louie k proctor shook his head shit sorry lieutenant but shit this is some mess that kid truehearts down there puking his guts out tell me about louie k and let me worry about trueheart and his guts proctor pokered up smalltime illegals rat went after schoolkids gave them samples of zoner and jazz to lure them in waste of air you ask me did some time but mostly he was pretty slick about it and the illegals guys never got much out of the kids he a violent tendency anything but kept a low profile never gave you lip you told him to move his ass along he moved it hed give you a look now and then like hed like to do more but he never had the guts for it had guts enough to open ralph woosters head bash a woman and assault a uniform mustve been sampling his own products all i can think and thats not profile either he maybe smoked a little zoner now and then but he was too cheap to do more whats out there looks like zeus proctor added with a jerk of the thumb toward the corridor little guy like that going nutso but he never handled anything that hot i heard about okay proctor thanks guy sells illegals to schoolkids worlds better off without him thats not our call eve dismissed him by turning her back she moved to the desk frowned at the computer screen absolute purity achieved what the hell does this mean she asked aloud peabody any new shit on the streets going by the name purity i havent heard of it computer identify purity invalid command frowning she entered her name badge number and authorization identify purity invalid command huh peabody do a run on new and known illegals computer save current display display last task performed the screen wavered then opened a tidy organized spreadsheet detailing inventory profit loss and coded customer base so according to the last task and time logged louie was sitting here very efficiently doing his books when he got a bug up his ass to bust his neighbors head open its hot dallas peabody looked over eves shoulder people can just get crazy yeah maybe it was just that simple yeah they can nothing on his inventory named purity nothing on the current illegals list by that name either so what the hell is it and how was it achieved she stepped back lets take a look at louie k see what he tells us chapter he didnt tell her as much as shed have liked the best she could determine onscene with her field kit was that louie k had died due to neurological meltdown that wasnt exactly the sort of term that elicited sage nods from the brass she passed the body off to the me flagged for priority which meant due to summer hours and summer glut shed be lucky if she got a confirmed pathology by the first frost she meant to push calling in chips with the chief medical examiner meanwhile she spoke with truehearts departmental rep via link and danced the bureaucratic dance she sent the still shaken rookie home and ordered him to stand by for testing then she went back to central to write and rewrite a detailed report on the incident that had resulted in two deaths and one critical injury and though her stomach curdled she followed procedure and copied internal affairs by the time she got home it was well past the dinner hour the lights were on so that the urban fortress roarke had built glowed like a beacon in the night green shadows from grand and leafy trees threw patterns on velvet grass and slid softly over rivers of flowers that were bright and bold by day the lower east side neighborhood that had eaten up most of her evening was a world away from this private paradise of wealth of privilege of indulgence she was almost accustomed to straddling worlds now without losing her balance almost she left her vehicle at the base of the stone steps and jogged up them more out of a desperate desire to shrug off the weight of heat than out of hurry shed barely stepped in taken that first breath of cool clean air when summerset roarkes majordomo appeared in the foyer like an unwelcome vision yes i missed the dinner she said before he could open his mouth yes im a miserable failure as a wife and a poor example of a human being i have no class no courtesy and no sense of decorum i should be dragged naked into the streets and stoned for my sins summerset raised one steel gray eyebrow well that seems to cover it good saves time she started up the stairs is he back just a little annoyed shed given him no opportunity to criticize he frowned after her hed have to be quicker next time when she was sure hed evaporated to wherever hed appeared from eve paused at one of the house screens wheres roarke good evening darling eve roarke is in his office figures business dinner followup she gave one blissful thought to detouring to the bedroom jumping headlong into the shower but guilt had her heading to his office the door was open she could hear his voice she supposed he was refining the details of some deal he had going most likely the one that had involved tonights dinner but she didnt care about the words his voice was poetry seductive in itself even to a woman whod never understood the heart of a poet wisps of ireland trailed through it adding music to what she assumed were dry facts and figures it suited his face one that bore all that wild celtic beauty in its strong sharp bones deep blue eyes in the full firm mouth that might have been sculpted by some canny god on a particularly good day she stepped to the doorway saw that he stood at one of the windows looking out while he dictated his memo hed pulled his hair back she noted all that thick black silk he usually wore loose so that it streamed nearly to his shoulders he still wore his dinner suit black and sleek over his long rangy form you could look and see the elegant businessman madly successful perfectly civilized hed polished himself eve thought but that dangerous celt was still always just beneath the surface it still always allured her she caught a glimpse of it now as he turned though she hadnt made a sound and his eyes met hers sign roarke he said and transmit file copy hagermanross hello lieutenant hi sorry about dinner no youre not she tucked her hands in her pockets it was ridiculous really the way they continually itched to take hold of him im sort of sorry about dinner he grinned that lightning bolt of charm and humor you wouldnt have been as bored as you think youre probably right if id been as bored as i thought id have slipped into a coma but i am sorry i let you down you dont let me down he crossed to her tapped her chin up with his finger and kissed her lightly it adds considerably to my cachet when i apologize for my wife whos been called to duty on a case murder always makes lively dinner conversation whos dead couple of guys downtown smalltime chem dealer whaled on his neighbor with a ball bat then went after a woman and a cop cop took him out roarke lifted a brow more he thought there was a deal more trouble in her eyes than her quick rundown warranted that doesnt seem like the sort of wrangle that would keep you on duty so late the cop was trueheart ah he laid his hands on her shoulders rubbed hows he doing she opened her mouth then shook her head and paced away shit shit shit shit that bad huh kid breaks his cherry its tough enough roarke stroked a hand over the fat cat that sprawled over the console then gave galahad a little nudge to move him along thats an interesting way to put it there are cops who go through the whole life of the job without deploying kids in uniform under a year and hes racked up a termination it changes everything did it for you your first termination on the job he added they both knew shed killed long before she had a badge it was different for me she often wondered if the way shed started life made death somehow different for her a cold and personal insult trueheart hes barely twentytwo and hes shiny yet pity a dark slippery blossom bloomed inside her she crouched down gave galahad an absent scratch under the chin he wont sleep tonight hell go over it and over it and over it in his head if id done this if id done that and tomorrow she rubbed her hands over her face as she straightened i cant block testing for him i cant stop the process she knew what it was stripped bare monitored questioned forced to let machines and techs into your head into your gut like a tumor are you worried he wont pass through it she glanced over took the glass of wine hed poured her hes tougher than he looks but hes scared down to the bone and hes swimming in guilt take all that guilt all those doubts into testing they can drown you and theres got to be an investigation internal why is that she sat gave him the details while the cat leaped up and kneaded a nest in her lap it helped clear her mind to say it aloud particularly to someone who caught on quickly and saw the full picture before you painted in all the lines a uniforms stunner cant terminate under those conditions yeah eve nodded exactly it would have to be on full stun and jammed on the throat pulse even then it would take more than one jolt which means truehearts version of the events doesnt quite hold iab wouldnt think so she knew and ran it through for herself as she would for them he was under serious duress a civilian dead another in extreme jeopardy himself injured is that how youre going to play it with iab yeah he always saw the whole picture pretty close to that she drummed her fingers restlessly on her thigh on the cat sipped her wine i need the mes report but theres no way its going to come out trueheart terminated with deliberation panic okay hell take a slap for panic thirty days suspension some mandatory therapy i cant get in the way of it its already dicey for him because he tagged me instead of calling it in through dispatch iab smells coverup and the kids finished roarke sat sipped his own wine have you considered speaking to your old friend webster she tapped her fingers on the arm of her chair now and kept her gaze steady on roarkes there might have been amusement on his face or something else it was often tough to call don webster wasnt precisely an old friend he had been very briefly and years before a lover the fact that he for reasons that would never be clear to eve had never gotten over that single night theyd shared had caused a violent and fascinating altercation between him and roarke it wasnt something she wanted to repeat maybe unless youre thinking thatd be a nice opportunity to pound his face in again roarke sipped smiled i believe webster and i have a reasonable understanding i cant fault him for being attracted to my wife as im very attracted to her myself and he knows that if he puts his hands on whats mine again ill break every bone in his body into small jagged pieces it works well for us great dandy she said it between her teeth hes over it he said so she added and roarke merely smiled again lazily now catlike you know what ive got enough to think about so were just not going to go there tonight i want to call the commander she said and i cant i have to play this by every page in the book kid was dog sick after nothing i could do for him hell be all right mum her eyes narrowed careful im the one who brought him in out of homicide lite i put him in the hospital a few months ago eve all right all right i put him in a situation where he ended up in the hospital now hes dealing with a suspicious termination ive got a responsibility youd see it that way he grazed his hand over the backs of her restless ringers thats what makes you what you are and why he called it in to you first he was scared he was shaken the taking of a life isnt a simple matter for most and it shouldnt be doesnt it make him a better cop that he felt something yeah and ill use that too it just doesnt hang roarke just doesnt hang she said as she got to her feet to pace again annoyed the cat shot his tail into the air and stalked out of the room no burn marks on his throat if trueheart had zapped him that way there should have been marks why werent there could he have used another weapon one with lethal power she shook her head i dont know anyone less likely to carry a drop piece if im wrong about him where is it it wasnt on him it wasnt in either apartment i had the recyclers checked his call to me came in minutes after the termination no time to think clearly enough to ditch one safely besides when you go back through it the whole thing doesnt make sense she sat again leaned in take this louie k the beat cop the neighbors even the woman he attacked all describe him as your basic lowlife wimp preyed on schoolkids hes got a sheet but nothing on it with violence no assaults no batteries no weapons of any kind in his flop the bat he played ball so hes sitting there in his underwear doing his books tidy books filthy apartment but not logically filthy cupboards are organized windows are washed but theres food and dirty dishes ripe laundry tossed around its like he got sick or went on a bender for a week she scooped her hand through her hair as she brought the picture of his cramped little apartment into her head pictured him in it sitting in the heat at his desk unit by the open window sweating through his jockey shorts hes got the music up to earblasting nothing new according to neighbors ralph from across the hall goes over and bangs on the door again nothing new but this time instead of turning the music down louie k picks up his bat and beats his sometime drinking buddy to death with it cracks his skull she continued turns his face to jelly beats down hard enough to crack a good solid baseball bat neighbor outweighs louie k by better than a hundred pounds but he doesnt get a chance to put a mark on him he knew she was seeing it now pulling images into her brain of what had happened though she hadnt been there she would see it its tough to fight back if your brains are leaking out of your ears yeah thats a disadvantage but then screaming all the while louie k kicks in the neighbors door and goes after the woman cop responds and louie goes for him the heat can turn people yeah it can it brings out the mean but the sucker was sitting there doing his books making entries just like he did every evening about that time it doesnt feel right frowning she leaned back on roarkes desk you know of any illegal that goes by purity no neither does anyone else when i went into his apartment his screen was on it said absolute purity achieved what the hell is absolute purity and how was it achieved if its something new why would a smalltime playground dealer be in on the ground floor ive been asking myself that the computer wouldnt identify even with my authorization code so ive sent it into edd cant bring feeney in she mused looks wrong to tag the head of electronics detective division for a standard data search you couldve tagged me talk about looking wrong besides you were working so i was and eating which i imagine you werent hungry now that you mention it what did you have hmm chilled plum soup crab salad and an excellent grilled turbot huh eve pushed to her feet i could go for a burger somehow i knew that later eve lay awake staring at the ceiling as she reconstructed data evidence theory none of it felt right she thought but couldnt be sure how much of that was influenced by concern over a young promising cop he had a good brain and an idealism that was as bright and shiny as polished silver purity she thought again if she had to use one word to define it it would be trueheart hed lost some of that purity today some she knew hed never be able to get back he would suffer for it more than he should and she wasnt being a mommy she thought turning her head just enough to scowl at roarke in the dark well then he shifted toward her sliding his hands unerringly over her breasts since youve all this energy whatre you talking about im sleeping here youre not not with your mind racing around loud enough to wake the dead why dont i just give you a hand with all that energy as he pulled her against him she chuckled ive got news for you ace thats not your hand thirtysix blocks away troy trueheart lay in the dark staring at the ceiling no one shared his bed to offer comfort or distraction all he could see printed on the dark was the face of the man hed killed he knew he should take a departmentally approved tranq but he was afraid to sleep hed see it all again in his dreams just as he could see it all as he lay awake the splatter of blood and bone and worse all over the walls of that dank hallway even here in his tidy apartment he could smell it the way the heat ripened the stench of blood of gore he could hear the screams the womans no more than a howl of terror and awful pain and the mans louis k cogburn the mans screams like a wild animals mad from the hunt the voices of other tenants shouting out from behind locked doors calls booming up into the windows from the street and his own heart raging in his chest why hadnt he called for backup the minute hed heard the woman calling for help he should have called for backup but hed rushed inside thinking only to protect and serve hed shouted back he had at least he had shouted as hed rushed up those stairs for someone to call no one had he realized that now no one had or cops would have come long before lieutenant dallas how could people stand behind locked doors and do nothing while their neighbor was crying for help he would never understand it hed seen the man in the hallway far beyond anyones help hed seen that felt his stomach lurch and the blood roar into his head in a buzzing white noise that was the sound of fear yes hed been afraid very afraid but it was his job to go through the door the open door he thought now go through it and into the screams and the blood and the madness what then what then police drop your weapon drop the weapon now his stunner was in his hand hed drawn it on the way up he was sure of that the man louis k cogburn he had turned the bloody bat hitched in both hands like a batter at the plate tiny eyes trueheart thought now tiny eyes almost disappearing in a thin face that was red from rage and secondhand blood darker blood fresher blood leaked from his nose just remembered that he thought did it matter hed charged a madman in jockey shorts whod moved like lightning the bat had come down on his shoulder so fast so hard stumbled back nearly lost the stunner terror bright as blood the man louis k cogburn hed whirled back toward the woman she was down dazed weeping helpless the bat swung up high a death blow but then he jittered his eyes oh god his eyes demon red went wide jumped inside his skull his body jolted jolted like a puppet dancing on string as he ran by out in the hall he danced still dancing then he fell sort of folded up and dropped faceup to stare at the ceiling with those awful red eyes dead dead and im standing over him i killed a man today trueheart buried his face in his pillow trying to erase the images that wanted to play in his brain and he wept for the dead in the morning eve put in a call to chief medical examiner morris and tried not to sound too snarly when she was forced to leave a message on his voice mail if necessary shed make time to go down to the morgue and speak with him personally in fact that was just what she was going to do and get another look at cogburns body as much at it irked she put a call into don webster in internal affairs this time she didnt bother to play down the annoyance when she was transferred to voice mail the rat squads got some cushy hours us real cops are already on duty give me a call webster when you toddle in for your day of riding the desk and sniffing up dirt on fellow officers probably not smart to annoy him she thought as she broke transmission then again if she tried to sweettalk webster hed know she was up to something lieutenant cap in hand trueheart stood in her doorway you sent for me thats right trueheart come in close the door she wasnt crossing any lines by calling him to her office prior to testing she was primary on the case that was her story she thought and she was sticking to it sit down trueheart he looked every bit as pale and holloweyed as shed expected somehow he managed to stay at attention even seated she programmed her autochef for two coffees black whether he wanted one or not rough night yes sir youre going to have a rougher day testings no walk on the beach no sir ive heard you better be up for it look at me when i speak to you officer she snapped it out watched his head come up and his weary eyes focus you put on the uniform you pick up the badge you holster the weapon and you take on everything that means was your termination of louis k cogburn justifiable i dont yes or no theres no middle here no qualifications your gut trueheart was the deployment of your weapon necessary yes sir if you walked into the same situation today would you again deploy your weapon he shuddered but he nodded yes sir thats the core of it she passed him the coffee you hold on to the core of it youll get through the rest dont try to outthink testing you havent got the brass for it yet answer correctly answer truthfully and however they twist the question of justification you deployed your weapon justifiably to preserve the life of a civilian and your own yes sir jesus trueheart youre an agreeable bastard at what distance were you from the subject when you deployed i think dont think how far six feet maybe five and a half how many jolts did you give him two did your weapon at any time during the altercation come in direct contact with the subject contact he looked baffled for a moment oh no sir i was down and he was moving away when i deployed then he turned moving toward me when i deployed the second time what did you do with the drop piece the pure shock jolted over his face she watched it turn pink with what could only be indignation sir i had no secondary weapon nor do i own one i had only the street stunner which im authorized to carry and which you took into evidence at the scene sir i resent save it she leaned back if they dont ask you that question in testing ill be surprised you can bet your ass iab will ask it and theyll push so save the moral outrage for them dont you drink coffee trueheart yes sir he looked miserably into the cup then lifted it sipped his breath sucked in this isnt coffee yeah it is its real coffee got a lot more going for it than that veggie crap doesnt it you could use the extra kick today listen to me troy youre a good cop and with some seasoning youll be a better one terminations arent supposed to be easy we shouldnt be able to shrug off the taking of any life like it was nothing or we skirt too close to being what were here to put away i wish i wish thered been another way there wasnt and dont forget that its okay to be sorry even a little guilty but its not okay to feel anything less than absolutely confident that you did what had to be done given the circumstances you let them see youre not sure and theyll rip you up like a leopard does a gazelle i had to do it he held the coffee tight in both hands as if he were afraid it would jump out of his grip lieutenant i played it in my head a hundred different ways last night i couldnt have done anything else hed have killed that woman hed probably have killed me and anyone else who got in the way but i made mistakes i shouldve called for backup before entering the building i should have called it in to dispatch instead of tagging you yeah those are mistakes she nodded pleased hed thought it through picked it apart neither of which would have changed the termination but they were mistakes that may cost you a little shine why didnt you call for backup i reacted the woman appeared to be in immediate jeopardy i did shout orders for someone to call nineeleven once i was inside but i should have done so personally if id been unsuccessful in stopping the perpetrator had no backup en route more lives could have been lost good lesson learned why did you call me instead of dispatch i was lieutenant i wasnt thinking straight i realized both men were dead that i had terminated the assailant and i you were disoriented from the blows you received she said briskly you had some concerns that you might lose consciousness your immediate thought was to report the homicide and the termination and you did so by contacting the homicide lieutenant you have worked with in the past are you getting this trueheart yes sir you were in physical and mental distress the lieutenant to whom you relayed your situation ordered you to secure the scene and stand until her arrival you did so it wasnt procedure no but itll hold be sure you do i didnt bring you in off sidewalk detail to watch you wash out ill get mandatory thirtyday suspension possibly probably i can take it i dont want to lose my badge youre not going to lose your badge report to testing officer trueheart she got to her feet and show them what youre made of she put in another nagging call to morris then decided to swing into edd before she nabbed peabody and headed to the morgue edd always baffled her how anybody got anything done when they were all pacing around talking on headsets or burrowed in cubes arguing with computers was beyond her and they rarely dressed like cops mcnab the skinny fashion plate who was currently engaged in activities on and off shift with peabody that eve didnt like to think about might have been the most outrageous of the bunch but he didnt win by much she retreated as quickly as possible into feeneys dull workingmans office his door was open he rarely shut it even when he was as now scouring a subordinate over some screwup you think the units in here are for your amusement and entertainment halloway you figure you can kick back and play a little space crusader on the taxpayers nickel no sir captain i wasnt this department isnt your frigging toy box captain it was my lunch break and you got time for lunch feeneys basset hound face registered shock amazement and a secret joy well thats fascinating halloway i can promise you for the next little while lunch breaks are going to be a fond fond memory you may not have noticed since youve been so busy saving the virtual universe while you tuck into a sandwich but were jammed in here crimes soaring like the temps out there and we being duly sworn servants of the law have to buckle our asses in and save the city before we move on to space and goddamn alien invaders i want a report on the dubreck hacker on my desk in thirty halloway seemed to shrink inside his lime green jumpsuit yes sir when youre done with that you hook up with silby on the links from the stewart breakin and when youre done with that ill let you know scram halloway scrammed flicking one mortified glance at eve as he scrambled out and back toward his cube does the heart good feeney said with a sigh to peel the skin off a skinny butt in the morning whats up with you what was his score on crusader got up to fiftysix mil on commando level feeney sniffed damn near nipped my record and thats been standing for three years four months and twentytwo days little putz she strolled in sat on the corner of his desk and copped a handful of the candied almonds he kept in a bowl you hear about trueheart no been buried his baggy face creased with concern what she told him leaving out nothing as they both munched on nuts feeney dragged a hand through his explosion of ginger hair gonna be tough on him builds fucking character she muttered hes giving it to me straight feeney kid would sooner swallow a live rat than lie to me but it doesnt hold up i brought cogburns data and communication center in i was hoping you could bump it up to priority look i know youre swamped she added before he could speak but i want all the ammunition i can get for this and theres something on there i know there is this purity business smells bad cant give you mcnab already got him juggling halloway he said and brightened i just dont think that boy has enough to do ill put him on it a little overtime should be good for him and help protect your high score goes without saying but the humor on his face faded quickly iabs going to take some hard shoves at that kid i know it im going to see if i can deflect a few of them she pushed off the desk im going to go harass morris if my hunch holds up truehearts off the sharpest hook chapter when eve swung back into homicide to snap up peabody several of the detectives in the bullpen sent meaningful looks her way rat in the hole baxter commented as he walked past her and jerked his head toward her office thanks she hooked her thumbs in the front pockets of her trousers and headed into her office lieutenant don webster sat in her single spare chair his polished shoes kicked up on her cluttered desk he was drinking her coffee hey dallas been a little while but somehow never long enough she knocked his feet off her desk is that my coffee in that mug he took a long sip let out a happy sigh it must be nice being able to call up the real thing whenever youre in the mood how is roarke these days is this a social call because i dont have time to chat im on duty not social but it could be friendly he moved his shoulders when her expression stayed set and stony or not gotta say though youre looking just swell she reached behind her shut the door youd have gotten the report of the incident occurring yesterday between nineteen hundred and nineteenthirty involving a uniformed officer assigned to central who while offduty responded to dallas webster held up a hand i got the report i know the incident i know officer troy trueheart hell of a name huh is in testing at this time internal affairs will interview the subject and investigate the termination after the results of said testing are evaluated hes twentytwo years old hes still green but hes solid im asking you to go easy on him irritation settled over his face toughened it you think i get up in the morning thinking about how many cops i can destroy that day i dont know what you or the rest of your pack think about she started to order coffee for herself then spun around i thought you were coming back i thought youd decided to be a cop again i am a goddamn cop after all that dirt came out from inside iab thats why i stayed in he said it quietly and cut off her tirade i thought about it he pushed a hand through his wavy brown hair i thought about it long and hard i believe in the bureau dallas how why checks and balances we need checks and balances when theres power theres corruption they go handinhand a wrong cops got no right to a badge but he deserves having another cop see its taken from him ive got no use for dirty cops annoyed with the world in general she took the coffee mug from him and drank damn it webster you were good on the street it gave him a quick zip to hear her say it to know she meant it im good in the bureau i think i make a difference by hammering at a rookie like trueheart because he did what he had to do to protect a civilian and himself you know the first thing i did when i went back into iab was move out all the racks thumbscrews and other torture devices i read the report dallas its clear there was immediate jeopardy but there are holes and there are questions you know it im looking into it let me clear it up you know id love to do you a favor just so youd owe me one but he has to be interviewed he has to make a statement he can have his rep there he can have you there jesus dallas were not looking to fuck this kid over but when a uniform terminates using his weapon it has to be reviewed hes clean webster hes goddamn spanking clean then hes got nothing to worry about ill take it personally if that means anything to you i guess it does you tell roarke you were tagging me for this or is he going to get riled up so i have to kick his ass again oh is that what you were doing when you had to be carried out of the room unconscious i like to remember it that i was just getting my second wind webster rubbed a hand over his jaw he could still remember what roarkes fist had felt like plowing into it like a wellaimed brick whatever works for you and i dont report to roarke you go on thinking that he took the coffee back from her finished it off youre so married i see little lovebirds circling over your head it mortified right down to her toes roarkes not the only one who can knock you unconscious i really like the look of you he grinned when her eyes narrowed just looking he assured her no touching learned my lesson there you can trust me to keep it clean personally and professionally that good enough for you if it wasnt i wouldnt have called you check ill be in touch he opened the door glanced back he really did like the look of her lean and tough and sexy thanks for the coffee alone she shook her head she could hear the noise level drop into silence from the bullpen as webster walked through it hed chosen a very hard road she thought a badge who policed other badges was regarded with suspicion derision and fear a slippery line to walk she supposed all in all she liked him well enough to hope he kept his balance she checked her wrist unit judged how much longer trueheart would be in testing more than enough time she thought for her to browbeat morris for results on cogburn they were stacked and racked and packed in the morgue rarely in eleven years on the job had eve seen so many corpses in one place at one time a trio of the bagged and tagged were laid out on gurneys and shoved against the wall outside of one of the autopsy suites take a number she thought too late to be protected but youll be served eventually as eve strode down the bright white corridor of the dead peabody hustled beside her man this place is always a little spooky but this is beyond you know how you half expect one of these bags to sit up and grab at you no wait out here if one of them makes a run for it give me a call i dont think thats particularly funny and watching the still black bags warily peabody took her post at the door inside morris was busy at work a laser scalpel midway through the y cut on one of the six bodies splayed out on tables he wore goggles over his pleasant face a plastic hood over his long dark braided hair and a clear protective coat over a natty navy blue suit whats the point in having voice mail if you dont talk to it eve demanded a lot of unexpected company dropped in this morning due to an airtram collision didnt you catch the report bodies dropping out of the sky like flying monkeys if they could fly they wouldnt be bagged and tagged how many twelve dead six injured some jerk in an airmini rammed it tram pilot managed to hold the controls most of the way down but people panicked add to that the knife fight at a club that took both participants and one bystander the jane doe female found stuffed in a recycler and your everyday bashings bludgeonings and brutalities and weve got ourselves a full house ive got a police termination with some questions rookie uniform stuns crazy guy crazy guy dies no sign of stunner contact on vic stunner confiscated from officer was set on low then it didnt kill him hes dead as the rest of your guests morris completed his y cut only way a noncontact zap with a uniform stunner would take out a man crazy or not would be if said potential crazy man had a respiratory or neurological condition of such seriousness that the electronic jolt acerbated it and led to termination it was exactly what shed wanted to hear if thats the case its not actually a termination by maximum force technically no however technically will do be a pal morris take a look at him its trueheart morris looked up and shoved the goggles up the kid with the peach fuzz on his face that looks like a screen ad for toothpaste thats the one hes in testing iabs next and something doesnt hang about the way this went down he could use a break let me look him up hes over there number four in line she jerked a thumb let me pull the report up i can let me read it morris cut her off with a wave of the hand and moved over to the data center name of crazy dead guy cogburn louis k morris called up the field report as he read he hummed to himself it was some catchy little tune vaguely familiar to her and it started playing around in her head in a way that told her it would be stuck there for hours illegals dealer morris began couldve been oversampling heart or neurological damage possible bleeding from ears nose broken blood vessels in the eyes hmm he moved to the table where louie k was laid out skinny and naked he refit the goggles lowered his face so close to louies it looked as though he was about to kiss the dead record on he said and began to dictate preliminary data visual findings well lets open him up see what we see you going to hang for this yeah if its quick one doesnt rush genius dallas he picked up a skull saw set it to whirl eve often wondered why anyone chose this particular line of work or how they could be so cheerful when going about it at least the air in the room was cool she thought and wandered over to study the offerings of the little fridgie she settled for a tube of ginger ale before walking back to morris what do you ssh she scowled but subsided morris was usually chatty when he worked in this case he went about the job in silence referring to the inside of cogburns skull to the computer imagery on the screen beside the table she studied it herself but saw nothing but shapes and colors you do a medical search on this guy yeah he hasnt been in for any sort of work or check in a couple of years nothing popped oh yeah something popped his brain and no standard stunner did this damage no tumor that i can see no clotting if it was an embolism there should be what weve got is severe intercranial pressure his brains massively swollen preexisting i cant tell not yet this is going to take time fascinating pops just what this brain did like an overinflated balloon i can tell you that in my opinion this wasnt done by any weapon its internal medical then im not going to confirm that im going to run some tests he shooed her away ill contact you when i have something solid give me something i can tell you it appears this guys brain was in serious condition an ongoing condition prior to any act by your officer last evening what happened here didnt happen as a result of a stun it didnt happen if hed stuck a police issue laser in the guys ear and blasted away i cant say if the stun caused some sort of chain reaction that led to early termination but from the looks of this brain this guy wouldve been dead within an hour ill let you know when i figure out how and why now go and let me work eve bypassed the seal on cogburns apartment the stench the stale trapped heat punched like a dirty fist when she opened the door god thats foul oh yeah peabody turned her head sucked in what she imagined was her last easy breath then followed eve inside go ahead and open the window while were in here its got to be better than working in a closed box what are we looking for morriss prelim is leaning toward preexisting condition we may find something in here to verify that to indicate he was selfmedicating the place looks like he was off sick thats what struck me from the first hes a creep but a tidy organized creep keeps his nest neat ordinarily but the last several days hes falling down on the domestic front keeping up with his business though youre sick youre hot youre irritable neighbor hassles you you crack makes better sense but well it doesnt really matter why cogburn had batting practice on his neighbor it always matters why eve answered ralph woosters dead and cogburns paid for it but it matters why she opened drawers shed opened and searched the day before maybe he had a hardon for wooster all along maybe he wanted to shag ralphs woman or owed him money and now hes feeling like shit and old ralphs hammering on his door and yelling at him she crouched down shined a penlight deep into the recesses of a cupboard point is something made him snap go postal could be his brain was frying morris said he was a dead man even so truehearts in testing peabody glanced at her wrist unit or just coming out of it hell have to face iab whether or not cogburn had a preexisting yeah but hell feel better if it comes out he gave the guy the standard and acceptable stuns and a preexisting was the root or cause of death we get him that he wont get the mandatory thirtyday vacation she stayed crouched frowning into space anyway i dont like how it feels just dont like it whats that song youre humming eve stopped cursed herself straightened i dont know damn morris lets knock on doors it was amazing how many people lost their sense of hearing or their ability to communicate in coherent sentences when a badge was involved more than half the doors eve knocked on remained firmly shut and whatever sounds emitting from inside were stifled instantly the doors that opened revealed people no more helpful with responses that ranged from i dunno to i didnt hear nothing from nobody on the first floor in apartment f eves dwindling patience was rewarded the blonde was young and looked half asleep she wore a tiny pair of white panties and a thin tank she yawned hugely in eves face then blinked at the badge when it was shoved in front of her my license is paid up i got six more months till renewal and i just had my mandatory health check i got the okay good to know as licensed companions went this one was on the young side and still looked fresh the license was likely in its first year im not here about that this concerns what happened on the fourth floor yesterday oh wow that was sure something i hid in the closet until the screaming stopped i was really scared there was a big fight and people got killed and stuff did you know either of the men who got killed sort of can we come inside miss oh oh im reenie reenie pike well pikowski but im changing it to pike because you know its sexier i guess so about coming in my trainer said how we were supposed to cooperate with the police so we didnt get rousted and stuff she was eve thought the trueheart of the licensed companion crowd still shiny and innocent despite her chosen occupation thats a good policy reenie why dont we all have some cooperation inside okay but the place is kinda messy i sleep during the day mostly especially since its so hot super hasnt fixed the climate control i dont think thats right maybe i can talk to him for you eve offered as she eased inside the door really that would be great its hard to bring clients back here because its too hot for sex and stuff and im only licensed for street work and most street clients dont want to pop for a hotel room and stuff you know the furniture was spare the layout identical to cogburns disorder came from scattered clothes in bright comehither colors in the trio of wigs tossed about like tangled scalps and the army of cosmetic enhancements jumbled on the chest under the window the air was hot enough to bake cookies what can you tell me about louis cogburn eve began he liked it straight and quick no fancy stuff thats really interesting reenie but i wasnt really asking about his sexual preferences but since you mention it was he a regular client sort of she moved around the room picking up clothes tossing them into a closet once every couple weeks since i moved in he was real polite about it said how it was nice having an lc right in the building he said how we could work out a trade but i told him id sooner the money cause im saving up for oncall status and i dont do illegals and stuff oh she slapped a hand on her mouth i didnt mean to say about him dealing but i guess its okay since hes dead and stuff yeah we know about his business did he ever fight with any of the other tenants before yesterday oh no nuhuh he was real quiet and like i said polite and stuff kept to himself mostly did he ever mention ralph wooster or suzanne cohen to you any problem or grudge he had regarding them nuhuh i sort of know suze sort of i mean to say hello to and howzit and just a few days ago we sat out on the stoop and had a brew cause it was so hot inside shes nice she said how she and ralph were thinking about getting married and stuff she works at a around the corner and he does the bouncing at a club i forget which one maybe i should go see her in the hospital i bet shed appreciate that did you notice anything different about mr cogburn in the last few days sort of hey you want a cold drink i got some fizzy lemon no thats okay you go ahead i could use some water peabody put in if you dont mind sure okay is it hard being a cop and stuff it can be eve watched reenies pert little butt lift as she bent down to find her fizzy lemon in the fridgie but it shows you all sides of the human condition you see lots as an lc too what did you see different about mr cogburn recently well reenie came back with a glass of water for peabody then took a moment to sip delicately at her soft drink take the day suze and i were on the stoop louie k walked up on his way in he looked kinda bad you know all pale and sweaty and tuckered out and stuff so i said you know hot enough for you and he gave me this real nasty look and told me i should keep my mouth shut if all i could say was something stupid her unpainted lips moved into a pretty little pout really hurt my feelings but you know louie ks just not mean like that and he really didnt look good so i said aw louie k you look all worn out you want some of my brew and for a minute he looked like he was gonna be nasty again and suze got all stiff but then he sort of rubbed at his face and said how he was sorry he said that and how the heat was getting to him and he had this bad headache and stuff i said i had some blockers if he wanted which i guess was stupid too cause of his business but he didnt say so and just said how hed maybe lay down awhile and try to sleep off the headache she paused a minute as if thinking it through and like that she concluded did you see him between that time and yesterday not to see but i heard him yesterday morning i was sleeping but he woke me up pounding on the supers door and yelling at him to fix the climate control he was cursing up a streak which wasnt something you heard him do a whole lot but the super didnt open the door and louie k he went on back up not out like he did most days he went back up to his apartment after trying the super yeah and thats kinda strange cause louie k was really you know like disciplined about work i dont think hed gone out for a while now that you mention it anyway i was getting dressed yesterday when i heard all the yelling and the crashing upstairs i only peeked out for a second and saw that cute cop come running in then i hid in the closet the cute cop was calling out for somebody to call i guess i shouldve but i was awfully scared and stuff you heard the responding officer call for someone to call for police backup reenie bowed her head yeah im sorry i didnt help but i thought somebody else would and i was scared i guess it wouldnt have made a difference anyway because it all got over pretty fast the cop guy the cute guy i think hes a real hero to go up there the way he did when everybody else stayed inside where it was safe maybe if you see him and stuff you could tell him i said so and i feel bad i didnt help sure eve replied ill let him know rather than write an updated report eve opted to go straight to commander whitney with an oral she had to wheedle a fiveminute window through the commanders assistant but she was willing to take what she could get for the impact of a facetoface thank you for making time commander if i could make time my day would be a lot less harried make it fast lieutenant he continued to read whatever data was on his desk screen his profile was stony the bulk of him suited the large and currently cluttered desk as did the weight of his command both that bulk and that weight eve had reason to know carried steely muscle regarding the incident involving officer trueheart sir ive gathered additional data which indicates the terminated assailant may have suffered from a preexisting that caused his death me morris is still running tests but has stated that due to this condition the subject would have died within the hour morris shot me a brief prelim on that you have loyal associates dallas sir trueheart has completed testing by now results should be in by morning id like to postpone any iab involvement until the investigation into yesterdays incident shows clearly if any such involvement is warranted or necessary whitney turned to her now his wide dark face closed lieutenant do you have any reason to believe that a standard iab investigation and interview will cast any shadow on the actions taken by this officer no commander then let it ride let it ride he repeated before she could speak let the boy stand for himself let him clear himself hell be the better for it having you in his corner is one thing having you stand as a shield is another entirely im not trying to she trailed off realizing she was doing just that permission to speak frankly commander as long as its brief i feel some responsibility as i brought trueheart in from his former detail a few months ago he was seriously injured on one of my ops he follows orders to the letter and he has a lot of spine but his instincts are still developing and his skins still thin i just dont want to see him take any more hits over this than he deserves if he cant stand up to it better he finds out now you know that dallas if theres a preexisting mandatory thirty day can be waived you know that commander as you know the emotional and mental distress even a bythebook suspension can bring on he responded to a call for help he put himself on the line without hesitation he failed to call for backup yes sir he did did you ever fail to call for backup whitneys eyebrows lifted if i did i deserved to get kicked for it ill kick him ill consider the waiver lieutenant once all data and results are in and studied thank you sir huddled in his cube halloway ran another series of scans on the cogburn unit and groused play a little crusader on your break and you get all the shit details dumped on you who the hell cared about the data stored on the drive of a dead kiddie dealers unit what was feeney going to do tattle on the pintsized clients to their mommies four hours he thought and popped a blocker for the vicious headache trumpeting inside his skull four frigging hours dicking with useless data on a useless secondrate unit all because bigshot dallas comes begging to bigshot feeney he sat back rubbed his blurry eyes he couldnt get past the shield on this purity transmission cogburn hadnt generated the message that much hed verified it had come from outside but so the fuck what absolute purity probably some sort of baby lotion his head was killing him and god it was hot in here damn climate control mustve gone out again nobody did their jobs anymore nobody but him he shoved away from the desk pushed out of his cube desperate for water for air he elbowed other cops out of his way earned himself some inventive suggestions on selfgratification at the water cooler he glugged down cup after cup as he tracked the movements of his associates look at them like a bunch of ants in a nest somebody ought to do the world a favor and squash some ants hey halloway mcnab bounced in fresh from a field assignment hows it going heard you caught a shit detail fuck you asshole temper rolled over mcnabs face but then he noted halloways pallor and the beads of sweat you look a little wasted maybe you should take a break halloway downed more water somebodys gonna get wasted get off my case before i show the rest of these dickweeds what a pansy feeneys pet really is you got a problem with me if so it was a new one to that point mcnab and halloway had flowed along smoothly we can take it down to the gym and work it out see whos the pansy of edd feeney swept in stopped by the cooler when he felt the hot wall of tension mcnab i want that report ten minutes ago halloway you got all this time to stand around the cooler i can find more for you to do move it later halloway muttered under his breath and stalked back to his cube with his head raging chapter with peabody in tow eve stopped by the hospital for a followup interview with suzanne cohen the woman was weepy and despondent having discovered her affection for ralph ran considerably deeper now that he was dead but she had nothing appreciable to add to the mix her version of the incident on the stoop followed reenies as did her basic take on louie k he was quiet except for his music and kept mostly to himself isnt that always the way eve noted every time youve got some guy going on a spree that ends in blood people say he was quiet and kept to himself just once id like to hear how he was a maniac who ate live snakes there was that guy last year who bit off the heads of pigeons before he jumped off the roof of his apartment building yeah but he only splattered himself and we didnt catch that one no point in trying to cheer me up with pigeon eaters despondent herself eve pulled out her beeping communicator dallas thought youd want an update morris began im still running tests and results in are largely inconclusive boy that sure perks me up patience dallas patience his face was glowing the way some people glowed when they claimed to have found jesus eve thought what weve got here is worthy of a writeup in medical journals across the land this guys brain is fascinating like it was under attack from the inside but theres no tumor no mass no sign of disease as such but theres damage brain damage ill say like someone set microscopic charges inside it biff bam boom you know how i likened it to an overinflated balloon yeah picture this balloon in an enclosed space in this case the skull balloon swells bigger bigger space stays the same it keeps pushing expanding but its got no place to go pressure builds builds builds capillaries burst ping ping ping nose bleeds ear bleeds until pop thats a really pretty image poor sucker had to be suffering from major headaches the mount vesuvius of headaches ive sent tissue to the lab for further analysis and im calling in a neurologist would this damage have caused his sudden violent behavior i cant tell you that not conclusively but the pain may have pushed him over the edge pains natures warning system ouch something wrong with me enough pain though can drive you crazy and an invasive body such as a tumor in the brain can cause aberrant behavior this brain was unquestionably invaded by what the best i can tell you is it looks like some sort of neurological virus pinning that down isnt going to be quick work okay get me what you can when you can she clicked off looks like its moving out of the area of police problem and into medical problem well close it up subject suffering from as yet undiagnosed neurological disorder assaults and kills neighbor attacks another police response results in death of assailant truehearts just got to hold on through the iab bullshit are you going to let him know the guy was mostly dead before the stun yeah but he should handle iab first whitneys right i go standing in front of him it makes him look weak hes not you know peabody smiled a little hes just pure yeah well his puritys a little soiled now and hell probably be better off well swing into edd and see if theyve pinned down the other purity i want to tie this up and put it away in his cube halloway raged and he sweated and he worked he didnt know he was dying but he knew he knew damn well he was being abused he couldnt remember not exactly why he had this old and crappy data center on his work counter but he remembered oh he remembered the way feeney had slapped at him how feeney had humiliated him and mcnab that asshole breezing up and sneering laughing at him behind his back laughing right in his face why was he the one who always got the plum assignments those plums should go to colleen halloways son kevin and they would if that backstabber mcnab didnt kiss feeneys ass every chance he got they were holding him down holding him back both of them he thought as he swiped his forearm over his sweatdrenched face trying to ruin him they werent going to get away with it god god he wanted to go home go to bed he wanted to be alone in his own place away from this heat away from this noise away from the pain his vision blurred as he stared down into the guts of the unit feeney had ordered him to work on and he saw mcnabs guts spread out and gleaming under his hands take it down to the gym he let out a little snort that ended on a sob hell with that hell with them he pushed to his feet closed his hand over his holstered weapon drew it theyd handle this here and now like men eve stepped into the glide i dont need you for this peabody sir im your faithful aide i feel obliged to stay close to your side if you think youre coming up to edd with me so you can play grabass with mcnab youre very much mistaken faithful aide the thought never crossed my mind is that so why are your pants on fire peabody grinned theyre not because im not lying i was thinking of patass not grabass his is so skinny its kind of tough to grab a good handful she hopped off beside eve and since she thought she saw her lieutenants mouth twitch in what might have been a smile rather than the usual muscle tic during such conversations she pushed and i can get a firsthand on the status of cogburns unit write that area of the report for you as your faithful and hardworking aide thats a good bribe peabody you make me proud ive learned from the master they finished the hike across the breezeway that connected edd turned toward the detectives sector and all hell broke loose shouts the distinctive hum of a fired weapon the scramble of feet eves weapon was in her hand and she was running before she heard the first crash a cop rolled out of the doorway as others came rushing down corridors he zapped him jesus christ he zapped him call for medical whos down detective give me the situation igod mcnabs down eve grabbed peabodys arm as her aide started to spring forward hold she ordered as the muscles trembled under her hand officer down officer down she snapped into her communicator edd detectives level give me the goddamn situation i dont know halloway he just walked up to mcnabs cube zapped him then everybodys running and halloways screaming firing streams hes got the captain i saw him take the captain keep out eve strode to the door ordered the cops who poured out of doors and hallways to stay clear weve got a potential hostage situation at least one wounded i need this area secured i need a negotiator peabody inform the commander of this situation yes sir tears gathered in the corners of her eyes mcnab were going in draw your weapon she eased closer lowering her voice for peabody alone if you cant handle this say so now you wont help them if you cant maintain i can i will fear had already blown through her and out again we have to get in there hold fire eve called out hold fire she went in slow sweeping first cops were scattered cubes blasted some of them still smoking she saw a clutch of them huddled on the floor mcnabs cube she noted and felt a gathering of ice in her belly more were outside of feeneys office shouting through the door im lieutenant dallas she had to shout to be heard im in charge here until commander whitney takes over this situation you men get away from that door hes got the captain hes got the captain in there get the hell away from the door now whats mcnabs status she could see him now lying unconscious his face white as bone she said nothing when peabody dropped down beside him checked his pulse hes alive peabody responded shakily pulse is thready didnt take a full stun detective gates a woman with zebrastriped hair stepped forward i saw halloway walk up to the cube something off about it then i saw the weapon i yelled something mcnab looked around saw he shoved off his chair and halloways stream took him down it was bad it was bad but i dont think it was a full stun medicals on the way i need eyes in feeneys office get me eyes in there for now get me to a link station so i can talk to him peabody assess how many are wounded and in what condition she snagged a link ordered transmission to feeneys it beeped beeped beeped and her heart thundered this is captain fucking halloway halloways face nearly as white as mcnabs filled the screen the whites of his eyes were cracked with red lines and a dribble of blood leaked from his nose im in charge here he screamed it then stepped back so eve saw him holding his weapon under feeneys jaw one stream she thought numb with fear instant death this is lieutenant dallas i know who the hell you are grandstander i outrank you now what the hell do you want its what you want thats at issue halloway captain halloway captain her eyes met feeneys a thousand messages passed between them in a split second if youd tell me sir what it is you want what seems to be the problem we can clear everything up without further violence you dont want to hurt captain feeney i wont be able to help you get what you want if you hurt captain feeney you need to talk to us son feeneys voice was calm as a lake tell us what the problem is youre the problem and im not your son so shut up shut up he jerked feeneys head back with his weapon and broke transmission every cell in eves body screamed to rush the door every instinct every hour of training ordered her to hold back eyes get me eyes in there now i want all available data on halloway if hes married get his wife in here or on a link get me his mother his brother his priest whoever hes most likely to listen to i want all nonessential personnel out of this area who in here knows halloway best shocked faces grim faces angry faces looked back at her it was gates who finally spoke i guess we all thought we knew him this doesnt make sense lieutenant talk to him eve pointed to the link keep it calm and friendly you ask him what he wants what we can do for him dont criticize him dont say anything to set him off just keep him talking she turned away moving just out of range and pulled out her communicator commander on my way his face might have been carved in granite situation she relayed it fast and brief negotiator is also on his way what do you need sharpshooters im getting eyes but at this point i cant ascertain target area feeney usually keeps his shades up but they might be lowered rushing the room or shutting it down is too risky hed drop feeney before we could get to him im two minutes away keep him talking find out what he wants yes sir she moved back toward the link gates tapped manually on the keys of a miniunit hes not listening to me incoherent scattered no answers looks sick eve nodded and took over the link you okay in there captain halloway need anything i need some respect im not going to be ignored im not ignoring you you have my full attention i am having a little trouble concentrating if you could ease back on your weapon a little so we can talk this out so you can bust in here his laugh was a squeaky wheeze i dont think so no ones coming in there theres no reason we cant resolve this without more injuries feeney youll give halloway your word to remain seated and cooperative wont you feeney understood the message stay where you are as long as possible sure ill sit right here while we work this out its hot in here its too goddamn hot in here as he spoke halloway used his free hand to swipe at the blood that trickled out of his nose seeing it eve went cold ill have the climate control adjusted she gestured offscreen to gates well cool it down in there for you you feeling okay otherwise halloway no no im not feeling okay this son of a bitch has me working until my damn eyes bleed my head he grabbed a handful of his own hair yanked viciously my heads killing me im sick he made me sick we can get you a medical will you let me send a medical in you dont look well halloway let me get you some medical assistance just leave me alone when a tear dripped out of his eye it was tinged with blood leave me alone i need to think he broke transmission status whitney snapped from behind her hes sick hes showing the same symptoms demonstrated by cogburn i cant explain it commander but hes dying in there and he could take feeney with him we need to get him out get him medical assistance lieutenant ah commander another detective hustled up weve got your eyes he managed a wan smile and ears with them with whitney eve bent over a monitor she could see the whole of feeneys office now the sun and the privacy shades lowered there would be no outside visual for the sharpshooters feeney was in his desk chair restraints locking his arms to its arms halloway paced behind him his young pleasant face ravaged his own blood smeared it like war paint he tore at his hair with one hand waved the weapon wildly with the other im the one who knows what im doing around here he raged kicking feeneys chair viciously as he passed im the one whos in charge youre old and youre stupid and im sick to death of your orders feeneys response was quiet and measured i didnt know you were feeling that way what can i do to make things right with you you want to make them right you want to make them right he jammed the weapon under feeneys chin again and had eve braced to hurl herself at the office door were going to write us a memo ry okay okay she let out a long breath keep him busy sir negotiators onscene bring him uptodate dallas whitney ordered then we structure alternatives she briefed the negotiator set him up with a link and turning saw roarke striding through the door what the hell are you doing here media bulletin he didnt speak of the terror hed lived with since hearing the report that there had been weapons fired officers wounded and a hostage taken at cop central and from his quick scan of the room he sized up the most vital aspects of the situation his wife was unharmed and feeney was missing feeney the hostage i dont have time for you he laid a hand on her arm before she could walk away what can i do to help she didnt waste time asking how hed gotten into a secured area in the first place he was a man who went where he wanted to go nor did she ask how he expected to help when the sector was loaded with cops whose job it was to deal with a crisis nobody was better at cutting through a crisis mcnab was hit christ he turned as she did and found peabody on the floor with the first medical team i dont know his status id feel better if i knew one way or the other done there was anger in him now a kind of frigid fury more deadly than heat lieutenant if its money he wants the department will have unlimited funds at its disposal appreciated but its not money go give peabody a shoulder i need to focus on getting feeney out of there alive roarke wait she scooped a hand through her hair find which cube is halloways hes got a data unit in there shut it down dont touch it dont get any closer to it than necessary just shut it down inside feeneys office halloway screamed into the link rusty knifes were slicing their way through his brain he could feel it bleeding you want to talk to me then turn the temp down in this furnace you keep trying to fry me out i drop this useless old efart im not talking to you asshole put dallas back on put that goddamn lying bitch back on you got ten seconds at the signal she sprang to the link im here halloway didnt i order you to turn the heat down in here didnt i give you a direct order yes sir i followed that order dont you lie to me you want me to start on his hands halloway pressed his weapon down hard on the back of feeneys hand i give it a good strong jolt he wont be jerking off with this hand anymore ill have it turned down farther halloway just listen to me look at feeney hes not sweating you can do a temp check the rooms down to sixtyfive thats bullshit im burning up in here because youre sick youve got some kind of virus like an infection youve got a bad headache havent you halloway and youve got a nosebleed its the infection thats making you feel this way the infection thats hurting you you need medical let us get you some help and well straighten all this out why dont you come in bitch his mouth twisted come on in and youll see how fast we straighten this out i can come in i can bring you some medicine fuck you i come in halloway and dont deliver youd have two hostages youre in control youre in charge you know feeneys a friend of mine i wouldnt do anything to jeopardize his welfare i can bring you in medication for your headache and whatever else you want fuck you he said again and broke transmission bartering another hostage isnt the way to deal in this situation the negotiator shoved himself between eve and the link we dont need any sacrificing we dont need any hotshots normally id agree with you but the man holding the cards in there isnt going to listen to the usual lines first hes a cop and he knows the routine second hes suffering from some sort of neurological disorder thats affecting his behavior his judgment his actions im in charge of this negotiation this isnt a pissing contest damn it i dont want your job i want to see both of those cops come out of there in one piece commander im sorry i dont have time to explain it all halloways physical and mental conditions are deteriorating i dont know how much longer hes got before he loses it completely but when he does hes going to take feeney with him sharpshooters are in position they can take him out using an onscreen visual one stun and hes dead thats what happened with cogburn halloways still a badge commander and what hes done what hes doing is not within his control i want the chance to take him alive you go in the negotiator said and three cops die or live i can tranq him hes in serious pain if the meds are there hell want them commander feeney trained me he brought me up i need to go in whitney stared into her eyes talk him into it make it fast it took her precious moments of bargaining but she fell into the rhythm of groveling that she realized was what he needed not just to be acknowledged as being in charge but to be shown absolute subservience he could very well fire on you the minute youre in the door roarke spoke softly as she waited for the mts to prepare the medications and pressure syringes he could but you go in without a vest without a weapon that was the deal i know what im doing you know what you have to do theres a subtle and dangerous difference eve he laid a hand on her arm it took everything inside him not to yank her clear of the room get her away i know what he means to you remember what you mean to me im not likely to forget it mcnabs condition is serious he took a hard hit at close range the mts were guarded but he came around briefly before they transported him its a good sign okay she couldnt think about mcnab couldnt worry about him now three others were injured before halloway grabbed feeney and used him as a shield into the office id like to know just for curiositys sake how one man takes out four other cops without taking a single hit jesus roarke this is edd half the cops in here are glorified drones or geeks youre more likely to see them pulling out an epad than a weapon lieutenant the mt approached with a clear bag of meds set these up like you wanted syringe with the red dot on the depressors the tranq takes a man down in under five seconds seconds the dummy nothing but a mild blocker pills are standard blockers except for the one with the little yellow stripe thats another tranq you get him to use either of those hes down pretty fast five seconds okay got it back in a few minutes she told roarke see that you are and because he didnt give a damn at the moment about her muchprized rep he yanked her against him and kissed her jeez save it will you but it warmed her steadied her as she walked over to the link and put through the next transmission i got your meds sir she held up the bag pain blockers oral and bloodstream the mt informs me that the syringe will clear up the infection and take care of your headache fairly quickly she held her arms up turned a slow circle im not carrying i know youre in control i just want to give you what you need to resolve this situation to your satisfaction damn skippy he swiped at the blood leaking out of his nose again he was rocking rocking back and forth on his heels as if to soothe away the pain his sandy hair was standing in mad tufts where hed yanked at it sweat and blood had soaked through the top of his cheery green jumpsuit come on in dallas his mouth moved into a terrible grin as he levered his weapon under feeneys jaw again im going to show you just what i need to resolve this situation to my satisfaction keep that link open he paused hissed out a breath then rammed the heel of his free hand against his eye keep that visual so i can see you all the way to the door anybody tries to pass you a weapon this old man is over keep your hands up keep them up where i can see them he drilled the heel of his hand against his eye again the other rolling wildly as he tried to focus on the screen my head ive got the medication to help you eve spoke calmly slowly as she walked to feeneys office door on either side of it just out of visual were two crisis cops in full riot gear armed with lasers i need you to release the locks sir anybody tries to rush that door i take him out im coming in alone im not armed im not carrying anything but the medication youre in control here everyone knows youre in control about damn time he released the locks then shoved feeneys head back digging in with the business end of his weapon and now eve thought if she was wrong everybody died she eased the door open then lifting her hands high nudged it the rest of the way with the toe of her boot im alone captain halloway she said stepped in shut the door at her back she risked one fast glance at feeney she read the anger the frustration on his face and saw the bruises gathering under his jaw where halloway had rammed his weapon time after time put the bag down on the desk halloway licked his dry cracked lips as she obeyed take a step back hands behind your head yes sir why are there two syringes sir the mt said that you might require a second dosage for full relief come around the desk slow she could hear him keening under his breath like an animal beyond pain he couldnt be thirty yet she thought he couldnt be thirty and a few hours before feeney had dressed him down for fighting virtual aliens blood trickled slowly out of his nose the left sleeve of his jumpsuit was red from wiping at it she could smell his sweat his blood his fury pumping how many times you have to bang this old bastard to make lieutenant sir captain feeney and i have not been intimate lying bitch he swung out backhanding her faster harder than shed anticipated off balance she fell back into a chair how many times as many as it took i lost count his head bobbed rapidly thats the way it works somebodys always screwing somebody so they can screw somebody else over everyone knows youve achieved your rank and position through your own merits you got that you fuckinga got that he pawed a blue blocker out of the bag how do i know this isnt poison here he shoved it into feeneys mouth swallow it swallow it or i do her he swung the weapon toward eve they were close but not close enough for her to see if the pill had a thin yellow stripe she waited counting off the seconds as feeney swallowed to see if shed already lost the gamble but his eyes stayed clear halloway as did his voice everybody here wants to resolve this you need to tell us what you want so that everybody walks out shut up he sliced his weapon down feeneys cheek with casual violence then pawed another pill out of the bag popped it in his mouth chewed it like candy maybe those syringes are poison get one out get one out he chewed a second pill well have a little test yes sir she pretended to fumble a bit as she reached in the bag im sorry im a little nervous she took out the dummy do you want me to administer this sir or would you prefer to do it yourself you go ahead and administer it no he said when she started to rise sit right there pump it into yourself you live through that maybe you live a little longer she kept her eyes on his as she turned the syringe toward her arm settled it depressed the plunger i followed your orders sir im sorry youre in pain its difficult to think clearly when in pain i hope after this medication alleviates your physical distress well be able to resolve this situation to your satisfaction you want to make captain youre going to have to start banging me im in charge now get up get up give me the damn syringe these pills are useless she stepped forward there was blood in his ears now she kept her eyes locked on his as she lifted the syringe this will work faster she set her thumb on the depressor poison he screamed it jerked away poison my heads exploding ill kill you kill all of you she heard the rush at the door pictured the sharpshooters taking aim he was a cop was all she could think as she leaped at him deflecting his weapon an instant before the stream struck her she brought the syringe down on his shoulder and pumped the tranq into him hold your fire hold fire she shouted it as halloway ran in circles around the room screaming as he ripped at his hair i disarmed him hes unarmed the door burst open she leaped between halloway and the lasers i said hold your goddamn fire she whirled around it was taking longer than five seconds halloway was throwing himself against the wall shrieking weeping then his body danced as bodies do when a stream takes them down blood fountained from his nose as he pitched forward get medical in here eve ordered as she rushed over to kneel beside halloway shed seen death too often to mistake it but still she checked his pulse damn it damn it she beat a clenched fist against her knee looked over to meet the knowledge in feeneys eyes we lost him anyway chapter he really caught you a good one eve crouched down to where feeney sat under the ministrations of a medtech she pursed her lips as she examined the long shallow gash that scored his cheek been a while since you took one in the face huh i dont stick my nose in the knothole as often as other people you and me were going to go a round dallas i taught you better than that adding a hostage do i look like a hostage i dont recall getting locked to my desk chair with my own restraints lately feeney sighed dumb luck that worked and dumb luck is a nice bonus to solid police work somebody told me that once she smiled at him laid a hand over his under her touch his hand turned so their fingers linked dont think i owe you one not for dumb luck and you make sure your man knows that ah business about banging and whatnot was just smoke i know hes seething with a black jealousy and planning on whomping on you but ill do what i can to calm him down he nodded but his grin faded as he looked away caught us with our pants down dallas pants down around our goddamn ankles i never saw it coming you couldnt have couldnt have she repeated quickly before he could speak he was sick feeney some virus some infection i dont know what the hell morris is working on it its the same deal that happened to the guy trueheart took out its in the computer its got to be in the computer jesus he was tired sick and tired all he could do was shake his head thats science fiction crap dallas you dont catch anything but eyestrain from a unit you put halloway on cogburns unit by the end of the day hes exhibiting the same symptoms as cogburn deduction feeney science fiction or not theres something in that thing and it goes into quarantine until weve got some answers he was a good kid he screwed off some but he was a good kid and a decent cop i got on his ass this morning but he needed a boot saw him sniping with mcnab this afternoon and feeney rubbed his temples oh christ theyre taking care of mcnab hes going to be okay hes tougher than he looks hed have to be wouldnt he she worked up a smile when she said it and ignored the sick dread in her belly four of my boys hurt one of them dead ive got to know why yeah weve got to know why she glanced back at halloways cube at the old brokendown data center on his work counter absolute purity she thought she went back into feeneys office halloways body was already bagged the blood that had burst from him was splattered like some mad drawing on the industrial beige wall she gestured to the mt whod fixed her the tranqs what do you make of it he looked down as she did at the body bag some sort of rupture damned if i know ive never seen anything like it not without severe head trauma first you need the mes take maybe a brain tumor maybe an embolism massive stroke awful damn young couldnt hit thirty twentyeight he had a fiancee who was rushing back from a business trip in east washington parents and a brother coming in from baltimore and if she knew feeney detective kevin halloway would be buried with all the honors due a badge whod gone down in the line of duty because thats just what had happened she thought as they carried the bag away hed been doing his job and had died because of it she didnt know how she didnt know why but a young edd man had died today for the job lieutenant she turned toward the door and whitney sir i need your report as soon as possible youll have it what happened here he stared at the blood on the wall you have answers to that some more questions than answers we need morris to examine halloway immediately i believe hell find similar neurological damage as he found in cogburn there are answers on cogburns data unit but it cant be examined until some reasonable safety measures are devised i do know detective halloway wasnt responsible for what happened here i have to brief chief tibble and the mayor before we speak to the media ill let you ride on that one for now he added for the moment the official word will be that detective halloway was suffering from some as yet undetermined illness that caused his aberrant behavior and resulted in his death as far as i know thats exactly the truth im not worried about the truth when it comes to the official word but i want it the whole of it this matter is your only priority any and all other investigations you have ongoing are to be passed on find the answers he started out then pivoted back detective mcnab regained consciousness hes moved up from critical to serious thank you sir when she walked out of edd she sported roarke leaning idly against a wall and working with his ppc anyone less like a cop less like a victim shed never seen as far as the other element that frequented cop shops he could still slide in silkily though to that dangerous group he looked up held out a hand for hers you couldnt have done more than you did no she knew that accepted that but hes still dead i put the murder weapon at his head i didnt know it couldnt be expected to know it but thats what i did and i dont even know what the weapon is she rolled her shoulders anyway mcnabs awake and moved up to serious i figure i ought to swing by and take a look at him before i head home interview him ill give him some stupid flowers first roarke laughed and had nearly lifted her hand to his lips when she jerked it down hissed darling you really shouldnt be so shy about public displays of affection publics one thing copsre another dont i know it he murmured and went with her to the garage level ill ride along with you one of us should see that peabody gets a bit of food or has a shoulder ill leave that end to you eve climbed behind the wheel youre better at the theretheres than i am he touched the ends of her hair just needed to touch she held up very well yeah she hung it isnt easy when someone you care about gets hurt or is in danger of being hurt she slanted him a look people want easy they should hook up with an office drone not a cop truer words but actually i was thinking how difficult it was for you to stand and watch feeney being threatened with death for nearly an hour he was handling himself he knows how to it rushed up through her grabbed her by the throat with spikey claws okay at the exit of the garage she stopped dropped her head on the wheel okay scared me jesus jesus he knew just where to hold the damn weapon just the right point one jerk and feeneys gone gone in a blink and theres nothing you can do i know roarke switched to auto programmed in the address for the hospital and leaning over rubbed the back of eves neck as the vehicle streamed into traffic i know baby he knew it we looked at each other and we both knew it could be over so fast no time to say anything do anything damn it she laid her head on the seatback closed her eyes i wheedled him into taking that unit bumping it up in line i know i know what happened what could have happened wasnt my fault but there it is anyway hes got a neck like a stupid rooster its got bruises on it where halloway kept jamming the weapon under his stupid droopy jaw how many times did his life pass in front of his eyes never see his wife again his kids grandkids you take on the job you take on the risks someones always reminding me of that she opened her eyes now looked at him must be tempting to smack her back for being such a tightass knowitall oh infinitely he played his fingers lightly over her cheek but someones always beating me to it she smiled now i dont get hit in the face every couple weeks anymore i dont feel right im okay yes you are she was steady again when she strode into the hospital admissions lobby steady enough to snap like a wolf at the dozen reporters already camped out and trying to sniff out a story no comment your name was brought up as part of the negotiation team that brought about captain ryan feeneys release why was homicide part of this team no comment a police source has stated that detective kevin halloway fired on several other detectives took captain feeney hostage within the electronic detectives division of cop central and subsequently was killed during the incident she shoved her way through the encroaching reporters andoopsknocked over a camera perhaps you didnt hear the no portion of the phrase no comment did you terminate detective halloway in your efforts to obtain captain feeneys release she turned at that her eyes flat as a sharks commander whitney along with the chief of police and the mayor of new york will be briefing the media on todays events within the hour if you want to feed go chew on that bone im just here to visit a sick friend whyd he do it someone shouted as she bullied her way to the elevators what kind of cops do you have working down there the kind who lay it down to serve and protect even when it involves vultures like you goddamn it she muttered the minute she was inside the elevator she punched the wall causing the elderly woman halfburied in a flower arrangement to try to melt into the corner of the car thats going to be tonights revolving sound bite i know better better than to let them get under my skin it would have to be made of reinforced steel not to get pricked now and then lieutenant and as sound bites go i thought it a strong and pithy one pithy my butt damn it i didnt get what floor hes on i did twelve madam roarke smiled winningly at their elevator companion your floor i can get off anywhere she noticed the weapon peeking out from under eves jacket anywhere at all its all right smooth and handsome in his business suit he kept his voice light friendly shes the police thats a beautiful flower arrangement yes well my granddaughter just had a baby a boy congratulations youd like maternity i imagine ah six once he had their destinations he turned back to her careful to keep his body blocking eves gun i hope mother and son are doing well yes thank you its my first greatgrandchild theyve named him luke andrew she slid her gaze cautiously toward eve when the elevator doors opened to six holding the flowers like a shield she scurried out what do i look like i stomp on old ladies for recreation roarke angled his head actually just keep that silk tongue of yours still thats not what you said last night and because he made her laugh she was able to head down to mcnabs room with less weight on her shoulders it dropped right back on when she stepped in saw peabody sitting by the bed and mcnab in it he looked too young lying there with his eyes closed face white so white against white sheets theyd taken his body adornments she thought he looked naked vulnerable wrong without his complement of earrings skinny shoulders eve thought with a wave of worry the guy had skinny shoulders and they didnt belong under some drab hospital gown he needed something bright bold silly over that halfassed body of his his hair was loose so that all that sunny blond looked too shiny too healthy against the rest of him she hated hospitals they stripped you down to flesh and bone left you weak and alone in some narrow bed where machines clocked your every breath cant we get him out of here she heard herself say cant we ill arrange it roarke whispered in her ear of course he would hed arrange everything while she stood here stuck in the damn doorway annoyed with herself eve stepped inside peabody peabodys head snapped up eve could see shed been crying her hand slid across the sheet covered mcnabs hes out the doctor says hes doing okay he took a pretty hard hit but i appreciate you letting me leave the scene to ride with him i heard hed come out of it yeah he peabody stopped took one long breath and seemed to draw herself in he went in and out a few times he was vague on what happened but he was coherent they didnt find any brain damage it gave his heart a pretty bad punch and i think theyre a little worried because the beats still irregular and his um his right sides numb yet they think thats temporary but right now he cant move his arm or leg on that side gonna walk funny the voice was a bit slurry but brought everyones attention to mcnabs face his eyes were still closed but his mouth curved up just a little in an attempt to smile that ripped at eves belly you in there mcnab yeah he tried to swallow yeah lieutenant all present and accounted for shebody right here i could use some water or something a brewd be nice you get water she snatched a covered cup brought the straw to his lips after two shallow sips he turned his head away i dont smell any flowers guy ends up in the hospital people are supposed to bring him some damn flowers i got a little distracted on my way to the gift shop eve moved over to the right side of the bed had to kick a few reporters he opened his eyes they were green and they were clouded from drugs or pain she couldnt be sure but to eves mind one was as bad as the other did you get the captain out i cant remember hell be coming by to see you as soon as he gets out from under the paperwork hes fine halloway he didnt make it jesus jesus mcnab closed his eyes again what the hell happened you tell me i i cant get it clear take it easy for a while then well talk about it you laying off me that fast i must be in pretty bad shape peabody if i croak you get my vid collection thats not funny okay okay you can have all the earrings too but my cousin sheilas going to be pretty pissed can somebody help me sit up some here the doctor said you were supposed to rest but peabody was already bringing the bed up to a reclined sitting position if i croak will you stop saying that he managed a grin while peabody scowled with her face close to his how about you lay one on me ill lay one on you she muttered it then pressed her mouth gently to his when she glanced over she noted eve was staring fixedly at the ceiling sorry peabody murmured just indulging the dying guy no problem she looked around when she heard roarke come in he nodded then walked to the foot of the bed there seems to be an inordinate amount of attractive female medical personnel on this level ian but i dont suppose youve noticed blast didnt screw up my vision that being the case you may not want to change locations summerset while efficient isnt quite so pretty sorry huh the lieutenant thought youd be happier recovering elsewhere weve a room for you at home but it lacks attractive female medical personnel youd spring me the faintest hint of color crept into his cheeks to your place your doctor wants another look at you first but we should be able to transport you in an hour or two if that suits you i dont know what to say thats so solid lieutenant yeah yeah eve shifted her feet lets see how grateful you are once summersets poking at you ive got stuff to do he looked sick mcnab said and stopped eve before she turned for the door halloway yeah i was coming in from a field assignment and he was by the cooler he got really pissy mean and aggressive not like him he could be a pain time to time full of himself but we got along we were in the squad together two years he closed his eyes again jesus i dont get it he came down on me like he wanted to taste some blood wasnt just what he said you ride each other just for kicks half the time you know how it is sure eve moved back to the bed but this wasnt just riding no it was how he said it how he looked at me when he did got me hot enough to suggest we go down to the gym and pound on each other but the captain came in and broke it up he didnt look good halloway all sweaty and his eyes were blown your eyes get fucked sometimes with all the data but his were bad i went back to my cube he went to his i forgot about it did you speak with him again see him speak or have an altercation with anyone else no i had to get this report out and there was a search and scan on a couple links id been putting off because they promised to bore my brains out i got some coffee bullshitted with gates got stuck with a transmission from some woman who thinks her computers possessed by aliens we get those all the time weve got this routine we walk them through to doesnt matter im just off that call and i hear somebody yell somebodys yelling in edd half the time but this was different this was trouble i swung around to see what the hell was going on he stopped there eve could hear the monitors rapid beeps his heart rate was up she thought time to back off okay well get the rest tomorrow no no i remember how it went i saw him coming at me it didnt click through all the circuits at once i mean jeez why would halloway be charging at me with his weapon out doesnt compute his face he looked crazy and he was already sweeping out streams like some combat cop laying down suppressive fire somebody screamed i jumped up started to jump up i didnt have my weapon on hardly any of us wear it when were working i think maybe i was going to dive for cover i think maybe i started to then bam a couple of elephants plowed into my chest and i was gone how many of us did he take out three others took jolts and were treated and released onscene you got the worst of it just my luck halloway he was okay before this wed rag on each other now and again but just the way you do we didnt have bad blood between us he liked his work and theres this skirt he was gone enough over that they were going to get married he bitched about feeney sometimes thought the captain was oldfashioned or something but everybody bitches about the ranks off and on it doesnt make sense hed come at me that way somethings wrong about this somethings wrong about it she agreed i need to be in on the investigation yeah she thought he did in his place shed have needed it therell be a full briefing tomorrow nine hundred my home office meanwhile youd better get back in shape because i dont have time to carry you around yes sir thanks weve got to go stock the autochef with gruel and other tasty invalid food see you around the gruel was a nice touch roarke told her as they walked down the hall i thought so put a nice happy glow on his face lieutenant dallas she turned to see peabody hustling down the hallway then took a staggering step back when her aide caught her in a fierce embrace thanks thank you oh jeez mortified eve lifted a hand patted peabody awkwardly on the back okay his heart stopped during the transpo they had to zap him it was only a few seconds but i thought whatll i do whatll i do hes such an asshole peabody said and burst into tears man god roarke an interesting and flattering lineup roarke said to his wifes strangled call for help here now darling gently he eased peabodys death grip on eve and with his arm around her led her into a small waiting area he sat her down and dabbed at her cheeks with a handkerchief eve shuffled her feet then sat then rubbed a hand over peabodys thigh youre just going to puff up his ego if he finds out youre crying over him hes already hard to live with i know sorry it was i guess it was hearing him say how it went down its got my brain all scrambled up theres a lot of that going around peabody managed a watery laugh and laid her head on roarkes shoulder such was her state of mind that the physical contact didnt cause her to experience the usual sexual tingle you guys are the ult seriously taking him in for a few days while his system levels out well eve sighed friendship she thought could be so damn inconvenient hes bound to be pretty demanding im sure as hell not going to be his private nurse youre going to have to come along and take that duty peabodys lips trembled her eyes filled again dont dont do that again thats an order yes sir she let out an enormous sigh im going to go stick my head under a faucet before i go back in with him ill keep him out of your hair dallas see that you do eve sat where she was a moment after peabody walked out dont make any smart comments about me being a soft touch eve warned or youll be glad we happen to be in a medical facility when you regain full consciousness wouldnt dream of it roarke rubbed a hand over hers lieutenant softie she slanted him a look but got to her feet without resorting to violence lets get the hell out of here she let him drive home because she wanted to think electronics werent her strong suit in fact she and technology fought an ongoing war and so far shed lost most of the battles feeney was captain of edd because he was a good cop and because he not only understood the strange world of electronics he had a lifelong love affair with it she could count on mcnab if he was physically up to it he brought a young fresh innovative hand to the field and after today she could expect the full cooperation of every cop drone and droid in edd but she had one more weapon and it was sitting beside her making her clunky departmental vehicle purr like a kitten as it darted through the misery of evening traffic she might have been roarkes wife and the wheel of the deal was his favorite pastime okay second favorite she corrected with a smirk but electronics was his wellloved mistress we need to get into cogburns unit she began we need to take it apart and put every chip every circuit every board under a scope and we need to do that fast without whoevers working on it turning into a homicidal maniac any ideas i might have a few i might take the time and trouble to refine them if i were officially attached to the investigation expert consultant civilian yeah she thought always a deal to wheel ill consider it after i hear the ideas ill discuss the ideas after you consider it she only scowled and tagged morris on the indash link his preliminary exam on halloway showed the same massive intercranial pressure unexplained early test results on cogburns brain tissue indicated some unidentified viral infection she frowned as they drove through the gates toward home computers get viruses not biological viruses roarke pointed out a sick computer can and does infect other computers but not its operator this one did she was dead sure of it subliminal programming geared to mind control weve dealt with that kind of thing before we have and he was considering it he veered away from the house toward the garage to save summerset the annoyance of remoting it there later as i said ive some ideas she got out in what she thought of as his vehicular toy warehouse shed never understand what one man needed with twenty cars three jetbikes a minicopter and a couple of allterrains and that didnt count the ones he had stashed elsewhere ill run consultant status by the commander temporary consultant status i really think i ought to get a badge this time he grabbed her hand lets have a walk a what a walk he repeated drawing her outside its a nice evening and will likely be the last well have to ourselves for a bit of time ive a yen to take the air with you lieutenant he lowered his head kissed her lightly or maybe its just a yen for you chapter she didnt mind walking though she preferred pacing for exercising the brain and really this was more meandering so that she had to check her stride twice to cut it back to his pace it was funny she thought the way he could throttle back so seamlessly from action and stress to ease without any visible effort it was a skill shed never mastered the air was heavy with heat thick with it so they were strolling through a warm syrup but the sharp white light of afternoon had mellowed toward a gilded evening light that was so soft it felt as if it could be stroked even the heat was different here she thought sucking itself into grass and trees and flowers rather than bouncing off pavement and smashing back into your face but there was something something just under the surface of roarkes placid calm she could sense the honed edge of it like a knife wrapped in velvet whats going on summer doesnt last very long he steered her down a stone path she wasnt entirely sure shed seen before its pleasant to enjoy it while it does particularly this time of day the gardens are at their prime she supposed they were though they always looked spectacular even in winter there was something compelling about the shapes the textures the tones but now it was all color all scent dramatic here with tall spikey things with brilliant and exotic blooms charming there with tangled rows of simple blossoms and all lush and somehow perfect without giving the appearance that any hand had touched it but mother natures who does all the work out here anyway elves of course he laughed and drew her into an arbored tunnel where hundreds of roses climbed and dripped onto green shady ground imported from ireland naturally its cool in here she looked up little flickers of sun and sky shone through the ceiling of flowers natures climate control she sniffed smells like well roses of course she thought but it wasnt that simple smells romantic she turned smiled at him but he wasnt smiling back what instinctively she looked over her shoulder as if expecting some threat a snake in the garden what is it how could he explain what it was to see her standing there in the dappled rosedrenched shade looking baffled a little confused by the beauty tall lean her disordered hair streaky from the sun wearing her weapon the way another woman might a string of good pearls with careless confidence and pride eve then he shook his head stepped to her resting his forehead on hers he ran his hands up and down her arms and how could he explain what it had been to stand by and watch her walk unarmed unprotected into a room to face a madman alone to know he might have lost her in an instant he knew shed faced death countless times had faced it with her theyd had each others blood on their hands before hed held her through dreams more violent and vicious than any human soul should have to bear hed walked with her through the nightmare of her past but this had been different shed been shielded only by her own courage and wit and standing back having no choice but to stand aside and watch and wait having no choice but to accept it was what shed had to do had driven an unspeakable fear into his heart like a spike he knew it was best for both of them if he didnt speak of it but she understood there were pockets and shadows inside him she still didnt fully comprehend but shed come to understand love it was she who lifted her face to his when he would have drawn back she who lifted her mouth to his he wanted to be tender it seemed right with the romance of roses in the gratitude that she was here whole and safe but the flood of emotion all but drowned him swamped by it he fisted a hand in the back of her shirt as if it were a line tossed into a raging sea that storm swept through him and into the kiss she waited for the heat of it to drop them both and for his hand to tear her shirt to ribbons but his fingers opened stroked one hard possessive line down her back before his hands came up to frame her face she could see the tempest in his eyes swarming in the blue of them with a kind of primal violence that made the breath catch in her throat and her pulse pound in response i need you his fingers dived into her hair dragging it back from her face fisting again you cant know what kind of need is in me for you there are times do you understand me i dont want it i dont want this raging inside me it wont stop his mouth crushed down on hers and she tasted that need the fierce and focused intensity of it and the greed the desperation of it she gave herself over to it without hesitation because he was wrong as he was very rarely wrong she understood the need and she understood the frustration of knowing it wouldnt be controlled the same war waged in her he released her weapon harness dragged it off tossed it aside she only wrapped herself more tightly around him moaned in drugged pleasure when his mouth his teeth fixed on the curve of her throat somewhere a bird was singing its heart out and the scent of roses grew heavy hypnotizing air that had seemed so cool in the green shade went thick went hot he yanked the shirt over her head and those hands with their long clever fingers raced over flesh until she all but felt it melt but when she tugged at his shirt he shoved her hands away locked them together at the wrist behind her back he needed control however fleeting however tenuous im taking you his voice was as thick as the air my way i want youll get what you want soon enough he unfastened the hook of her trousers but ill have what i want first and he wanted her naked he leaned in nipped her bottom lip do off the boots let go of my hands he merely slid his down into the opening of her trousers tightening his grip on her wrists when her body jerked the boots he laid his lips on hers slid his hand over her his tongue slipping in to soothe his finger slipping in to arouse with a patient seduction opposed to that steely grip on her wrists even as she murmured a protest her arms went limp dazed she began toeing off her boots and the movement of her own body shuddered her over peak she was hot and wet and trembling he wanted to touch to taste to explore and exploit every inch of her releasing her hands he moved down her body and when his mouth clamped over her she erupted her hands grabbed at his hair as she choked on gasps but he only gripped her hips and continued to destroy her she was his now in this garden in this world she was his her world was spinning all the color and scent gone mad around her his mouth was like a fever burning against her with a torment so exquisite it felt like death she could feel the heat rolling through her again filling her pumping into her blood and bone until it burst like a nova and left her shattered and still he wouldnt stop i cant i cant i can when the next rush buckled her knees he pulled her down this time he dragged her arms over her head and once again locked her wrists together do you remember the first time i had you i cant you said but you did damn it her body bowed up i want you inside me i will be he closed his free hand over her breast i can make you come this way now youre primed for it everything in you is ready for me his hand was like magic over her skin under it her breast felt impossibly full unbearably sensitive and her heart beat like a fist it pleasures me to watch it take you over he watched now as the helpless pleasure raced over her face as her breath came faster through her lips she bowed up again a trembling arch then burst then melted he shifted away began to undress she lay sprawled damp naked conquered on the soft green grass she wore only a long chain from which dripped the fat tear of a diamond and the simple st judes medal hed given her those symbols and shields that she would wear them together moved him unbearably her arms stayed flung over her head as hed left them surrendered as she surrendered to no one else he was rock hard and desperate to mate he straddled her ran his hands over her face her throat her breasts eve she saw his face so intense so strongly beautiful in the deep shade a trio of thin sunbeams shot down through the leaves and flashed light over his hair i want you to take me is that what you need to hear i want to be taken as long as its by you he drove himself into her shoved her knees back and drove himself deeper she cried out the shock of sensation slicing through her as he plunged harder she demanded and yanked until his mouth was on hers again harder his body quivered and control snapped like brittle glass caught up in his own madness he ravished her mouth her body pounding as he heard her cry out pounding as he felt her gather again with me he took her hands linking fingers now come with me he gave himself as she had given so they could take each other the blood was still roaring in his ears when he managed to roll drawing her with him so she was cushioned by his body rather than pinned under it the storm inside him had burned itself out his hand was gentle as he stroked over her back some walk he smiled a little yes well a bit of fresh air always does a body good yeah im sure it was the fresh air that did the trick she snickered now i get why people go to the countryside for a little r and r im feeling pretty rested and relaxed at the moment she lifted her head now studied his face yeah he knew what she was asking knew shed understood yeah i suppose wed better tidy ourselves up and get inside they should be bringing mcnab along soon and ive yet to tell summerset ill leave that happy little job to you coward bet your ass she rolled off him then looked around on the grass for her clothes where the hells my shirt did you eat it not to my knowledge he glanced up pointed there hanging on the roses the many uses of the garden she commented as she strode over to tug it free visual and olfactory stimulation sex capades and clothes hanger he got up laughing and the rich easy sound of it told her they were back on steady ground again once they were inside eve made a beeline for the stairs and went straight up to her office she had work she told herself it wasnt that she wanted to avoid whatever conversation roarke was going to have with summerset or it wasnt just that she put in a call to the commander first the reluctance shed shown about having roarke on board as consultant had been smoke shed already planned to tag him for it officially but there wasnt any reason to give him a swelled head about it permissions already been granted whitney told her feeney requested that roarke be asked to consult im told detective mcnabs been released from the hospital and into your care not my care so to speak ive already spoken with his parents you can expect a transmission from them ah her mind began plotting how to pass that along to summerset as well hes young and hes fit i expect hell be back on his feet in a day or two ill be working primarily out of my home office commander unless feeney feels otherwise i want cogburns unit transferred here thats your call we have a meeting tomorrow with chief tibble mayor peachtree and chang the media liaison fourteen hundred in the tower your presence is required yes sir get me some answers lieutenant when he broke transmission she sat down at her desk she might not have the answers yet but she could line up all the questions she made notes checked prior notes shuffled them together and made fresh ones cogburn louis k playground illegals possible to trace purchase of data unit search data entries to determine how often he used it per week hours per day sudden violence displayed in primitive physical bludgeoning no prior vt

mira for profile verification no prior vt reported me reports same results on prelim as cogburn symptoms displayed match death ensued without outside trauma or force murder weapondata unit it was murder she thought technology was the instrument but what was the motive dallas huh she looked up scooped her hair back and stared blankly at feeney until her mind cleared i figured youd be at home by now rode over from the hospital with the boy his face had a few new sags eve noticed and he looked exhausted go home feeney give yourself a break youre one to talk he gestured toward her notes just wanted to see mcnab settled it was a good thing you did having him come here he seems pretty chipper he dropped into a chair shit dallas shit hes halfparalyzed thats temporary you know it can happen if you take a hit wrong yeah yeah take it wrong enough its permanent hes twentyfuckingsix years old you know that it curdled in her belly no i guess i didnt his parents are in scotland spend most summers there they were set to head back but he talked them out of it i think part of hims afraid to have them see him like this part of hims afraid hes not going to come all the way back we let him think like that we think like that were not helping him i know it i keep seeing halloway the way he looked when he went down he let out a deep breath i had to talk to his family too didnt know what the hell to say to them and the goddamn reporters and my squad my kids feeney youve been through a bad one its different than when it happens in the field you should talk to the department shrink she winced at the look he shot her i know how that sounds coming from me too but damn it you were a hostage you had a weapon jammed at your throat by one of your own men you watched him die if that hasnt screwed with your head what would so you should talk to the shrink or mira if it were me id go to mira shed keep it off the record if you asked her i dont want to open my head or spill my guts his voice went tight wrapped with bands of insult and temper i need to work okay recognizing the signs as shed seen them often enough in her own mirror she backed off were going to have plenty id as soon work from here for the time being if its okay with you but the first order of business is to rig some sort of shield or filter on that unit nobody touches it until we have it shielded from what how are we supposed to design the right shield when we dont know what its supposed to block thats a problem i expect you and the expert consultant civilian youve already requested will figure out something he nearly smiled thought that might burn you a little but you know damn well hes the best then put him to work and get me a shield she got to her feet it felt awkward but it also felt right to cross over to his chair crouch down until their eyes were level go home feeney have a beer be with your wife shes a cops wife but shes not going to feel easy till she sees you and youre not going to feel steady until you see her i need you on this i need you steady there was a lot more said between them that didnt take words kids today he said at length think they know every damn thing his hand closed over hers squeezed once then he got up walked out went home she sat where hed sat for a moment laid her hands where his had laid then she got up walked to her desk went back to work she brought up cogburns data then halloways personal file she was halfway through a search for any connections when her link beeped dallas got one youre going to want to see baxters face filled most of the screen but she could see the movements hear the sounds of a crime scene behind him im on a priority baxter i cant take another case handle it youre going to want this vics a fiftythreeyearold male first glance it looks like somebody got in attacked him but you look closer he did all the damage in here himself including slitting his own throat i dont have time for a lot of premortem bleeding ears and nose and take a look at this he turned she caught glimpses of a spacious room thoroughly trashed then the desk unit that lay screenup on the floor absolute purity achieved dont let anyone touch that unit im on my way she was halfway out the door when she swore strode back to the desk to hunt up a memo listen she spoke into it as she crossed into roarkes office i got tagged related death ill be back when i get back sorry she tossed the memo on his console then bolted chadwick fitzhugh had lived and lived well in a twolevel condominium on the upper east side his profession was primarily being the solitary male of the fourthgeneration fitzhughs which meant he socialized smoothly looked snappy in a dinner suit played a mean game of polo and could if pressed discuss stock options the family business was money in all its many forms and the fitzhughs had plenty of it his hobbies were travel fashion gambling and seducing young boys baxter filled her in on the basic data while eve studied the bloody mess that was now chadwick fitzhugh name popped on the data search known pedophile trolled the clubs surfed the chat rooms baxter stated he liked them between fourteen and sixteen pattern was to buy them alcohol zoner whatever worked lure them up here with the promise of more then hed pull out the toys into bondage hed do them whether they were willing or not looks like he took vids if his homemade stash is any indication then hed give them some cash pat them on the head and tell them if they squawked about it theyd be in more trouble than he would baxter looked down at the body mostly they believed him if we know this have record of this at least one of the kids squawked yeah he got reported four times over the last two years baxter pulled out a pack of gum from the pocket of his onduty suit offered it in new york anyway he continued while he and eve chewed spearmint contemplatively got charged family money and lots of highdollar lawyers stepped in and made it all go away nothing stuck to this creep worlds a better place without him eve grunted and fitting on microgoggles examined the throat wound it gaped like a wide screaming mouth no visible hesitation marks when you gotta go you gotta go with a sealed finger she turned fitzhughs head his ear canal was thick with blood surfed the chat rooms i got the statement here in the file from one of the complaints thats how he roped this one kid anyway looked for young boys going through a sexual identity crisis or those just playing around got a playpen upstairs rooms done in black leather you got your cuffs your whips your ball gags butt plugs and various mechanical devices firstclass vid setup he tucked his notebook away how it looked was he had some kid in here who went bonkers on him place is pretty smashed up and hes got quite the potpourri of illegals around here but security discs dont show anyone coming in here or going out for the last three days not even the dead guy who called it in sister lives down on st thomas guess youve been to the islands plenty now he added blue water white sand mostly naked women wouldnt mind trading this heat for some of that he gave a wistful sigh then crouched down beside eve careful to keep his cuffs out of the blood so anyway bro here was supposed to fly down today big family party or some shit doesnt show she gets worried gives him a call he answered screaming at her cursing nose bleeding like a tap she figured he was hurt being attacked and called it in im going to need to talk to her get a formal statement with her hands braced on her thighs eve looked over at baxter i have to take this one away from you yeah he huffed out a breath pushed to his feet figured everybody knows what went down in edd today he looked around frowned at the computer screen what the hells going on im putting together a team to find out she straightened you want in on that he looked back at her i want in then youre in i need copies of the security discs fitzhughs file sisters name and location we talk to neighbors family known associates see if we can determine when fitzhugh got infected she scratched her head we need to review his personal vid collection oh yeah thats my idea of a good time watching some creep pork little boys maybe one of those little boys has been playing with computer programs this unit needs to be transported to my home office we working this out of your digs he brightened immediately solid nobody messes with it no search no scan it gets shut down and stays shut down until i say otherwise same goes for any of the data centers in this place she looked around were going through this place top to bottom see if he put anything on hard copy he gets bagged sent to morris with a red flag got it hey wheres your shadow my shadow the inestimable peabody shes looking pretty good these days a knothole in an oak tree looks good to you baxter only after a very long very hard day how come you didnt bring her in on this shes in shes just shes with mcnab his humor faded hows he doing hes okay awake coherent good attitude hes she shoved her hands in her pockets hes having a little trouble with his right side what do you mean trouble but he knew every cop knew ah shit dallas goddamn it temporary right its just temporary yeah theyre saying that they stood for a moment in silence lets get to work here she ordered chapter she found roarke in his office when she got home since it was there she picked up the coffee at his elbow and drank it straight down like water dead pedophile slit his own throat went nuts first broke up his own fancy apartment morris is going to find severe intercranial pressure the purity message was on his machine just the one unit i dont know yet im having all of them sent here ive got to find out how those units were compromised how that causes a human brain to essentially blow up you dont say you have to find out why purity she said and sat clean out the dirt and make absolute purity the world would be better off without them she said aloud thinking of baxters comment a vigilante group with superior tech knowledge he nodded halloway was simply a casualty of war both of your victims preyed on children yeah they were scum of a particularly disgusting sort but theyre your scum now you got it im going to need to go through the known victims of my victims kids who might have strong tech skills more likely family members who do could be well find somebody who had a kid messed with by both cogburn and fitzhugh chadwick fitzhugh roarke picked up his coffee mug scowled into it then strode to the autochef slimy puddle of piss hey just because i drank your coffee thats no reason for calling me names fitzhugh bloody smug bastard buggering young boys someone ought tove taken a knife to his throat long before this i take it you knew him well enough to find him revolting in every possible way there was a different tone a different look than when baxter had described fitzhugh a far more dangerous one in that icy control that musical lilt his familys old money roarke continued very uppercrust and pedigreed too fine to do business with the likes of me though they have done he added as he turned back his face was cold now warrior cold until this sneaking badgers favored form of entertainment got out and about then it was me who wouldnt do business with them even a dublin alley rats got to have standards not doing business with him is one thing and three cheers for you there killing hims another cut his own throat didnt he he took a swig of coffee more fitting to my mind if hed cut off his own balls first but life isnt always willing to be poetical she went cold now too as cold as the ice that settled in the pit of her stomach no one has the right to stand in judgment to pull on an executioners hood without due process there are times lieutenant im not so fond of that line of the law as you are in fact have the coffee i think ill have a drink to toast buggering fitzhughs demise she rose when he went to a cabinet opened it and perused wine bottles in the rack if thats your stand you cant help me on this thats my stand he selected a good cabernet an exceptionally good one but it doesnt mean i cant and wont help you dont ask me to be sorry hes dead and i wont ask you to be glad of it theyd been on opposite sides before she thought but this was opposite sides on very very shaky ground whatever he did whatever he was someone murdered him its no different from lynching a man or standing him against the wall and blasting him to pieces the law determines guilt and punishment were not going to march in file on this one eve and consider this with all those fine words youve just spoken arent you standing there right now judging me i dont know but her belly was beginning to churn but i do know i dont want to get this messed up with a personal thing between us we can agree on that he spoke briskly as if they were debating differing views on what color to paint the parlor ill do whatever i can to help you find who or what is doing this let that be enough watching him drink she worried it wouldnt be enough do you think murdering him was right i think its right hes dead is that enough differentiation for you lieutenant she didnt know and felt the ground tremble under her feet ive got to put reports together for the morning briefing so he thought theyd leave it there for now you might call peabody up to help you she could use a distraction hows mcnab settled in a bit sulky as summerset put him on light food rather than the steak dinner of his dreams his attitudes cheerful but straining around the edges theres no feeling yet it can take up to twentyfour hours usually its back within one to three but it hell well look into specialists if need be theres a clinic in switzerland thats had great success in this area she nodded here she thought was a man who believed murder was given the right circumstances a viable option or at least the result of it something worthy of a personal toast and he could would take the time use his own money without hesitation to help a friend ill see if peabody wants to put some hours in it was closing in on two am when she sent peabody off to bed and thought about heading toward her own the door between her office and roarkes was closed now and the light over it indicated he was still in there working she thought very likely carving away at business hed had scheduled for the next day so he could clear his time for her she paced back and forth in front of the door she wished she could tap someone else wished she had another source with half his skill and half his resources she could call on so that they could avoid picking their way over this boggy ground of opposing beliefs picking their way hell neither of them had the patience to walk daintily some things were bound to get crushed underfoot she couldnt afford to worry about it she rapped briskly pushed open the door sorry just letting you know im turning in briefings at nine mmmhmm he continued to study the data on his monitor counteroffer four point six million usd firm terms ten percent escrowed on verbal agreement forty on signing remainder at settlement acceptance by he glanced at his wrist unit noon tomorrow eastern or negotiations are ended transmit he swiveled away smiled at her ill be along shortly what are you buying oh just a little villa in tuscany with a rather nice vineyard thats been mismanaged sounds like a lot of dough for a little villa and a mismanaged vineyard dont worry darling we can still afford those new curtains for the kitchen you know i dont have to pretend an interest in the stuff you do if youre going to crack wise when i do his smile only widened youre absolutely right how rude of me would you like to see the cost projections for the rehab then theres the vintners report and the financials from the bite me can i take a raincheck on that id really like to finish this up if things go well i think we might be able to squeeze out the coin for a new parlor sofa as well im going to bed before i spring a rib laughing at all your funny jokes nine ace sharp she swung away then cursed viciously as her desk link beeped what now she stormed across the room snarled into the link dallas what always such a pleasure to see your cheerful face dallas nadine furst onair reporter for channel fluttered her lashes no comment nadine no fucking comment go away hold it hold it dont cut me off first just let me say my feelings are crushed that you didnt notice i wasnt around for the excitement today i just got back in town twenty minutes ago and you called me at two in the morning to let me know youre home safe and sound second nadine said coolly when going through my mail messages deliveries that accumulated during my absence i came across this she held up a disc the contents are very very hot and i think of professional interest to you somebody sends you a sex vid call vice its from a group calling themselves the purity seekers dont use your computer eve snapped shut it down now dont touch it dont run that disc again im on my way listen but she broke transmission and raced for the door ill drive roarke ran down the steps beside her dont argue i might be able to find something on her machine or on the disc i wasnt going to argue i was going to tell you to pick one of your faster toys they made it to nadines apartment in under eight minutes give the disc to roarke eve demanded the instant nadine opened the door im taking you to the nearest health center just a minute just a damn minute she shoved at eve when eve grabbed her arm the disc isnt infected they made that clear stop dragging me they want media exposure they want the public to know their purpose eve pulled back shut down the image of seeing a friend die screaming they want you to air the disc its text only they want me to report thats what i do nadine huffed out a breath rubbed her arm where eves fingers had dug in i guess i should appreciate you worrying about my health but this is going to bruise youll live and that was the point i need the disc nadine arched one of her perfectly shaped eyebrows her attractive foxy face was every bit as determined as eves she was shorter than eve curvy and no doubt softer but when it came to a story she could do plenty of asskicking herself youre not getting it this is a homicide investigation and its a story freedom of the press dallas you might have heard of it the disc was mailed to me ill get a warrant to confiscate and to dump your pretty ass in a cage if you withhold evidence and obstruct justice nadine had to rise onto her toes to compensate for the difference in height but she managed to push her face into eves im not obstructing anything and you know it i didnt have to contact you i could have gone straight to air with this so just shut down your thrusters sister ladies ladies taking the risk all men fear roarke stepped between two snarling women lets just take a deep breath you both have valid points it might settle things a bit if we took a look at the disc theres no guarantee its not infected i can take it into quarantine you know thats bull nadine shook back her streaky blonde mane of hair theyve got no beef with me they want what i can give them exposure to the public if youd read the text youll see exactly what i mean dallas theyve just gotten started all right lets take a look and if we all start bleeding from the ears hey the jokes on us nadine led the way through the living area into a large office space done in classy pastels and clean lines she plopped down at a desk run disc i told you to shut the unit down just read the damn screen dear ms furst we are the purity seekers and are contacting you due to our belief of your respect for the public welfare we want to assure you that we admire your dedication to your work and wish you no harm this disc is clean you have our word that no harm will come to you through us we seek only the purity of justice a justice that is not cannot always be served through the confines of law that too often is forced to ignore the victim and serve the criminal our police force our courts even our government often find their hands tied by the slippery rope of tangled laws designed to protect those who prey on the innocent we were formed and are sworn to serve the innocent some will find our means distressing some will find them frightening no war can or should be fought without distress or fear but most will find our means just and our ends a victory for all who have been lost in a system that no longer serves the common good by the time this message reaches you the first execution will have taken place louis k cogburn was a blight on society a man who corrupted and addicted our children he hunted them on the playgrounds and the schoolyards and the parks of our city luring those young and innocent bodies and minds with illegals he has been charged he has been tried he has been sentenced he has been executed absolute purity in the matter of louis k cogburn has been achieved he was infected through a technology we have designed and developed as his soul was blighted so did we blight his brain until death there is no danger to you to the innocent to the public from this infection we are not terrorists but guardians who have vowed to serve our neighbors whatever the cost others have been tried convicted and sentenced we will not stop seeking those who profit by and pleasure themselves on the grief and harm of others until absolute purity has been achieved in new york we ask you to inform the public of our message of our goals and to assure them that we work to protect and preserve the victim who the law cannot serve we hope to consider you our media liaison in this matter the purity seekers thats tidy isnt it eve commented real tidy they dont bother to mention ralph wooster who got his brains bashed in or suzanne cohen who was beaten unconscious no talk about a dead cop or one who may be paralyzed just how pure and true their goals are to serve the public what are you going to do my job nadine told her youre going to air this garbage yes im going to air it its news and its my job to report the news nice bump to your ratings im going to let that pass nadine said after a moment because youve got a dead cop and another one i consider a friend whos hurt and im letting it pass because yeah this is going to be a nice bump to the ratings youre here right now reading this before i go on the air because i respect you because youre someone else i consider a friend and because i happen to believe justice doesnt have shortcuts if you dont respect me and my purpose then ive made a mistake eve turned away kicked a small sofa with enough force to make nadine wince youre the only reporter ive been able to stand on a professional level for more than ten minutes oh my im so very touched friendships a separate issue lets just stick with the program for now youre good at your job and you play it straight thank you and right back at you that doesnt mean im going to do a happy dance knowing youre going to be broadcasting this crap guardians my ass you cant put a damn halo on murder good one can i quote you fury leaped into eves eyes this is off the record this is all off the record nadine agreed calmly but youre going to want to go on the record very fast i need a oneonone with you interviews with whitney with tibble with feeney mcnab i need to talk to halloways people family friends associates i need a statement from the mayor would you like me to tie a bow around all that for you nadine nadine fisted her hands on her hips this is my area and i know how to play it if you want this story balanced if you hope to spin it your way i need airtime with all the key players eve roarke laid a hand on eves rigid shoulder shes right she couldnt be more right the majority of viewers will be fascinated by this group theyll look at cogburn and fitzhugh whos fitzhugh nadine demanded are you talking about chadwick fitzhugh is he dead shut up eve snapped let me think let me finish roarke corrected theyll look at the people this group has executed and think well its no more than they deserved they were parasites preying on our children like you she said before she could stop herself face expressionless he inclined his head if youre hoping yet ill work my way around to indignation over the death of a swine like fitzhugh youre doomed to disappointment the difference is i saw what happened to a young cop today what happened to ian what might have happened to feeney to you that changes the complexion of this pompous egocentric and selfserving statement but some who hear it will consider this purity group heroes heroism isnt achieved by remote control eve snapped if you keep spouting sound bites like that off the record nadine said im going to break down and cry then show them up for cowards roarke told her let the public see the grief halloways family is feeling because their son was an innocent victim a cop who died in the line of duty because of something this group started you let them see mcnab young eager wounded you need to use the media as thoroughly as skillfully as they will i need to find them i need to stop them not play whos spinning the media wheel now lieutenant roarke squeezed her shoulder you need to do both i need that disc nadine ejected it held it out this is the original ive already made a copy for myself she smiled as eve snatched it out of her hand its going to be such fun working with you i dont give you anything on record until ive cleared this with whitney go ahead give him a call id say we could all use some coffee ill give you a hand with that roarke strolled out of the room with her eve took a moment to calm down she hated knowing nadine was right she would have to fight part of this battle on the airwaves she used nadines link to wake up her commander shes been in there a long time nadine poured a second cup of coffee you wouldnt break the story at this time of morning because nadine was puffing on one of her herbals roarke indulged himself with a cigarette he preferred real tobacco youll wait until six to maximize the viewing audience and ratings catch your competitors unprepared and thoroughly screw up their firstoftheday broadcasts youre good at this ive some experience with manipulation im giving her ten more minutes then i have to call into the station block the time do the prep call in an electronics expert i dont suppose youd i think not that would be skirting right over the line eves already drawn in her mind over this but i can recommend a couple of names if you dont have anyone particular in mind i was thinking mya dubber shes excellent a solid handle on electronics and a pleasant way of communicating technical jargon in simple terms she works for you doesnt she in a freelance capacity yes unable to sit any longer nadine stood up to pace shes cutting me close on this ive got research to do copy to write interviews to set up this storys going to blow everything else off the air whos next thatll be one of the questions and theyll keep tuning in until theres an answer and my cop will work herself into the ground to try to beat that answer so there is no next thats why you have to respect her and thats why she always makes a damn good story are you two butting heads over this one he blew out a lazy stream of smoke not heads so much as philosophies its more difficult for her to accept mine than it is for me to accept hers well work through it i appreciate you backing me up on this i didnt do it for you he stated calmly i did it for her i know i appreciate it anyway nadine spun around as she heard eve come in well youll get your oneonones with me and whitney asap the mayor will draft a statement that may be read by the deputy mayor thats not decided yet he or she will do some questions pending approval were not going to contact halloways family at this hour and add to their distress if in the morning theyre willing to speak with you well arrange it the same goes for feeney he had a rough one today she said before nadine could speak im not waking him up for this you can interview mcnab at our place pending medical clearance ill let you know as soon as i can chief tibble will also draft a statement and consider an interview after hes reviewed all the data take it nadine because thats the best youre going to get have some coffee i need to make a call and change into wardrobe well do the oneonones with you and whitney in studio one hour she got through it toeing the departmental line throughout the interview if nadine wasnt thrilled with the content of the interview she knew it wasnt the words that would make the segment it was lieutenant eve dallas herself looking pale and exhausted and absolutely steady to eves surprise mayor steven peachtree arrived just as she was going offcamera at fortythree he projected both a youthful and steady image he was dignified and handsome in a conservative gray suit with a broadcastready blue shirt and a tie perfectly knotted in tones of both gray and blue he came in looking alert and grim with a small entourage of smartly dressed aides he ignored the way you ignore your own shadow commander he nodded to whitney and was close enough now that eve noted the faint smudges of lost sleep under his eyes i felt this needed to be addressed personally and swiftly im told youve also been consulting with chang re official statements thats correct we need unification on this a solid line i absolutely agree the media liaison will have updated statements for all parties by eight hundred lieutenant mayor we need swift and decisive action on this matter my office is to be kept updated on every action taken he glanced toward the studio were going to keep this goddamn mess under control well feed ms furst and the others no more than what we determine is good for public consumption were not the only ones feeding her eve pointed out im aware of that his voice managed to be both rich and chilly at the same time whatever they toss out well spin back we can count on chang for that youll work directly with him and deputy mayor franco on media relations he glanced at his wrist unit frowned keep me informed he ordered then strode off to the prep room hes good at this whitney told eve hell come off strong controlled and concerned were going to need strong image projection to keep this lid from blowing off and spilling the contents all over new york it seems to me the way to keep the lid on is to identify and stop the purity seekers thats your priority lieutenant but the job has more than one channel the memorial service for detective halloway is scheduled for tomorrow ten full honors i want you there yes sir ill be there todays meeting has been bumped up to thirteen hundred get some sleep he added before he walked over to take his turn in the studio its going to be a long one at home she fell facedown on the bed for three and a half hours the alarm on her wrist unit woke her with its incessant beeping she crawled out of bed in the dark stumbled into the shower and stayed under hot crisscrossing jets for twenty full minutes when she came back in the bedroom roarke was just getting up did i wake you you could catch another half hour im fine he gave her face a critical study then nodded and you look considerably better than you did at four this morning why dont you order us up some breakfast while i get a shower i was just going to grab a bagel at my desk youve changed your mind he said as he went into the bath because youve remembered that your body needs proper fuel to maintain energy and health and because youd prefer i not pour a protein shake down your throat as that just starts your day off on the wrong foot scrambled eggs would be good wouldnt they she bared her teeth but he was already in the shower she ate she told herself because she was hungry and when roarke buzzed summerset on the inhouse link and asked about mcnab she tried to feel optimistic at the information that the patient had spent a restful night just as she struggled against despair when she watched him ride into her office in an electronic wheelchair hey his face was just a little too cheerful his voice was just a little too bright im getting me one of these rides when im back on my feet they rule no racing in the corridors he grinned at her too late well wait for feeney before i start the briefing eve began we caught the morning report on lieutenant peabodys eyes were shadowed and more than a little desperate when they met eves behind mcnabs back id say we got a good start on the briefing i need coffee she gestured for roarke to distract mcnab then jerked a thumb toward the kitchen youve got to hold up better than this she told peabody the minute they were out of earshot hes not stupid i know im okay its just when i see him in that chair i get a little shaky theres no change they said he should start to feel a tingling like you do when your foots asleep and starts to wake up that would signal the nerves are coming back but hes not theyre not recovery time varies ive taken a full body blast and had no appreciable numbness within minutes and ive had a glancing stream hit my arm and put it down for hours hes scared hes pretending hes not but hes really scared if he can pretend hes not so can you and if you want to do something about the people who put him in that chair temporarily then you need to pull it in and focus i know peabody drew a deep breath straightened her shoulders i can handle it good then get started by handling the coffee she walked back out stopped cold when she saw feeney in her office doorway his face was a picture of misery sorrow and fury as he stared at the back of mcnabs chair eve started to make a sound anything that would snap him back but before she could he hit some internal switch his face cleared whats all this he came in scowling at mcnab this looks like malingering to me trust you to manage to get a toy out of it all iced huh first time you run over my foot im flattening you baxters on his way in got coffee yeah eve nodded we got coffee by ninethirty shed given the team the basic details by nine fortyfive shed filled in the gaps and by ten shed added a basic theory at least one of the key people in this group has been personally affected by a crime most likely a crime against a child most probably more than one of them you need like minds to get something like this off the ground they have superior and as yet unknown electronic abilities and must have some sort of medical consultant its also likely they have contact of some sort with the police or with the judicial system or both theyre organized theyre articulate and theyre media savvy when youve got a group like this baxter said youve got those like minds but you almost always have one or more whos in it for the thrill the blood or because theyre just seriously wacko agreed you can start a search for serious wackos who fit another of the groups profile they will contact nadine again she continued they want public attention and approval theyre going to get it feeney slurped at his coffee this is just the sort of thing that gets people riled up arguing in the streets making up tshirts taking sides we cant stop the media train so we do our best to steer it onto our tracks nadine wants to interview both you and mcnab you can blow she said before feeney could do just that but you wont be saying anything i didnt already say or think the point is the department believes this will be helpful you think im giving this airtime feeney slammed his cup down you think im going to go onscreen and yammer about what happened yesterday talk about that boy what youll say will help people understand what happened with halloway roarke spoke quietly it will make them see him as he was a good cop who was doing his job who was killed in the line of duty by a group of people who want to be perceived as guardians of justice youd make them see him as a person id like to talk about it mcnab was strapped into the chair it was something he couldnt ignore no matter how hard he tried he wasnt just sitting but secured in so he wouldnt slump down like a ragdoll tumble out like a baby it burned in his belly along with the fear that he would be strapped in a chair the rest of his life if people listen theyd understand he wasnt the one who put me down it was whoever infected that unit he was working on halloway didnt put me in here and he doesnt deserve anyone thinking he did so id like to do the interview id like to say what i have to say if thats what you want feeney picked up his coffee again drank it to wash away the fistsized lump in his throat then thats what well do the departments issued statements youll both need to read them eve walked to her desk gave herself time to settle they wont preclude or censor anything you feel you want to say but theyd like you to get in the bullet points and some of the language its important nypsd show unity in this regard nadine can do the interviews here she turned back now maybe we can get down to the business of cop work we need to determine the nature of the virus in the units and that cant be done until we have some sort of shield against that virus ive done a bit of work on that roarke told her and taken the liberty of calling in a technical adviser he turned to the link summerset send him up you shouldve cleared this with me eve began you need specific skills for this feeney and mcnab need more than me and i need more than an assistant ive someone whos been doing some very innovative work with my r and d departments and i dont think youll find anything to worry about regarding his loyalty or his clearance eve looked at the doorway and her jaw dropped well for christs sake roarke i cant use a kid for this chapter genius has no age so said jamie lingstrom as he strutted into her office on a pair of dilapidated airboots he wore his sandy hair short and spiked on top with a longer hank in the front that flopped over his forehead the only piercing apparently was to accommodate the tiny silver hoop at the tail of his left eyebrow his face had done some fining down since the last time shed seen him and right now his mouth was twisted into a smirk hed always been cocky his grandfather had been a cop whod gone down while unofficially investigating a cult the cult had killed jamies sister and had come uncomfortably close to sacrificing eve hed sprouted up at least two inches when did kids stop growing she wondered he was sixteen no likely seventeen by now and he should have been doing whatever teenagers did rather than standing in her office with that cocky expression why arent you in school i do the home thing mostly on work program you get to do handsonthejob crap as long as its with a business that contracts through the school and shit eve turned to roarke one of yours actually i have several companies that contract with the education program the youth of today after all is the hope of tomorrow so jamie scanned the room then dipped his thumbs into the front pockets of baggy jeans with holes at both knees when do we get started you eve jabbed a finger at roarke there pointing at his office she strode in ahead of him slammed the door smartly what the hell do you think youre doing bringing in an expert assistant hes a kid hes a brilliant kid you do recall how he managed to bypass the security here with a homemade jammer so he got lucky luck had nothing to do with it that particular homemade had been refined adjusted expanded he has more than a knowledge of electronics though he has that in spades i can promise you he has a feel an instinct thats very rare id like to keep his brain inside his head at least until he turns twentyone ive no intention of allowing him to do anything that puts him in physical jeopardy neither of us intended that last fall either but he came damn close and hes well hes like feeneys family exactly itll give feeney a lift to work with him the fact is eve we need someone like him someone with an open mind and a quick brain he wont automatically think a thing cant be done because its not been done before roarke spread his hands hell see possibilities he wants to be a cop he added before eve could speak yeah i remember but is determined to be unless i can bribe him into one of my r and d divisions permanently with great gobs of money his lips twitched which ill certainly attempt at the moment he plans to ditch any thought of college and leap straight into the academy when he hits eighteen next year so what youre hoping to use this assignment to turn him off that idea into college so you can scoop his genius brain up for your own uses he smiled slowly and with great charm thats a lovely thought but actually i thought this would be a valuable experience for him and we need him im not blowing smoke when i say that what you need electronically is going to take considerable work and research and experimentation all of which you require in a compressed time frame correct yeah but look im your expert consultant for a rather pathetic monetary wage and under that agreement i have the option of selecting a technical assistant hes mine she blew out a breath paced to the window paced back not just yours it makes him mine too i dont know how to deal with a teenaged type person ah well id say youd deal with him as you deal with everyone else you order him around and if he argues or doesnt jump quickly enough you freeze his blood with one of those vicious looks youre so good at and verbally abuse him it always works so well for you you think so there see he cupped her chin there it is now i can actually feel my blood running cold you can keep him but hes on probation and youve waived your pathetic monetary wage have i he frowned i cant seem to recall doing so and his fee comes out of your pocket hed already intended to pay jamie but knew how to play the game thats exceedingly unfair im going to talk to my departmental representative about this highhanded treatment you dont have a departmental rep she walked back to the door you got me to both my joy and sorrow he replied behind her back as she strode into her office jamie was crouched between feeney and mcnab showing off some handheld device itll read every system on the market and some that arent on it yet he was saying then it clones his head came up and then his body the handheld was jammed into his back pocket so hey we got a deal or what roarke merely crossed to him held out a hand shoulders slumping jamie pulled the jammer out of his pocket i only borrowed one so i could see about finetuning a couple of functions dont hose me jamie and if you continue to borrow equipment youll be losing your work program privileges very quickly the jammer disappeared into one of roarkes pockets it was my prototype and the royalties from it roarke mused would make the boy a very rich young man but he said nothing merely lifted an eyebrow and waited for jamie to squirm okay okay dont fry your circuits sulking he looked at roarke looked at eve he was never quite sure which of them was in charge either way he knew both of them could stomp him flat before he saw them lift a foot itd been easy with his parents before the divorce his father had been in charge after especially after alice died jamie himself had mostly been in charge but around here you just never knew whats the word he demanded youre attached as roarkes tech in a probationary capacity eve told him you step out of line over the line try wiggling under the line i squash you like a bug now do you see everyone in this room yeah nothing wrong with the orbs so theyre all the boss of you which means anyone here gives you an order including telling you to stand on your head and whistle through your teeth you do it clear next she continued before he had time to complain all data all info all conversations all actions or proposed actions done or discussed pertaining to this assignment are confidential you speak of this to no one including your best pal your mother any girl youre hoping to see naked or your pet poodle i dont blab off he said with some heat i know how it works and i dont have any lame poodle plus ive seen naked girls he grinned now including you careful lad roarke said quietly step carefully youve got a smart mouth i remember that about you deliberately eve walked a circle around him i like a smart mouth under certain circumstances so instead of yanking your ears over your head and tying them in a knot im going to overlook that comment once baxter take this drone into the work area show him the basic setup if he touches anything break his fingers you got it lets go kid when they reached the doorway baxter leaned down howd you see her naked hes going to be trouble eve muttered hell be worth it roarke slid a hand over the jammer in his pocket believe me hes a good kid dallas feeney pushed to his feet smart and as steady as you get at that age well keep him in line im counting on it im dumping him on you eguys nadine and her camera are due in about twenty shes never late you both good to do the oneonones downstairs somewhere works for me mcnab glanced toward feeney i want to get that over and get on the job she doesnt come up here eve cautioned she doesnt go near the kid any progress any at all tag me ive got a meet downtown at thirteen hundred ill be working out of here until then lets get started feeney laid a hand on mcnabs uninjured shoulder well show the boy what real edd men can do flick baxter back this way i need to get him set up somewhere ill take care of that youll want him on this level roarke assumed fine and whatever that is in your pocket ace keep it there he shot her such a hot suggestive grin that peabody was forced to swallow get the salacious images out of your head peabody eve ordered weve got work she started peabody on probability scans when you were dealing with brass and bureaucrats the more data the more paper the better eve began a hunt for known child abusers whod wiggled through the system and out again how did so many of them skate over the law she wondered she backtracked looking for any connection between one or more of her possibles and each other between one or more and either cogburn or fitzhugh birds of a feather she mused some of them had to have sullied the same nest at one point it was irritating to have to go by case numbers rather than names but a great number of the files were sealed minor victims often had seals slapped onto their files using numbers incident reports descriptions she whittled it down to a short list ran probabilities since her short list was over twentyfive possibles she worked on secondary connections twelve of the minor victims had shared the same child services rep clarissa price born oi queens new york id number lhm mother muriel price father unknown marital status single employment child services manhattan division employed since currently b level education masters degrees sociology psychology earned from nyu no criminal record visual she ordered and studied the image of clarissa price an attractive mixedrace female with a competent straightahead look about her not many in child services lasted as long without the job adding lines and layers but clarissas skin was smooth her reddish brown hair was curly and worn neatly pulled back at the nape eve called up the home and work addresses copied and saved the data then went hunting again this time she found a cop detective sergeant thomas dwier had arrested cogburn four years earlier on possession with intent but hed rushed it scooping cogburn up without ascertaining if hed been carrying the arrest hadnt stuck hed had better luck with an illegals dealer who supplied the uptown teenage crowd but by the time the case had wound itself through the system it had been pleaded down to possession and the dealer had ended up paying a fine and walking hed bumped into fitzhugh as well taking on a complaint of abduction and rape that had been tossed by the pa eighteen months before dwier had worked on a team running a sting on a child pornographer the woman had run a licensed day care center the case had gone all the way to trial resulting in acquittal mary ellen george eve thought who according to the files just happened to be a known associate of chadwick fitzhugh saddle up peabody eve stuck data discs in her bag were going to make a couple of stops before the tower meeting mary ellen george that was some trial in the passenger seat peabody studied the data eve had accumulated did you buy that act of hers what act that shattered innocent schoolmarm act peabody glanced over squinted didnt you catch any of the trial onscreen i dont watch that crap well you mustve seen the blips in media reports read the commentaries and stuff i make it a point to avoid media reports commentaries editorials and so on but sir youve got to watch the news onscreen or read it why well to keep abreast of current events why because because flustered peabody pushed back her uniform cap to scratch her head because we live in the world yes we do there doesnt seem to be a thing we can do about it now tell me how watching news blips and the on trial channel is going to make me a better person just informed peabody answered seems to me its only news for a few minutes then its old and they have to blast up something else thats news vicious cycle if you ask me i dont get caught up in it because by definition events that are current today are no longer current tomorrow and before you know it its tomorrow anyway so youve just wasted all that time getting riled up about something thats past its time when you wake up the next day my head hurts i know theres a major flaw in everything you just said but it made my head hurt so i cant think of it dont worry about it well check out george later first we take a shot at clarissa price parking near the manhattan division of child services was a joke the twolevel slots the city had put in along the street were jammed with vehicles that looked as if they hadnt dared move out in the last five years eve saw at least three with pancake tires and another with a windshield so covered with dust and grime it wouldve taken a pickax to clear it she doubleparked flipped up her on duty sign and wondered idly just how far traffic would back up before she came out again the building was a squat twelvestory box of block construction that surely hadnt seen its proper share of city maintenance dollars since it had been tossed up after the urban wars the lobby such as it was was small and crowded and boasted an ancient manual directory sixth floor she walked right by the beleaguered lobby receptionist and onto an elevator so much eve mused for building security and as shed had personal experience with child services she knew that the kids whod been sucked into the system could be just as dangerous as the adults who put them there she stepped out on six and saw someone had tried to add an illusion of cheer in this area there was a section under a window with childsized seating in primary colors and an offering of plastic toys across from it were two vidgame units currently under attack by a pair of bored surly teenagers in rebel black she saw one of them gaze up and make her for a cop before his eyes traveled over peabodys uniform and dismissed them both she walked up to him waited for his lazy glance to meet hers again then she leaned over take the knife out of your boot real slow and give it to me and i wont run you in for carrying a concealed since it was concealed and very well in his opinion he only sneered fuck off eves hand slapped on the hilt under his pants leg seconds before his you want trouble with me ill oblige otherwise ill just take this and let you spend your mandatory hour bullshitting your social worker she yanked the knife out of his boot slid it into her own nice blade decent balance cost me seventyfive you got hosed pal its not that good she turned her back on him and walked to the young cheeryfaced receptionist they were always young and cheeryfaced because they rarely lasted a year before running away with their idealism shattered behind them i need to see clarissa price eve laid her badge on the counter miss price is in a family session she should be finished in ten minutes well wait eve walked back and deliberately dropped into the seat beside knife boy it took him twenty seconds of pretending indifference to break howd you spot the sticker thatd be telling come on shed already spotted the bruises on his wrists fresh and when he shifted saw the old burn marks on his shoulder only partially hidden by his toughguy muscle shirt that was one thing her father hadnt done to her she thought no burns no scars wouldnt want to diminish the value of the merchandise when you made me you moved your right leg back rotated your ankle to check if the blade was under and secure you get busted for carrying they toss you in juvie ever been inside the way he shrugged told her he hadnt yet i have whatever deal youve got its better than being inside couple of years theyll shove you out of the system and your lifes your own you go inside at this stage theyll keep tabs on you till youre twentyone since that was as close to advice or a lecture as she intended to give she pushed up again and went out to hunt up a vending machine by the time she got bad coffee the receptionist told her miss price had five minutes free before her next session it was a small office but again the attempt had been made to brighten it art obviously created by children was framed to cover two of the walls files were neatly stacked on the desk and sat beside a little vase of fresh daisies behind them clarissa looked as neat and competent as her id photo im sorry you had to wait she began im afraid lauren didnt get your name dallas lieutenant dallas we havent met on the job no im homicide homicide i see whats this about one of my kids no not directly you worked with some minors who had associations with a playground dealer louis k cogburn and an alleged pedophile chadwick fitzhugh i worked with minors who were exploited by those individuals a couple of your case files also intersected with other known or alleged child predators but at the moment were interested in cogburn in fitzhugh who are dead clarissa said flatly i heard the report on this morning some paraorganization is claiming responsibility terrorist organization eve corrected who is also responsible for the death of an unrelated civilian and a police officer you watch much screen sorry eve let her lips curve just a personal debate between my aide and myself on the merits of media reports and keeping up with current events i have on most mornings and usually tune in at least briefly in the evenings she smiled back whose side am i on hers eve jerked her head toward peabody in any case im primary investigator on these matters and im pursuing the possibility of connections between members of the group known as the purity seekers and minors who may have been exploited by cogburn and or fitzhugh as well as other child predators this group may have targeted as the names of those minors are sealed and many of those whove reached majority have requested they remain sealed i need your help i cant break confidence with those kids and their families lieutenant to help you in an investigation she lifted pretty ringless hands theres a reason for those seals these children have been damaged and while you have your job i also have mine mine is to protect those children and to do everything in my power to help them heal seals can be broken miss price itll take me time but i can get an order to open the files for this investigation i understand that clarissa lifted both hands again and when you have that authorization ill help you in any way the law allows but i work with these victims every day and its difficult enough to gain the trust of kids whove already been hurt by an adult to gain the trust of their families even to find family members who give a damn i cant help you until im ordered to did you ever have personal contact with cogburn or fitzhugh professional contact i gave statements to the pa on both men that is on the psychological damage done to the minors in my case file whod had dealings with them i never spoke with either of them and i wont pretend to be sorry theyre no longer around to hunt more children mary ellen george clarissas face closed up she was acquitted should she have been a jury of her peers thought so have you had personal contact with her yes i had occasion to visit and examine the conditions of her day care facility and i cooperated and worked with the police who ultimately arrested her she was very convincing very motherly but she didnt convince you this job requires a certain instinct just as yours does i knew what she was a cold disgust bordering on rage hardened prices features you win battles and you lose them losings hard but if you dont move on to the next in this field youll burn out and i have to move on to the next now i have another session and im already late i appreciate the time eve stepped to the door i will get that authorization miss price when you do im at your disposal outside eve ignored the knotted traffic fighting its way around her vehicle she didnt bother to respond to the horns the curses the variety of obscene gestures she just climbed in shes by the book peabody began as eve shoved into traffic but shell be helpful once you get authorization shes holding more than sealeds under her hands she knew who i was and pretended not to how do you know she knew who you were she watches routinely you watch routinely youre going to see me you sure as hell saw me this morning during the report she admitted watching when i did the oneonone she played it a little too cautious not mentioning that eve swung west barely missed nipping the bumper of a rapid cab clarissa price goes to the top of the short list chapter jamie was working hard to act cool everything he wanted in his life had fallen so unexpectedly into his lap he was terrified hed do something to blow it away again as far as jamie was concerned electronics made the world go around there was only one thing he wanted more than to work with them that was to work with them as a cop thanks to roarke he was getting that chance sort of and on a homicide investigation that was baffling the premium ult cop it didnt get better well it wouldve been better if hed had a badge and rank but tech assist to the expert consultant was an airboot in the door he was going to make it count he dug on working with feeney that was for sure uncle feen was the total ecop with all kinds of stories about shit that went on before there was an edd and mcnab was totally iced he talked a lot of trash but he knew his ironies jamie thought he was pure hero stuff now that hed been wounded in the line here he was halffrozen and pushing on with the job thats what cops did thats what dallas did nothing stopped her no matter what she stood up like she had for his grandfather and for alice it still hurt thinking about his sister he knew his mother was never going to get over it not all the way over it maybe you werent supposed to sometimes when he looked back to everything that had happened last fall it was like a dream especially the end of it all the smoke and the fire in that horrible room where that bastard alban had taken dallas after hed drugged her smoke and fire and blood and the bitch selina lying dead on the floor roarke and alban fighting like wild dogs and dallas yelling at him to get the knife get the knife to cut her loose from where alban had strapped her naked to some kind of altar hed cut the bonds but hed felt cold cold all over in spite of the smoke and naked still groggy from the drugs dallas had leaped right off the slab onto albans back dreamy it was all so weird and dreamy hed seen roarkes fist fly up knock alban unconscious hed heard the sirens coming hed heard roarke and dallas talking not words just sounds the fire crackling the smoke stinging and the knife in his hand shed shouted when shed seen what he was going to do but it was too late she couldnt have stopped him he couldnt have stopped himself the bastard who had killed his family was dead and his blood hot on jamies hands he couldnt remember actually doing it not the moment not the instant when hed plunged the blade into albans heart it was like some time blip and he couldnt remember but it had happened it hadnt been a dream and dallas had told feeney and peabody and the other cops who burst in that alban had been killed during the struggle shed grabbed the ritual knife from him put her own prints on the handle and lied because shed stood for him too jamie stay focused he blinked blushed and hunched his shoulders at roarkes brisk order yeah sure right he was working on a virus simulation his third since theyd started these sims arent going to generate hard data without results of a diagnostic on one of the infected units so youve said in a variety of ways six or eight times already jamie swiveled away from his workstation behind him roarke worked on filter construction he was doing most of the programming manually with fast flicks and taps of his fingers in jamies estimation any eman worth his chips had to be able to do manual as well as voice and should know when one method suited the job better than the other roarke was the ultra mag eman itd take me five minutes tops to run a diagnostic jamie continued no give me ten and i can locate and isolate the virus no without an identification on he broke off when roarke held up a hand and shut his mouth he finished the sim input the resulting data then started the next program he let it run on auto as he got up to dig out a tube of pepsi from the fullsized cooler ill have one of those roarke said without looking around jamie pulled out a second tube across the room feeney and mcnab worked on filter analysis jamie had never been in a house that boasted its own fully equipped elab then again hed never been in any other house like this one what it didnt have hadnt been invented the floor was a steel gray tile the walls were a pale green and covered with screens the light came from sky windows a half a dozen of them all tinted to cut the glare and heat that could play havoc with the equipment and that equipment was so cuttingedge the edge hadnt even been cut yet there were a full dozen data and communication centers including one of the rxks that hed seen tested in r and d it wasnt scheduled for release for three months maybe six there were three vr stations a sim tube a holo unit with d and c capabilities and a global and interstellar searchandscan navigator he was itching to get his hands on he glanced toward his own screen checked the status of his sim run then sat beside roarke he scanned the codes jammed end to end over the screen calculated if you filter out the sound blank all frequencies you wont get the id or source youve missed something look again roarke continued to work while jamie rearranged the codes in his head okay okay but if you flipped this equation see and this command then wait roarkes eyes narrowed as he read his own program considered the direction of jamies suggestions the boy was good thats better yes thats better yet he made the adjustments and with them in mind began on the next series of commands roarke theres no point in asking me again answers still no just listen okay you always say a guy should be able to make his pitch nothing more irritating than having your own words tossed back at you but he stopped sat back and took the tube of pepsi pitch then okay without a diagnostic with direct data from one of the infected units were blind you can come up with filters with shields but no matter how good they are you cant be a hundred percent that theyll shut out the virus if it is a virus which we dont know without a diagnostic well be a great deal more certain of operator safety once we have shields in place if its a subliminal which is the highest probability using either visual or audio to infect ive dealt with something similar before and am constructing a series of shields to filter it out yeah but similar isnt a hundred percent so youre still going to be playing odds son playing odds is a kind of religion to me jamie grinned and because he wasnt being dismissed dug in okay odds are good given the log time detective halloway had in when he first showed symptoms and factoring in how long the other bad guy dudes were on that it takes a couple hours maybe more to hit the danger zone logically halloway had the brain eruption faster because he had all this time on at once straight computime instead of on and off tasking surfing whatever and he was in the unit not just working on it and you think i havent factored that in if you have you know im right probably right probably is a lot to risk dying for youd increase success rate if you used the first of the completed filters before going in jamie had to fight the urge to wiggle in his seat because he knew he was making progress kept log time to under ten minutes ran a medical on the operator while hes on to catch any neurological changes you got equipment in here that can be rigged to do that and roarke had been considering doing just that after hed gotten the boy and the cops out of the way but perhaps there was a more straightforward method to it all do you see where im going with this filter here he asked jamie yeah i got it finish it roarke ordered then got up to make his pitch to feeney mcnab was all for it perhaps roarke thought it was an easier matter for youth to gamble with mortality we can do sims analyses probabilities for weeks and not have it wrapped mcnab insisted the answers are in the infected units and the only way to get at them is to get at them we havent put a full day in yet feeney knew he was meant to be the voice of reason but he was itching to tear into one of the infected units the more tests and sims we run the better our chances ill have a filter the best i think we can hope for under these conditions ready to be interfaced within the hour roarke glanced back toward jamie we can run sims with it first bombard one of the units with viruses and subliminals and see how it holds up at that point id say itll be time for a calculated risk feeney dragged out his bag of candied almonds the primary wont go for it the primary roarke said coolly dismissing the love of his life isnt an eman no she sure as hell isnt never could get her to have any respect for technology we finish the filter run the sims if it holds up we go in ill operate mcnab said quickly no you wont captain youre already on partial medical resultsd be skewed it was bullshit feeney thought but hed be damned if he put mcnab on the hot seat he wasnt losing two men in two days i should get to do it jamie swiveled around it was my idea roarke barely spared him a glance since we both have to answer to your mother i wont even acknowledge that bit of stupidity i dont see why have you finished that programming jamie roarke asked no but finish it he turned back to feeney id say its down to you and me just me im the badge an emans an eman badge or no we can argue about that the fact youve got a badge the fact its my equipment were using here but why dont we settle the matter like irishmen both amusement and challenge lit feeneys face you want to fight or you want to drink roarke laughed i was thinking of the other manner of settling things gambling roarke dug a coin out of his pocket heads or tails he asked you call eve considered chief tibble a good cop for a suit he was tough he was honest and he had a very strong bullshit sensor he played the politics of his job better than most and generally kept the mayor and other city officials off the backs of the rank and file but when murder came through an item everyone in the city every voter in the city owned when the media was in high gear and one cop took another hostage in central the politicians were going to get their swings in deputy mayor jenna franco was known to swing hard eve hadnt dealt with her personally before but shed seen her around city hall or onscreen she had the hard polish of a woman who knew it was essential to look her best while doing the job in an arena where votes were often swayed because a candidate was attractive she was a small woman who made up for it with snappylooking threeinch heels she was a curvy woman who took advantage of what nature or her body sculptor gave her with spiffily tailored suits in bold colors todays was power red and matched with a chunky gold necklace and earrings that looked as if they weighed five pounds each it made eves lobes throb just to look at them she looked more like some pampered society matron on her way to a ladies luncheon than a hardscrabble politician and the opponents whod come to that conclusion had been left in her dust that was something eve could respect the fact peachtree had sent her in his stead said he respected her as well with her was lee chang the media liaison he was short slim perfectly groomed in a gray pinstriped suit with his straight black hair slicked back he had asian blood an oxford education and an ability to juggle and spin the facts with expediency until it sounded true eve had never liked him and the feeling was completely mutual lieutenant tibble began we have a problem yes sir first i understand detective mcnab is recuperating from his injuries at your home yes sir we have a medical supervising him though she wasnt sure how shed explain summerset if pressed we felt hed be more comfortable in familiar surroundings rather than the hospital and his status this afternoon theres been no change at this time i see tibble remained seated at his desk youll keep this office informed in that area yes sir and the status of your investigation im pursuing possible connections to the victims that may lead to the identity of members of the group calling themselves the purity seekers captain feeney and his eteam are working on devising a shield so that the infected units can be examined and analyzed with reasonable safety medical and laboratory tests continue to be run on the victims in an attempt to ascertain the nature and cause of the brain damage that resulted in their deaths reasonable safetyjenna franco lifted a hand not like someone asking permission to speak but as one accustomed to being heard what precisely does that mean im not an eman ms franco that leg of this investigation is in captain feeneys hands all efforts are concentrated on devising a shield for maximum safety to the operator lieutenant we cant have another new york city police officer implode and potentially kill or injure fellow officers or civilians i cant go back to the mayor or the media with the term reasonable safety ms franco police officers go on shift every morning with no more than reasonable safety they dont usually fire on their squad room and take their commanding officer hostage no maam and detective halloways commanding officer is in charge of the team who is working with all possible speed to ensure that doesnt reoccur if i may changs hands remained neatly folded his face continued to hold a warm and pleasant expression it could be said that the police are utilizing all resources in this investigation to identify the source of the alleged electronic infection the media will of course consult electronic experts to help them formulate their questions and to generate discussion and debate onscreen we will naturally do the same and when we discuss and debate onscreen eve said tightly we give this terrorist group exactly what they want attention screen time legitimacy the discussion and debate and questions will take place regardless chang told her its essential that we control the tone whats essential is that purity be stopped that lieutenant we can happily agree is your job not mine lieutenant whitney didnt raise his voice but the steel tone of command in it stopped whatever comment eve was about to make the media machine is already rolling we get on board or it runs us down understood commander my team and i will follow the departmental directives for media contact well adhere to the official statement thats not going to be enough franco put in youre a highprofile cop lieutenant on a highprofile case the head of edd and another of your team members were directly involved in the debacle at central yesterday deputy mayor franco my lieutenant put her life on the line to defuse that situation exactly my point commander and due to her key involvement the public interest in her personal and professional life we need her onscreen as often as can be managed no lieutenant she forced herself to speak calmly when she turned at tibbles voice no sir i will not take my time and energies away from an investigation to play department mouthpiece i will not play a part in giving a group responsible for the death of a fellow officer and the possible paralysis of another the attention they seek i should be out in the field now not standing here debating the ramifications of the term reasonable safety youve used the media when its suited you lieutenant dallas yes sir and when i have ive done so using my own words not spouting off scripted pap and my personal life is just that and has nothing to do with this investigation the expert civilian consultant on your team has a great deal to do with your personal life lieutenant tibble continued i sympathize with your position and with your desire for privacy but if we dont play this game well purity will not only get their media attention but will continue to build support mr chang has the results of polls polls eve couldnt keep the furious disgust out of her voice we took polls two of the media services had polls generated before eleven this morning chang took a memo book from his pocket the mayors office conducted its own for internal purposes when asked if they considered the group known as the purity seekers to be a terrorist organization fiftyeight percent of the respondents said no when asked if they were concerned for their personal safety fortythree percent responded yes naturally we would like to see both those numbers decrease you amaze me eve murmured the facts are these tibble said a strong majority of the public perceive this group exactly as they wish to be perceived additional polls show little to no sympathy for cogburn and fitzhugh nor regret for the manner of their deaths its neither possible nor politically prudent to attempt to generate sympathy for those individuals the system is what must be defended and the system must have a face chang added it must be personalized this is a fine line lieutenant tibble continued if this group is publicly damned with the wrong tone there could be a panic businesses shutting down in fear of using their electronics individuals afraid to turn on their data centers people flooding into health centers and emergency centers because they have a headache or a damn nosebleed we need people and industry to remain calm and secure franco put in its essential we show that were controlling this situation purity hasnt thus far targeted anyone outside a specific profile eve began precisely franco nodded and that lieutenant dallas is the key message the mayor all of us want to send the family in the downtown loft has no cause for alarm the midtown cafe can continue business as usual puritys agenda does not include them so far francos eyebrows lifted do you have reason to believe otherwise i have reason to believe vigilantes grow to like their work that power unchecked will corrupt its own agenda that violence given impunity and approval breeds more this is good chang said pulling out his notebook again with adjustments dont mess with me chang or youll be eating that book dallas whitney got to his feet were all on the same side tools and methods may vary but the end goal is the same for all of us forget the polls and the politics for a moment you know enough about human nature to understand that without a solid spin people will begin to see this group as heroes theyll see criminals predators who slithered through the systems fingers finally meeting justice tonight our children are safe because someone took a stand justice doesnt hide behind anonymity it doesnt operate without rules of conduct that in a nutshell is the point press conference at sixteenthirty centrals media center be there at sixteen hundred to be briefed and prepped yes sir we all have our jobs lieutenant franco reached down picked up a sleek leather briefcase and portions of those jobs are distasteful or annoying but at the core its the safety of this city that concerns all of us agreed maam fortunately my concern isnt contingent on polls or votes francos lips curved i was told you were a hardass good so am i chief tibble commander whitney she gestured to chang then strode out on her snazzy shoes lieutenant tibble remained in his position of power at the desk you will be required to work with deputy mayor franco on this situation i expect you to cooperate with her and the mayors office and to afford her the respect that office deserves is that understood yes sir the potential for crisis here is layered public safety public trust financial and political ramifications those must all be addressed the damage to city revenue to individual businesses to personal incomes could be serious if the tourist trade decreases because people are afraid to come into the city and use a public data center if employees refuse to come into work or use their home offices if parents refuse to send their children to school or utilize their homeschool options out of fear the educational units are infected the media can swing this sort of thing on a dime and if you believe this is an area beyond your concern id suggest you ask your husbands opinion my husbands opinion doesnt affect how i carry out my duty chief tibble nor does it affect the thrust of my investigations any married individual on or off planet knows that statement is bullshit lieutenant at this point you dont have the luxury of ignoring the politics or the media welcome to my world he sat back studying her carefully blank face sometimes dallas you make me tired that cracked the mask enough to have her blink at him once slowly i apologize sir no you dont he waved a hand at her then rubbed it over his face now give me the details of your investigation you didnt want to divulge in front of franco and chang she started to fill him in he interrupted once a social worker and a cop how many other ways do you intend to complicate my life ive yet to speak with detective dwier sir and have no direct evidence linking him to the organization but as i suspect civilian parents of abused minors may also be involved id say the complication level will rise fairly high itll leak one of your interviews will go to the media well need damage control chief tibble when her communicator beeped she had just enough control of her own to realize shed just been saved by the bell with your permission sir answer it dallas dispatch dallas lieutenant eve possible priority homicide riverside drive victim identified as mary ellen george see uniformed officer onscene acknowledged her face was blank again when she looked back at tibble things just got more complicated or more simple depending on your point of view he sighed go tibble pushed to his feet as she strode out fifty that she uses this to ditch the press conference i look like a sucker whitney shook his head ill see shes there one way or another chapter it had been a long time since roarke had worked a con as basic as the coin toss still all it took was quick fingers and a bit of misdirection that boyhood skill had come back to him smoothly when feeney had called heads a snatch a light rub of the thumb over the engraving of the coin to determine which end you needed up and tails slapped onto the back of his hand it was all done fast and if he did say so himself very well indeed feeney might have been annoyed and suspicious at the results but a deal was a deal even when the game was fixed we could give it another pass or two feeney said when they all stood in the temporary lab with roarke holding the filter disc could be wed dont be such a mother roarke said mildly my life wont be worth piss something happens to you on my watch well now cheer up had the toss gone the other way i could say just the same shed have my bones for breakfast about that toss feeney hadnt seen anything hinky about it but you could never be sure with roarke i say we do it again but let baxter here do the flip i could take that to mean youre calling me a cheat though you examined the coin yourself made the choice of heads without prompting but seeing as weve a long and friendly history between us ill just take it as concern the deeds done feeney and no irishman welshes on a bet dont put me in the middle of this baxter kept his hands safely in his pockets whatever the hell happens dallas is going to be pissed so lets do it before she starts busting our balls we get the diagnostic run we keep our balls jamie was in heaven not only were they about to do something beyond chilled but he was standing around talking the trash with cops infected units a snail and the filter programs complex its going to take ninetythree seconds to download the shield he said to roarke if you start the diagnostic while its loading youd jamie are you under the impression that this is so to speak my first day on the job no but while the diagnostics running you want to upload the results onto go away yeah but jamie lad feeney laid a hand on his shoulder well be monitoring from outside you can badger the man from there ten minutes feeney said to roarke not a second more ill be running a time sequence no ten minutes not a second more his jaw went firm as stone i want your word on it all right you have it as satisfied as he could get feeney nodded if we see anything worrying in the medical readouts youll shut it down if youre thinking im willing to have my brains come spilling out my ears let me reassure you then he flashed a grin but if such a thing should happen ill have the satisfaction of knowing eve will be sending the lot of you to hell right behind me shell go easy on me mcnab worked up a smile im handicapped dont count on it now if youd all get out we could get this done before were all old and gray youll wait until i give you the goahead i want a check of your medicals first feeney stopped at the door glanced back slainte you can say that again over a couple of guinness in just a bit when theyd gone out roarke engaged the door locks he didnt want his associates to panic and burst in on him again alone he unbuttoned his shirt then attached the sensors that would monitor him lost your mind havent you he thought not just working for cops which is bad enough but risking your bloody brains for them life was a damn strange business he wouldnt lose his brains or his life like a lab rat if it came to that he sat faced cogburns machine and felt under the work counter let his fingers play lightly over the weapon hed secured there hed chosen the ninemillimeter beretta semiautomatic from his collection it had been his first gun acquired at the age of nineteen from the man whod been pointing it at his head a banned weapon of course even then but smugglers werent so picky about such things it seemed to him should things go wrong a properly ironic cycle if he ended it all by doing himself with the very weapon that had started his collection and had helped him on the road to riches he didnt anticipate anything going wrong theyd taken all possible precautions and those who had taken them were some of the best emen and boy available but there was always a chance however slim if push came to shove he would decide his own fate then he took his hand away from the cold steel and put it out of his mind going to run a check on your vital signs roarke glanced up at the wall screen nodded at feeney fine cut the audio in there when youre done i dont want all of you nattering at me when im working he slid his hand into his pocket rubbed a small gray button between his fingers for luck for love it had fallen off the jacket of the very unflattering suit eve had worn the first time hed seen her youre good to go feeney told him booting up then start the clock mary ellen george had thanks to the royalties on the book shed written on her arrest trial and acquittal and the speaking fees she commanded lived a very comfortable life in her west side apartment shed died there as well but it hadnt been comfortable unlike cogburn and fitzhugh the signs of her illness werent violent nor were they destructive it was apparent shed taken herself off to bed dosed herself with overthecounter medication for several days then with strong street versions during which time she had blocked her link calls and had refused to answer her door shed taken a laptop unit into bed with her essentially destroying herself eve thought as she tried to heal one of her last acts had been to place a hysterical transmission to a former lover begging him for help weeping about the screaming in her head her last act had been to fashion her silk sheets into a noose and hang herself she wore only a white nightgown obscenely soiled her hair was matted her nails bitten down below the quick there were tissues and washcloths stained with blood littering the bedside table trying to stop the nosebleeds eve concluded and picked up a medication bottle with sealed fingers trying to treat a brain on the point of exploding with tendollar blockers the laptop was still on the bed its stark message filling the screen absolute purity achieved get this screen on record peabody victim george mary ellen female caucasian age fortytwo body discovered in victims apartment at fourteen hundred hours sixteen minutes by building manager officer debrah banker and hippel jay who placed the nineeleven record of scene and body complete lieutenant okay peabody lets get her down it was an ugly job neither of then spoke as they wrestled with the makeshift noose as they shouldered the deadweight and lowered it to the bed visual evidence of blood in victims ears in nasal passages indication of blood vessel eruption in the eyes no head or facial trauma evident there are no visible wounds other than the bruising around the neck which is consistent with strangulation by hanging she opened her field kit took out a gauge time of death established at fourteenten eve reached over shut down the laptop bag this log it and have it transported to my home office then she stepped back and took a long careful look at the bedroom she didnt exhibit the same level of violence as the other vics you can see shed been spending most of her time in here popping blockers and tranqs trying to sleep off the pain she got a little messy a little careless with housekeeping and appearance but she didnt run around breaking furniture people handle pain differently peabody said as she bagged the laptop like you you pretend its not there like its a personal insult and youre going to ignore it so itll go away me i go straight for the holistic stuff early childhood training but if that doesnt work its better living through chemistry and guys like my brothers and my dad they whine a guy gets sick he reverts to babyhood which includes temper tantrums thats interesting peabody well you know testosterone yeah i know in these cases the two males three counting halloway tried to beat the pain and anyone who got in the way and the female tried to suppress it with traditional methods everybody failed everybody died and heres what else everyone did burrowed burrowed sir holed up climbed into their nest or the closest thing to it cogburn was locked in his apartment maybe if his neighbor hadnt come along hammering at the door shouting cursing at him hed have stayed there until he died or until he killed himself she studied the messy makeshift noose terminate and end the pain i bet its programmed into the virus fitzhugh holed up selfterminated halloway the only one who wasnt a target the only one who was exposed outside of his own home burrowed into feeneys office if we hadnt kept him busy i think hed have offed feeney then turned the stream on himself cogburn and halloway peabody nodded following the dots they were the only two who had contact with anyone during the last stages of the infection if they hadnt would they have just opted out like mary ellen george shuts herself in blocks her incomings ignores anyone who comes to the door terminates wounded animal instinct the burrowing peabody asked human nature its logical and it makes sense for purity they dont want to take out the innocent just the ones theyve judged guilty theyre looking for minimum negative fallout they want public support for their cause even with the incidental casualties theyre starting to get it they wont keep it no dallas they wont im not going to believe most people really want something like this she gestured toward the body we had legal executions for what over two hundred years in the grand old us of a eve reminded her illegal ones have been going on since cain bashed abel under the polish peabody were still a primitive species a violent one she thought of roarke and sighed turn her over to the me open the scene to the sweepers ill be talking to hippel she turned on her own recorder as she walked into the small cheerful office space off the living area officer baker stood on post while a young black male with a muscular build sat with his head down and his hands dangling between his knees eve wagged a thumb at the doorway and baker stepped out mr hippel he lifted his head his skin was a rich chocolate just now faintly tinged with the green of nausea ive never seen ive never its the first do you want some water mr hippel no i the officer got me a glass my insides are too shaky to drink i need to ask you some questions im lieutenant dallas yeah i saw you onscreen doing that deal with nadine furst he tried to get his lips to curve up but they just trembled shes hot i always try to catch her segments shell be thrilled to hear that eve sat down on a small tufted chair ms george contacted you yeah i hadnt heard from her in a couple weeks we broke things off mutual he said quickly we didnt fight or anything just time to move on thats all okay maybe she was a little steamed maybe i wanted to move on more than she did but we didnt fight okay maybe we had an argument he choked on his own guilt spit out information while eve sat in silence and let him run through it maybe we yelled at each other some jesus jesus she didnt do that because i dumped her did she when did the dumping take place jay maybe two weeks ago itd been coming on i mean hey shes a finelooking sexy lady and all plenty of coin too but im twentyfour and shes not guy needs a piece or two his own age once in a while right only natural and mary ellen she was getting a little territorial crimping my style got me yeah the last time you saw her did you notice anything different about her different no same old mary ellen she didnt complain of headaches or discomfort she was feeling fine we went out to a club had some laughs got ourselves a privacy room and banged came back out for a couple drinks and she sees me scoping out some skirts and gets steamed so we had a kind of argument and broke it off and today when she contacted you she looked bad man nose was bleeding her eyes are all red shes crying and yelling i didnt know what the hell what did she say to you said i had to help her somebodys got to help me said she couldnt stand it anymore theyre screaming in my head is what she said i tried to calm her down but i dont even think she heard me i thought she said theyre killing me but she was crying so hard im not sure i thought somebody must be hurting her all that blood on her face so i called emergency and got my ass over here i work just around the corner at the riverside cafe how i met her i got here right before the cop and im trying to get them to let me go up then the cop came and we went up came inside there she was he lowered his head again this time all the way down between his knees when she finished at the scene she swung by the morgue morris already had mary ellen georges brain removed even for a seasoned homicide cop the sight of that pulpy mass of gray matter on a sterile scale was a little offputting definitely expanded her mind morris said but it doesnt appear she managed it by reading the great works of literature or exploring other cultures hardehar tell me youve isolated the cause i can tell you this preliminary scan shows a healthy fortytwoyearold female broke her left tibia at one point healed beautifully shes had some minor face and body work excellent job all around have to wait on the tox reports to tell you if she considered her body a temple or believed in chemical enhancements her bodys not a big concern of mine right now tell me about her brain massive swelling that would have resulted in death within hours irreversible in my opinion after the initial spread of infection which is confirmed on the other brains in question by the neurologist ive brought in the brain contains no foreign matter no tumor no chemical or organic stimulant the infection for lack of a better word remains unidentified youre not making my day here morris he gave her a little comeahead with his finger rinsed his hands then brought an image onto a monitor here youve got a computerized crosssection of the brain of a normal healthy fiftyyearold male here he tapped a key youve got cogburns christ in a word you can see the increased mass the bruising where it was squeezed as the pressure increased the red areas indicate the infection it spread through what more than fifty percent fiftyeight notice that some of the red is darker than others older infection this would seem to be the area where it began this leads us to believe it was an initial optical attack and here audio so its caused by something he saw something he heard he may not have been able to hear or see it not with ears and eyes but a bombardment on these two senses into the lobes of the brain that run them subliminal then possibly i can tell you that what we found so far indicates that the infection can and does spread quickly causing the swelling to increase sector by sector whether its selfgenerated or requires further stimuli we havent determined i can tell you that the pain and suffering this process would cause is unspeakable latest polls say most people dont think thats such a bad thing most people are academically at least barbarians morris smiled when she looked at him easy to say off with their heads when you dont have to stand in the blood and have that head roll between your feet a little of it splatters on them they start calling for a cop i dont know morris sometimes it splatters on enough of them and they get a good taste they turn into a mob she dragged out her communicator when it beeped dallas lieutenant youre due at the media center in thirty commander im at the morgue with the me awaiting further tests on mary ellen georges brain i need to finish this consult and update my team i request that denied in thirty dallas have your aide transmit your incident report and any additional data to my office asap it will need to be reviewed and disseminated for the media when whitney broke transmission morris gave her a little pat on the back i know i know sucks sideways they sicced the deputy mayor and chang on me i wouldnt wonder if franco and chang were thinking youd been sicced on them run along now and go assure the viewing public that the city is safe in your hands if i didnt need you id be tempted to beat you up for that she suffered through the preconference briefing read the newly drafted statements filed away what she was told could be discussed what she was told could not but she bared her teeth when franco suggested she freshen up before the cameras and try a little lip dye the fact that i have breasts doesnt require me to slap on enhancements franco sighed and waved her hovering aides out of the room lieutenant i didnt mean that as an insult were women and whatever position of power and authority we hold we remain women some of us are more comfortable with that than others im perfectly comfortable being female ill do what im ordered to do deputy mayor i dont have to like it i dont even have to agree with it i just have to do it but i sure as hell dont have to doll myself up because youd prefer a different police image onscreen than what i might present agreed agreed agreed franco threw up her hands i apologize for making the insulting suggestion that you might put a little color on your mouth i dont think of lip dye as a tool of satan neither do i mostly i just dont like how it looks on me or the way it tastes franco let out another sigh sat listen its been a rough couple of days for all of us likely to get rougher the mayor wants me to work with you your boss wants you to work with me were stuck here i dont want to battle with you over every step and detail then lay off jesus let me say this you and i are both women with a strong sense of public duty were committed to doing our jobs though we may employ vastly different methods and hold different attitudes i love new york lieutenant i sincerely love this city and im proud to serve it i dont doubt that maam jenna were working together call me jenna ill call you eve no but you can call me dallas ah and there we have one of our key variations you hold your line as a woman by employing more traditionally male methods i hold mine with the female i enjoy exploiting my looks my femininity for my own uses it works for me its helped me get where i am to present an attractive package over the brains the ambition the sweat just as your method has worked for you i distrust women like you you distrust women like me i distrust politicians in general franco angled her head if youre thinking to insult me enough that ill toss you out of this press conference let me tell you in the insult game cops are amateurs compared to politicians she checked her slim gold wrist unit were due at least comb your hair keeping her face carefully blank eve raked her fingers through her hair twice thats it franco paused with her hand on the doorknob looked eve up and down how in gods name did you manage to snap a man like roarke very slowly eve got to her feet if youre thinking to insult me enough that i plant a fist in your face and get myself removed from this investigation so you can toss the media a more attractive image as primary ill tell you that while its very tempting im going to see this case through im going to close it after that all bets are off then we understand each other whatever our personal feelings we see this case to closure franco stepped out and was immediately swallowed by her pack of aides lieutenant lieutenant chang trotted after eve hustling to catch up with her long angry strides i have your media schedule for tomorrow what the hell are you talking about your schedule he handed her a disc you will begin in the seven oclock hour of planet with a twominute interview with k c stewart this is global and has the highest ratings at ten we have arranged for a live feed from your office at central with the crew from city beat again this is the highest rated chang do i have to explain to you where this disc is going to end up if you keep talking to me his mouth thinned then pursed this is my job lieutenant and ive worked very hard to arrange for these appearances in order to keep the agendas of the nypsd and the office of the mayor at the forefront of this media blitz the latest polls the latest polls are going to end up in the same place this disc does if you dont get out of my face riding on fury she snapped the disc in half then whirled around and stormed straight to the commander you either want a cop or a media shill i wont be both if in your opinion the media perception is more important than my investigation then respectfully sir youre full of shit he caught her arm before she could spin away one moment lieutenant you can write me up you can bust my rank but i will not spend the hours i should be in the field doing my job as some talking head onscreen so the mayors office gets better numbers as long as youre under my command lieutenant you will not tell me what you will or will not do behind her chang smirked then carefully schooling his face he held out a copy of the broken disc commander whitney as lieutenant dallas has damaged her copy ill prefer to give you her media schedule for tomorrow what media schedule we have several important segments booked including appearances on planet city beat del vincent and the evening report were waiting for confirmation on crime and punishment and speak back youve booked my lieutenant on no less than four media appearances chang nodded were very pleased with the schedule but it can be improved were arranging a satellite interview from delta colony the ratings are very high there for crime segments are you aware mr chang that lieutenant dallas is the primary in charge of a priority homicide investigation yes this is why are you also aware that standard procedure requires that your office clear any such demands as this media schedule with my office before confirming the appearances i believed it was made clear at this afternoons meeting the mayor what was made clear at this mornings meeting was that lieutenant dallas would participate in this press conference and that at my directive she would make herself available for comment to the media this schedule has not and will not be approved by me im not wasting my lieutenants valuable time on media pandering the mayors office can contact me whitney interrupted dont again presume to give one of my cops orders chang you overreach your authority now back off i need to speak to my lieutenant the media conference i said back off the flare from whitneys eyes could have seared through stone eve heard chang scramble back commander he held up a hand youve come perilously close to being written up for insubordination lieutenant i expect better control from you and have rarely had the need to remind you of it yes sir moreover i find myself insulted both on a personal and professional level that you assumed i had or would approve an asinine schedule that pulls you off a priority i apologize commander and can only offer the weak excuse that any and all contact with lee chang results in my temporary insanity understood whitney turned the disc over in his hand it surprises me dallas that you didnt shove this down his throat actually sir i had another orifice in mind his lips quirked just slightly then he snapped the disc in two just as she had thank you commander lets get this damn circus over with so we can both get back to work chapter she got through it parroting the departmental chorus as a result of stifling her own opinion ignoring her own gut instincts she stewed in her own simmering juices all the way home dallas they were nearly at the gates when peabody dared to speak that way if eve tossed her bodily out of the car she wouldnt have far to hike dont take my head off okay you did what you had to do what i have to do is investigate the case and close it yeah but sometimes serving the publics complicated there are a lot of people wholl sleep easier tonight because they heard their home unit isnt going to fry their brains if they sit down and balance their financials or do some email if their kid does his school report thats important ill tell you what i think eve headed toward the gates without dropping speed so that beside her peabodys heart took a fast spring into her throat i think people shouldnt always believe what they hear sir im not sure i follow you maybe whoevers manning the switch doesnt like the way mr smith with his pretty wife and charming little girl and small household pet lives his life maybe he decides mr smith shouldnt be cruising the porn sites or stopping off at a strip club after a hard day selling furniture or occasionally getting zonked on zoner with his pretty wife mr smith isnt following all the rules as well as he should be time to make an example of mr smith so others like him understand the program but theyre going after known predators im not saying its right im not saying that dallas because its not but its a really big leap to go from school yard dealers and pedophiles to some guy who takes some recreational zoner on saturday night is it eve stopped the car at the base of the front steps the laws ignoring mr smith it hasnt punished him just like it didnt punish the others purity punished them and a lot of people thought hey thats not a bad idea cops didnt do the job so good somebody else did nobodys thinking hmm that mary ellen george was acquitted maybe she was innocent she wasnt so no she wasnt but the next one could be the one after that its not easy to watch somebody walk but its a hell of a lot easier than it is to know an innocent didnt these people are deciding whos guilty with what criteria what system what authority their own theyre rolling peabody and public opinions rolling with them lets see how happy the public is when it starts coming into their homes their lives you really think thatll happen damn right itll happen unless we stop them itll happen because theyre on a mission and theres nothing more dangerous than someone on a mission she should know eve thought as she slammed out of the car shed been on one since shed picked up a badge when she walked in it was one of the rare times she wasnt annoyed to see summerset lurking in the foyer lieutenant id like to have some idea how many of your guests will be staying overnight theyre not guests theyre cops and a kid head on up peabody ive got something to do here yes sir and assuming that something was to have her usual pissing match with summerset peabody darted up to check on mcnab give me the status on mcnab and give it in english eve demanded theres no change thats not enough arent you supposed to be doing something the nerves and muscles arent responding to stimuli maybe we shouldve left him in the hospital she paced the foyer maybe we shouldnt have brought him here the simple truth is there would be little more they could do for him there as can be done here during the first twentyfour hours were past twentyfour she snapped were over that and he should have it back she stopped herself pulled it back in and studied summersets cadaverous face what are his chances dont pretty it up what are his chances of regaining sensation and mobility they decrease by the hour now rapidly he watched eve close her eyes turn away but before she did he saw the raw grief lieutenant mcnab is young and hes fit those qualities play strongly in his favor being allowed to work at this time helps keep his mind active and off his difficulties that cant be discounted theyll bounce him on disability or stick him in a cube doing drone work hell never feel like a cop again once that happens he prances when he walks she said quietly now hes stuck in that chair goddamn it arrangements have been made with the clinic in switzerland i believe roarke mentioned this he waited until she turned around looked at him again theyll take him as early as next week they have an impressive rate of success in regenerating nerves he must continue his treatments until whats their rate seventytwo percent with injuries similar to mcnabs make a full recovery seventytwo its not impossible hell recover naturally in an hour a day but his chances of that suck in a word i am sorry yeah so am i she started up lieutenant hes frightened hes pretending not to be but hes a very frightened young man they used to put bullets in you she murmured little steel missiles that ripped through flesh and bone i wonder when it comes down to it if this is any cleaner she walked up and into her office to what appeared to be a recreation break her team was spread out lounging she thought sourly while each sucked on the beverage of his choice jamie was feeding galahad little bits from what seemed to be a sandwich the size of utah perched on the arm of mcnabs chair peabody filled them in on the details of the media conference well this all looks so nice and cozy she said i bet those terrorists are shaking in their boots you gotta rest the brain cells and orbs every few hours feeney told her she stepped over the feet roarke had stretched out he could consider himself lucky she decided she didnt give them a good kick she walked directly to her desk sat maybe while youre resting those cells and orbs someone could take just a moment out of playtime and update me missed lunch again didnt you roarke said mildly yes i did it had something to do with the woman whod hanged herself with her own bedsheets the pesky little details of serial homicides an annoying little meeting with city officials some of whom seem to be more interested in media image than those inconvenient dead people and the hour or so i was ordered to spend feeding those media hounds she bared her teeth in a smile that had jamie sliding down in his chair and how was your day roarke rose took half the sandwich jamie and the cat had yet to devour and set it in front of her eat eve shoved it aside report now lets not have any bloodshed feeney shook his head the two of them made him think of a couple of bulls about to ram heads weve got some progress for you which is why were on break we built a shield that partially filtered the virus we think weve nearly isolated the infection on the cogburn unit we were able to extrapolate a portion of it computers running an analysis now once weve got that we may be able to simulate the rest of the program without going back into an infected unit how long i cant give you that its a program the likes of which ive never seen encoded failsafed were working with the bits and pieces we got out before the sucker selfterminated you lost the unit that baby is fried jamie put in didnt just blast the program it killed the whole machine toasted it but we got some good data wed have had enough to be sure of a sim if roarke had had another minute even fortyfive seconds but he trailed off because eve was getting to her feet really slow something in the movement made him think of a snake coiling up right before it lashed out with fangs you operated the cogburn unit i did yes you operated an infected unit using an experimental filter one that subsequently failed and you took this step without direct authorization from the primary dallas feeney rose it was a testament to his courage under fire that he didnt back off when she murdered him with one vicious glare the electronic end of this investigation falls on me the lab work falls under my hand and your hand falls under mine i should have been notified of this step you know that it was my call was it she looked back at roarke as she spoke get out no one mistook she meant for roarke to leave the general exodus was more of a scramble and at the doorway feeney batted the flat of his hand at the back of jamies head what sulkily jamie rubbed the spot what ill tell you what feeney muttered and closed the door at his back eve kept the desk between them she wasnt entirely sure what she might do without the symbolic barrier holding the line you may run half the known universe but you dont run my investigation my operations or my team nor do i have any desire to lieutenant his voice was just as cold just as hard as hers what the hell do you think you were doing exposing yourself to an unidentified infection so you could prove youve got the biggest dick his eyes flashed hot then chilled youve had a very difficult day so ill take that into consideration the filter needed to be tested the program isolated and analyzed with sims with computer runs with youre not an eman he interrupted you may be in charge of the investigation but what goes on in the lab is beyond your scope dont you tell me whats beyond my scope i am telling you i could spend the next hour explaining the technical ins and outs of the thing to you and you wouldnt understand the half of it its not your field but its one of mine youre a dont you toss that civilian bullshit at me not over this you wanted my help so im part of this team i can take you off the team aye you could he nodded then reached out fisted a hand in her shirtfront and pulled her across the desk but you wont because the dead mean more to you than even your pride they dont mean more than you well damn it he released her jammed his hands in his pockets that was a low blow you had no right to risk yourself not even to tell me you went around me on this and that pisses me off you took a chance with your life that i find unacceptable it was necessary and it wasnt some blind leap for christs sake im not a fool he thought of the weapon hed secreted just in case and the small gray button hed rubbed like a charm before hed begun the work no he wasnt a fool but hed felt a bit like one there were four emen in that lab who agreed the step had to be taken he continued i was monitored and the exposure was limited to ten minutes the filter blew it did yes blew to hell in just over eight minutes jamie has some ideas on that i think are sound how long were you exposed without a shield under four minutes a bit closer to three actually no ill effects he added but for a little nagging headache he grinned when he said it and she wanted to strangle him thats not funny maybe not sorry my medicals are clear and we have a partial picture of the infection it required a human operator eve one who knows his way inside a computer and who knows the tricks and blocks a good programmer employs if i hadnt done it feeney would have is that supposed to make me feel better why didnt he she demanded he wouldnt have just passed this to you we decided it logically we flipped a coin you she broke off rubbed her hands roughly over her face somebody implied today i chose to act or think like a man boy was she out of orbit on that she dropped her hands whether or not the electronics lab is out of my scope it is under my authority i expect and insist on being informed and consulted before any step is taken that carries personal risk to any of my team agreed youre right he said after a moment you shouldve been informed it can be a tricky balancing act im sorry for my part in cutting you out of the loop accepted and though ive about hit my quota of apologizing today ill add one more for bringing your dick into the argument accepted i need to ask you a question all right her stomach was knotted but she would say the words she would ask the question if you think these people are justified in what theyre doing if you think their targets deserve what they get why would you risk this why would you take this chance with your own welfare to help me stop them for christs sake eve youre like a goddamn chessboard black and white temper was there bubbling in a way she knew meant it could spurt out any moment i dont think thats an unreasonable question you wouldnt why do you think that i think this is justified i feel no twinge of remorse or pity for someone like fitzhugh and suddenly im the side of terrorists i didnt mean it exactly like maybe i did you think im capable of finding any justification in what happened to that poor boy halloway no she felt vaguely ill but the others perhaps i can believe the pure philosophy of it that evil real evil can and should be destroyed by whatever means possible but im not stupid enough and not quite egocentric enough to believe there can be purity in the spilling of blood or that it can be done in general without law and courts and humanity in general you would pin that wouldnt you he nearly laughed we cant think just the same on this issue i know that i guess it shouldnt bother me but it does damn it roarke it does so i see i cant be pure for you eve i dont want that this whole thing has me tangled up maybe because i cant feel pity for someone like fitzhugh or george either i cant feel it and at the same time im outraged im insulted that anyone anyone felt they had the right to sit back and push a button that murdered them then call themselves guardians im not saying youre wrong i dont believe you are but my morals well say are more flexible than yours even so to make myself clear to you as you seem to need it i dont subscribe to their means their methods or their agenda if and when you confront evil you do it facetoface and handtohand as she did he thought as he had himself and you dont flog your message to the public like you were selling a new line of bloody sports cars eat some of that sandwich will you i guess maybe were a little closer on this than i figured steadier she picked it up took a bite god whats in this im fairly sure its everything the boy eats like foods about to be banned and he best gulp it all down while he can she took another bite its pretty good i think theres corned beef in here and maybe chocolate wouldnt surprise me in the least are we back on track now you and me yeah much as we ever are before we leave this topic ill tell you one more reason i did what i did this afternoon because you like to show off naturally but that isnt what i was going to say i did it because whatever else i feel or believe or dont i believe in you now why dont you have some coffee to wash that back then well show you what weve got she wasnt an eman but she could follow the basics even if she pushed the slightly more complex but when she studied the printout of the data roarke had been able to access from cogburns nowtoasted unit she might have been trying to decipher hieroglyphics its really jazzed jamie told her as he monitored the progress of the decoding program hed devised totally whoever built the program is an ultimate no chip jockey couldve done it its even beyond commando level while i agree i doubt very much if this is the work of one programmer the one thing we are sure of is this took superior programming knowledge as well as medical neurological theyd need a team feeney agreed a firstclass lab equipment and deep pockets isolation chamber how much do you know at this point about how it works eyes and ears jamie said as he swiveled from one unit to another tapping keys light and sound light and sound spectrum and frequency you go on pull up a nice game of world domination to piss a little time away and what happens is youre getting bombarded with light and sound stuff your eyes and ears cant register on a regular level you know how theyve got those whistles for dogs people cant hear yeah i know how it works okay well as far as i can tell thats the idea with this virus we havent clocked onto the spectrum pattern or the frequencies but we will the beauty is the virus runs through the system but it doesnt make the computer sick doesnt screw up any of the programs on it or any the operator might upload after it all just cruises along without a hitch and kills the operator eve concluded kills him dead jamie agreed were working on how long it takes but it needs at least an hour maybe two to transfer the infection into the old gray matter we havent confirmed that feeney reminded him the first shield failed mcnab added but it held long enough that we were able to pull out data thatll help us refine the next one how long eve demanded we can put together another experimental in maybe two hours mcnab shrugged his good shoulder longer if we have to wait until we break the code man it is dense jamie picked up his pepsi slurped you break through one tier and therere six more popping out im going to run a short cut on an alternate unit see if i can sneak through do that and jamie roarke touched a hand to the boys shoulder well need you to bunk here until weve cut through all this frigo he rolled his chair to another workstation and hunkered down okay let me give you the status then we can all go back to work eve waited until attention focused on her you she pointed at jamie youre a drone be a drone he muttered curled his lip but turned back to his monitor the mes findings to date concur with your theory of audio and visual points of attack he also reports that once the virus begins to spread it is most likely irreversible the latest victim mary ellen george was according to witness reports asymptomatic as early as eight days ago after that point weve found no one who had any contact with her in analyzing the scene i concluded that the victim feeling unwell took herself to bed attempting to alleviate discomfort with overthecounter she blocked her incomings pulled down the privacy shades and burrowed she also took her laptop unit into bed with her thereby certainly speeding the infection along with continued exposure fitzhugh locked himself in too feeney offered as did cogburn until he was incited by his neighbor in halloways case he was infected on the job but elected to hunker into your office well assume that seeking this sort of shelter or isolation is also symptomatic programmed in roarke said to decrease the chances of outside interference or injuries agreed purity doesnt want hysteria or condemnation from the survivors of innocent victims it seeks out specific targets it seeks out media attention its playing god and politics a very volatile combination bet your ass she said to roarke which forces the nypsd to play the same combo the mayors office and the tower are spinning their dish to the media deputy mayor franco is the spearhead a good choice of symbols roarke commented attractive intelligent strong without being overbearing so you say eve sneered symbolically speaking by using her as spokesman rather than the mayor it generates the impression this is not a crisis but a problem by pushing you forward it adds the element of competence and doggedness the city is in good hands caring hands female hands that traditionally tend and nurture as well as protect what a load of horseshit you know its not baxter spoke up pain in the ass for you dallas no question but its a good angle you both look good onscreen nice contrast like i dunno the warrior and the goddess then youve got whitney tibble looking all sober and stern a few comments from the mayor at his dignified best stating his absolute confidence in the nypsd and the system and people feel calm and dont riot in the streets and fuck up traffic maybe you missed your calling baxter you should be in pr and give up this cushy job and the great salary she laughed horseshit or not thats the current game plan and unless we get a substantial break soon im going to end up on the morning shows hyping justice like it was the latest entertainment vid if that happens ill make all of you suffer beyond imagining she turned for the door peabody with me she waited until they were back in her office dont hover over mcnab like that sir you hover over him youre going to make him think youre worried i am worried the twentyfour worry all you want dump on me if you need to but dont let him see it hes starting to fray and hes trying hard not to show it you try just as hard not to show it if you need to vent go out there on the kitchen terrace scream your lungs out is that what you do sometimes sometimes i kick inanimate objects sometimes i jump roarke and have jungle sex the last she said after a beat is not an option for you but i think it would really make me feel better and be a more productive member of the investigative team good humor is good get me coffee yes sir thanks its going to be a minute on the coffee i think ill try the terrace thing eve sat began to thread her way through mary ellen georges life the sealed files remained sealed shed gotten her warrant and child services had immediately trumped it with a temporary restraining order the tro would hold her off until lawyers fought it out in court days she thought days lost unless she took another route before she did shed try a more legitimate angle for the third time that day she put in a call to detective sergeant thomas dwier this time she tagged him instead of his voice mail sergeant lieutenant dallas ive been trying to tag you im in court he had a tough livedin face were on a fifteen what can i do for you lieutenant im primary on the purity homicides you hear about that who hasnt you tapping me because of that asshole fitzhugh im digging for what i can find id like to pick your brain over it you also were part of the team on mary ellen george yeah thought we had her solid but she slithered whats the connection shes dead so the wheel goes round and round dont know what i can tell you about either one of them thats not in the files why dont i buy you a beer after court im jammed up dwier i could use some help sure what the hell you know omalleys off of eighth on twentythird ill find it should be done here in an hour ill meet you at omalleys she glanced at the time seventeen hundred should work theyre calling us back later she turned from the link as peabody set a mug of coffee on the desk better yeah i guess throats kinda sore your fridgie and your autochef are both out of pepsi jamie must drink it by the truckload tell summerset then she broke off when a small tornado burst into her office mavis freestone moved fast the twoinch platforms on her purple gelsandals didnt seem to affect speed or balance she zoomed into eves office a blur of purple pink and possibly puce all mixed together in a microskirt and tit tube that almost covered the essentials her hair was in what appeared to be a halfmillion braids that echoed the color theme she spun to the desk around it the squishy gel on her feet making little sproinging sounds and caught eve in a headlock embrace that cut off all oxygen to the brain eve managed to glug slap on the arms that pressed on her windpipe this is the best day the most totally mag day ever invented i love you dallas then why are you trying to kill me sorry sorry but she squeezed again until eves ears began to ring ive got to talk to you cant freed eve coughed rubbed at her throat even if i were physically able im buried here ill call you when i surface i have to its important its like vital please please please she bounced as she begged and the virulent mix of colors on the move made eve dizzy two minutes talk fast its private sorry peabody but please peabody go find summerset tell him to hunt up a cargo plane full of pepsi close the door okay would you thanks still bouncing mavis linked her hands held them between her small barely restrained breasts her ringers winked and glowed with rings on her left arm some sort of coil snaked from wrist to elbow eve wondered if the impression of it would be permanently stamped on her throat make it fast mavis eve scooped back her hair gulped down coffee im really pressed werent you supposed to be somewhere freestar one olympus resort did a week gig at the apollo casino it rocked i just got back this morning good great eve shifted her gaze to her screen began to process the data in her head well get together when im clear you can tell me all about it im knocked up fine well cover that we can her brain simply went on hold as if someone had flicked a switch that shut down all the circuits when it clicked back there seemed to be some sort of blip blanking out basic reasoning functions what did you say im knocked up mavis let out a snorting laugh then slapped her hands over her mouth her eyes as purple as her shoes today danced like a pair of chorus girls youre you stunned into stammering eve stared at maviss bare midriff at the trio of belly dangles that sparkled from her navel you got something growing in there her hands still over her mouth mavis nodded rapidly a baby the laugh spurted through her fingers ive got a baby in there is that the ult is that beyond the beyond feel she snagged eves hand and pressed it to her belly oh jesus maybe i shouldnt touch it its okay its all padded and everything what do you think i dont know cautious eve slid her hand away tucked it behind her back logically she knew pregnancy wasnt contagious but all the same what do you think i mean are you did you damn im not processing yet was this like an accident no we did it on purpose she scooted her tiny butt onto the desk swung her pretty legs so the gel sandals bumped and squished against the wood weve been trying to procreate for a while me and leonardo are really good at the process we didnt have any luck at first but you know try try again we tried a lot she said on another wild giggle are you sure youre not just drunk no totally pregs she patted her belly embryos in and cooking oh god dont say embryo for some reason the word in combination with the squishy sound of the gel made eve queasy come on we all started out as one maybe but i dont like to think about it im like totally focused on it now but wait because im getting ahead of myself anyhow when i was at olympus i got this feeling maybe i was baking i was whooshing in the mornings and okay skip that part too definitely queasy now eve realized and made a mental note to sterilize the hand that had pressed against maviss bare belly right so i took a preg test and it was positive then you know i got worried id messed it up because i wanted it so much so i took three more liftoff she pushed off the desk whirled around the room then i went to the clinic up there just to be more sure i didnt want to say anything to my honeydew until i was absoposo im six weeks into the deal six weeks wed tapped out pretty regular so i figured i was just feeling off at first and i was kind of afraid to do the check because you get so bummed when its a nogo but when the whooshing kept up oh sorry i just knew something was up last week i just went to the clinic here just one more check you know do an on planet deal systems go i went home and i told leonardo he cried eve caught herself rubbing a hand over her heart in a good way oh yeah he stopped everything and started right away designing well not right away because we had to celebrate by reenacting the conception program but afterward he starting designing me preg clothes for when i get fat i cant wait can you imagine no its something else thats beyond my scope youre really happy dallas every morning when i wake up and puke im so happy i could just she trailed off and burst into tears oh god oh jeez eve sprang up hurried over then wasnt quite sure what to do she tried a hug intending on keeping it light just in case but mavis grabbed on hard this is the best thing thats ever happened to me in my whole life i had to tell leonardo first then you because youre my best friend we can tell everybody else now i want to tell everybody but i had to tell you first okay so youre crying because youre happy yeah its so iced i can have mood swings whenever i want and without chemical assistance no drinking which sort of blows but its not good for little eve or roarke eve pulled back so abruptly mavis almost doubled over with laughter were not really going to call the baby that were just borrowing them for fun until they can tell us what equipment its got you get to call those names for when you and roarke shut up dont start down that road i dont want to hurt a pregnant woman she only grinned we made a baby me and leonardo made a baby im going to be the best mommy dallas im going to totally rock yeah eve ran her hand over the thick colorful braids you will chapter eve was a lot steadier walking into a bar that smelled of cop than she was hugging a pregnant woman you knew what to expect at a cop bar good greasy food alcohol without the frills and people who made you for what you were the minute you walked in the door the lights were low conversations didnt pause when she stepped inside but she felt the subtle shifting of bodies then the flip back to business as usual when they recognized her as one of their own she spotted dwier at the end of the bar already halfdone with his first glass of beer and the shallow black bowl of pretzels in front of him she walked down slid onto a stool beside him it was apparent hed staked a claim on it as every other seat in the joint was occupied detective sergeant dwier she held out a hand lieutenant dallas metcha he said over his pretzels then washed them down with a deep sip of beer they spring you early from court yeah supposed to get to me today didnt now i gotta give them more time tomorrow pricking lawyers whats the case assault with deadly and theft mugging yeah guy mugs this suit coming out of a late meeting over on lex gets his wrist piece his wallet wedding ring and what all then bashes him upside the head anyhow cause the guy asks him not to take the wedding ring got him cold hocking the wrist piece mope says oh hey this i found this on the street vic picks his face outta lineup mope says mistaken identity got some bleeding heart pd whos trying to push that claiming the vic seeing as he got his brains rattled cant properly id saying the wrist piece cant be directly tied to the crime as its a common brand and style hows it shaping up shit he popped more pretzels chomped down waste of my time and the tax dollar mopes got three priors figure theyd plead down if the pd wasnt so green and stupid you drinking yeah ill have a beer she signaled the bartender by holding up two fingers i appreciate you taking the time here dwier dont mind wasting it over a beer you read the files datas there sometimes the files miss impressions you want my impression of fitzhugh and george theyd have to crawl up to reach scum level fitzhugh dwier polished off the first beer arrogant bastard never even broke a sweat when we hauled him in just sat there smirking hiding behind his highdollar lawyers smart enough to keep his mouth shut but you could see it in his eyes he sat there thinking you cops cant touch me turned out he was right you talked to the vics to their parents yeah he blew out a breath it was tough sex crimes are always dicey but when its minors you know how it is yeah shed been a minor and when shed been in that hospital bed broken shed read in the eyes of the cop whod tried to talk to her what she was reading in dwiers now a weary pity any of the family members strike you as the type to go after fitzhugh anyone talk about seeking revenge outside the law you blame them this isnt about my personal feelings or yours its about an investigation fitzhugh was executed so was george so were the others its my job to find out whos pulling the switch i wouldnt want your job he snagged the second beer nobody who worked the fitzhugh case or the george is going to cry any tears over this im not asking for tears im asking for information im asking a fellow officer to reach out he brooded into the beer then took the first foamy sip i cant say as any of the vics or family members acted in any way you wouldnt expect most of these people were shattered kids he raped ran the gamut from embarrassed scared and guilty family that came in filed the complaint was torn to pieces kid was shaking in his socks but they wanted to do the right thing they wanted him put away so he couldnt get his hands on the next kid can you give me a name his gaze shifted to hers there was no pity in it now names are sealed you know that child services put a tro on my warrant to open the sealeds ive got a terrorist organization with technology superior to anything my experts have seen executing at will there are connections between the victims and i think one of those connections is their victims im not giving you names and ill tell you straight i hope they squash your warrant i dont want to see those people pulled through this crap again youve got a job to do and word is youre good at it i cant give you more help than i have i appreciate the beer okay she stood up pulled out credits do you know clarissa price at childrens services sure dwier reached for more pretzels she repped some of the vics from these cases if youre thinking of finessing names from her youre wasting your time she wont shake dedicated type you bet dedicated enough to go outside the system if she doesnt like how its working his eyes stayed flat if i had to say id say shes bythebook not everybody always likes the way it reads but its the book until a better one gets written anyway let me ask you something sure murder cops are different anybody on the job knows that but doesnt it stick in your craw to be working for scum like this i dont pick the dead i stand for dwier they pick me good luck in court tomorrow she walked out then simply sat in her vehicle there was quite a bit sticking in her craw she thought the latest was her instincts telling her that a man whod been a pretty good cop had crossed a line along the way if dwier wasnt already a member of purity he was a prime candidate for application when eve walked back into the house mira was coming down the stairs eve i thought id miss you did we have a consult scheduled no though i did drop off the profile youd wanted mira stopped at the base of the steps one pretty hand on the gleaming wood of the banister her warm brown hair was a soft wave around a soft feminine face her mouth was a pale creamy rose her eyes a clear summer blue her suit had a fluid drape and was the color of sunflowers it was eve supposed stylish in some classic sense and was matched with miras favored pearls she looked perfect essentially female utterly comforting and was one of the top criminal profilers in the country as well as the psychiatric specialist attached to the nypsd thanks but you didnt have to go out of your way i was coming by anyway i wanted to see mcnab oh instantly eves hands sought her pockets well i wonder if i might speak with you for a few minutes theres that lovely garden terrace off the parlor id love to sit outside ah eves mind strained toward her office toward her work sure fine would you care for some refreshment doctor summerset lurked at the edge of the foyer some tea perhaps some wine thank you id love a glass of wine before she could comment mira slid an arm through eves and walked toward the parlor i know you have work i promise not to keep you long youve had a difficult day the media conference couldnt have been pleasant for you thats a master understatement eve opened the terrace doors stepped out like everything of roarkes the spot was beautifully planned and executed the terrace itself was constructed of stones various shapes sizes tones all smoothed into a fluid curve that blended into garden paths there were two glass and iron tables set among pots where flowers flooded or dwarf trees speared beyond the curve gardens exploded with summer the evening sun spilled pale gold onto the stones and through a trellis wild with vines and vivid blue blossoms such a charming spot mira took a seat at one of the tables sighed im afraid id find myself sitting out here every chance i got daydreaming she smiled do you ever daydream eve i guess she sat wondered if she should read dwiers file again not so much really you should its good for you when i was a girl i used to curl up on the window seat in my fathers library i could dream away an afternoon if left to myself hes a teacher did i ever tell you that he met my mother when he sliced his hand cutting tomatoes for a sandwich hes always been a bit clumsy she was a young resident doing her er rotation and he hit on her she laughed a little lifted her face to the sun the heat baked through her skin into her bones so odd to think of that and sweet theyre both semiretired now they live in connecticut with their ancient dog spike and have a little vegetable garden so they can raise tomatoes thats nice and it was it was also baffling youre wondering why im telling you all this thank you summerset she said when he set two glasses of wine and a small tray of canapes on the table how lovely enjoy just let me know if i can bring you anything else no particular reason she said to eve when summerset went back in the house i suppose the tranquility of this spot made me think of them appreciate them not everyone has such a steady undemanding childhood i dont have time for a session eve began but mira covered her hand i wasnt speaking only of you the children who were damaged by these people will have a great deal to overcome you understand that and id understand killing what hurts you this is a different matter and i wondered if youd been able to separate it what you did was done in pain and fear and immediacy to protect yourself to save yourself whats being done here is cold calculating thorough its organized and its pompous for lack of a better word this isnt selfdefense its arrogance the tension in eves shoulders eased i was beginning to wonder if anyone else saw it starting to wonder if i was drawing a hard line on this because if i didnt it made what happened with me the same you killed to live this group is living to kill id like to see that on a goddamn media release eve lifted her glass drank whoever formed the group whoever holds the top position of authority is intelligent organized and persuasive others would have to be brought in recruited for the highly specialized technical positions they understand the power of the media they need public support theyre beating that drum pretty good yes so far i dont think this infection used to terminate is a coincidence its another symbol our children have been infected by these monsters now we infect them because the law could not would not the use of the word guardian another symbol well protect you youre safe now that were here how long before they expand their horizons unchecked mira picked up a small disc of bread and creamy cheese groups tend to evolve successful groups tend to seek out other ways to use their skills and their influence the child predator today the acquitted killer tomorrow the street thief the chemihead if new york is to be pure these infections must be eliminated i think at least one cops involved a social worker some of the families the victims messed with mira nodded as if shed expected nothing else look for people with connections to your victims who hold highlevel skills neurology computer science physics sociology psychiatry and look for wealth the research and equipment needed here would require heavy funding you can expect another death and another statement very soon they need to keep this story in the forefront purity is on a mission eve and its using our children to drive it theyll have to put a spin on what happened with halloway with feeney and mcnab yes mira watched a hummingbird iridescent as a jewel dart in for a blossom with a blur of wings im sure it will be very wellwritten eve ran her glass in small circles on the tabletop roarke and i have gone around on this some were close to the same line i guess but not quite on the same side of it id say that was a good thing surprised eve looked up how youre not the same person eve nor would either of you want to be seeing this from two sides would id think help keep you both honest and interested maybe we pissed each other off another part of marriage its a damn big slice of ours but her shoulders relaxed a little keep each other honest she murmured maybe so did you talk to feeney he isnt ready hes handling himself well the work heals him as it does you what about mcnab i cant tell you specifics about what we discussed its confidential okay eve stared at the tangled vines and bold blue flowers can you tell me do you think i should cut him loose from duty on this roarke can get him into this swiss clinic one that specializes in this sort of injury next week but in the meantime maybe he shouldnt be on the job maybe he should be with his family or something he is with his family by keeping him on the team by continuing to value his input his resources youre helping him to cope what youre doing for him right now is helping a great deal more than anything i can do roarkes made arrangements with the jonasludworg clinic how typical of him its a good place right there is none better okay she pressed the heels of her hands to her forehead thats good youve had a lousy day havent you oh yeah i hope some better news comes along i got some news anyway she dropped her hands mavis is knocked up oh my god mavis was attacked no it was leonardo mira clutched a hand to her breast shock radiated onto her face leonardo leonardo beat mavis beat her no he banged her you know knocked her up confused eve shook her head then began to laugh as the light dawned sperm meets egg she managed as she had her first genuine laugh of the day shes pregnant pregnant mavis is pregnant knocked up lord id forgotten that term this is news are they pleased circling pluto hes already designing her fat clothes oh my wont that be a sight to see when is she due due for what oh right she said she should pop by march shes writing a song about it knocked up by love sounds like another hit theyll make wonderful and unique parents how do you feel about it aunt eve there was a jolt dead center of the belly i feel like if anybody calls me that ill have to hurt them even you with a laugh mira sat back this will all be fascinating to watch if you speak with mavis again before i do be sure to give her my love and congratulations sure no problem eve snuck another look at her wrist unit and i can see youre anxious to get back to work would you mind if i just sat here a while longer finished my wine no go ahead ive really got to get back to it good luck when eve went in mira sipped her wine looked at the flowers and the bright bright bird and daydreamed a little eve stopped by the lab first then just backed out again there was some discussion debate or argument going on in the sort of tech jargon that invariably gave her a headache deciding theyd let her know something when they had something to let her know she swung into the room baxter was using as an office whats the word ive got many names connected to one or more of the vics that are in the system cops lawyers child services medicals the handful of complainants that werent sealed broke that down to names that popped on at least two of the vics and ran those just zipped the data to your unit our pal nadine furst covered the george trial that putz changs down as media liaison i guess that figures she sat on the edge of his desk whats your gut that if weve got any family members involved and we do theyre in the sealeds youre stewing about it youre carrying wounds over it you want your privacy yeah thats mine too and if youre going to talk to anyone about it about what youre carrying its going to be somebody who was there with you somebody who knows and stood for you and yours youre looking at clarissa price and looking hard you know anything about ds dwier out of the sixteenth nothing i didnt read in his file when he popped want me to ask around yeah quietly she hesitated does it bother you looking at another badge baxter puffed out his lean cheeks yeah some its supposed to bother us otherwise wed all be iab wouldnt we there you go you can bend the line you can even move it a little sometimes but you cant break it break it and youre not us anymore youre them dwier broke it baxter thats my gut she pushed off the desk walked around the room youve used trueheart a few times right a couple good kid fresh as a daisy yet but eager if i brought him in on this would you use him ive got no problem dumping some he sat back cleared his throat you asking me to train him no just okay yes sort of youre second grade so you qualify and he could use somebody to work him rub some of the dew off him without dulling the shine interested maybe ill take him on this onecontingency well see how we fit good she started for the door then stopped baxter whyd you transfer in from anticrime couldnt get close enough to you honey he winked suggestively and when she just stared blandly shrugged got restless wanted homicide never a dull moment you can say that again never a youre such a jerk she replied and turning ran straight into roarke the man could move like a ghost sorry to break up this tender moment he began but weve got a second shield ready were about to run it with one of the fitzhugh units who won the coin toss he smiled it was agreed after some debate that the initial operator would continue in that function do you want to observe from in here or your office well use mine its bigger she closed a hand over his wrist no heroics id never qualify for hero status i order a shutdown you shut down her hand slipped down until their fingers linked you got that loud and clear youre in charge lieutenant eve drank coffee because she wanted something to do with her hands feeney sat at her desk manning a secondary unit theyd brought in as a control if something went wrong in the lab he could crash the system remotely jamie hovered over him so close they looked like one body with two heads why cant we do the whole thing remote eve asked you lose operator instinct mcnab told her you got him right there at the infected unit he can make judgment calls in a blink besides ow jamie rubbed his belly where feeneys elbow had landed besides what eve demanded dont pull this esolidarity crap with me mcnab okay okay in simple terms we cant be sure the shield will filter out the infection during an interface it could probably would spread from one unit to another we figure thats how it pumped into the eight units we hauled out of fitzhughs place infect one infect all efficient timesaving and thorough so if we try a remote it could leak into the other unit potentially through the whole system we need more data to confirm jamie piped up then well create a shield to handle that area priority was shielding the operator while he extracts the data when youre dealing with a remote and a multisystem network the units have a language they like talk to each other right the infected units got a different language compatible but different like i dunno spanish and portuguese or something okay eve nodded i get that keep going me and mcnab were working on what you could call a translation deal then we can zap it in run sims well shield the whole system we figure well be able to link to compuguard and shield the whole damn city getting ahead of yourself jamie one thing at a time feeney glanced up at the wall screen where they could see roarke attaching the sensors gonna run your medicals you copy yes medicals normal youre good to go booting eve never took her attention away from the screen roarke had tied his hair back as he often did when he was working and his shirt was carelessly open his hands were quick and steady as he slid the disc into its slot loading the filter estimate seventytwo seconds to upload on this unit loading jamies code breaker fortyfive running diagnostic from point of last attempt multitasking with search and scan for any programs loaded within the last two weeks he was working manually with those quick and steady hands relaying his intentions in a voice that was brisk and cool and beautiful disc and hard copy of data requested as accessed upload complete were shielded there now jamie fine job datas coming up readable here now whats this you see the data on monitor feeney yeah yeah wait hmmm what eve shook mcnabs good shoulder what are they talking about ssh such was his concentration he didnt notice her jaw drop at his command as he drove his chair closer to the screen that is so total forgetting himself he started to push himself up and his dead hand slid off the arm of the chair for a moment he simply froze and eves throat filled at the look of shocked panic on his face then he adjusted the chair smoothly bringing it to a different position so he was higher and straighter with a better view of the monitor the room was full of jargon again rapid questions comments observations as foreign to her as greek somebody speak in english damn it its bloody brilliant i shouldnt have missed this on the first pass roarke reached over to another control keyed in commands by feel ah bugger it shes trying to failsafe not yet you bitch im not done with you shields breaking up feeney warned him shut down eve ordered shut it down its still at ninety percent hold your jets there lieutenant before she could repeat the order feeney interrupted hes all right yet dallas medicals are holding son of a bitchs pulse barely shows a blip he must run on ice roarke go to shell try the im in the flaming shell his voice was a mutter and irish now as a shamrock and ive already tried that clever bastard look here look at this its voice printed cant override manually fuck it there she goes eve saw his monitor erupt with jags of black and white he flipped out data discs an instant before a nasty grinding sound came through the speakers and a small gray plume of smoke puffed out of the back of the machine toasted jamie said chapter units a dead loss roarke had yet to button his shirt however he had removed the sensors but it gave its life for a good cause he turned one of the discs in his hand these should be clean nothing on that program was geared to the external drive but they should be labeled and set aside for testing after weve managed to extract the entire program hard copy will do for now jamie you can start inputting the data in the morning i can start now youll have some supper then a twohour recreation break if you feel like putting an hour in after that an hour only thats fine in bed lights out by midnight if you dont rest your brain it wont be of any use to me man my mother isnt even that strict im not your mother feeney you dont want to tell me when to go to bed kid im old enough to be your mother i was going to ask if you could do with a meal i imagine we all could hold it just hold it frustrated eve held up both hands nobody eats anything until i get an explanation what did you get and what does it mean and if i hear one word of computerese everybody gets rabbit food talk about strict jamie countered tell me ordered eve he got the frequency mcnab told her and the spectrum another minute tops wedve had the pulse and speed basically lieutenant roarke tugged the band out of his hair so it fell like black rain with a little more finessing weve got your virus did you get the method of infection she asked possibly theres data to analyze but from the look i could get on the scroll im putting my money on the simplicity of email they emailed it fucking email eve had wanted simple but this this was almost insulting you cant infect that way compuguard has never seen the likes of this roarke interrupted my guess would be he trailed off gestured go ahead jamie before you erupt okay see what it looks like and i have to figure out how to do it is they cloaked a doc microed and stealthed do you want to eat radishes and lettuce eve asked mildly right he adjusted his brain to lay terms so they attached the virus to the email only it didnt show up as having an attachment doesnt alert the receiver sender can check if it went in just by doing the standard scan on when the mail was read had to download fast really fast without showing the operator what it was doing it had to talk to the unit temporarily at least shut down the prompts and alerts for a download then it filed itself as a document an invisible document in the main drive program it wouldnt register on a standard doc search and scan it doesnt id its just there like lurking and doing its job its way radical okay i follow that eve looked at roarke if this could be done how come you didnt know about it lieutenant i am chagrined me im just starved jamie patted his belly got any pepperoni pizza eve had a couple of slices herself bided her time through the noisy confused meal let her mind drift to the case away from it back again she wasnt sure when it struck her maybe when feeney casually speared some of the pasta off roarkes plate or when jamie dumped another slice of pizza on mcnabs as he stretched across the table for another for himself maybe it had always been there and just chose that moment to clarify mira had said it on the terrace family this was what families did she realized this was what shed never experienced as a child noisy messy dinners with everyone talking over everyone else which wasnt as annoying as it shouldve been stupid jokes and casual insults she wasnt quite sure what to make of it when it applied to herself but she could see what it might do to that pattern when something or someone damaged a part of the whole it would fall apart temporarily for those who were strong enough to glue it all back into pattern or make another permanently for those who couldnt or wouldnt she glanced at mcnab even here with all the chatter there was a smear of worry over it all if that one part of them stayed broken the rest would tumble down like tiles theyd form a new pattern that was the job but theyd never forget the way it had been she pushed back from the table ive got some stuff i need to do the walking dead said there was chocolate cake jamie roarke said mildly sorry jamie said reluctantly mister walking dead also known as summerset said there was chocolate cake and if you eat it all ill kill you in your sleep then you can join the walking dead roarke i need to talk to you as they started out she heard jamie ask think theyre gonna go do it and heard the quick slap of feeneys hand on the teenaged skull are we going to go do it roarke grabbed her hand want me to have feeney knock you too im a bit quicker than jamie yet but i take that to mean were not going back upstairs for a fast tumble how many times a day do you think about sex he gave her a considering look would that be actively thinking of it or just having the concept of it lurking there like jamies invisible document never mind did you see mira before i didnt no i was in the lab sorry i missed her peabody said mavis stopped by as well and needed a private word with you is she all right shes knocked she didnt have time for that little routine again shes pregnant what he stopped in his tracks it was always a treat a rare one to see him stupefied totally pregs as she puts it on purpose too mavis our mavis one and the same she came in jumping and spinning and dancing i dont know if she should be bouncing around like that now seems like you could i dont know dislodge the thing in there shes really hyped well this is lovely he decided is she well i guess looks great anyway said she was puking in the mornings but she liked it i dont get that no i cant say i do either well take them out to dinner as soon as were able i should check on her performance and recording schedule he knew every bit as much about the care and feeding of expectant mothers as eve did which was nothing i dont suppose she should be overdoing if this afternoon was any gauge shes got enough energy for both of them and then some when they stepped into her office she shut the door the action made him lift a brow as youve vetoed sex i assume you want privacy for a less pleasurable reason theyre blocking my warrant and when youve got two bureaucracies duking it out in court you can die from natural causes before theres a ruling i had a brief consult with mira ive still got to read her profile but she gave me the gist in the oral i got baxters take eve what is it you want me to do that youd prefer not wanting me to do people are dying right now they dont know it but theyre infected and for some its already too late its going to keep spreading a good cop is dead another another whos a friend of mine and jesus i cant believe im friends with such an idiot may not walk again under his own power some of the answers to whos doing this are in those sealed files then well break the seal she stared at him then cursing spun away and what makes me any different from them im willing to slide around the law because i think im right because theyre killing people i can tell myself that but its just a matter of degrees the hell it is youll always have a conscience and youll always question the right and wrong of it worry it to death and yourself with it you know how far to push the line before it breaks eve youll never break it you cant she closed her eyes i said something similar to baxter theyre using the law to slow me down i cant let them it would be best if we used the unregistered she nodded lets get it done the room was accessible only by voice and palmprints only three people were cleared for entry there was a single window wide and uncovered to the dying evening but she knew it was privacy treated to prevent anyone nervy enough to try a flyby from seeing in the room itself was designed almost rigidly this was work space serious space there was a wide ushaped console in sleek black that commanded all the research retrieval communication and data systems systems unregistered with compuguard and therefore illegal the first time shed seen it well over a year before even shed recognized the level of equipment as superior to anything in central since then some units had been upgraded she imagined there were some toys in here not yet on the market there were comp stations with monitors a holo unit a smaller auxiliary station which now boasted its own miniholo crossing the glassed black tile she studied the new addition never seen one like this prototype i wanted to run some tests on it without documenting them it seems to be working out nicely its really small were working on smaller yet palmsized she glanced up get out palms with full holofunction three years maybe less and youll be slipping one into your pocket just like your link he placed his palm on the consoles identiscreen roarke open operations the console came to life with lights eve walked over to join him laid down her palm dallas identification verified darling eve she hissed why do you do that its embarrassing darling eve the computer however brilliant is an inanimate object and cant embarrass anyone where would you like to start start with cogburn he was their first you can pull the data off my unit she gave roarke the case number and the file number for her notes he had them accessed copied and displayed in almost less time than it had taken her to give him the numbers you see his sheet ive made notations of the case files that connect him to the other victims through arresting officers social workers legal medical baxters started interviews where we have vic id but he hasnt gotten a bump bump the vibe no bump on the vic roarke repeated with a chuckle and you threatened rabbit food for comp jargon jeez upon interviewing identified victims related to this matter detective baxter found no connection to the purity seekers nor felt any indication of connection from statements attitude or background checks i got it the first time darling but its such fun to hear you explain it to me in such official tones moving on she continued the incident reports list interviews with two additional minors records sealed itll take me a few minutes yeah ill get the coffee lets have some wine instead he said as he began to work on a keyboard id prefer not to get buzzed on caffeine i need to keep sharp any sharper youd be drawing blood now this is interesting what theres a secondary block on this file thats not usual for a standard seal damn good block too well now he rolled his shoulders like a boxer about to enter the ring when was it put on she hurried back to lean over his shoulder can you tell when it was put on no talking he brushed her back and continued to work onehanded yes indeed ive seen your work before havent i youre good very very good but he gets to talk eve grumbled and because watching the speed of his fingers flying over keys made her antsy she went to get the wine got him roarke sat back a moment reached out a hand without glancing at her to take the glass of wine wouldnt have been quite that quick if i hadnt already dealt with his work on those two units in the lab now theres a bump she thought youre sure of that a good compujock has a style take my word for it the block was added by the tech who designed the virus or techs i doubt this was the work of one organized thorough and skilled eve nodded and careful lets see who they wanted to hide screen three display devin dukes eve read twelve at the time of the incident she scanned the data quickly to get to the meat okay cogburn sold him some jazz parents sylvia and donald turned it up confronted the kid pressed the right buttons and got the story brought the kid in to make the complaint and ds dwier caught the case mightve been wiser to leave the cops out of it she looked back coolly excuse me just a thought dragging the boy into a cop shop putting him in the system put his back up wouldnt it a crime had been committed absolutely i just wonder if it might have been simpler and cleaner to stand the kid on his head so to speak at home initially rather than having him surrounded by badges and reports we rarely torture minors these days they break down so easy its not much fun torture has a different definition for a boy of twelve but he shrugged his shoulders elegantly thats hardly to our point is it it seems a relatively small occurrence to go to such trouble to lock away cogburn was brought in idd charged eve continued but the parents had flushed the evidence cogburn maintained that hed been drinking in a bar at the time the kid stated the buy went down bartender backs cogburn probably bullshit places like that will back jack the ripper if jack spreads enough grease dwier messed this up annoyance edged her voice he shouldnt have charged cogburn so fast why didnt he work him first work the bartender hang back scope out his routine snatch him up doing another deal pop a charge on him like that he lawyers up clams up he knows dwiers got nothing but the kids word and see here youve got the child services report clarissa price says the minor was reluctant defiant uncooperative confrontational with parents recommends family counseling and yaddayadda dwier needed to sweat cogburn because his witness was hostile and worthless which is something like saying his back was up look further he said before she could snarl at him into the cs report price states the boys schoolwork has been in steady decline his attitude at school and at home poor brooding in his room picking fights and so on the root of the problem wasnt in buying the jazz the root was in the boy and at home maybe so but the result was the parents overreacted the cop jumps too fast social worker mouths platitudes and the system fails the kid is that how you see it i see dwier didnt do his damn job on this one but i dont know how i see the whole picture she studied the data absently twirling a lock of roarkes hair around her finger i know theyre seeing the last part system fails but youre right this isnt enough to hide so theres more lets dig into fitzhughs sheet roarke found more blocks there as well but he had the groove now and broke them quickly minor complainants jansan rudolph ah here we are sylvia and donald dukes filing on behalf of their fourteenyearold son devin yeah yeah cs rep price investigating officer ds dwier click click click theres a no talking she ordered touche he retorted and sat back to watch her work kid ends up at the health center this time sodomized facial bruising sprained wrist tox report got himself jazzed again and chased it with alcohol got some body piercing now cock and nipple ornaments dwier catches it again but look here price tagged him specifically something going on between them she pulled out her memo book began to take notes as she scanned data doctor determines rape stanford quillens well see if he pops up again but they dont shake fitzhughs name out of the kid for twentyfour hours doesnt want to talk about it why do they think you want to talk about it gang up on him at home the next day price dwier the parents rape counselor whos this marianna wilcox shouldve gotten a male counselor he doesnt want to spill this to a female are they just stupid computer copy text of victim interview to my home unit but she read it through from where she stood it gave her a sour taste in the mouth a greasy feeling in the gut so many of the questions were familiar the same had been asked of her once who did this to you we want to help you but you need to tell us what happened youll feel better once you get it out bullshit bullshit you dont feel better sometimes you never feel better why dont they say it like it is youve been fucked over kid and were real sorry we have to fuck you over again tell us how it was and dont spare the details so we can write it all up and make it real all over again eve she shook her head fiercely theyve got good intentions most of them anyway but they dont know this boy isnt like you he was standing behind her now laid his hands on her shoulders and began to rub hes troubled and looking for trouble i know about that surely he got more than he deserved in that area but he isnt like you she calmed leaned back against him not like you either you were smarter meaner and you werent gay no arguing with that he kissed the top of her head his confusion over his sexuality is likely the cause for most of his behavior and the consequences of it that and his parents you got donald here eight years military service marines once a marine always a marine mom takes the professional mother route they put you in private schools three in five years pull you out into home schooling two months before the incident with fitzhugh hes got a kid brother here three years younger no problem there at least thats showing up on personal data but they yank him into home schooling too taking no chances you did note the fathers profession yeah computer scientist click click she turned away to get her coffee remembered it was wine frowning a little she settled for it devin rolls on fitzhugh claims he was picked up at a club after he snuck out of the house admits he showed fake id admits he was a little buzzed and that fitzhugh says how hes having a party at his place he goes with him most of thats probably solid but then it gets smokey he claims fitzhugh got him stoned but the tox levels too low for the way he plays it he was zonked didnt know what was going on fitzhugh got him into the playroom got him in restraints he tried to get away but fitzhugh overpowered him knocked him around then raped him it wouldnt be the first time wolves hunt sheep its their nature but it didnt go down like that here dwier had to know it didnt go down just like that maybe it was rape kid was a minor so consensual or not fitzhughs a pig but he didnt knock devin around the father did you look at fitzhughs sheet he never beat on his victims he didnt use force he used persuasion bribery threats trying to make the case with force was one of the reasons they lost him so you read this as dwier probably along with the dukes and price tried to build their case out of straw and the wolf blew it down she sat on the console lies halftruths and lousy police work i guess thats straw ill tell you how it went down kid sneaks out of the house probably hes done it dozens of time they try to cage him in but hes not having it hes not his goddamn father hes not his angelface baby shithead brother he heads to a club that caters to samesex orientation hes not looking for a girl fitzhughs trolling and smells fresh meat buys the kid a drink maybe offers him some illegals come up to my place theres more where that came from kid keeps the nice steady buzz going and fitzhugh does what fitzhugh does buzz is wearing off its no prettier a picture painted your way no prettier eve agreed but its the right picture kids fourteen hes angry hes confused hes ashamed he goes home sneaks back in but hes busted he smells of the alcohol and the sex and the father loses his temper grabs him by the wrist slaps him tears shouts recriminations probably some namecalling the father regretted after take him to the health center order him to say the minor injuries were a result of the sexual assault hes caused the family enough trouble damn it and hes going to do what hes told and in the end roarke continued it fell apart fitzhugh walked because among other things the others were too busy protecting their image yeah which makes me feel better about going over to their place tomorrow and questioning the family they wont be the only ones lets find the others ive set up the search already adding in georges file he smiled at her moved in nudging her knees apart so he could fit his body between them itll mark blocked sealeds and ive input the series of commands to bypass the block open the seal busy fingers and theyve life in them yet he slid them under her shirt itll take a bit of time to finish tasking just id say enough time im on duty me too he eased in and found with his mouth the spot just under her jawline he liked best why dont you give me an order lieutenant his fingers skimmed over her breasts her sides and around her back to dance along her spine the thrill rushed after them she knew what he was doing washing away the shadows of the picture theyd just painted bringing up the strong clear colors of their own cut that out she angled her head so his lips could trail up in a minute thats pushing even my speed and agility but well start with a minute he caught her earlobe between his teeth and see how it goes her brain was starting to fog up her body starting to rev god youre good at this is that going into my official file as a his mouth found hers sank in expert consultant civilian ill keep it in my personal records her breath caught how the hell had he gotten her shirt off so fast this is we cant do this on a command console i think we could hed already unhooked her trousers but it does lack a little something hitch on he said and gave her hips a boost until her legs were wrapped around his waist minutes gotta be up she whispered but couldnt resist nibbling at his throat lets see if we can make time stop he opened a wall panel a bed slid out when he tumbled her to the mattress she kept her legs and arms hooked around him and used the momentum to roll on top of him its going to be fast she warned him i can live with that she tore open his shirt ran her hands in one hard sweep over his chest then lowered to scrape her teeth over flesh the taste of him was already a part of her lived inside her still she always wanted more and took more crushing her mouth to his until the heat drenched her she could feel it pump from him from her as mouths and hands turned greedy it fueled her pulsing through her system like a slap of adrenaline when he flipped her to drag at her trousers she dragged at his her heart hammered under his restless mouth his muscles tensed under her impatient hands they tugged pulled yanked and ripped so that she was naked and laughing when she rolled again to straddle him laughter became a purr of pleasure as she took him inside her she clenched around him and drove him mad with need rearing up he clamped his mouth on her breast sucking her in until it felt as though he could feed on her heartbeat the flavor the heat the scent of mate she arched letting him fill her then began to move she drove him back braced her hands on either side of his head and used her hips to set a furious pace the thrill the dark and dangerous edge of it sliced through him her face was alive so alive with purpose and pleasure and she rode him as if their lives depended on it the air thickened his vision dimmed she was a blur of white and gold you go over her voice was raw you let go his body plunged to hers he thought it was like being swallowed alive he heard her cry out as she dived after him he drew her down drew her in while they drifted back sex is funny she murmured im still laughing she snorted and turned her face into the side of his neck for a moment yeah that was a really good joke but i meant sometimes it knocks you flat so you feel like you could sleep for a month other times it pumps you up so you feel like you could run a marathon i wonder why that is i couldnt say but i have a feeling this one falls into the latter category yeah im stoked she shifted planted a quick hard kiss on his mouth thanks oh whatever i can do to help well you can get your greatlooking ass up so i can see the rest of the data she sucked in a cheerful breath then rolled away i want coffee its going to be a long night why dont we get some of that cake to go with it she grabbed her shirt good thinking between the sex and caffeine her energy level stayed high until after three am she had six more names on her list and had no doubt there were more the game plan was already formed in her head shed start in the morning with the dukes when she reached for yet another cup of coffee roarke simply pushed it out of her reach youre cut off lieutenant and going off duty ive got another hour in me you dont no youve gone pale which is a sure sign youve hit the wall you need some sleep or you wont be sharp tomorrow youll have to be if youre going to do what i assume youre going to do and push for interviews with these families will you take peabody he asked more to distract her than a need to know he shut down the equipment slid an arm around her waist ive been going back and forth on that if i take her im putting her in the squeeze if i dont shell be pissed and sulk shes really annoying when shes sulking he had her in the elevator before she realized it which proved she supposed that shed lost her edge for the night i guess ill leave it up to her or maybe ill decide in the morning he finished and steered her off to bed chapter mcnab wasnt having much luck shutting down for the night he felt restless and useless lying in bed in the dark more aware of the numb parts of him than the rest counting off his own heartbeats like they were ticks of a clock he thought ticklocking off the rest of his life as halfthere halfgone it was easier during the day when the job kept his mind busy pushed him to think of something other than himself and that ticktock until he went to reach for something or stand up or just scratch his own damn ass it flooded back then boy like a goddamn tidal wave ticktock if he closed his eyes he could see it all happening again the shout the movement the blur of halloways hand lifting the weapon drawing a bead and he could feel it again that icy hot blast kicking him up and back and down that one instant just the one of feeling nothing if hed moved just a little faster if hed jumped the other way if halloway hadnt fired so close and so clean if if if he knew what his chances of coming back were now down to thirtypercent and falling he was fucked and everyone knew it they didnt have to say it he could hear them thinking it especially peabody he could practically hear her thinking it in her sleep he turned his head and could see the outline of her in the dark in the bed beside him he thought of the way shed chattered away about the job the case the kid jamie about a thousand things to avoid any gaps of silence while shed helped him get undressed for the night christ he couldnt even unbutton his own pants note to self he thought sourly zippers velcro and tipcot fasteners only in the future hed deal with it you ran with the data you got but hed be damned if she was going to be stuck with him he gripped the bedpost with his good hand tried to lever himself up she stirred shifted and her voice came out of the dark too clear for her to have been sleeping whats the matter nothing just want to get up ive got it ill give you a hand lights on ten percent i said ive got it peabody but she was already out of bed coming around to his side bet you gotta pee you and jamie mustve sucked down a gallon of milk each with that cake i couldve told you go back to bed cant sleep anyway i keep thinking about the case her movements were as brisk and practical as her tone as she scooted him up lifted shifted and maneuvered him into his chair you have to figure dallas and roarke are working on something or theyd have sit down im going to get some water sit down peabody sure okay she kept the halfsmile on her face as she sat on the side of the bed facing him was it too much she wondered not enough her muscles were so knotted it felt like a troop of youth scouts had been practicing for a merit badge with them he looked so tired she thought so horribly horribly frail somehow this isnt going to work were not going to work thats a stupid thing to be talking about at three in the morning she started to get up but he laid his good hand on her knee she was wearing a bright red nightshirt and her toes were painted the same shade her hair was messy her mouth grim and mcnab realized roarke had been right in something hed said once he was in love with her that meant he had to do this right look what i was going to do was pick a fight piss you off enough so youd storm out not that hard to do you get bent pretty easy wed break it off and go our separate ways but that doesnt seem right besides youd have copped to it anyway so im going to play it straight with you peabody its too late to have this kind of argument im tired you werent sleeping neither was i come on shebody hear me out he saw her eyes start to shine and shut his own dont turn on the tap okay this already sucks out loud i know what youre going to say youre messed up youre impaired and you want to break things off because you dont want to screw up my life blah blah she sniffed swiped a hand under her nose you want me to walk away because you cant so i can have a full meaningful life without the burden of being stuck with you well get fucked mcnab because im not walking and you managed to piss me off just fine by thinking i would that covers part of it he sighed kept his hand on her knee you wouldnt walk peabody youre solid and you wouldnt walk when im when im like this youd stick and youd keep sticking even if your feelings changed about everything youre solid and thats what a solid does after a while neither of us would know not for sure if you were with me because you wanted to be or because you felt obligated she got a stubborn line between her brows and turned her head so that she stared at the wall instead of those sober serious green eyes im not listening to this yeah you are he eased back gripped the arm of the chair with his good hand i dont want a medical and you dont want to be one for christs sake i wouldnt be able to take a piss on my own if roarke and dallas hadnt given me this fucking chair shes keeping me on the job and she doesnt have to im not going to forget that youre just feeling sorry for yourself fucking a he nearly smiled you try going twentyfive percent dead and see how quick you haul out the violins im pissed and im scared and i dont know what the hell im going to do tomorrow if ive got to live like this then thats the breaks he wasnt going to be a whiner he reminded himself he was not going to be a whiner but ive got a right to set up the rules and i dont want you around you dont know youre going to have to live like this she threw up her hands trying for exasperated while tears burned the back of her throat if it doesnt come back in a few days youll go to that clinic ill go ill owe dallas and roarke big for that too but ill go and maybe ill get lucky theyve got a seventypercent success rate they got a thirtypercent fail rate dont talk numbers to an eman baby ive got to focus on myself for a while i cant think about how things may or may not work out with us so we just box that up so you dont have to worry about it now youre a coward too goddamn it goddamn it cant you get that i need to do this for you cant you give me a lousy break here guess not her chin jutted out you already had your lousy break and ill tell you i dont know how things are going to work out with us either half the time i dont know what the hell i see in you youre irritating youre sloppy youre skinny and you sure dont match my childhood image of delias dream man but im in it now and i make my own calls when i want out ill get out until then you can shut up because im going back to bed guess roarkes more the image of delias dream man he grumbled damn right she swung her legs back into bed punched her pillows smooth sexy gorgeous rich and dangerous none of which you are now or were before you got zapped none of which you can hope to be once youre up and dancing again either get your own pitiful self back in bed im not your nursemaid he studied her as she laid back folded her arms across her chest and glared at the ceiling and he began to smile youre good i didnt see that coming piss me off insult me the not sexy remark is the one that stung by the way and shove the argument out of its orbit kiss my ass its one of my favorite recreational activities i dont want to fight with you shebody i just think we could both use a little time a little space i care about you dee i really care about you it made her eyes sting again he never called her dee she kept her lips pressed tightly together afraid she might start sobbing certain the killing expression she worked onto her face would have made her lieutenant proud she turned her head then she sat up like a rocket coming off the launching pad and stared youre scratching your arm what very slowly trembling only a little she pointed he followed the direction and saw hed been scratching absently at his right arm so it itches what im trying to say his body went very still hed have sworn his own heart stopped it itches he managed it feels like a bunch of needles under the skin oh christ its waking up she hurled herself out of bed to kneel beside his chair what about your leg can you feel anything yeah yeah i the itch grew maddening and his heart began to hammer help me out will you right along the hip i cant reach ahhhh i have to call summerset stop scratching and ill kill you can you move your fingers toes anything i dont know he bore down tried to ignore the sensation in his biceps in his thigh that was like being pricked with a thousand hot needles i dont think so do you feel this she pressed her thumb against his thigh and thought she felt a muscle quiver yeah he fought back the hot flood of emotion that gushed into his throat why dont you shift that grip a few inches to the left distract me before i start screaming from this itching your dick never went numb a tear spilled off her cheek plopped on his hand and he knew the sweetest sensation he would ever feel was that warm wet tear against his awakening hand i love you peabody she looked up at him with surprise look dont get crazy i love you he laid his good hand on her cheek i figured id lost my chance to tell you that im not going to risk missing it again dont say anything okay maybe you could just give it a chance to settle in she moistened her lips i could do that i need to get summerset up here he should do something probably when she straightened her knees wobbled and she turned and cracked her shin smartly on the bed shit shit wow she limped to the house link while mcnab scratched his throbbing arm and grinned after her by seventhirty eve was pumping in the caffeine again second cup in hand she headed for the lab for a quick checkin with roarke before the rest of the team poured into her office she was nearly through the door when she heard his voice shed heard that icy tone before the kind that sliced straight through the belly spilling out the guts before the victim registered the pain though the victim in this case was a minor nobody was going to call child services is there something about the rules of this household and your current position in it thats eluded you roarke posed the question the way a cat lurks outside a mousehole with lethal patience and the gleam of fangs look whats the bfd and the kid eve thought with a shake of her head was responding like the mouse stupid enough to think it could outwait or outwit the cat foolish foolish boy she mused you are dead meat already youll mind your tone when you speak to me james ill tolerate a certain amount of idiocy from you due to your age but ill tolerate no sass whatsoever are we clear on that particular point yeah okay but i just dont eve couldnt see roarkes face but she could clearly envision the look in his eye one that had jamie swallowing back whatever hed been about to say and revising it yes sir thats good saves time and heartache now ill explain the big fucking deal to you in words that should be easily understood because i gave you a specific order and when i give specific orders theyre to be followed and thats the end of it any part of that hazy for you people are supposed to think for themselves that they are and people who work for me are to do as i tell them or they dont work for me any longer if youre going to sulk over it take yourself off elsewhere so i dont have to look at you im almost eighteen roarke eased a hip onto a work counter a man are you then behave as one and not like a boy whos been caught with his hand in the cookie jar i couldve gotten more data you couldve crashed that impressive brain of yours the fact is jamie ive plans for you that dont include going to your memorial jamies shoulders hunched now his gaze lowered he kicked idly at the base of the workstation with the toe of his ancient airboot idve been careful careful careful isnt trying to sneak into the lab in the middle of the night to boot up an infected computer without anyone at control without anyone monitoring what that is is arrogant and its stupid ill tolerate a bit of arrogance even admire it but stupiditys another matter beyond all that you disobeyed an order i wanted to help i just wanted to help you have been and youll continue to help if you give me your word you wont try the same thing again look at me you say you want to be a cop god knows why as youll work yourself half to death for pisspoor wages and little to no appreciation from the people you swear to protect and serve a good cop follows orders he doesnt always agree with them doesnt always like them but he follows them i know the wind seemed to go out of him slumping his shoulders again i screwed up you did indeed but not as badly as you might your word on it jamie roarke held out a hand as a man jamie looked down at the proffered hand his shoulders straightened and he clasped it i wont do it again i promise then thats the end of it go grab some breakfast well be back at this in a half hour eve eased around the corner waited until jamie had dashed out and away roarke was already at a workstation when she walked in she noted he wasnt doing casework but transmitting some complicated instructions for his broker when he was done she opened her mouth to speak then closed it again when he immediately started another transmission to his admin she reminded herself of all the time he was giving her the work he was juggling reshuffling adjusting so he could carve out the time it helped keep her from grinding her teeth when he followed up the transmission to his admin with one to freestar one if youre going to stand back there shuffling your feet lieutenant you might bring me a cup of coffee im going to need another ten minutes here he was doing her a favor she told herself as she choked back the sass and got the coffee she listened with half an ear as he pulled in transmissions answered transferred instructed and as far as she could tell ruled his empire from the workstation more suited to a drone than a king that thing you were bidding on the office complex i guess they caved and took your offer yes and i wasnt shuffling my feet mentally you were im going to have to take a meeting this afternoon shouldnt tie me up more than ninety minutes whatever it takes youve already given the department more than it could expect pay me he said and yanked her down for a kiss you work cheap ace that was only a deposit have you decided how youre going to handle this morning pretty much before i brief the team i wanted to say that was a good technique with the kid before slap him down break him crush him into dust then build him back up again he sampled the coffee heard that did you i mightve added a couple of creative threats something that gives a good visual but all in all it was very impressive little peabrain thinking hed come in run an infected and present us with the data this morning i nearly planted a boot up his ass how did you know he tried because i took the precaution of adding an extra layer of security to the door and locked down all the units the faintest smile touched the corners of his mouth and i expected him to try it as i wouldve done at his age im surprised he didnt get through ive a bit more skill than a teenage boy thanks yeah yeah and bigger balls too i was thinking of that jammer of his you took the prototype away from him but idve bet a month of my pisspoor wages he had another you mean this roarke pulled it out of his pocket i had summerset toss his room discreetly when it wasnt found there i assumed correctly he had it on him so i picked his pocket on the way into dinner last night and slipped him another with a few particular defects defects gives you a quick rather unpleasant little jolt when you begin the cloning function that was small of me i suppose but he needed to be put in his place amused she clinked her coffee mug to his yeah all in all pretty impressive you want in on this briefing or do you need some more time to buy saturn or venus i dont buy planets theyre just not cost effective he rose they walked into eves office to see jamie feeney and baxter chowing down from a table set up in the middle of the room and loaded with food these eggs baxter swallowed forked up another bite are from chickens chickens cluckcluck eve walked over to snag a piece of bacon you fell into gravy with this guy dallas no offense baxter said to roarke and shoveled in more eggs none taken amused he nodded toward the meat platter have you tried the ham its from pig oinkoink jamie said cracking himself up if weve finished visiting the farm animals youve got ten minutes to slurp the rest of this up eve polished off the slice of bacon and baxter if you spread it around central about me falling into gravy ill see to it that you never have another chicken egg as long as you live she scowled at her wrist unit why arent peabody and mcnab in here she turned intending to use the house link to roust them roarke stopped her with a hand to her shoulder eve he said it quietly nudging her around until she faced the door her throat snapped closed her hand went to feeneys shoulder in turn squeezed hard they watched mcnab walk slowly into the room he used a cane it looked almost stylish somehow glossy black silvertipped he was sweating she could see the beads of effort popping out on his face even as he grinned from ear to ear his steps were unsteady obviously labored but he was on his feet walking peabody was just behind him struggling not to cry eve felt feeneys hand come up close tight over hers its about time you got up off that lazy ass of yours his voice was thick but feeney was afraid to lift a cup and drink to clear it his hand was far from steady teams been carrying you long enough i thought about trying to pull it off for one more day mcnab was out of breath when he reached the table still he reached out with his right hand closed his fingers over a slice of bacon lifted it to his mouth but i smelled food you wanted breakfast you should have come in twenty minutes ago eve waited until he looked at her better eat fast she ordered weve got work yes sir he tried to sidestep to a chair wobbled eve caught his elbow held it until he had his balance again dallas detective i figure this is the only chance ill ever have at this he gave her a hard noisy kiss on the mouth that had baxter applauding eve choked back a laugh and looked at him coolly and you think i wont knock you on your ass for that not this time exhausted he dropped into a chair caught his breath hey kid pass those eggs over here before baxter licks the damn platter after breakfast after the briefing eve dismissed her team but for peabody he looks good eve began a little worn out but good didnt get any sleep he was pulling the woe is me youve got to go routine when the what he was feeling low and hed gotten into his head he wanted me to walk so he wouldnt feel like a burden or i wouldnt feel like it whatever we were arguing and it started his arm starting itching then his legs and then sorry i get messed up when i talk about it okay then lets not talk about it except to say im glad hes she broke off pressed her fingers to her eyes and breathed deep messes you up too peabody sniffled dug out her handkerchief thats so nice were all glad hes back lets leave it alone for now she sighed once then switched gears data has come into my hands through an alternate source im not going to name this source i intend to act on this data which includes names and info in sealeds that i do not as yet have authority to open peabody sat quietly she knew what roarke and her lieutenant had been working on now she didnt know how the hell theyd gotten into sealeds probably didnt want to know yes sir it seems to me that acting on this data which came into your hands by an alternate source would be correct procedure to ignore the data during an investigation labeled priority would be dereliction of duty want to be my rep if they bust me for this i figure roarke can hire us the best going you wont be in the line of fire you can elect to take another assignment dallas or eve continued you can accompany me as my aide and as my aide your ass will not go in the sling on this youre just following orders respectfully sir my ass is with yours if you expect it any other way youve got the wrong aide i havent got the wrong aide we might catch a little heat for this peabody but i dont think itll burn very hot or very long ill fill you in on the way donald and sylvia dukes lived in a tidy twostory townhouse eve noted frilly curtains at the windows and identical white pots of regimented red flowers standing on either side of the front door like soldiers she thought guarding the fort she rang the buzzer took out her badge the woman who answered was small slim and as ordered as her flowers she wore a blueandwhite checked dress and there was a white apron tied at her waist she wore pale rose lip dye earrings fashioned of three small pearls in a triangle and spotless white canvas shoes without the apron she would have looked like a woman about to head out for a day of running errands mrs dukes yes whats wrong what do you want her cautious gaze darted from eves face to the badge and back again eve could hear the breathy sound of nerves in her voice nothings wrong maam id like to ask you some questions is it all right if we come in im in the middle of im very busy this isnt a good time i could make an appointment at your convenience but im here now and ill try not to keep you very long who is it sylvia donald dukes came to the door he towered over his wife an athletically lean man of six feet two inches his sandy hair was fashioned into a short military cut the police sylvia began lieutenant dallas nypsd and my aide officer peabody i have some questions mr dukes if i could have a few minutes of your time whats this about hed already shifted his wife aside and stood blocking the doorway it wasnt only flowers guarding the fort now eve decided its regarding the deaths of chadwick fitzhugh and louis k cogburn that has nothing to do with us sir at one time you filed charges on behalf of your son devin against both of these men my son devin is dead he said it so flatly so coldly he might have been speaking of the loss of his favorite tie im sorry eve heard his wife choke off a sob behind him dukes didnt bat an eyelash mr dukes is this something you want to discuss in the doorway this is something i dont want to discuss at all devins files are sealed lieutenant how did you get our name your names came up during the course of my investigation hardass to hardass then eve decided staring at him coldly files can be sealed mr dukes but people talk dad a boy walked halfway down the stairs he was tall like his father his hair as rigidly shorn he wore blue trousers a blue shirt both knifeedge sharp like a uniform eve decided joseph go back upstairs is something wrong this doesnt concern you dukes glanced back briefly go upstairs immediately yes sir i wont have you disrupting my home he said to eve would you prefer taking it down to central you have no authority to yes sir i do and the fact that youre reluctant to answer a few routine questions leads me toward exercising that authority this can be simple or complicated thats your choice you have five minutes he stepped back sylvia go upstairs with joseph i require mrs dukes as well eve could see him struggle with fury hot color burned across his cheekbones and his jaw worked this wasnt a man accustomed to having any order questioned much less countermanded she could go headtohead with him or she could throttle back she made an instant and instinctive decision to change tactics mr dukes im sorry to bring this into your home to disturb you and your family i have to do my job and your job is to question decent citizens over the death of scum im just a foot soldier following orders she saw immediately it had been the right button he nodded and without a word turned and walked into the living area sylvia remained standing her fists clenched her knuckles white as her apron should i would you like some coffee or they arent guests sylvia dukes snapped it out eve saw his wife flinch as if from a blow dont trouble yourself mrs dukes the living area was whistle clean flanking a sofa done in a pattern of muted blues were two identical tables on each was a matching lamp there were two chairs in the same pattern as the sofa and the green area rug showed not a speck of dust or lint there was a vase holding yellow and white flowers arranged too precisely to be cheerful it was set exactly in the center of the coffee table i wont ask you to sit dukes stood clasping his hands behind his back at waist level another soldier eve thought prepared for interrogation chapter mr dukes its my understanding that approximately four years ago your son had occasion to purchase an illegal substance from louis k cogburn that is correct and on learning of this you reported same to the police filing an official complaint at that time that is also correct subsequently charges in this matter against cogburn were dropped can you tell me why the prosecutors office refused to follow through he stayed at attention cogburn was put back on the street where he could continue to corrupt young minds young bodies i assume your son gave a full statement of the occurrence and with the illegal substance in evidence traced back to cogburn it seems unusual that the prosecutor wouldnt press cogburns lips thinned the illegal substance had been destroyed i would not have it in my home it seemed my word my sons word was not enough against the word of trash i see that was difficult for you frustrating im sure for your family it was it was interesting eve thought that dukes wore nearly the same blue uniform as his young son the creases down the center of his trousers were so sharp they looked capable of cutting flesh more interesting were the waves of fury rolling off him hot smothering waves of rage barely held in check to your knowledge did your son continue to have dealings with cogburn he did not but eve saw the truth on sylvias face the kid had gone back for more eve thought and everyone knew it i assume child services recommended illegals counseling for devin they did eve waited a beat and did he complete the program i fail to see what this has to do with your investigation lieutenant he said tightly she changed tacts again can you tell me about the events surrounding devins experience with chadwick fitzhugh the man sexually molested my minor son the first crack showed in dukess composure but it wasnt grief eve saw so much as disgust he forced himself on my son and engaged in unnatural acts and this molestation took place in fitzhughs home it did how did devin come to be in fitzhughs home he was lured did devin tell you how he was lured it doesnt matter how he was molested it was duly reported to the police the man responsible was not punished the charges were dropped why because the law protected the predator and not the prey your time is up how and when did devin die ignoring the question dukes started out of the living room toward the front door i can get that information through public records my son killed himself dukes stood with his hands fisted at his sides eight months ago he pumped his body full of garbage until he died the system failed to protect him it failed to assist me in protecting him you have another son how far would you go to protect him joseph will not be corrupted by the cancer that eats away at our society cancers a kind of virus isnt it you can kill a virus with a virus infect the host until the bad cells are destroyed youre a computer scientist mr dukes you know about viruses she saw it then the acknowledgment even a kind of pride that leaped onto his face then off again i said your time is up sos yours mr dukes eve said quietly youre going to want to start making arrangements for your wife and son for when you go down with the rest of purity get out of my house i intend to call my lawyer good idea youre going to need one when they were back in the car peabody frowned back at the house why did you tip him if he wasnt smart enough to figure out im looking at him and he is whoever hes going to report this visit to would be i was tipping the wife you dont think shes part of it he never touched her barely looked at her shes standing there with tears running down her face and he doesnt so much as acknowledge her presence no this is his deal what did you see in that house peabody well he rules more than that its a fucking barracks and hes the commander she answers the door before nine in the morning dolled up like a woman in a screen ad for autochefs kids about fourteen but he bolts back upstairs at the snap of dukess finger i bet all the beds were already made and you could bounce a fivecredit coin off every one of them considering she headed downtown hows a former marine who demands everything around him be squared away going to handle having a son whos corrupting his mind and body with illegals that was his term right just like unnatural acts was his term a chemihead homosexual son boy that had to burn his whitebread homophobic ass poor kid yeah and now his father can use him as a symbol as an excuse to kill there are all kinds of cancers she mumbled dallas she said when her dash link beeped in your vehicle nadine asked you may want to pull over somewhere youre going to want to hear this i can hear and drive at the same time im talented that way ive got another statement from the purity seekers going to air in

just what they want to hear thats why this is textbook pr dallas it works ill be damned if theyre going to use one of us as a symbol you want a comment nadine here it is lieutenant eve dallas primary investigator on the purity homicides states that edd detective kevin halloway was killed in the line of duty by a terrorist organization calling themselves the purity seekers this organization is suspected of being responsible for the murders of four civilians and a police officer lieutenant dallas further states that she the members of her investigative team and every officer every resource of the new york police and security department will work to uncover identify and arrest all members of this terrorist organization so that they may be tried under the codes of this city and if found guilty be punished to the full extent of the law got it got it not bad nadine said as she turned back from her recorder how about a oneonone followup no im busy nadine and i have to help bury a cop today they memorialized kevin halloway in a bereavement facility downtown only blocks from cop central it had often occurred to eve when shed had to pay her respects to other fallen cops there that whoever had started the business had figured the location near a major cop shop would be a plus for halloway theyd opened the entire first floor and still the place was packed cops always managed to find the time to wake another cop she spotted mayor peachtree tucked in among his entourage as he shook hands and looked properly grim sympathetic or understanding eve didnt have anything against him personally and he seemed to be doing the job with a minimum of fuss and selfaggrandizement he might have been sincere he seemed sincere sincerely pissed she thought when his sparkling gaze locked with hers through the crowd there was command in the single sharp gesture that summoned her to him mayor lieutenant he kept his voice low it could have been mistaken for reverent in such a place but she heard the annoyance beneath it your record is impressive your superiors have complete faith in your abilities but youre not simply a police official in this matter youre a public figure your statement to furst at was neither vetted nor authorized my statement was responsive and accurate accuracy he seemed to draw himself in accuracy isnt the issue perception image and message are lieutenant we need to be a unit a team during this crisis he laid a hand on her arm there was warmth in the gesture a land of practiced bonhomie just as the slight curve of his lips was practiced im depending on you yes sir he stepped back was soon swallowed up by his people and by others who wanted that brief contact with power and celebrity eve preferred commander whitneys quiet presence to peachtrees shining one hed brought his wife eve noted if there was anything anna whitney excelled at it was the public and social areas of being a top cops wife she wore black a simple understated suit and ranged beside her husband she held a womans hand in both of hers halloways mother feeney stepped up to eves side ive already spoken to her she asked specifically to meet you man i know i hate these things too attractive redhead other side of the chief halloways girl names lily doogan shes pretty ripped up there are badges here from every borough that says something yeah it says something they got him in the next room mcnabs in there feeney let out a long breath got him into a chair cant stand easy for long yet roarkes in there with him roarkes here yeah grief drenched him i couldnt stay in there anymore just couldnt do it being heres enough feeney doesnt feel like it ill take you over to his mother they made their way through the crowd of mourners through the muted hum of conversation the air was heavy with the scent of flowers dim with the quiet light the grieving seemed to prefer lieutenant eve turned at the hand on her arm and looked into jenna francos eyes she didnt see grief in them but she saw plenty of annoyance she didnt mask it as smoothly as peachtree deputy mayor i need to speak with you privately i have something to do first youll have to wait she tugged her arm free turned her back it was petty she knew but since she had a damn good idea what the private chat was going to entail she doubted she and jenna franco were going to waste much time on the amenities eve braced herself before approaching colleen halloway she would probably be in her forties maybe fifties eve calculated but looked younger grief had given her skin a kind of translucence that added a youthful fragility against the unrelieved black of her mourning lieutenant it was anna whitney who spoke first eve had often found herself on the commanders wifes wrong side but at the moment there was none of the usual hint of impatience or irritation on her face and to eves surprise anna took her hand and squeezed it mrs whitney detective halloways mother has been hoping to speak with you her voice was low her back turned slightly so that the words were for eve alone do you know the one thing more difficult than being married to a cop lieutenant no i always figured that was the short straw the faintest smile ghosted around annas mouth theres one shorter yet thats giving birth to one be careful with her yes maam colleen with a natural gentleness eve admired anna draped an arm over the womans shoulders this is lieutenant dallas lieutenant kevins mother mrs halloway im very sorry for your loss lieutenant dallas colleen gripped eves hand it was stronger firmer than eve had expected thank you so much for coming i wonder theres a small privacy room upstairs i wonder if you could spare a few minutes id like to speak with you all right she led eve out of the dim parlor up a set of stairs cops had spilled out crowded there as well but they stepped aside eyes lowered respectfully as colleen passed my husband would like to meet you as well and lily but i asked them if i could have this time alone with you they understood she opened a door walked into a small sitting room more flowers soft fabrics just a little overdone in style just a little too dark in their winered tones these places are so horribly depressing arent they i wonder why they dont let in the light colleen walked to the window threw open the heavy drapes and let in the sun i suppose a lot of people find comfort in the shadows do you she asked eve then shook her head my thoughts are rambling please sit down colleen took a chair sat with her back very straight ive seen you onscreen you always seem so competent even when its coverage of one of those social functions you attend with your husband hes terribly handsome isnt he yes maam it was kind of him to come as well to make the time to speak to me my husband lily very kind kevin spoke of you occasionally you never worked with him though did you not directly no but i often depend on edd in my work hall kevin was a valued member of the department he admired you i wanted to tell you she added smiling a little at the blank look on eves face he sometimes spoke of you working with captain feeney and the other young detective ian mcnab he was i think a little envious of your relationship with both ian and the captain mrs halloway i only tell you that so you might understand why he might have said or done the things he said or did when he was in such terrible trouble mrs halloway i dont need an explanation kevin was ill very ill and none of what happened after they infected him was any fault of his its good to hear you say that i heard the statements this morning both of them i wasnt sure if yours was just the departmental line or if you meant it i did mean it every word of it colleen nodded her lips trembled once then firmed i know what you did to try to save kevin i know you risked your own life to do so and i know she continued as eve started to speak that youll say you were doing your job thats what all of you say but i want to thank you first as a mother just as a mother her eyes swam and though she blinked to fight the tears one spilled out and trailed down her cheek and i want to thank you for kevin please let me finish still she had to stop for a moment clear her throat my son was proud to be a police officer he believed in what that stood for respected it and gave his best they might have taken that from him as well as his life if not for you if not for you his captain his commander his fellow officers that pride and respect might have been taken from him instead she reached into a small black purse and took out her sons badge instead theres honor ill never forget it she leaned forward now her expression intense stop them you will stop them yes maam ill stop them with a nod colleen leaned back again ive kept you long enough im sure you have a great deal of work i think id like to sit here in the light for a little while eve rose and went to the door then she turned and said what was on her mind mrs halloway he must have been awfully proud of you too again those lips curved just a little again a single tear spilled down her cheek eve slipped out and closed the door she was nearly to the stairs when franco swooped up chang scurried in her wake like a pet dog well talk now when she headed for the privacy room eve caught her arm mrs halloways in there the impatience on francos face faded her one last glance at the door was full of sympathy then that faded as well as she strode down the hallway pushed her way into another room it was some sort of office manned at the moment by a young woman at a gleaming wooden breakfront that had been modeled into a workstation i need this space franco snapped youll have to leave eve lifted her brows as the girl scrambled out franco was a woman who went where she wanted when she wanted eve admired the trait when chang closed the door behind them franco launched into the attack you were instructed to use the official statement when responding to the media we cant waste time and resources running along behind you and clearing up the mess then youd better try to keep up i got a heads up minutes before the latest statement from purity was to be aired i responded to said statement as i deemed appropriate its not your place to deem what is an appropriate response to the media this came from chang in clipped tones its my job to tell you whats appropriate in this area the last time i looked i dont answer to you and should that day ever come ill retire chief tibble ordered you to cooperate he reminded her yet you refuse to accept the bookings that were arranged for maximum spin and effect and now you issue your own statement without clearance a statement that speaks not just for you lieutenant but for the department this is not acceptable if the chief or my commander determines ive done or said the unacceptable then they can dress me down chang you cant she took a step toward him was darkly pleased to see him take one back dont ever try to tell me how to do my job youve never had any respect for me or my position eve angled her head and your point is well see what chief tibble has to say about this run along and tattle you little weasel and let the grownups finish talking she turned back to franco whod said nothing during the exchange you got something else to say to me yes actually why dont you give us a minute here chang well discuss the rest of this in my office in she checked the time thirty minutes he went out giving the door a sulky little slam do you try to irritate people dallas or is it just an innate skill i guess its the second because it comes real easy especially with pissants like chang if i tell you i agree that chang is an annoying selfsatisfied and boring pissant a statement i will vehemently deny making if repeated can we table some of the hostility why do you use him then because hes good hes very very good if i had to like everyone i worked with or who worked for me i sure as hell wouldnt be in politics now issue one your statement this morning chang feels and i agree as does the mayor that your use of detective halloways death was ill advised my use just one damn minute they used him shirking responsibility for his death i responded and stuck the responsibility right back up their ass and i understand the instinct that prompted you to do so for gods sake dallas do you think i function without a heartbeat i dont and that heart breaks for that woman down the hall damn it shes lost her son i have a son hes ten i cant imagine having to say goodbye to him the way colleen halloway is saying goodbye today it seems to me it would be harder if people were allowed to think her son died for nothing didnt he franco retorted then shook her head oh i know how you cops think on the job i wont argue with you because i dont understand that either but the point is that the more often his name is said the more hes made the story the harder it is to focus the media and the public on the message we want to send whatever you might think she added as she turned back i know more about this than you and chang know the second point is no statement should have been made without clearance you wont box me in that way im no media hound but if and when i feel using it helps my investigation ill use it yet you toss back the bookings chang arranged programming where wed have some control im not sitting in some studio parroting departmental or mayoral approved responses and statements when my time and energies are required in a priority investigation the fact is im never doing it yes so your commander has made clear then whats the problem had to take a shot franco spread her hands we could use the airtime the other matter i have to discuss with you is potentially a great deal more serious its already come to the mayors ear that you questioned the dukes this morning in the course of your investigation a family who also lost their son recently and who are protected by sealed files he didnt waste any time the information on the dukes came into my hands the connection to two of the victims as well as donald dukess profession led me to believe an informal interview was warranted are you going to try to tell me how to do my job now oh for christs sake franco threw up her hands why do you insist on behaving as if were on opposite sides it feels that way do you know what will happen if donald dukes goes to the media if he talks about being harassed in his own home by the primary in this already hotbutton situation their son was hooked on illegals by cogburn theres no evidence to support cogburn was his first dealer it doesnt matter if theres evidence franco fired back this is what would be said cogburn hooked an innocent vulnerable twelveyearold boy from a good solid churchgoing family the police failed to make a case later this boy now troubled now recalcitrant due to his addiction falls into the hands of a pedophile chadwick fitzhugh beats and rapes young devin now a tender fourteen the family is shattered the boy is traumatized and again the police fail to make a case thats not the way it happened thats the way itll be presented reported discussed should they go public truth pieces of the truth outright lies it doesnt matter once its on the air a picture will be painted then youll walk into it questioning this damaged grieving family who tried to do the right thing who put their faith and their sons welfare into the hands of the system only to be failed in the most horrible way you attempt to implicate them in a homicide investigation you accuse them of being members of a group youve publicly called terrorists and you do this in their home dont you see how this will play ill tell you how it plays franco donald dukes couldnt or wouldnt accept his sons sexual orientation oh my god oh my god franco pressed her fingers to her temples seemed to try to drill them through you start saying that child was gay youll be in a lawsuit and so will the department probably the city before i can push you out of the nearest twentystory window not if i push you first in any case evidence indicates he was gay or certainly confused about his own sexuality he never got the chance to make up his mind his father is rigid domineering the kind of guy whos just not going to be wrong he destroys evidence that may have helped make the case against cogburn but its the systems fault he edits and changes the facts in the fitzhugh matter so the case falls apart and again its the systems fault now hes found an outlet for his aggressions and his viewpoint purity you have proof of all this of some ill get the rest dallas if im having a hard time believing any of this no one else will believe it in addition youre speaking of facts and suppositions that were in a sealed an official and public reprimand from your commander may not be enough to stop legal action or the media storm if and when my commander deems it necessary to reprimand me thats his right and thats my problem the media storms yours and changs dukes can start all the legal actions he wants theyre not going to go anywhere once i put him in a cage are we done here youd better be very sure of yourself franco warned im sure of the job and thats the same thing eve walked out as she started back downstairs she heard the clear strong voice of a tenor singing the opening bars of danny boy cops were always singing danny boy at funerals she thought shed never known just why lieutenant roarke met her at the base of the stairs i need some air was all she said and strode out the door chapter a doubleparked delivery van had tied up traffic for what appeared to be a good six blocks the resulting noise from blasting horns and hurled obscenities turned the air into one long scream of rage a glidecart operator had overcooked and oversauced his kabobs the stink of the greasy smoke was amazing eve preferred the noise and stench to the murmurs and flowers inside she strode straight through the nauseating odor and dug out credits gimme chocolate she ordered the operator got sticks many ya want six got yer fruitade got yer pepsi got yer coke got yer fizzy water whatcha want just the chocolate she tossed him the money snagged the skinny sticks out of his hand she bit fiercely into the first they were already melting in the vicious fist of the heat roarke bought a large water and grabbed a small mountain of napkins hand one over youll be sick if you eat them all im already sick but she proved her depthless love by giving him one peachtree gives me the thirtysecond lecture on teamwork ending in the warm were both just public servants arm squeeze then chang and franco jump on my ass about the statement i gave this morning not screened not approved lets not confuse the public with the truth im a cop not a public relations puppet which im sure you pointed out yeah she smiled grimly ate more chocolate there was that franco doesnt seem to be an idiot especially for a politician but she and all of them sure seem to be more interested in perception in image in spins than in the investigation they wouldnt understand the investigation the way they would perception image and spin he drank water to wash down what was laughingly called chocolate by the city vendors then dampened a napkin to get the smear of it off his fingers and they wouldnt understand you and the fact that you care less about media exposure than you do what shirt you put on in the morning he added twopointing the napkin into a recycler which is not at all eve looked down at her shirt it was white she thought it was clean what else did you need to worry about wed all be better off if they did what they did and left me alone to do what i do ive got suspects damn it price dwier and now the dukeses i crack any one of them and this breaks open she started on the third stick dukes called a lawyer jumped right on that whining harassment making lawsuit noises thatve put franco and company into orbit was that unexpected no i expected it i guess i hoped it would hold line until after the memorial she glanced back at the bereavement center a few cops were heading out back to duty she thought life didnt always go on but the job did hes in it roarke dukes slides into the profile like it was a tailormade suit you know how you handled jamie this morning what i said about knocking him back grinding him into dust then building him up again dukes wouldnt trouble himself with the last part of that cycle my impression is he made his kids life a small personal hell im going to bring him down and the rest of them with him she looked up picked out the window of the room where shed sat with colleen halloway im going to stop them i need you to get me as much data and background on donald dukes as you can within legal bounds if you want it within legal bounds why ask me instead of feeney or mcnab because i may be ordered to back off the dukes and if i am i cant ask them so im asking you in case it plays that way seems to me a guy with all your companies would always be on the lookout for a good computer scientist youd do a background check employment check and so on before you considered hiring anyone on right i certainly would and i might casually mention some of that information to my wife he stroked a finger down her chin thats very clever lieutenant i want him in a box and to get him there i need all the angles im going to have another talk with clarissa price this afternoon shes not going to be happy to see me then i may bounce on to dwier she looked down at her hand the remaining stick was now a blob and a dead loss well yuck she dumped it in a recycler cleaned her fingers with the water and napkins roarke provided hey lady a man stuck his head out of his car window and shouted at her over the horns why dont you blast that asshole up there give the resta us a fricking break your weapons showing roarke told her and she hitched the thin black jacket back over it a quick scan and she spotted a couple of uniforms coming out of the center yo she held up her badge roust that delivery jerk up there he doesnt move along in one slap him a ticket you a fricking cop the man shouted no i just like carrying a fricking badge and a blaster lay off the horn she turned back to roarke caught him grinning at her what youve got chocolate on your fricking badge lieutenant damn it shed nearly wiped it on her trousers before he snatched it out of her hand used the last of the napkins lift up your chin he ordered what is it on my face no he leaned in the perfect angle and kissed her i just wanted to do that smart guy give me back my shield its back in your pocket she checked shook her head go use those fast fingers of yours to get me some data im going to go grab peabody and head to child services ill just see if mcnabs ready to go you brought them in the limo didnt you she asked as they walked back yes why youre spoiling my team she turned toward the door just as whitney came out lieutenant roarke i thought youd left we were about to commander as soon as i round up my team leave that to roarke walk back to central with me yes sir tell peabody to meet me at central eve told roarke she took a step stopped tell her to walk she added i dont want you dropping her off in the limo as you like lieutenant roarke skimmed a finger over the dent in her chin ill see you at home jack he nodded at whitney then went inside from the looks at this traffic he wouldnt get a vehicle near central for the next thirty minutes hed find a way eve replied and it makes a damn spectacle i prefer walking when i can manage it whitney said as they started down the sidewalk you spent some time speaking with halloways mother alone shes got a lot of spine yes she does i believe you also spoke with the mayor yes sir hes understandably concerned about this situation i think its fair to say were all understandably concerned about this situation our concerns may demonstrate themselves differently you also spoke with chang and the deputy mayor we had words whitney looked over at her you had words with a number of people today yes sir i believe the statement i gave nadine furst in response to the release by purity was appropriate it was also factual detective halloway and his family deserve more than to have him used as a tool by terrorists to spread their message the job owes him more than that im very aware of what the job owes lieutenant he stopped at the crosswalk with a crowd of other pedestrians waiting for the light as it happens i found nothing inappropriate about your statement nor does the chief the mayors office is less satisfied but chang is already working to maximize the effect in our favor it matters whitney said though she hadnt spoken hadnt intended to the crowd started the surge seconds before the light changed both eve and whitney moved through it picking up the pace to break clear i could waste our time giving you the standard lines about politics media relations public relations image and perception and the often tricky dynamics between the nypsd and the mayors office whitney flipped credits out of his pocket and into a beggars cup without breaking stride but i wont youre aware of all of this already just as im aware youre not particularly concerned with any of that i will say it will be helpful and it will be simpler for all involved if you cooperated with chang as much as possible when it doesnt impede or interfere with your investigation yes sir as to the matter of your interview with donald and sylvia dukes this morning it wasnt an interview commander but a few informal questions in their home and with their permission you can play the semantics game when it suits you whatever term used the files on devin dukes were sealed and remain so at this time data isnt always accessed through files sir yes you can play the game are you willing to divulge your source no sir nor am i required to under departmental code article dont quote departmental codes at me dallas he continued to walk easily despite the pressing heat but his tone took on an edge if it comes to a civil trial both you and those codes will be tested it wont not only will the issue be moot when i charge donald dukes with conspiracy to commit but hes going to need to pool all his legal resources for his defense hes part of it hes up to his neck the mother eve shook her head i dont think so shes too passive im doing a background to try to determine how skilled a programmer duke might be regardless i believe him to be a key player he wouldnt settle for less i could break him in interview hes angry and hes arrogant and he needs to be right he doesnt like women in authority either so thatll push likes them in their proper place she continued half to herself wifes all shined up like a show dog wearing an apron lip dye and earrings at nine in the morning my wife puts on her makeup before breakfast weird but nobody intimidates mrs whitney nobody pushes her around eve caught herself winced no disrespect intended commander none taken i need a few more threads to tie dukes then i can bring him in find the threads and make them strong ones i think hes maintained a relationship with the social worker and the cop who were on his sons case and i think theyre involved i tie any one of them ill tie them all they streamed through another intersection turned west make sure of it a mistake will blow this up in our faces and youll take the brunt of that on another matter it was good to see mcnab on his feet yes sir very good he looks a little shaky yet im keeping his workload light and peabodys she clammed up redirected must be something about walking outside like a couple of tourists that loosened her tongue she decided peabodys taking up the slack do you think im unaware of the relationship between the edd detective and your aide lieutenant eve stared straight ahead i dont like to talk about it it makes me twitchy excuse me literally i get this tic right under my eye every time never mind both detective mcnab and officer peabody fulfill their duties in an exemplary fashion i plan to submit peabodys name for consideration for promotion to detective first grade how many years does she have in almost three and over a year of that in homicide her work and her record warrant the consideration sir if you could find time to look at her files and my evaluations and if you agree with my recommendation she could start preparing for the test ill let you know can you spare mcnab for an hour maybe two this afternoon yes sir if necessary then im pulling him hell do a oneonone with furst in studio in response to the statements issued this morning sir that doesnt go down easy putting him on display after his injuries on the day of halloways memorial this is whats known as compromise lieutenant his tone remained mild a dash of ice water on the heat of hers power and authority demand compromise do you doubt he can handle it more do you doubt hell stand for halloway no sir i dont doubt it you dont like him being used as a symbol whitney moved to the entrance of cop central but thats what he is and lieutenant so are you inside he looked around the enormous lobby with its many data stations animated locator maps at the cops at the victims at the guilty and so he said is this this stands for law and order and its on display it is very simply on trial due to the manipulations and maneuvers of a group of terrorists its more than closing your case its winning the verdict find the threads if youre going to take down the father of a dead teenager be sure you tie them tight she decided to tie other threads by taking the time to write an official report on her morning activities but when she walked into her office don webster was at her desk i keep finding iab in my chair im going to have to have it replaced close the door dallas ive got a report to write then i have to get out in the field he got up closed the door himself well make this quick i have to record this conversation whats this conversation and why do you have to record it its in regards to your access of data contained in sealeds take a minute to think he said before she could speak take a minute to think before the recorder goes on i dont need a minute turn it on and get this over with i have a few pesky murders to solve while youre filing your internals this is sop you know it you had to know this was coming to tell you the truth i didnt think of it and shed kick herself for that later had a few things on my mind today have a seat im not required to sit okay fine he turned on his recorder webster lieutenant donald attached internal affairs bureau in interview with dallas lieutenant eve homicide cop central regarding the matter of dukes donald sylvia and minor son devin deceased lieutenant dallas do you wish to engage your departmental representative or any outside legal representation for this interview no did you in your official capacity visit the home of donald and sylvia dukes he read off the address at approximately nine am this morning yes did you at that time question the aforementioned individuals regarding incidents that involved their deceased minor son devin dukes yes he lifted his eyebrows but whether it was in annoyance or approval of her monosyllabic answers she didnt know or care were you aware that the data regarding certain incidents pertaining to the minor on which you questioned the dukes is in sealed files she didnt bat an eyelash i was informed of this by mr dukes at his residence this morning you were not aware previously that this data was protected by seal i deduced it was how did you come by that deduction as i could find no open files with the aforesaid data in my search for information in the course of my investigation websters gaze stayed level with hers how did you obtain information on devin dukes through an outside source from what source did you obtain this protected information im not required to name a source utilized during an investigation most specifically a priority investigation this information is protected under departmental code twelve article eightysix b the monotone of his voice never changed you refuse to name your source yes doing so would compromise the source and my investigation lieutenant dallas did you employ departmental equipment and or sources to access sealed records i did not did you lieutenant dallas break the seal to devin dukess files i did not did you order any member of the nypsd to do so no did you coerce bribe threaten or order any other individual to break the courts seal on these files no will you should it be deemed necessary submit to truth testing on this matter i will not voluntarily submit to testing but will do so if ordered by my superiors thank you for your cooperation lieutenant interview end record off good is that it for now can i have a hit of your coffee she merely jerked a thumb at the autochef he walked over programmed a cup if this goes to court the truth angle would be smart would you pass it the interviews over webster ive got work look i snagged this interview duty because im trying to give you a hand iab doesnt follow through officially on something like this it smells like coverup neither of us needs that some of the anger shed held in check during the questioning leaked through theres a coverup webster but it has to do with purity hiding files under official seals doing the legal tango to keep them sealed as long as possible to try to stall or impair this investigation i got around them and they dont like it you sniffing at any cops when she said nothing merely sat and turned toward her computer he kicked her desk it was a gesture she understood and had some respect for is it so hard to believe im on your side in this no but i dont toss cops to iab at least not until im sure if i find any whore part of this ill carry them to you on my back but not until i know without a shadow theyre dirty he sipped coffee she could literally see him using it to calm himself down smooth out the edges if youve got names i could look into it unofficially she studied his profile he would she decided i believe you and i appreciate it but ive got some angles to work first if i hit a wall and think you can help ill tag you are you done with trueheart yeah hes cleared for duty kid didnt deserve to take this spin through the wringer as long as he came out the other side ive got work webster he started for the door if there are cops in this i want them get in line she answered then made her first call while she waited for a response she drafted out her report referring back to her own record to be sure she didnt leave out even the smallest detail she refined it logged it and transmitted the appropriate copies when she got clearance she contacted trueheart i need a uniform she said briskly grunt and drone work report to detective baxter my home office sir im assigned to dispatch duty until further notice this is your further notice ive cleared it my home office officer asap yes sir thank you sir see if you thank me after you put in a few hours with baxter she broke transmission then went out to scoop up peabody peabody youre with me sir it was all peabody said until they were in eves vehicle i didnt want to mention anything inside the building just in case baxter passed some info to me for you about detective sergeant dwier what he get he struck up some conversations at the memorial place was full of cops and some of them were from the onesix he worked it around to dwier and it turned out one of the guys there is in his squad seems that dwier went through a rough patch a few years back divorce wife moved to atlanta with his kid so he doesnt get to see his boy as much as hed like he was pretty flattened by it according to this source but not long after he met somebody met her through the job hes been seeing her regularly and the last year or so it seems to be heating up she works in child services some days it falls right in your lap it was time to visit clarissa price shed barely cleared the garage when she got the call absolute purity had been achieved the new homicide delayed her so that she arrived at child services minutes before the doors shut for the day she bullied her way past the receptionist and strode straight into clarissa prices office there was blood on eves trousers it barely showed against the black but she could still smell it im sorry lieutenant i cant make time for you neat and pretty price sat at her desk deliberately she shielded the data on her screen glanced at her wrist unit i have to finish this report then i have a late appointment youll make time prices lips firmed and she folded her hands lieutenant youve already broken faith by intruding on the dukes family this morning and setting a cycle in motion that will bring more grief and almost certainly litigation which may involve this facility and me the very last thing im inclined to do is make time for you or to tolerate you bursting into my office at the end of a very trying day breaking faith is that what you call it eve planted her palms on the desk leaned in and what do you call what puritys doing keeping the faith ive just come from another of their executions ms price the name nick greene ring a bell with you maybe you heard about him in the course of one of your trying days dealt in illegals porn vids sex brokering party favors that arent in what youd call the mainstream a client wanted it nick provided some of those clients taste ran to minors most of us wouldnt call nick greene a real swell guy but i can guarantee he had a couple of trying days himself just lately if thats your way of telling me someone else has died thats no business of this office and if this person has ever come up in the course of the duties performed by child services until im served with the proper papers i can neither confirm nor deny sooner or later im going to roll over whoevers blocking the warrants thats a promise heres another name that might ring a bell with you hannah wade sixteenyearold mixed race female recurrent runaway parents gave up the last time she took a walk my information is shed been on the street this time about three months did some unlicensed hooking petty dealing petty theft hannahs been in trouble on and off since she was twelve but shes not going to cause any trouble now shes dead eve pulled three fresh still photos out of her evidence bag tossed them on the desk she was a lovely girl according to her id photo according to witnesses whod seen her cant tell by these can you nobody looks lovely after theyve been stabbed fifty sixty times her face sickly white price shoved at the photos i dont know her youve got no right tough looking at the results isnt it not so fucking pure when you look it in the face i just waded through her blood thats tough too theres a lot of blood in a teenaged girl clarissa a lot of blood to splash and splatter while she tries to run away from a guy with a knife whose brains trying to burst out of his skull a lot of blood to pour and pool when she falls because she cant get away from him she greene did this to her no purity did this to her eve shoved the photos closer to price take a good look at what they did to her their research obviously didnt clue in that shed shacked with greene the last week or two it didnt identify a teenaged runaway who was flopping at his place sleeping in his bed while the infection started to cook in his brain maybe in hers too autopsy will check for that i dont believe you i want you to leave nothings pure price dont you get it nothing comes in or goes out of the world without a blemish no systems foolproof only when this one fails innocent people die she was a child you were supposed to protect her but you cant protect them all nobody can protect them all was it your idea eve asked or were you recruited whos in charge of purity i dont have to talk to you price was white around the lips now and her voice far from steady i dont want to talk to you dukes helped create the virus who else did dwier pull you into it or did you pull him price shoved back from her desk pushed to her feet eve could see her hands were trembling get out im bringing this down and youll go under with it you and dwier who the hell do you think you are standing in judgment executing by remote control then brushing off the bystanders deaths as victims of the blight on society youre the fucking blight clarissa all of you selfrighteous selfappointed guardians eve snatched up hannah wades death photos you killed this child and youll pay for it imim calling a lawyer but tears were swimming in her eyes gathering in the corners ready to spill this is harassment you call this harassment there was no humor in eves smile it sliced like a thinbladed axe dont get me started youve got twentyfour hours to turn yourself in you come in you turn evidence and ill push for an on planet rehabilitation facility i come after you in twentyfour hours and one minute you go into a concrete cage off planet youll never see real daylight again eve looked at the time fivetwelve tomorrow not a minute more chapter eve knew shed shaken clarissa price and shaken her hard she also knew price wouldnt be calling any lawyer unless he was purity approved but she would call dwier shed seen the horror on prices face when price had looked at the crime scene photos of hannah wade there had been shock and disbelief along with it but it was the horror that would continue to surface that would eat at price until she woke screaming in the night to keep herself from doing the same eve knew she had to do what came next take the next steps focus on the work thats what she told herself when she pinned the latest photos to the case board in her office she couldnt allow her own horror to surface again to have it slam into her belly as it had when shed stepped into greenes park avenue condo the horror that had taken her back for an instant to a small freezing room in dallas where the blood had reeked and the knife covered with it was clutched in her hand roarke came in closed the door locked it i need the whole team in here except for jamie to update them on the latest homicides in a minute he crossed to her took her shoulders turned her to face him her eyes were shadowed some was fatigue he knew but most of it was the nightmare i can see it in you he pressed his lips to her brow the pain from it its not getting in my way no cant have that can we hold on for a minute eve just for a minute his arms were already around her and now hers wrapped around him in turn it wasnt the same it wasnt anything like the same but it shoved me back it shoved me right back there i stood there looking down at her at him i was so cold ive seen that kind of thing before and he hasnt pushed me back there this was a girl a young girl older than i was twice as old as i was she could have been me she let out a long breath after she said it thats what i thought when i stood there when i stood over her if i hadnt killed him first if i hadnt gotten away from him she couldve been me steadier she turned her head on his shoulder looked back at the board with clear eyes do you see what they did to her as much as hed seen as much as hed done in his life the image of hannah wade still made his blood run cold the girl had been hacked to pieces the shirt and shorts shed been wearing were in tatters and soaked red with her own blood you can he said quietly you see it time and time again and no matter how often you do it still matters thats what makes you i need to do this now take the step she thought do the work i want jamie kept busy somewhere hes not going to see this ill take the stills of her down between briefings ill send him off to the pool or the game room have summerset monitor him to make sure he stays well away from here until youre done she nodded stepped back one thing did i coerce bribe or threaten you into opening sealed files no you asked with some reluctance and teeth gnashing she nearly managed a smile except for the teeth gnashing thats how i saw it if requested had been on the list i still wouldve said no in the iab query idve lied i dont like knowing that but i can live with it she looked back at hannah wades photo yeah i can live with it when her team was assembled she ran the details for them nick greene provided services his employment is listed as an entertainment consultant while he did have some straight clientele the bulk of it ran below the surface illegals vids that push code as they tend to involve minors authentic violence and bestiality he also provided unlicensed companions either sex for those looking for a little more than the law allows or who just like the thrill of breaking it hes got a sheet which indicates he often auditioned these companions personally hed been picked up for questioning a total of eight times but never charged his business apparently paid well his digs were park avenue smooth is he linked to price or dwier baxter asked i dont find their names on any of the data i have no doubt he was known to child services of the eight times he was hauled in for questioning two involved complaints involving a minor one of those complaints is sealed and under that seal well find one or more members of purity lieutenant trueheart raised his hand like a kid at a school desk isnt it possible greene was infected because of what he was alone without any other connection to the group its too early for them to target that way the first wave involves personal agendas gotta be feeney agreed you start up a group like this people are risking a hell of a lot most arent going to do it just on a principle they need some payback first have to have incentive for the rank and file youll have some raving fanatics too sociopaths who just like the idea of taking somebody out without getting bloody disciples roarke continued eager to follow the path frustrated cops city officials social workers and the like whove seen the guilty walk away free once too often and some id think who are simply intrigued intellectually at the idea of this sort of manmade selection theyve got their first wave in place eve gestured to the board working quickly my opinion is theyve infected or set to infect their entire first wave by this time give their membership bulk gratification quick and multiple successes and keep the media hot on the story focusing on targets who have in some way victimized children is very deliberate even cops have a different attitude when the victims are children she looked at the board again according to statements from the knockondoors hannah wade was first seen in the building ten days ago its possible she was there longer as her parents havent seen or heard from her in three months they didnt bother filing a police or cs report on her this time she was a habitual runaway mcnab youll review the buildings security discs and pin down the exact date she took up residence with greene on that i want to know how often she came and went and who else visited greene in the last two weeks we have a list of her known associates from her parents peabody and i will run those baxter see if any of the cops of record who questioned greene will reach out feeney roarke and the kid will continue to work to extract data from the units weve impounded were eking it out feeney told her we should have enough to dupe the virus in another eight ten manhours keep me up on that the greene wade hit follows the basic pattern greene was holed up in his place for the last five days building has live doormen on eight to midnight in three shifts droid handles the graveyard none of them saw greene come or go in that space of time statements indicate this was unusual for him he generally went out most days and at least five nights out of seven third shift man verifies greene brought a girl matching wades description home with him ten days ago and that she appeared to come and go freely from that time no one recalls seeing her exit or enter yesterday she turned crime scene record screen one the image that popped on was stark and grisly the whiteonwhite living area was splashed with blood broken glass sparkled in thin rivers of it that had snaked and spurted their way over carpet overturned tables a smashed entertainment screen lush tropical plants that had provided a contrast to the white but were now uprooted set the stage for the girls body she had been flung facedown arms and legs spread her hair was long and curly and had once been blonde with sapphire highlights some of that gold and blue still showed through the matted blood eve heard her own voice detailing the scene saw herself step into view and crouch by the body you can see the illegals scattered over the rug what appears to have been a hospitality bowl was found broken in this living area traces of substances identified as jazz and erotica were still in the damaged bowl switch to bedroom record the disc shifted showed a large sunwashed room done in blacks and reds the sheets on the bed were torn off the desk units monitor faced the recorder and read absolute purity achieved a smaller bowl undamaged can be seen here on the dresser various illegal substances are still in it and others are on the floor it appears greene continued to use while the symptoms of the infection manifested there were traces of blood on the sheets probably from a nosebleed and traces of semen indicating he was capable of masturbating or engaging in sexual relations with wade prior to death autopsy will tell us which wades body showed no evidence of recent sexual activity where the hell is he baxter asked well get there reconstruct tells me he probably spent some time closed up in the bedroom popping illegals jerking off while in the last hours wade entertained herself in the living area ate junk food got buzzed watched some screen greene wouldnt have been good company but hanging in a park avenue condo with easy access to illegals plenty of food lots of alcohol was a better deal than picking up a few tricks on the street maybe getting busted shed tough it out until he came around trueheart raised his hands again baxter simply kicked him lightly shook his head uhuh he whispered shes in the zone eight transmissions came in during the last three days neither of them answered they were all for greene she wouldnt be interested in playing his admin at some point this afternoon she gets up maybe she wants to go out look for some action maybe she goes to the bedroom but hes locked the door asshole her clothes are in there how shes supposed to go out if she cant get her clothes slick up some she wants him to open the door open the goddamn door but he doesnt she kicks at it bruises her toes pisses her off bumps it a couple times with her left hip bruises that some too fuck him she could see it almost feel the girls edgy frustration all buzzed up and nowhere to go she heads into the kitchen looking for something sweet you get a sweet attack with jazz gets herself some ice cream and feeling put out writes asshole on the counter in chocolate sauce she turns around and there he is he looks bad really bad his nose is bleeding his eyes are red his breath is horrible and the rest of him smells like a sewer doesnt look like hes changed out of his underwear in days if he thinks shes going to do him now he is so wrong she brought the kitchen of the condo back into her head white and silver and red from the blood she says something something a teenager thinks is clever and cutting he hits her hits a good one across the face knocks her back so she bangs her head on the autochef drops her bowl of ice cream it hurts she hit her head hard enough to break the skin enough to leave some skin and hair on the door of the autochef it blurs her vision for a second and scares her but not as much as seeing greene take the knife the big silver knife out of the block he slashes at her she throws her hands up and the knife slices across both her palms she tries to run and the blood from her hands splatters on the white wall then from her shoulder probably her shoulder as he swipes at her again he doesnt hack no down strokes in that room just those long sweeping slashes left to right right to left shes screaming begging crying trying to run get away but those swipes keep catching her the back the buttocks the shoulders again through the dining alcove he opens her up good there hits an artery and the blood starts spurting shes dead then she doesnt know it she still thinks she can get away she makes it to the living area before she goes down on that white rug crawls a few inches then he starts hacking jesus mcnab said softly prayerlike he doesnt know who she is doesnt care eves face was stonecold as she stared at the screen shes stopped screaming but his head wont he throws the goodie bowl smashes the screen shoves at tables stabs the sofa a few times he has to stop the pain he goes back in the bedroom but he cant stand it he shoves open the terrace doors hes still got the knife and he looks like hes been painted red he screams and screams at the air traffic at the street below at his neighbor who comes out on her terrace two apartments down she runs back in locks herself in and calls the cops by then its all over bedroom terrace view she ordered he was lying on his back and looked like a man whod been swimming in a river of blood hed plunged the knife into his own heart got your timing wanting to stay with the action in the lab mcnab set up in a corner he liked listening to the familiar language of compujocks as feeney and jamie debated the next level or when roarke weighed in with an opinion they were close he knew they were right on the verge of duplicating the virus once they had it they could fight it eve walked over to him she wasnt sure why shed come into the lab the last place she was needed unless it was to get away from her own thoughts heres our girl he continued taping the image onscreen coming in with greene doorman had it she doesnt show before this time and date perv rubs her ass as they walk in hes old enough to be her father she walked in of her own free will eve studied the girls face the suggestive smirk the glittering eyes oh yeah she thought figured you knew the score you didnt know a damn thing yeah well doesnt make him less a perv she pops in and out never see her before noon when she makes the daylight appearances shes back before nightfall usually has a couple bags with her highend stores he must foot the bill for the shopping shes thinking shes got a good thing going hmm they go out together yeah he zipped through the disc jumped up for a night out look halfbuzzed already all duded out up till the six days prior to implosion they went out every night we got three visitors during the time frame all male he keyed in to the view outside greenes condo this first one goes in stays sixteen minutes bet the contents of his briefcase switched during that little social call time to test the merchandise and count the money eve agreed do we know if illegals was tracking this guy dont can unconsciously mcnab flexed his fingers working on the tingle that hadnt quite faded i got some contacts there far as i can tell the perv skimmed the line kept legitimate business avenues open didnt deal too heavy second visitor different deal stayed ninetyeight minutes no bag eve studied the second man entering exiting sex she said flatly what about the third fortyminute stay carried a disc bag in and out likes his sex on vids i guess i know this guy i know him tripps deals bootlegged vids has a few runners on the street yeah i know him ill tap him if i need to see if he can draw me a picture run the other faces for id in case we need them eve saw him massaging his right thigh as he set up for the search no not now mornings soon enough pack it in for the night why dont you and peabody go use the pool or something or just get out for a while yeah taking pity on the recovering crip grab it while you can pal it wont last he grinned i wouldnt mind a little club action some music not up to dancing yet you know what would really do it virtual club scene if we could use the holoroom if youre going to program in some perverted sexual fantasy i dont want to hear about it mums the word she went back to her own office and spent the next hour dissecting nick greenes life college man a business major whod started picking up trouble in his teens minor possession fines criminal trespass bootlegging vids always the entrepreneur she thought it had paid off for a while classy park avenue digs closet full of snazzy designer duds she frowned as she continued through his financials hed garaged two highend vehicles and had kept a third and a watercraft stored at his weekend place in the hamptons he had art and jewelry insured in excess of three million doesnt add up she went to the link and beeped roarke i need you to look at something in my office he came in looking mildly irritated if you want the job done lieutenant you have to let me do it i need your expert opinion on something else look at these assets reported income debits give me your take she had the numbers onscreen and paced the office while roarke studied them obviously someone didnt report all their income thats shocking ditch the sarcasm how much in excess of this could you make from a midlevel illegals business running a few unlicensed whores dealing some porn vids a little sex brokering ive decided to be flattered rather than insulted that you assumed id know of such matters depends of course on the overhead youd have to buy or cook the illegals before you could sell them outfit and maintain the prostitutes generate the vids then theres the outlay for bribes security employees if you were good at it had a steady clientele youd pull in two or three million in profit still doesnt add up he kept it small exclusive you dont get busted as hard or as often if you keep it low profile so say you add the three million to what he reported last year that keeps him under five million you could live real comfortable on that some could are we done now no youve got five million to play with look at his clothing expenditures last year stifling impatience roarke scanned the data she shot onscreen so he wasnt a snappy dresser but he was closet full of designer labels had to have a hundred pairs of shoes since i live with someone with the same baffling addiction i can recognize the pricey stuff there was an easy million in the closet probably more he prefers paying cash then roarke said but he was becoming interested despite himself okay subtract a million from the five he has art and baubles insured for over three one rarely buys all their baubles in a single year yeah but therere appraisals for over threequarters of a million last year no debit entries cash again subtract another seventyfive vid equipment insured for one point five mil two new cams on the list last year to the tune of half a mil two garaged vehicles in the city annual for thats what two three thousand a month each ones a xrz new last september what do they run ah two hundred k if he got it loaded threebedroom condo on park annuals about the same as the car right he was doing the math in his head close enough then you add a fivebedroom beach house in the hamptons the slip fee for his watercraft whats that run him near a million okay you add in he goes out dining and debauchering almost nightly basic living expenses over that what do you get either im well off on the estimate of his business profit or he had another source of income another source she hitched a hip onto her desk follow me here you got an underground business that caters to fairly exclusive clientele some of whom might blush if their little hobby came out in the light youve got expensive taste and your business does pretty good but hell you want better what do you do blackmail and we have a winner all right so he ran a shakedown on the side a profitable one by all accounts what does that have to do with the matter at hand the matter at hand is homicide its a purity hit and its connected but you still run it by the numbers he might have kept his blackmail data in a safebox if he did hed keep it close to home easy access we can check the banks and depositories but maybe he kept them even closer to home im going to go check out his place again want company two could toss it faster than one he thought she was wasting her time and his but he supposed the cop in her needed to snip off any loose ends and hed had no intention of letting her go back alone to a place that had taunted her nightmares he waited until she bypassed the police seal uncoded the locks the air still carried death it was the first thing that struck him when he stepped in beside her the raw pitiably human stench of it lingered under the odor of chemicals used by the crime scene team and sweepers red stains splatters streams were a virulent horror over the white walls carpet furniture he could see where the girl had fallen could see where she had crawled where she had died christ how do you face it how do you look at this and not break because its there whether you look or not and if you break youre done he touched her arm he hadnt realized hed spoken aloud did you need to see this again to face this again to prove you could maybe but if that was all idve come on my own second bedroom and the office are over there we went through the place thoroughly on the first sweep but we werent looking for a hideyhole now we do she put roarke in the second bedroom and started on the office herself theyd taken the data and communication center away had gone over the work area through the closet where greene had kept his extra supplies she did it all again point by point there was a safe one of the crime scene techs had run his scanner over it tagged the combination shed found nothing unexpected in it some cash disc documents a little paperwork not enough cash she thought now not nearly enough if three clients had come by in the last few days at least two of them when greenes symptoms would have been increasing where was the payoff would he have sent wade out with cash to tuck it into a safebox she didnt think so you might bang a teenager sell her off to clients but you didnt put cash in her hand and wave byebye she took two paintings and a sculpture off the wall searched behind them for panels bedrooms clean roarke told her hes got another safe hes got a hole this is the logical place the office is the logical place maybe its too logical first place you looked isnt it she stopped scooting along the baseboard and sat back on her heels okay if this was your place wheres your stash if i liked combining business and pleasure as it appeared he did the master bedroom okay lets try it she led the way then stood in the doorway with him scanning the room money doesnt always buy taste does it darling he shook his head at the black and red decor a bit obvious for a passion den he wandered to the closet opened it well here at least he showed some level of class very nice fabrics yeah and he died in his underwear just goes to show just what does the city do with this sort of thing the clothes if he doesnt have family heirs that kind of thing theyre donated to shelters he pressed the button that had the first tier of suits revolving to reveal the second the sidewalk sleepers are going to be better dressed this year he moved the second tier aside studied the wall of shoes to his right smiled here you have it have what give us a minute he said running his fingertips along shelves under them ah here we are lets see he depressed a small lever the lower third of the shelves swung slowly open he crouched heres your hideyhole lieutenant and your second safe she was already breathing down his neck can you open it would that be a rhetorical question he chuckled just open the damn thing he drew the jammer hed taken from jamie out of his pocket well this is why youre the cop and im not because you can pop a safe no i could teach you to do it quick enough even without this handy little toy because i thought you were wasting time coming back here tonight you still think im wasting time i suppose i do but youve found your safe the display on the jammer began to flash numbers zipping by in a blur then a series of them locked on the safe hummed once then clicked abracadabra roarke stated and opened it now thats more like it hunkered down beside him eve studied the neat stacks of cash this is how he stayed out of a cage so long no credit no etransfers cash on the line and a file box loaded with discs and vids best of all roarke reached in took out a ppc his personal palm very likely uninfected and chockfull of interesting data lets load it up get it in she pulled out her memo book whatre you doing logging the entry i better not see any of that green stuff or those baubles go into your pockets ace now im offended he straightened brushed at his shirt if i nipped anything you can bet your ass you wouldnt see me do it chapter eve started running the discs as soon as she got back into her office she set the ones labeled financials and bookkeeping aside they could wait she passed the ppc onto roarke to take to the lab for testing in short order she found herself listening to what had been greenes daily journal he mentioned clients but always by initials or an obvious nickname lardbutt had made his monthly payment gg had begged for another extension he made entries on shopping on the club scene on sexual exploits they were all recorded in a tone of disdainful humor and derision greene had despised the people hed served so hed blackmailed them eve mused squeezing them until hed eventually become them wealthy bored and perverted brought home a nice piece of ass today he noted on the day hed hooked up with hannah wade ive been watching her for a few days she hangs around the clubs targets her mark and talks him into getting her in straight up to a privacy room most times when shes done she cruises the club looking for action i decided to give her some ive got clients wholl pay top for a session with this little number she knows the score figure ill keep her up here a couple weeks enjoy the fringe benefits class her up some outfit her right she could pass for about fourteen hcs been asking for some new young meat i just brought home the cow creep eve said aloud and ran through the weeks journal she hit the next level two days after hed brought wade home fucking headache fucking headache all day zoner barely touches it got meetings today cant miss told gg to come up with payment plus penalty by tomorrow or her loving husbands going to get a delivery wonder how hell feel about seeing his wife do the nasty with a st bernard assholes she tries to screw me over shell be sorry there was more of the same over the next three days increasingly angry entries full of vague threats complaints frustration he talked about the headaches and for the first time mentioned a nosebleed on the day before his death the disc was full of weeping of pounding as if he were beating a fist against the wall trying to screw me over everybodys trying to screw me over ill kill them first kill them locked her out locked the little bitch out she thinks i dont know oh god oh god oh god my head she put something in my head cant let her see cant let anybody see stay inside safe inside i gotta sleep i gotta sleep make it go away lock it up i have to lock everything up tight she wont get whats mine little whorebitch eve filed the disc walked into the kitchen for coffee then she just pulled open the terrace doors and breathed it was easy to see how greenes infection had progressed paranoia anger fear the symptoms had started shortly after hed installed wade in the condo so hed believed she was responsible for them in his sick way hed killed her in selfdefense she got her coffee went back to her desk to make notes then though her head was buzzing with a combination of caffeine fatigue and stress she started on the videos it was clear how greene bumped his income up several brackets the videos were not only technically welldone but showed a strangely creative sense of theater if you liked your entertainment raw and perverse still at it roarke walked in headed straight into the kitchen without glancing at the screen will you have some wine now oh yeah i could use a drink ive sent the others on their way youll have your little nightcap here lieutenant then im going to he trailed off as he came back with two glasses of wine what was playing onscreen had even his jaded eyes widening what is that a small bear no i think its a really big dog a st bernard he took a sip of wine walked closer i believe youre right someone should report this activity to the animal rights league or whatever it is although hmmm he certainly seems to be enjoying himself if the size of his mother of god gimme that wine she grabbed it drank deep theres sick and theres sick this one goes off the scale ive got no term for it you recognize the woman romping with fido its a bit hard to tell under the circumstances greene lists her as gg i ran an image search on her while she was rubbing butter all over herself to help get fido in the game gretta gowan wife of jonah gowan thats professor jonah gowan of nyu hes head of the sociology department a staunch conservative party member and a methodist deacon want to bet clarissa price took some of his classes never bet against the house roarke declared fascinated despite himself with the onscreen action she recruited him into purity or he did her id bet on that one anyway gretta there is the mother of two and whoa that is just nasty gretta chairs several committees including the garden club which would no doubt frown on her deep affection for canines theres a log entry on the ppc its clean by the way for gg six thousand paid in six days before the murders fits with his journal this vid wasnt done at his place eve said some of the others ive viewed were he used the second bedroom theyre tamer than this group sex with costumes bondage and roleplaying one used a teenaged girl i ran her image too she popped as another runaway greene knew how to sniff them out copy disc log to file roarke let out a long breath how about we run a nice classic comedy to cleanse the palate i want to finish this tonight at least get the ids for what purpose eve to know for one thing she filed the disc selected another and second to see if i find a link do you really think terrorists are killing all these people so they can get rid of a blackmailer no but i think each one of the victims was carefully selected and with greene the blackmail was part of it maybe just a bonus but part of it run disc you dont have to stay for this if you can stomach it i can home again eve said recognizing the bedroom in greenes condo my guess is he rigged the cameras before the client came in ran them by remote until the session was over did the editing made a copy gives that to the client with a demand for payments probably lost clients that way but he kept the income no overhead at all just pure profit here we go curtain up a woman stepped in from the adjoining bath a rather elegant woman in a killer black dress with long lush waves of icy blonde hair spilling over the shoulders her legs were sheathed in black hose her feet tucked into milehigh heels she wore a diamond choker and her lips were bloodymurder red looks familiar eve began which is she client or hooker want an image search let it run awhile first a man stepped in from the outer door he was stripped to the waist bulging in tight black leather his chest gleamed with oil his hair was slicked back from a striking face sharp of bone there was a tattoo under his left nipple when eve froze and enhanced the image she saw it was a tiny skull he ran a slim riding crop through his fingers roseanna he spoke the name and the woman lifted a hand to the diamond choker at her throat how did you get in roleplaying eve said we run a search on both of them she froze the disc again blocked faces started the task eve hmm take a good look at her i am i know that face continue disc play with a halfsmile on his face roarke leaned against the desk take a better look frowning eve watched the scene play out the man ran the riding crop down the womans center she shuddered she turned as if to run he dragged her back long sloppy kiss lots of hands hands eve straightened with a snap thats not a woman distracted eve watched the barechested man yank the dress down to the blondes waist beneath was a black lace waist cincher though the breasts that spilled over it were full and lush eve had no doubt they were just another part of the costume the man dealt a couple of sharp slaps to the buttocks when his partner struggled there was moaning now breathy protests the dress spilled to the floor looks pretty good for a guy eve observed the legs were slim set off with thighhigh black hose oldfashioned garters too much shoulder though she mused and the hands were too big she could see the hint of an adams apple beneath the glittering choker in her mind she erased the wig the red lips the heavily accented eyes and tried to see beneath the female artifice she knew that face and when it filled the screen flushed with excitement as the camera zoomed it she heard the click oh good god did you make him im not quite there yet give me another minute but when the barechested man pushed his captive down to the knees exposed himself roarke winced never mind as id soon skip this part it doesnt ah well he blew out a breath as the face filled the screen again another angle as the eyes crystal blue stared upfull of hunger yes indeed id as soon skip watching his honor the mayor give leather boy a blow job he turned away from the screen caught eves chin in his hand thats why youre the cop all right you werent wasting anyones time thatll teach me to doubt you i have to watch the rest of it must you i take this in tomorrow i have to know what im dealing with this isnt your average transvestite this tosses peachtree right into the middle of a sex scandal and a major homicide investigation then im getting another drink he took her glass for both of us smart she said later greene caters to a small clientele rich with whacked whims out of that exclusive club he handpicks a smaller group a handful of people whove used his services built a certain level of trust in him who cant afford even a whiff of scandal the payments are high but none of them too high for these select few to afford you got an even dozen paying out an average fee of twentyfive thousand a month you rake in an extra three million six annually nobodys squeezed so hard theyll pop and you live in luxury and from what i can tell from his records most he was blackmailing continued as clients the devil you know roarke decided are you putting the mayor in purity i dont know but ive sure got enough to ask him about it dont i youll be putting your hand in the fire lieutenant yeah i got that too she pinched the bridge of her nose to relieve the pressure of a building headache has to be on a needtoknow media gets a whiff of the scent its a disaster shit i voted for the guy he mightve gotten more votes yet if hed campaigned in that little black dress very attractive roarke only grinned when she stared at him id say its time for bed were tired you start talking about guys in black dresses looking pretty youre more than tired pal i said attractive he corrected and i meant the dress i wouldnt mind seeing you in one of those corsets with spiked heels and little garters yeah she yawned as they rode to the bedroom you hold your breath on that one she was in bed in five minutes asleep in ten when the dream started she didnt know a white room washed with blood she could see herself walking through it her boots splashed with red as she stepped in grisly puddles even in sleep she could smell it the girl was facedown on white carpet thick with red blood her arm was stretched out fingers spread as if she reached for something but nothing was there the knife was there in the dream she crouched down picked up the knife by the hilt she felt the slick warm wetness that ran from it onto her hand when she looked it wasnt the girl now but a baby hardly more than a baby cut to pieces curled up tight her eyes were like a dolls staring she remembered she remembered such a little thing so much blood for such a little body and the man whod done it the father mad on zeus the baby screaming screaming as eve had charged up the stairs too late shed been too late to save the baby killed the father but lost the child she hadnt saved them the baby the girl and their blood was on her hands the knife gleamed over her fingers the room wasnt white any longer it was small and duty and cold so cold the red washed in from the light through the window over her hands little hands now on the hilt of a knife when he walked in the door the red light bounced off his face like a shadow of the blood yet to be spilled eve roarke gathered her close holding tight when she struggled her skin was iced as she wept in her sleep it tore his heart to pieces eve wake up come back now just a dream he pressed his lips to her brow her cheeks just a dream kill the father save the child ssh he ran his hands soothingly over her back under the old white shirt she favored for sleeping im here with you youre safe so much blood god he sat up with her held her in his lap and rocked her in the dark im all right she turned her face into his shoulder somehow just the scent of him could center her sorry im okay im not so you can hold on to me awhile she slid her arms around his waist something about hannah wade the way the way she died it reminded me of this little girl baby really the little girl whose father ripped her up i got there too late yes i remember it was just before we met she haunts me i couldnt save her couldnt get to her in time and i think that maybe if you hadnt come into my life right after thats the one that mightve broken me but she haunts me roarke a little ghost to add to all the others to add to myself you remember her eve he brushed his lips over her hair perhaps youre the only one who does in the morning she got up early enough to do a hard sweaty workout then took a long swim she beat off the fatigue and the vague nagging hangover from the nightmare and because she knew hed keep at her until she gave in anyway she sat down in the sitting area of the bedroom and ate the oatmeal roarke ordered for her but she cast a suspicious eye on the milky liquid in the glass beside her coffee whats that a protein drink i dont need a protein drink im eating the stupid oatmeal arent i youll have both he stroked a hand over galahads head then gave his attention to eve rather than the morning financials scrolling by onscreen theyll offset the candy bar you probably plan to have for lunch you didnt sleep well ive got a lot on my mind how come you dont have to have a protein drink he forked up a section of grapefruit cant abide the stuff and im not the one whos going to have to deal with the mayor today yeah i have to get started on that im sure hell find it an even more unpleasant way to start his day than you do yours drink up lieutenant she scowled but drank she was actually starting to like whatever he dumped in those mixes this data doesnt go to the rest of the team yet i have to report it to whitney probably tibble and wont that be fun we should have your virus fully idd today youre closing in ive been thinking about that too she looked toward the data center ive been making plenty of noise theyll know ive got some solid leads now could they dump that virus in this system here this systems security is a great deal more complex than what youll find on other home systems galahad inched toward the table the plates roarke merely gave him one cool look the cat shot up a leg and began to wash as if that had been the plan all along and ive taken separate precautions he continued based on the shield weve been working on in the lab i cant give you a hundred percent guarantee but unless they upgrade and modify what theyve used to date no they cant infect this system let me take it in another direction if there was an attempt to infect can you rig some alarm some detector whatever to alert us to it maybe track the source you interest me lieutenant ive already started working on that it cant be done with any real success until we complete the full id but your lab rats have been devising some creative options jamies particularly skilled in this area i swear if the boy wasnt determined to be you hed make his first billion before well before i made mine if you could track it from this system would you be able to track it back from one of the infected units she saw the look on his face okay so im one step behind the master geek plan you get me that today i might just dig up a pair of garters i want the corset too and the shoes you get me a source location you get the shoes im really starting to like this job you have to wear the shoes the whole time we lets not push it pal she rose im going to make this call from my office she closed her door though she wasnt sure of whitneys schedule she assumed he was already on the way in from westchester she tried his car link and didnt mind admitting to herself that shed timed it so she didnt have to tag him at home and chance dealing with his wife whitney sir theres been a development in the investigation that requires your attention and i believe chief tibbles what development i dont believe i can discuss this over link commander my judgment puts this at code five she saw his eyes narrow code five meant complete madia block and all departmental records would be sealed during the investigation are you at your home office yes sir i can be at central in no the chief is closer to you than downtown for that matter at this point so am i ill contact him expect us within thirty minutes yes sir has your team been informed of this development no sir just the expert consultant who was working with me when this new development surfaced keep it that way for now out even as the screen blanked there was a quick knock on her door nadine burst in damn it nadine when i close a door its because i want it closed i dont have time for the media go away dont be so hasty she closed the door at her back then crossing the room at a clip tossed a disc to eve i went to a lot of trouble to get that to you and i dont want anyone to know you got it from me why and what is it why because it could be perceived as taking media police relations one step too far ive a strong feeling the bosses at would think so what it is is a copy of the home vid bought after what im told was a rapid and lively negotiation from a tourist a tourist who was taking a spin on an airtram when nick greene ran out on his balcony theyre going to air at nine sharp i wanted to give you a heads up channel is going to air a guy killing himself im not saying i approve im not saying i disapprove this hits at nine its going to be big what i will say for your ears only is i disapprove of going public with it without informing the police first the vid doesnt change the outcome the investigation but i dont like the way it might stir up more support for purity so im giving you time to structure a response have you looked at this eve held up the disc i ran it on my way over its grim its ugly and it makes greene look like a monster its going to be easy to look at it and think thank god hes dead give me the name of the tourist i cant do it she pushed impatiently at her mane of hair dallas even if i knew i couldnt do it a source is a source is this your story no then hes not your source nadine shook her head ill only go so far over same as you if youre thinking this guy was a plant i dont see how he couldve been but ill look into it i will promise if i smell a setup ill spill satisfied eve nodded tell me one thing how much they shell out for this dallas off the record nadine for both of us im just curious one cool mil for twenty seconds of feed i guess he really hit the jackpot i know you didnt have to do this i wont forget it so you owe me one i dont like to owe somethings going to bust she said after a moment likely within the next day or two dont bother to ask any questions i wont answer when it goes down and im cleared to talk about it ill give you an exclusive within an hour after it goes down i cant promise that at the first possible opportunity good enough ive got to go and i was never here when the door was closed again eve slid in the new disc ordered a run she saw greenes balcony saw the door swing open he came out fast he came out bloody the image bobbled as the operator jerked at what he saw through his viewer and she heard his gasping oath but he was cool enough to zoom in yes he looked like a monster eve thought blood literally dripping from his fingers his hair his mouth was wide his eyes wild and red as a demons he hacked at the air with the knife beat a fist against his own head he raced from one end of the terrace to the other batting at the air as if swatting at insects then gripping the knife in both hands he threw back his head and plunged it into his own chest holy shit jamie stood in the doorway leading to roarkes office his jaw was slack his gaze riveted to eves view screen goddamn it end run that door was closed sorry roarke asked me to i was just getting something for him and wanted to ask you doesnt matter he took a steadying breath scrubbed the back of his hand over his mouth thats the guy from yesterday right yesterdays homicide you should be in the lab im part of this team his chin came up my grandfather was a cop and im going to be one ive seen blood before i killed a man shut up she snapped it out striding over to close the door behind him theres an official report with my name on it that states alban was killed during the struggle to disarm and arrest you want to fuck me over jamie you keep saying you killed a man i wouldnt do anything to mess you up something of what he felt for her the core of love he tried to bury under a blanket of teenaged cool surfaced on his face id never do that dallas because she saw it she eased back before it embarrassed them both okay this is between you and me i know you kept me out of the briefing yesterday and i can figure why you didnt think i should see something like that he nodded toward the screen the new guy trueheart hes what three years older than me maybe four whats the difference hes wearing a uniform so will i she studied his face something in those gray eyes was already halfcop yeah yeah you will look im not saying you cant handle yourself theres a lot of bad shit out there you see too much of it too soon it can swallow you up before you get started ive already seen a lot of it theres more thats just as bad theres more thats worse you get through the academy you put on the uniform thats soon enough to start dealing with it okay now scram and do me a favor ive got a meeting a private meeting in a few minutes keep everyone the hell out of here sure he grinned and looked terrifyingly young truehearts got a little thing for you get out as he laughed she gave him a shove and shut the door in his face she went back to her desk copied the disc for her files then sealed the other for her commander she took the rest of the time to update her evidence log sealed that as well then organized her thoughts at the knock on her door she took a deep breath and rose to open it for the citys two top cops chapter during the course of investigating the greene wade homicides eve began i found greenes financials didnt jibe with his lifestyle even assuming a substantial unreported income through his alleged dealings in illegals and sexual services purchases and other assets accumulated over the previous year far exceeded any projected monies you assumed he had another source whitney put in yes sir during the initial search and sweep of the premises lieutenant tibble held up a hand to stop her is there a reason youre taking us down the long road here i think my findings in this matter are going to require a solid foundation fine but theres no need for the formalities just lay it out yes sir we found a safe when we did the first pass there wasnt enough in it as review of the security tapes showed us three probable deals going down in his digs during the last week he didnt go out himself so he wouldnt have made any deposits the guy dealt in cash primarily no way hes going to hand his take over to a teenager he found in a club and trust her to dump it into his safebox or dummy account had to be another cache in his place just like there had to be another source of income given the type of clientele he serviced blackmail seemed the most logical sideline you felt this assumed sideline connected with purity tibble asked her its not enough to connect to investigate the big picture each case has to be handled individually by the numbers or you miss details tibble nodded since were here i assume you didnt miss the details i returned to greenes condo with the civilian consultant we located the second safe i logged those contents at that time and have updated the log as i reviewed those contents it contained eight hundred and sixtyfive thousand in cash a code for a safebox at the security national bank th street branch five data discs and twelve video discs she gestured to her desk all contents are logged and sealed as is my record of their confiscation from the safe since youre being very cautious lieutenant those contents must be hot she met whitneys eyes they are the data discs contain his underground books he kept good records they also contain his daily journals his deterioration from the infection is well documented on them demonstrating increasing pain paranoia anger and confusion and the vids tibble said blackmail yes sir i did id search and matches on the individuals recorded by greene theres little doubt they were unaware they were being recorded during their activities as said activities were extremely graphic in nature some of the recordings take place at an as yet unknown location others in the spare bedroom at greenes condo on those vids are a number of very prominent citizens recorded in compromising illegal and or embarrassing sexual situations among them are a criminal court judge the wife of a college professor and vocal conservative party supporter who i believe i can and will connect to clarissa price a wellknown media personality and the mayor of new york oh christ tibble stared for a full five seconds then pressed his fingers to his temples this is a confirmed id on peachtree yes sir i recognized him but followed up with an image scan then its a fucking mess he dropped his hands all right the idiot cheated on his wife and got recorded sir its a little more involved than straight adultery spell it out dallas whitney said impatiently were grownups here he was dressed in womens clothes and had a sweaty sexual session with another man which included a little dominance and punishment and um oral gratification and consummation it just gets better and better as if tired tibble sat back rested his head on the cushion of his chair as he studied the ceiling mayor steven peachtree is a transvestite who was being blackmailed by a sex and illegals broker whos now dead and whose death was precipitated by a terrorist organization now responsible for seven murders in a nutshell eve agreed the media gets a hold of this he shook his head pushed to his feet he paced to her window its over for him one way or the other even the talented chang wont be able to spin him out of the toilet the citys in enough of an uproar without this we keep it quiet for now i need to interview him chief as well as the other individuals on vid tibble looked over his shoulder studied her face you believe peachtree is involved in purity the mayor setting a terrorist organization loose on his own city he may have shown extremely poor judgment in a personal matter but hes not stupid enough to piss in his own pool why not she thought you use a sex broker to fulfill your dreamdate fantasy youre stupid enough for anything i cant make that determination until after hes interviewed you want to drag him into a major homicide investigation because he wore a goddamn bra she felt her patience drying up hulling out like a grape in the sun sir i dont care if he dresses up like a shepherdess and seduces his flock on his downtime unless doing so puts him into my case its my allegation as primary in this matter that purity has people of power authority and influence among their members my request for a warrant to open sealed juvenile files has been blocked and continues to be blocked beyond all reasonable objections warrants to view files at child services have also been blocked or denied these blocks impede the forward course of my investigation you found a way around them with dukes she took a deep breath yes sir i did and ill continue to find ways around them seven people including a police officer are dead ill continue to find a way until i have the answers and justice is served the mayor of new york is now a suspect in this investigation whether it suits you or not chief tibble whitney got to his feet very nearly gave into the urge to step between them like a referee at a boxing match lieutenant dallas is right tibble swung his searing gaze onto whitney do you think i dont know shes right for christs sake jack ive carried tin longer than shes been alive i know shes right i also know well be digging ourselves out of the fallout for months once this hits transvestite terrorist sweet jesus can you imagine what the media will do with it the media doesnt concern me tibble turned to eve if you want to climb up the ladder it better youd be wearing bars now if you paid more attention to perception and image youve made choices that have prevented you from being the youngest female captain in the nypsd harry tibble waved off whitneys quiet objection turned away again ill apologize for that this has blindsided me i work with the man i cant say were friends but were certainly friendly i know his family i believed i knew him id like some coffee black no sugar if you dont mind eve said nothing didnt trust herself to speak instead she walked into the kitchen programmed the autochef while temper warred with training they could take their captains bars and shove them she came back in as tibble was once again facing the window she set his coffee on her desk then handed whitney a second cup am i ordered to ignore the evidence that has come into my hands and detour from the investigative route that leads to mayor steven peachtree i have no doubt lieutenant tibble said with his back to the room that were i to issue that order you would disobey said command or throw your badge in my face as i believe youre angry enough at the moment to choose the latter ill apologize once again i had no right to personalize this nor to take my frustrations out on you i will say there are shades of right lieutenant dallas and the higher you climb the more shades there are and the deeper they get im aware of the difficulty of the situation and your position chief tibble but mostly you think its bullshit he spread his lips in the grin that had terrified both cop and criminal over the years he walked over picked up his coffee and drank and mostly youre right no lieutenant you are not ordered to ignore the evidence that came into your hands without thinking he sat behind her desk i am asking you to delay that interview until i speak with the mayor any portion of the conversation that is salient to your investigation will be relayed to you its not just the man but the office the office requires some respect and protection i hope you can trust me to separate man from office and conduct this preliminary questioning personally i believe youre more than capable of handling such questioning sir how do you want me to handle the other individuals identified on the videos discreetly i need copies of those vids your notes and files i have them available for you he took the evidence bag she offered jack it looks like were going to start the day with some porn i ended mine with it eve said and made tibble roar with laughter jobs never dull how much am i cleared to tell my team trust is a twoway street i leave that to you he rose if peachtrees part of this well take him down you have my word on it he held out a hand well take them all down sir youve got mine on that after theyd left eve called peabody into her office sit down she ordered then as tibble had done she took the position of command behind her desk new data has come to light that may have a direct bearing on this investigation im not free to share all the details of this data with you at this time but youll be accompanying me today on what will be a number of sensitive interviews until i give you clearance youre to say nothing of this to other team members youre not bringing the team in not at this time this is code five any record i order you to make will be sealed peabody choked back the dozen questions leaping to her tongue yes sir before we start on this new round of interviews well do a followup with dukes he needs a push and i figure to round off the day with price and dwier like i dont know bookends is whats between the bookends connected to the whole its all connected ill fill you in as much as im able on the way to the dukes blackmail peabody said at the first stoplight on route greene sure had his fingers in a lot of nasty pies lucrative pies raked in over three million annually with this scam you think purity infected him because of the blackmail yeah i do look at the others those were child predators greene he dealt some in the adolescent arena but the bulk of his clientele and employees were adults you said you thought purity would start expanding their criteria and they will not this soon there are plenty more in fitzhughs ilk to keep them busy greene teeters on the line i think someone maybe more than one had personal reasons for wanting greene dead eliminating another scumbag was a factor but ditching a blackmail payment and the threat of exposure makes a real nice bonus but it was stupid a mistake killing the blackmailer before you destroy the evidence that ties you to him can you tell me if dukes was on the blackmail list no but he knows how its done he knows whos been infected or scheduled for infection hes part of the foundation so we shake him or his wife shes a weak point you think shell roll on him she might if shes scared enough shes not a player but she knows dukes his schedule his habits how else could she tailor the household to suit him and if he thinks were pushing her he might get pissed enough to slip up hes got a hot button eve hunted up a parking spot then jaywalked diagonally across the street toward the dukess residence the first thing she noticed were the wilted flowers by the door theyre gone peabody followed the direction of eves cold stare maybe she forgot to water them no she wouldnt forget probably has a daily duty list damn it damn it she rang the buzzer anyway waited rang again curtains are still at the windows peabody craned her neck to see inside furnitures still in there they left it got out fast they were probably packed and gone within twentyfour hours of our first visit she started working the street knocking on doors until one opened for her she offered her badge to a snowyhaired woman in a pink tracksuit is something wrong has there been an accident my husband no maam nothings wrong im sorry to alarm you im looking for some of your neighbors the dukes they dont answer their door the dukes she patted her hair as if to stir her thoughts im not sure i oh of course of course i saw the story on the media report oh dear youre the policewoman theyre going to sue i dont believe any legal action has been taken as yet do you know where they are goodness i dont really know them pretty young woman id see her walking to the market every monday and thursday ninethirty you could set your wrist unit by her but now that you mention it i dont know the last time they lost their older son didnt they they only moved in two years ago i never knew a thing about it they didnt really talk to any of the neighbors some people never do its a terrible terrible thing to lose a child yes maam id see him come and go now and then didnt look like a very kind sort of man on sundays theyd all go out together ten oclock sharp to church i imagine from the way they were dressed back by twelvethirty you never saw the boy playing outside with other children i never saw another child go into that house she sighed staring across the street now i suppose they kept him close afraid something would happen to him too hold on theres nita coming out my jogging partner she waved wildly at the woman who came out of a building directly across the street she too wore a tracksuit in powder blue nita doesnt miss a trick the other woman said out of the corner of her mouth you ask her about them getting yourself arrested nita said cheerfully when she joined them better lock her up tight officer sals a slippery one well talk about slippery later sal told her theyre asking about the dukes two doors down from you they went on a trip a couple days ago loaded up the car with suitcases wife wasnt too happy about it if you ask me shed been crying that wouldve been let me think wednesday wednesday morning bright and early i was out front watering my pots when i saw them loading up did you notice anyone visiting them prior to that saw you nita said with a grin the morning before got the commandant pretty stirred up from what i saw onscreen later nita oh stop fussing sal i didnt like the man and im not afraid to say so out loud she waved a hand and settled herself in as if for a nice friendly chat i had an old cocker spaniel old frankie died last year a few months before i was out walking him like i did every day twice a day stopped in front of the dukes place for a minute to talk to a neighbor who was out walking too and well old frankie did his business there on the edge of their property while i wasnt watching she sighed one long expulsion of air old frankie now idve cleaned it up i cleaned up behind that dog for sixteen years but the commandant comes to the door and gives me whatfor says hes going to report me carries on so youd think hed never seen a little poop before well i gave him whatfor right back i dont take that kind of thing from anybody she huffed out a breath obviously still outraged he slams the door i pick up the poop finish walking old frankie and go home few minutes later the beat cops at my door young woman looked mortified told me dukes had called in a complaint can you imagine that since id already flushed away the evidence nothing came of it the cop just wanted to let me know he was seeing red said shed cooled him off but maybe it would be best all around if i made sure to keep the dog away from his property is that the only dealing you had with him never spoke another word to the man nor he to me they lost a child sal reminded her it can sour a person some are born sour nita nodded to the house across the street id say that man was eve conducted the first three interviews on greenes list in the privacy of each subjects home or office in each case there were varying degrees of denial outrage embarrassment and pleading and in the case of judge vera archer a cold acceptance id prefer to continue this discussion without the presence of your uniform lieutenant dallas peabody wait outside archer folded her hands on her desk her chambers was a streamlined organized space that suited her image she was a tall sternly attractive railthin woman of sixtythree with short straight dark hair she had a reputation for delivering swift and thorough decisions that rarely failed to hold up on appeal she brooked no theatrics in her courtroom apparently eve thought she enjoyed them in private on disc shed worn a pink ballgown and had performed a rather glamorous striptease down to gstring and pasties for two wellmuscled men as a prelude to a very athletic menage a trois i assumed id be dealing with this when i heard nick greene had been killed my private life isnt up for discussion no laws were broken by me other than those of common sense yet you paid nick greene seventyfive hundred dollars a month i did its not illegal to pay such a fee and if we determine it was blackmail the crime was his in extorting such a fee im not going to explain the contents of the disc nor the motivation behind those contents im entitled to my privacy yes your honor and you certainly paid enough for it however the contents of that disc and your payments are now part of a homicide investigation archers gaze never wavered i was better off with him alive i could afford the money a great deal more than i can afford the publicity from exposure the embarrassment to my robes my husband i made full disclosure of this matter to my husband nearly a year ago you can verify that if you deem it necessary but it is again a private matter i will tell you we agreed to continue the payments youre aware of the circumstances of nick greenes death i am while i sympathize with your desire for privacy your honor that sympathy doesnt extend over my pursuit of the terrorists who are responsible for his death and the death of six others to date and how will exposing the contents of that disc aid your pursuit i must have the respect of my courtroom when im on the bench you pursue you arrest but then its up to the courts to complete the cycle of justice how can i do that if im a laughingstock an embarrassment ill do whatever i can to protect your privacy tell me how you came to use nick greenes services archer rolled her lips inward into a nearly invisible line id heard about him through an acquaintance it seemed harmless and though his services were admittedly borderline i made use of them a release valve you could say from the pressures of the job i made use of them once a month for several months then he gave me a copy of the disc explained the payment schedule and the consequences of nonpayment all very reasonable and businesslike you must have been very angry i was angry more i felt like a fool a woman whos lived for more than sixty years sat on a bench for fourteen shouldnt be so easily duped i paid because one always pays for foolishness and i stopped using his services were you afraid he would expose you anyway she angled her head in mock surprise and cut off a small but steady income no did he ever up the payments or threaten to do so no in his way he was a good businessman if you bleed too fast and hard you eviscerate archer lifted her hands the only excess motion shed made throughout the interview i didnt even resent the payments they reminded me i was human which is why i used his services to begin with i needed to be reminded i was human youve done a background on me personal professional yes your honor an initial run ive served the law and served it well my record bears that out im not ready to retire she glanced over at the small viewing screen on her wall i saw the broadcast on this morning it was a vicious horrible death they chose for him he was a blackmailer and he peddled in what could be called sin certainly exploited peoples secret weaknesses but he didnt deserve to die as he did nor did that child she looked at eve again her gaze direct and level you suspect that i may be a part of these vigilantes calling themselves pure they stand for everything i abhor lieutenant everything ive dedicated my life to fighting against theyre bullies and cowards playing god im willing to waive legal representation at this time and submit to a truth test my conditions are that this be done privately by a single authorized and licensed technician and that when the results clear me of suspicion they as well as the disc and any files pertaining to me in this matter are sealed ill agree to those conditions and will arrange it i can ask dr mira to do the testing personally dr mira is acceptable i believe the results will put an end to your involvement in this matter your honor thank you can i ask your advice and opinion on another matter connected to my investigation yes i have requested warrants to open sealed files on juvenile victims that directly pertain to this case child services filed a tro blocking me from these records and from additional records of their agency the prosecutors office engaged in the standard legal wrangle over this the block remains sealeds particularly in the case of minors are sensitive issues so is serial homicide so is terrorism so is obstructing a priority investigation time is of the essence yet an essential tool is being held out of my reach this isnt a matter of opening sealeds to the public but to an investigator with probable cause if this matter was before you how would you rule archer leaned back is your probable cause solid lieutenant and dont jive with me its rock solid the tro argues that the sealeds must remain to protect the minors and their families from further distress to ensure their privacy the pa argues that probable cause in a homicide investigation supersedes and further argues that the contents of the sealeds will be known only to the investigative team if the arguments are as basic as that youd have your warrants in my court who signed the initial warrants judge matthews and hes subsequently held the sealeds no your honor the arguments are being presented to judge lincoln lincoln i see ill make a few inquiries eve left the courthouse with peabody beside her and took a moment in the air if shes not clean ive lost all sense of direction do we keep working down the list yeah we keep working it meanwhile do a run on judge lincoln another judge jeez hes not on greenes but hes on archers shes good eve said as she got into her vehicle but shes not that good i saw something on her face when i told her he was hearing the arguments over the sealeds frowning she pulled out her beeping pocket link dallas omalleys dwier said briskly twenty minutes come alone the blue squirrel eve returned wanting home field advantage fifteen she broke transmission eve didnt frequent the blue squirrel as often as she once had it was a joint with no redeeming qualities including the food and service during the day it catered to a handful of surly regulars and the occasional lost soul who was foolish enough to think he might scope out a cheap meal and a little action at night it was usually jammed with people who made the action and were tough enough or crazy enough to risk their lives for what passed for alcohol in such places the music was loud the tables small and rarely clean and the air generally permeated with bad booze and stale zoner eve had an odd affection for it and was pleased to find it hadnt changed since her last visit for a time mavis had been one of the featured performers whirling in costumes that defied description and screeching out her music to a packed dance floor where people actually seemed to understand it thinking of mavis eve wondered if impending motherhood would tone her down not a chance grab a table opposite side eve ordered peabody eat if you dare their soy fries are only halfbad ill risk it eve chose a table in the far comer slid in and decided peabody was right the fries were only halfbad and deserved another chance she keyed in an order on the menu and decided not to dance any closer to the edge by risking the coffee she opted for bottled water which she feared was bottled in one of the seamy back rooms by flatnosed men with hairy knuckles seeing no sign of dwier she pulled out her communicator and checked in with feeney whats the status nearly there there was a faint sheen of sweat on his brow and his hair was sticking out in tufts two hours well nail it whatre you working on in a couple of minutes lunch blue squirrel you walk on the dark side dallas yeah thats me got a meet with dwier he should be coming along shortly i think he wants to deal ill give him a damn deal feeney blew air out his nose you wanna tell me what the brass was doing here this morning cant i have to wait for some information bugs me feeney but i cant hooked a big fish didnt you kid no dont sweat it he said just remember some big fish got teeth im careful dwier just walked in later she pocketed the communicator then waited for him to come to the table i said alone ditch the uniform or this ends now the uniform needs to eat you want to walk its your choice she nipped the bottle of water as it popped out of the serving slot keep away from the coffee she said conversationally if you want to live he dropped into the seat across from her she wasnt surprised when he ordered bottled brew your girlfriend tell you about our conversation yesterday you show some respect when you talk about clarissa shes a lady your type dont recognize a lady my type recognizes wrong cops conspirators killers fanatics watching his face she took a pull of her water i dont care how their skin stretches i want you off her back im giving you one warning on it she leaned forward you threatening me dwier are you intimating that if i continue to pursue the line of investigation that involves clarissa price you may attempt to cause me physical harm what are you wired no im not wired i just want to be real clear on the nature of your warning that way i wont be kicking your sorry ass across this sticky floor out the door and across the street due to a miscommunication you think youre some badass dont you you homicide cops all think youre so fucking important elite or some shit you come out on the street and wade through the garbage awhile you pick up the pieces of some kid whos been raped and beat up or drag through the puke of some asshole teenager whos odd on jazz he got from some vulture working the school yards see how long youre such a badass she felt some sympathy a sliver of it scraping over her for a cop whod seen more than he could handle but there was the line again the line that could only be moved so far before it fell off the edge is that why youre part of this dwier just couldnt handle taking all the steps seeing some of those steps bust out from under you is that why you decided to be judge jury and executioner her fries slid out and she ignored them his bottle popped seconds later he snatched it up twisted the top with the violence of a man who wished it was a human neck i want you off clarissas back youre repeating yourself tell me something new he took two deep swallows from the bottle im not saying i got anything to tell you but if i did id need a deal cant deal without the cards dont try to hose me he snorted at her and she lost even that sliver of sympathy he wasnt just a cop whod broken under the pressure he was one whod puffed up on it and filled himself to bursting like the thin skin of a balloon bulging with arrogance with righteousness im a badge i know how this works if i had anything to say pertaining to the recent homicides id need immunity for clarissa and myself regarding any possible involvement immunity she leaned back carefully selected a french fry studied it you just want me to wipe your slate seven dead one a cop and you want a free ride for yourself and your lady just how do you expect me to pull that off for you dwier youll pull it off youve got weight lets put it this way she drenched the fries with salt they needed help desperately why do you think id use the weight you think i have to help you skate on this you want the bust i know your type the bust comes first keep your casescleared percentage high you figure theyll pin another fucking medal on you you dont know me her voice was low and lethal you want a picture in your head dwier how about this one a sixteenyearold girl cut into ribbons her blood all over the walls following the trail where shed run trying to get away from a man who was driven insane by a group of people who decided he should die her name was hannah wade she was a stupid kid with a bad attitude who ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time like kevin halloway a solid young cop just doing his job how do the people pushing your buttons rate that in their list of percentages an acceptable loss clarissas sick over that girl shes busted to pieces over it didnt sleep a wink all night eve felt bile rush into her throat washed it back with water remorse will weigh in with the prosecutor maybe you were misled maybe both of you were misled by the people in charge of purity you were just looking for a way to protect the kids on your watch yeah he drank keyed in the menu for a second bottle if that were the case it would go toward immunity the fact if we did know something relevant we were willing to give it up voluntarily you puke she thought her face blank as a wiped slate you know i cant guarantee immunity that decision doesnt come from me i can only request it you can push it you know the buttons she looked away from him a moment because knowing shed try for the deal made her sick the greater good she told herself sometimes justice couldnt sweep clean ill push for immunity but youre off the job and sos she you cant shut up dwier just shut up because what im going to lay down here is as good as youre ever going to get and the offer is onetime only i put my weight for immunity make the case for the pa that your information and prices was key to my investigation if it isnt key dwier this conversation is moot you and price walk no cage time but you put in for retirement and she resigns from child services its up to the pa and the brass as to whether you keep your benefits thats out of my hands but you walk she shoved her plate aside you refuse this deal and i give you a vow to hunt you both of you until i have enough to put you both over ill push for multiple charges firstdegree conspiracy murder ill push for the murder of a police officer ill push hard and the two of you will spend the rest of your lives behind bars the last breath you take will be in a cage ill make it my personal mission his eyes glittered temper terror alcohol and eve thought with a dull amazement with insult i got sixteen years in sixteen years busting my hump and now youve got five minutes to decide she pushed up from the table be gone or be ready to talk when i get back as she strode across the club peabody started to rise eve simply shook her head and kept going she slammed into what the squirrel called their rest room five narrow stalls and two shallow pits for sinks she ran the water cold splashed it on her face again and again until the heat of her anger and disgust chilled face dripping she lifted her head and stared at herself in the blackflecked mirror seven people dead she thought seven and she was about to help two of the ones responsible ride free so she could stop the others is this what it took to speak for kevin halloway for hannah wade is this what it took shades of right tibble had said and just now she felt smeared by the shadows she scrubbed her face dry then pulled out her communicator commander i need a deal for thomas dwier and clarissa price dwier was still at the table when she returned and starting on his third bottle she wondered how long ago hed drowned his conscience talk she said i gotta have some assurances i laid it out for you once im not laying it out again talk or walk i want you to understand we did what we had to do you work to get scum off the street and before you write up your fives theyre back out the systems gone soft all this shit about civil rights jammed down our throat lawyers sliding through the grease you cant do the job i dont want the lecture dwier i want data whos running the show im gonna tell it my way he swiped the back of his hand over his mouth hunched in over the table me and clarissa we got close shes dedicated her life to helping kids only to see half of them maybe more get screwed over by the system we started going out mostly just to blow off some steam and we got close after what happened with the dukes kid she was thinking about packing it in that one almost broke her she took a couple weeks leave to decide what she wanted to do and don came to see her don would that be donald dukes yeah she was in a rough spot a rough spot and he told her about this group who was looking for answers who was working to find a better way an underground group purity the purity seekers he said a lot of people had gotten together people like him like her other concerned citizens he asked if shed come to a meeting where church basement downtown church of the savior a church basement she didnt know why it offended her sensibilities she wasnt never had been religious but it appalled something deep inside her this runs out of a church thats one of the meeting sites we move around churches and schools she went to the first one with don with dukes it brought her back up pulled her out of the depression it gave her a grip on things again i went with her the next time it makes sense he insisted the program makes sense you want to clean up the city you gotta take out the trash cops and courts are cuffed nobody respects the law because the law doesnt work it doesnt fucking work and you know it she looked at his face the flush brought out by beer and righteousness not always she thought it doesnt always work because its not going to put you in a cage who runs the meetings its a democracy dwier told her with some pride we all have a say dukes is one of the founders weve got cops doctors judges scientists preachers weve got thinkers names he dipped his head rubbed the bottle over his brow we go by first names but i recognized some ran some others you have to know who youre in bed with look we had some glitches with the program maybe we pushed things too fast the techs figured they could delete the virus after absolute purity was achieved but there was some snafu theyre working day and night to fix it we took up a collection for halloway were making a contribution to the police officers survivors fund in his name im sure thatll give his family a lot of comfort dwier give me names you think its easy to weasel he slammed the nearly empty bottle on the table you think its easy to flip on people youve worked with was it easier to kill easier to throw a few bucks in the hat for a dead cop because there was a snafu i dont want to hear about your pain dwier or your skewed sense of loyalty i want names it comes down to you or them no names no deal bitch yeah keep that in mind donald dukes his wife no he kept her out of it he doesnt much like working with women but he recruited clarissa i figure there was some pressure on him to pick her up since they had a history dwier jerked a shoulder matthew sawyer bigshot doctor out of kennedy memorial brain guy keith burns one of those computer geeks worked with dukes on the virus he was the kids devins godfather stanford quillens another doctor judge lincoln angie and ray anderson their kid got raped by fitzhugh angie runs her own media consultant firm midtown he continued to reel off names eve recorded them he ordered another beer he wasnt sloppy yet she noted four beers in less than an hour and he wasnt showing it it told her his body was used to the steady intake there were other doctors other cops a city councilwoman more programmers two former social workers and a minister thats all i got confirmed clarissa might have a couple more what about funding everybody kicks in what they can donates time he sucked on the bottle some of the members got deep pockets and put their money where their mouth is weve got powerful support political support and we couldve expanded on that without the accidents whos your political support the mayor peachtree he doesnt come to the meetings but he sends statements and contributions my take is he lined up sawyer and lincoln dukes too are you telling me this organization generated out of the mayors office thats how i see it yeah peachtree wants reform and he cant get it through the polls he found another way hes a goddamn hero she stored it clamped down on another wave of disgust how do you select the targets we put the names the sheets to the membership we vote who else is nominated only got one more infected we decided to hold off until we worked out the glitches dru geller runs private clubs sells young meat to patrons runaways mostly she scoops them up and pumps them full of erotica her aps scheduled within ten hours how do you know when its achieved thats mostly tech stuff not my area but we can track usage on their infected unit or units they ran sims so they know how long it takes to finalize whens the next meeting dwier closed his eyes tonight eight the downtown church wheres dukes he shook his head safe house upstate albany im supposed to help work out a relocation hes still working on the program him and burns and the other techs theyll have it perfected in a few days theyre sure of it nobody anticipated that girl being in greenes place how the hell can you anticipate something like that but it comes down to it she wasnt any different than greene got what she deserved same as him just a little whore she bitchslapped him her hand was up and swinging before she realized the fury had taken over before he could see it in her eyes and evade the sharp crack of flesh on flesh slashed through the club a few people turned their heads then quickly looked away again eve got to her feet stay where you are peabody youre going in you can tell your story to the pa price is being picked up right now just a fucking minute shut up you pulsating piece of shit youll get your immunity youre going in now and staying in until the rest of your selfproclaimed heroes are picked up theres a blackandwhite outside and a representative of the prosecutors office thomas dwier you are now in custody surrender your shield and your weapon now she said laying a hand on his arm or ill take you down the way i want to instead of by the book youve shown such contempt for people know we were right he laid his weapon on the table tossed his badge down beside it there are four monsters off the streets thanks to us she took his weapon took his badge then hauled him to his feet there are all kinds of monsters dwier you dont quite qualify youre just a weasel and an embarrassment to the job when he was secured in the blackandwhite eve got into her own vehicle then just laid her forehead on the wheel you all right dallas no no im not all right she yanked dwiers badge and weapon from her pocket seal these i dont want my hands on them again i got him immunity i got him a ride maybe maybe i pull him in hammer at him in interview i get him to roll without the deal but i made the deal because maybe he doesnt roll and i cant spare the time to find out the prosecutor wouldnt have dealt immunity if he didnt figure it was the way to go when you want the whole pie sacrificing one little slice is a reasonable trade thats how the pa figured it thats how dwier knew hed figure it i wish i could get me an address on a dru geller shell be in the system she pulled out her communicator to run the next steps with the commander it took an hour to set it up to her satisfaction precious time but she wasnt losing another cop not today we cant be sure what kind of shape shes in eve reminded the crisis team shed handpicked we will assume she is violent and armed three men on the door three for the windows we go in fast we subdue secure and transport the subject cannot be shocked with standard weapons even on low setting the probability is high that the infection has spread to the extent that this would result in termination we use tranqs and tranqs only she gestured to the apartment blueprint onscreen youve familiarized yourselves with the setup we know the subject is in this location we dont know where she is within its perimeter but the highest probability is for the main bedroom here communications are to remain open throughout the op when the subject is secured she will be transferred immediately to the medical techs accompanied by two team members during transpo to designated health center where a medical team is waiting maybe theyd save her eve thought as she approached the door to dru gellers apartment and maybe they wouldnt if dwiers information was accurate she had under eight hours left morris had called the infection irreversible after the initial spread she was risking six cops her aide and herself over a woman who was in all likelihood already dead she drew her tranqshooter nodded for the crisis team cop to uncode the locks uncoding she said quietly into her communicator locks disengaged wait for my signal she eased the door open she caught a whiff of spoiled food of stale urine the lights were off the sun shields tight at the windows the room looked and smelled like a cave she gestured pointing peabody and the second officer left she went in fast low and right living area clear she heard it then a kind of growling the sound a rabid dog might make when cornered moving to main bedroom hold at the windows she took flank at the door nodded again then kicked it in dru geller had her back to the wall she wore nothing but panties there was blood on her breasts breasts scored from her own fingernails her nose had bled as well and the red ran down over her snarling lips stained her teeth dripped off her chin eve saw it all in the space of a heartbeat and saw the longbladed scissors in her hand the scissor flew like an arrow from a bow eve pivoted deployed the tranq it caught geller in the left breast now go hit her again she ordered as geller lunged forward a second tranq hit her midbody and still she leaped on eve like a wildcat all teeth and nails she saw the red eyes wheeling felt the blood drip on her face geller howled as a third tranq took her in the right shoulder she shut off like a light red eyes rolling back limbs going limp it took seconds only seconds there was a flurry of movement as geller was rolled away her unconscious body restrained get her to the mts get her transported eve ordered move we got an officer down what wiping the blood from her face eve gained her feet spun around and saw peabody lying on the floor bleeding the scissors jammed deep into her shoulder no goddamn it no she was on her knees in one fast move and without thinking brushing her hand over peabodys white face zigged right shouldve zagged left peabody managed she turned her head stared dully at the bright silver scissors its not too bad is it not too bad no its nothing get me a medical now right now eve stripped off her jacket prepared to use it to staunch the flow of blood pull them out okay wouldja peabody groped for eves hand its making me pretty sick having them sticking out of me better not mts coming up right now theyll fix you up theyd hit an inch over the riot vest wouldve deflected them whatre the chances really hurts jesus it really hurts im cold just shock right right dallas im not dying or anything youre not dying she snagged the wrinkled bedspread from one of the crisis team i dont have time to waste training another aide eve turned her head as an mt rushed in do something she ordered ignoring her he ran a scanner over the point of entry took peabodys vital signs okay officer whats your name peabody im peabody would you get these goddamn scissors out of me sure im going to give you a little something first gimme lots dallas is the one who lives for pain he smiled at her set his pressure syringe shes losing blood eve snapped are you just going to let her bleed out on the floor just keep the pressure on he said mildly too bad about that jacket looks like nice fabric im going to pull out the invasive object on three peabody okay one two three the mt met eves eyes and mouthed hold her down eve felt it in her gut felt the sharp shock of the blades slicing out of peabodys flesh felt it in the quick jerk of her aides body against her restraining hands blood flowed over her fingers warm and wet then she was nudged out of the way while the mt worked on the wound twenty minutes later she was pacing the er waiting room shed nearly decked the doctor whod ordered her out of the treatment area had restrained herself only because she figured the medical had to be conscious to work on peabody mcnab burst through the doors in a limping run with roarke right behind him where is she what are they doing for her how bad is it shes in treatment theyre patching her up its just like i told you mcnab shes got a deep puncture in her shoulder but it missed the major arteries they dont think theres any muscle damage theyre going to clean it up give her some blood and fluids sew her up then theyll probably spring her she saw him stare down at her hands she hadnt taken time to wash the blood off cursing herself she shoved them into her pockets which treatment room b around the corner to the left he rushed off and eve scrubbed her hands over her face i cant stay in here she muttered and hurried outside is it more serious than you told mcnab roarke asked her i dont think so the mt seemed solid he said it was too serious to treat and release onscene but not major she lost a lot of blood she stared down at her hands you lost a bit yourself he traced his fingers over her jaw where gellers nails had swiped its nothing goddamn it its nothing she spun away from him kicked the tire of an ambulance parked in the bay i took her in there is she less a cop than you thats not the point thats not the fucking point she whirled back i took her and six other cops in there i made the call i set the op i dodged out of the way when geller threw the scissors at me because her eyes were swimming her voice beginning to hitch he took her shoulders and peabody didnt move as quickly is that your fault its not about fault its about reason i took her in took all of them in to secure and transport to medical a woman whos probably going to die anyway i ordered those people to put their lives on the line for her a woman who sells little girls boy thats irony for you ive got peabodys blood on my hands because of a woman who sells children for sex she gripped his shirt fisted her hands for what she demanded whats the damn point lieutenant she jerked at mcnabs voice turned quickly hed never seen her cry before hadnt known she could shes awake you were right theyre going to spring her they want to keep her about an hour first shes still a little groggy she asked if you were around ill go in and see her dallas mcnab moved into her path took her by the arm if you ask her what the point is shed tell you you havent asked me but ill tell you anyway because when something has to be done were the ones whore supposed to do it i didnt have to be there to know you went through the door first so you already know what the point is maybe i needed somebody to remind me roarke watched her walk back inside youre a good man ian he laid a hand on mcnabs shoulders lets go buy peabody some flowers i usually just steal them lets make an exception for this one chapter whitney took eves report orally in his office she was in her shirtsleeves and the shirt carried a small stain of dried blood has peabody been released from the health center they were preparing to sign her out when i left shell need to take a couple days medical leave see that she has what she needs dwier and price are in custody and will be held incommunicado until the situation is resolved we have the location in albany under surveillance when youve cleaned up here donald dukes will be taken we agree that he shouldnt be arrested until after your raid on tonights meeting yes sir dwier and price were just soldiers dukes is one of the generals the commandant eve remembered its probable he remains in contact with other key members of the organization we let him sit until weve broken its back sir as dwier has further implicated mayor peachtree i request permission for formal questioning the mayor has agreed to temporary house arrest his incoming and outgoing transmissions are being monitored under advice of counsel hes admitted to the sexual transgression but continues to deny any association with purity politically hes finished politically eve began yes thats not enough i wont disagree however this evenings op takes priority over questioning him well bag most if not all the other members in this sweep essentially destroying this organization thats the first order of business when the mayors office is a front for terrorists thats an important piece of business commander and will it make a difference to closing this case if you question him now or wait until tomorrow she wanted to take him now she wanted to taste him in her throat it could if he gives up additional information i can promise you that with his fleet of attorneys youll be in for a long tough haul getting more than his name you dont have the time to spare today hes on ice dallas hes done be satisfied with that for a few hours longer i give you my word that as of ten am tomorrow he belongs to you yes sir thank you youve done superior work on this despite a number of difficult obstacles he hesitated studying her face id like to speak to something chief tibble said this morning you deserve the bars dallas they dont matter fuck it this is between you and me here in this room you deserve to wear the bars youve earned them if it was only a matter of merit you would wear them regrettably its not only a matter of merit your age is a consideration what are you dallas thirty thirtyone sir he let out a halflaugh ive got shirts older than you i have to hide them from my wife but ive got them still this is a consideration that could be resolved even used to advantage in some circumstances commander whitney im aware that my personal life is a factor in this matter that my marriage to roarke who is regarded in some quarters certainly some within the department with suspicion unless hes being useful is and will be more a detriment to my moving up in rank than the mayor using an illegal sex broker and doing the mambo in womens clothes would be to his future political standing chief tibble was correct it was my choice i hope youre equally aware that your marriage isnt regarded as a detriment in this office i am nor for that matter by the chief if it were up to me youd have your bars it used to matter to me it doesnt seem so important anymore id never be able to play the game with the same passion i can put into the job youll find out differently his chair creaked when he leaned back its a few years down the road yet as things stand but you will find out differently go home clean up gear up then go take these bastards down eve decided to follow orders exactly the minute she got home she headed for the shower she only wished she could wash away frustration and anger as easily as blood and sweat bracing her hands on the tiles she lowered her head so the jets of water could beat down over her drumming out the little aches she didnt think for twenty minutes under the spray she allowed herself to blank calmer she stepped into the drying tube let the hot air whirl and blow around her she hitched on a towel stepped back into the bedroom and saw roarke sit down eve her blood drained peabody no no shes doing well in fact shes on her way here now you just need to sit ive got a major op in a few hours the investigative team deserves to be down on the bust they need to be briefed it can wait while you take a few more minutes to settle yourself he scooped her off her feet hey what are you a damn rabbit i dont have time for sex if i thought sex was what you needed wed be in bed instead he dropped her on the couch sat beside her turn around here close your eyes look roarke oh god her eyes fluttered as he dug fingers and thumbs into her shoulders youve knots in here the size of my fist i could dump a soother into you but well try this instead yeah well if you dont stop that within fifteen minutes im going to kick your ass he bent his head touched his lips to her knotted shoulder i love you eve every obstinate inch of you i dont feel obstinate i feel she felt herself filling up again doubts and loathing im not sure of myself you have to know youre right dont you have to know that asshole dwier he knows hes right not a doubt in his mind not a twinge hes just trying to save his skin and his womans a lot of people know theyre right when what they are is wrong having doubts keeps you human not like this not when you start doubting the core isnt that how this group pulled people in the ones who started doubting the core not trusting it i traded dwier for the case today i gave a wrong cop a walk so i could close it down you had a choice to make she reached back gripped his hand hed been one of her choices the best choice of her life at least there she had no doubts he said he said theyd taken a collection for halloway like a memorial like they had a right roarke wrapped his arms around her waist drew her back against him and let her pour it out im sitting there looking at him listening to his bullshit justifications the program propaganda and i remember how colleen halloway thanked me she thanked me and im kicking loose one of the people responsible for her sons death she pulled up her knees pressed her face against them im seeing what happened to hannah wade i see her lying facedown in her own blood and he says its too bad about her said it was an accident but she only got what she deserved because she was just a whore i want to pound my fists into his flesh for that beat him senseless for it but i swing weight with the pa to get him immunity so he wont have to pay for it for any of it am i standing for the dead or am i walking all over them you know the answer to that he forced her around her cheeks were damp again you know the answer in your heart i used to know it in my gut i used to know it in my bones and i dont know what kind of cop im going to make if i dont feel it that way again i dont know this dwier but i do know this he may not live out his life in a cage but hell never be free again i do know you eve whatever you did you did for halloway for hannah wade and the rest you bargained your own needs away for theirs i dont know if i did but i hope to god it was worth it she used her hands to scrub her cheeks dry im going to break them tonight and tomorrow im going to send peachtree down to hell with them she blew out a breath pushed back her hair to do that ive got to shake this off would you like some positive news i could use it weve finished the full id on the virus weve duplicated it which means we can create a permanent shield against it that allows us full access to the data in the remaining units you can track it back to source we can we will itll take a bit more time but were on our way well on it to that point good ive got a warrant one that went through she added thinking of judge archer all dukess equipment whatevers left in his place is to be confiscated i need you to dig out transmissions somebody gave him the word to run and where to run to were getting dwiers and prices too just in case theyre holding any names back well be busy you and jamie can put in some time on them tonight while we run the op i recall you saying the investigative team would be in on this bust i cant take the kid on an op she rose walked to the closet youd be a lot more valuable to me in the lab thats not a con and to prove it im not ordering you to stay she grabbed a shirt turned back im asking thats tricky of you he got to his feet ill be your lab rat then for a bit longer appreciate it dont wear those trousers with that shirt what are you thinking im going to a bust not a party thats no reason not to look your best lets see whats the welldressed cop wearing these days to take down a major terrorist organization you cant go wrong with basic black is this a joke she asked as he selected another shirt good fashion sense is never a joke he handed her the shirt slid a finger down the dent in her chin but its good to see you smile again lieutenant oh and wear the black boots not the brown i dont have any black boots he reached in pulled out a pair of sturdy black leather you do now half a block down from the church of the savior eve sat in the surveillance vehicle and argued with peabody look youre lucky to be here at all youre on medical leave no im not because i didnt sign off i signed you off i signed me back on eve bared her teeth you forgot the sir peabodys chin jutted no i didnt how about i write you up for insubordination go ahead peabody folded her arms across her chest i can handle it just like i can handle this op eve let out a gusty sigh maybe youre right beside her feeney shifted his gaze from the monitor toward eve and thought ohoh im patched up peabody claimed relaxing a little as she saw her opening im fit for duty it wasnt that big a deal i guess im just overreacting a little eve lifted her hands then pushed to her feet you ought to know how you feel right absolutely sir she said well then eve patted peabodys shoulder lightly then squeezed she watched her aides color drain watched her mouth go lax on a shocked and pained o and how do you feel now i feel just all patched up she watched the sweat pearl on peabodys brow fit for duty im sit down shut up yes sir at eves gentle nudge peabodys legs folded she wasnt sure if she put her head between her knees or eve did but either way she was grateful youll stay in the surveillance vehicle and assist mcnab any arguments from you detective she said looking at mcnab no no sir lieutenant he patted peabody on the back you okay honey no honeys eve pulled at her hair there are no honeys on an op for sweet christs sake keep it up just keep it up and im having one of you transferred to queens she turned on her heel dropped down beside feeney again whats the status a few early birds going in pretty quiet yet he lowered his voice good job there she aint ready to rock yet girls got spine though therell be other ops eve agreed and studied the monitor theres always another op the church was small an unpretentious building that might have started out white it was gray now a soft and dingy gray that boasted a simple black cross it had no steeple and only a scattering of windows across the front eve knew what it looked like inside shed studied the blueprints and the record baxter had taken hed dressed as a sidewalk sleeper had stumbled around inside though he hadnt been able to get to the basement hed gotten a good picture of the main level and had copped ten credits from the deacon whod finally moved him along again there were fifty pews twentyfive to a side a podium centered at the front there were two doors off the worship area baxter had managed to bungle his way into one snag a quick record of an office area before the deacon had rushed in to fuss over him the equipment in the office was topoftheline and several levels over what any little neighborhood church could afford there were three outside doors the front the east side and the rear that led to the basement all were covered when they moved she thought theyd surround the building like the rings around saturn picking up more chatter now feeney told her eve lifted up her earpiece tuned in there was talk about sports how about those yankees women exchanged recipes and talked child care someone mentioned a sale at barneys jesus feeney shook his head sounds like a damn pta meeting a what school deal parents teachers what kind of terrorists are they ordinary people eve said thats what makes them so dangerous most are just regular joes looking for a way to clean up the streets i watched this vid with roarke this old west thing bad guys kicking ass in this town law cant stop them cause they kick the laws ass too so the people get together pool some bucks and hire this band of gunslingers thats a great word isnt it gunslinger she savored it for just a moment snagged a few of feeneys candied nuts anyway they hired these guys to get rid of the other guys and they do but then the gunslingers decide hey we like it here so were going to hang and run things our way what are you gonna do about that so the town ends up under their thumb just trade one gun for another yeah plus you lose the bucks a lot of people who were minding their own get hurt ends up this us marshall type comes in which shouldve been done in the first place and after a lot of shooting people taking dives off roofs getting dragged around by horses and shit he cleans up the place we dont have the horses but well clean up the place tonight damn right they waited dull conversation long silences quick updates from other units stationed around the perimeter cop work eve thought as she sipped black coffee and monitored was hours of waiting mountains of paperwork stretches of unbelievable boredom and moments extreme moments where it came down to life and death she glanced over at peabody instants she thought and inches and fate theyre starting feeney said quietly must be all theyre expecting tonight bastards are starting their death meeting with the lords prayer theyre about to have plenty to pray for eve got to her feet lets round them up and take them down she ran checks with each unit captain ordered all positions held while she and feeney moved in to join baxter and trueheart her unit would hit the basement door first she gave baxters chest a quick poke to make sure he was wearing his riot gear grinning he poked her back damn stuffs heavy isnt it irritates the hell out of me she admitted she circled her finger he turned so she could yank down the concealing flap and reveal the nypsd emblem on the back of his jacket meetings under way mcnab reported through her earpiece judge lincolns presiding theyre reading fucking minutes from the last meeting lets give them a couple minutes eve ordered get more on record the more we have the deeper we put them under lieutenant trueheart whispered as if already in church i want to thank you for allowing me to be a part of this op youre going to suck up baxter told him you suck up to me now i suck up to dallas thats the food chain opening to new business mcnab reported discussion on greene termination wade termination called unfortunate systemic byproduct jesus single objection from membership sir peabodys voice came through word just came in geller didnt make it eight dead eve thought it ends now this meetings over locked and loaded baxter said all units go go she went in the door first and down a set of old iron stairs in her mind she pictured other units coming in the front the side streaming across the main floor weapon drawn badge held up she swung through the doorway into the basement room nypsd nobody moves there were some screams some shouts a few people scrambled either for cover or escape secondary units poured in like ants at a picnic ants armed with laser rifles and twinbarreled stunners put your hands up hands up eve shouted or you will be stunned this building is surrounded there is no way out you are under arrest for terrorist acts for conspiracy to commit murder for the murder of a police officer and other charges that will be made known to you she moved forward sweeping faces movements some wept now and others stood rigid in fury still more knelt hands clasped like martyrs about to be fed to the pagan lions on the floor she ordered on your faces hands behind your heads she swung hard as she saw judge lincoln reach inside his jacket do it she said softly give me a reason his hand dropped he had a hard face dark stone with features sharply carved she had sat in his courtroom given testimony there had trusted him to feed justice she took the weapon from under his jacket patted him down were the solution he told her were courageous enough to act while others sit and wait i bet hitler said the same thing on the floor she pushed him to his knees on your face hands behind you she clapped the restraints on him herself this is for colleen halloway she said softly in his ear she knows more about courage than you ever will youre a goddamn disgrace she got to her feet baxter read this bunch of heroes their rights it was twothirty when she made it home but it wasnt fatigue that dogged her now but a weariness so internal it dragged at both body and mind she felt none of the rush of victory the pumping energy from seeing a job through when she closed the door at her back she couldnt find it in her to toss an insult at the waiting summerset despite the lateness of the hour am i to expect your house guests will arrive with their usual desire for refreshments no theyve got homes of their own and theyre using them you were successful they scored eight before i stopped them i guess that would depend on your definition of successful lieutenant her mind was too shadowed for more than mild irritation she stopped on the second step looked back what do you want during the urban wars there were a number of civiliandriven organizations some risked their own lives to try to protect neighborhoods under siege or to rebuild those that had been decimated there were many acts of heroism and there were other groups who were also organized they sought only to destroy to punish to wage other levels of warfare some formed their own courts held trials oddly all of those trials ended with a verdict of guilty and were swiftly followed by execution each he said had considerable success with their separate agendas history is however enlightened by one and tainted by the other im not looking to make history thats a pity he said as she continued up the stairs because youve done so tonight she went by the lab first but there was only jamie he was obviously out of work mode and into recreation there was a graphic of yankee stadium on his monitor he was playing against baltimore and the os were up two runs in the bottom of the sixth shit you blind he slapped the unit as the ump called a strike on his batter that was high and outside asshole it caught the corner eve disagreed nipped the strike zone good pitch like hell he paused his game swiveled around wanna take me on its better with two reals instead of playing against the comp ill trounce all over you some other time hit the sheets hey hey wait he scrambled up arent you going to tell me how it went down it went down well i know we got the call on it but no deets spill some deets dallas tomorrow well have a full briefing one deet you give me one then i got one for you we confiscated discs containing records of every meeting weve got them sewn up so tight they cant hack their way out of the sack with a broadsword give okay frigo we got some track you found the source nothing to it once we cloned virus was sent out from the unit confiscated from dukess lower level work area he sent them staggered over a threeday period he pushed the button on every one of them they brought him in from albany tonight hes lawyered up ill take him apart tomorrow go to bed kid got to smash the os first she shrugged whatever she walked to the door paused jamie i was against roarke bringing you onto the team i was wrong you did a standup job his face brightened like a sun thanks she left him to battle the birds and went to roarkes office he too was at his unit but she doubted he was playing whatever his business was he shut it down when she came in congratulations lieutenant wheres your team they were heading to some afterhours place to wind down with a couple of drinks i passed then you can have one here with me he rose to top off his brandy and pour her a glass of wine we have your source yeah jamie told me i stopped by the lab on my way hes still up yankees and os bottom of the sixth hes two down with two out and a runner on first ah well then he gave her the wine did he tell you we also found a number of transmissions to and from price and dwier and three so far from mayor peachtrees office link the last coming in the afternoon of your visit to the dukes house text only it advises dukes to take a little holiday with his family and gives a suggestion for the address in albany its carefully worded but under the circumstances damning enough i take dukes and the mayor tomorrow she sat on the arm of a chair but didnt drink the wine i split up the interviews after the bust gave a push at suspects with various team members and combos everybody yelled lawyer like it was their team cheer i broke some pathetic housewife in under thirty minutes spilled her guts while her lawyers huffing and puffing about duress pleaded her down a couple levels to shut him up and she rolled over like a puppy you stopped them you shattered them i took in a judge two other cops a retired cop whod put thirty years in i took in mothers who were almost as panicked about notifying their child care provider as they were about spending the night in a cage i took in a boy barely old enough to shave and a woman who wont see a hundred again she spit on me her voice quavered just a bit on that she spit on me when we were putting her in the wagon roarke stroked a hand over her hair and when she turned her head cradled her face against his side im sorry me too she murmured i just dont know what im sorry about ive got to go to bed she eased away stood ill look over the data you and jamie extracted in the morning ill be along when i can i have a meeting shortly a meeting its almost three in the morning its in tokyo well do a holoconference she nodded then set the untouched wine aside were you supposed to be there in tokyo i can be where i want and i want to be here ive cut into a lot of your time just lately he rubbed a thumb over the shadows under her eyes you certainly have and i expect to be properly recompensed he touched his lips to her forehead now go to bed ive work here i could come into midtown sometime and consult id like to know what ive done to deserve a threat like that it helped to smile or you know go shopping with you help you pick out a suit or something i felt that chill right down to the bone go away lieutenant okay see you later mmm and as his holo unit signaled he watched her go chapter she woke before dawn and gauged the time by the quality of the dark she calculated an hour before daybreak and thought about trying to zone out again for the best part of that shed slept like a woman in a coma falling facedown on the bed after stripping down to the skin she hadnt heard roarke come to bed but at least she hadnt dreamed she shifted to her side and made out the shape of him it wasnt often she woke before he did because of it she rarely had the opportunity to lay in the dark in the silence of the house and listen to him sleep he slept like a cat she thought no quieter than a cat the light rumble of snoring she heard was from the other side of the bed where galahad lay sprawled on his back like roadkill it was kind of nice she decided with everyone all tucked up safe and warm too nice to waste the best part of the hour she had left for bed sleeping she crawled on top of roarke found his mouth just where shed left it and woke him with heat she felt his body throw off sleep a fingersnap brace assess relax again work late she asked against his mouth mmm sleeping in not anymore she laughed and scraped her teeth over his jaw just lie back ill do the work if you insist she was warm and naked and still soft from the night in the dark before light she moved over him like a dream all scent and touch and shadow her lips and fingers stroked over him stirring needs that were never quite still her hands cupped his face her mouth sank to his she sighed into him he heard something wistful in the sound and as she lay over him he traced his hands up and down her back that long lean line as much for comfort as seduction his cop he thought so troubled so torn but here they were safe and sure here they were right he knew she realized and turned her face into his throat he always knew and the gift of having someone who did who could was overwhelming i love you roarke i love you her mouth met his again hotter now with the first taste of urgency i love you for all the times i forget to say it the kiss slid back to sweetness her heart beat thick beat steady against his in a long slow movement he rolled her to her back he laid his lips on her collarbone as their legs tangled as hers parted he could see her now the shape of her face the gleam of her eyes he slid into her a satin glide of flesh to flesh a quick and quiet catch of breath again long again slow and deep with her body rising toward his with his falling toward hers she shuddered and groped for his hands their fingers linked their mouths met overhead dawn broke it was still shy of seven when she studied the data roarke and jamie had accessed the night before she frowned over it chewed over it considered dukes goes down all the way down he has to know it essentially he was the button man even without a confession im handing the prosecutor a case hed have to be a baboon to lose then why do you look annoyed i just wonder if this guy knows he was the goat all along whatever whoever goes down he takes the heaviest fall hes the name the media will trumpet the image of the effigies burned once the crowd turns if he hadnt figured it out i might be able to use that to convince him to point the finger at anyone i dont have in the box and they will turn roarke agree yeah they will she frowned politics she said softly hell of a game she glanced over at roarke im going to check out a couple things then head in to start picking him apart i want a good chunk of time with him before i pass him to feeney and move onto peachtree youre doing peachtree at central his house his involvement remains code five until hes formally charged i want to observe the interviews he looked over from where he sat on the bedroom sofa monitoring the stock reports on the miniunit and the morning media report on the wall screen whats the point the point is closure i gave way on the bust last night i want this whats the matter with you ace youre sprung job done game over you can spike the ball you can go back to work and buy alaska or something ive as much acreage and interest in alaska as i need for the moment but if your hearts set on a glacier just send me a memo you can arrange it lieutenant its a reasonable enough request for dukes yeah but peachtree hes had my support financially youre not the only one whos pissedoff by this situation i want to be there for the end of it okay okay ill work it out but im leaving in ten so youll have to hold on a minute his gaze narrowed on the wall screen as nadine furst came on with a flash bulletin this just in fortythree people suspected of being part of the group known as the purity seekers were taken into custody last night at the church of the savior on franklin street this nypsd operation was headed by lieutenant eve dallas police sources identify some of the suspects arrested as judge lincoln a criminal court judge in this city michael and hester stanski where did she get the names eve exploded and barely resisted punching a fist at the screen were not releasing names yet listen to the rest roarke told her this cant be it theres no point in this kind of leak donald dukes nadine continued a former marine sergeant and a computer scientist was arrested at a private home in albany and has been taken into custody several charges have been brought against dukes including conspiracy to commit murder in regard to the purity killings over the past week there was a slight pause then nadine continued but the most disturbing development in the purity matter is the allegations levied against mayor steven peachtree official sources confirm that the mayor of new york is a prime suspect in the crimes attributed to the purity seekers and will be formally questioned this morning evidence linking mayor peachtree to purity includes a video of alleged sexual misconduct which was recovered from the residence of nick greene during the investigation of greenes death it is suspected that the video was used as part of a blackmail scheme the mayor could not be reached for comment nor has his office issued a statement regarding the allegations son of a bitch even as eve swore her communicator beeped as did the bedside link her pocket link she imagined the communication centers in her office here and at central were lit up like christmas youre in the media storm now lieutenant roarke told her youre going to have to ride it ignoring the links she yanked out her communicator lieutenant was all whitney had to say yes sir i saw it i dont know where she got it but ill find out what i can fast peachtrees lawyers are already out for blood leak or no leak commander im making an arrest today and itll stick no media statements he ordered neither confirm nor deny until i clear it take dukes first and break him dallas ill let you know when and where for peachtree dont answer the links she told roarke as she jammed the communicator back in her pocket tell summerset to screen all transmissions and to keep jamie here and under wraps i dont want him talking to anyone about anything not even his mother you think the boy leaked this eve no he didnt leak it hes too good a cop already i know where the leak came from she snagged a jacket this may not be my game but i know how to play it when i have to i know how to win it if youre with me she added youve got five minutes she let him drive and spent the entire time on the link covering the situation with her team coordinating them and arranging for extra bodies at central to hold back the media who would certainly be swarming into a pack outside the doors then she tagged nadine listen before you jump on me i was given that bulletin thirty seconds before air there wasnt even time to polish the copy i couldnt have flipped it to you if id wanted to who gave it to you youre asking me to reveal a source and you know i wont but as it happens it was given to me by my producer i dont know his source sources she amended hes never gotten this hot with less than two all i know is someone high up leaked to him with the stipulation i read the story he confirmed and we aired you specifically thats right smart eve decided things are popping around here dallas youre going to want to give me a statement asap what evidence do you have linking mayor peachtree to the activities of the purity seekers no comment nadine the shit hitting the fan isnt all going to land on peachtrees face a lot of its going to fly into yours as she spoke nadine angled her chair brought up data manually on her computer screen he had a fiftythree percent popularity rating before this and many of the voters included in that percentage are very vocal very staunch and very monied supporters on the other sides the faction wholl want to lynch him politically and will use you as the rope no comment curious which side do you bet on supporters or lynching party it was a good angle she mused and one it wouldnt hurt her to get a jump on hell resign no way out of it without the dirty details of this sexual misconduct i cant project hell take hits for cheating on his wife and for any connection with greene off the record nadine eve could see nadine strain against the bonds okay damn it off the record if its a little juicier than cheating if it involved some sexual kinks oh god youre killing me if its good and juicy hes probably cooked at least short term convicting him of murder unless youve got him with fresh blood on his hands is another matter public support will swing both ways which puts him center ring people have short memories and selective ones they wont necessarily remember if hes guilty or innocent but theyll remember he did something big if he doesnt do hard time if he can slither on the sex he could run again in a few years and hed probably win thats politics eve stated later dallas but eve cut her off youre pulling on a string lieutenant roarke said im beginning to see the shape of the ball it comes from yeah lets see how it unravels head straight to garage level oh and if you run over any reporters i give you extra points inside she moved fast she had dukes and his team of lawyers in interview within fifteen minutes she teamed with peabody deliberately choosing to piss dukes off by having two females go at him she turned on the recorder input the salient data then sat back lets get started lieutenant dallas the head of the legal team a broadshouldered squarejawed man named snyder interrupted mr dukes has opted to have all questions and comments directed through and answered by me or one of my associates as is his right he prefers not to speak to or be spoken to by you directly no problem youre going to want to inform your client that with duly executed warrants his data and communication centers were confiscated from his residence in this city and from the portable registered to him found in the albany location said units were then officially logged technicians attached to nypsd extracted data and transmissions from said units this data these transmissions lock your client in a cage away from his family away from his friends away from whatever has previously passed for his world for the rest of his natural life she smiled when she said it and kept her eyes on dukess face you can also relate to your client that im just as happy about that as i can be i danced all the way in here this morning right peabody you do a mean tango lieutenant your sarcasm is noted on record snyder said you betcha if as you claim you are in possession of such damning evidence against my client i fail to see why youre wasting your time in this interview mostly i wanted to gloat she grinned and as much as it offends my sensibilities im required to give this asshole excuse me your client an opportunity to show remorse and to cooperate so that such remorse and cooperation may be considered during his sentencing have you guys done the math eight counts firstdegree murder theres a cop in there which puts that single count at full life off planet facility no possibility of parole lieutenant snyder spread his hands you dont have first and you certainly cant hang the cop on my client the fact is you dont have any direct evidence linking donald dukes to the alleged activities of this supposed organization either youre as bloody as your client or he hasnt given you full disclosure which do you figure peabody i think we should give mr snyder the benefit of the doubt i think dukes is too puffed up with his own importance to believe he needs to tell his lawyer everything he likes being in charge too much you think wearing that uniform makes you somebody dukes said under his breath yeah peabody edged closer it makes me a cop it makes me somebody whos sworn to protect the public against people like you it makes me she said slapping her palms on the table and pushing her face close to his one of the people who walked through the blood you spilled you will not speak directly to my client snyder shoved to his feet and to eves delight peabody shifted and got up in his face your client spoke directly to me on record he does that im free to respond on record now now class eve clapped her hands once made a sitdown gesture lets not let our tempers override our manners if were going to give snyder the benefit of the doubt then we owe it to him and his associates here to inform them of the evidence that is now in our hands maybe we should just toss him to the pa let them sink peabody thats very harsh if the two of you think you can run the good cop bad cop routine on me snyder began wouldnt think of it eve grinned fiercely and just fyi im the bad cop im always the bad cop bitch dukes muttered see he knows to respond to the bitch comment eve continued let me just say you aint seen nothing yet don we idd your brainchild we duped it and we tracked it back to the source your little workshop unit your fingerprints your voice prints your personal code you and nobody else didnt think we could pull it out did you now eve leaned forward ive got a couple of techs at my disposal that make you look like a firstyear hacker thats bullshit infected email transmitted from your unit by you to louis k cogburn eight july at fourteen hundred hours infected email transmitted to chadwick fitzhugh eight july at twentythree fourteen with her eyes on his she recited every transmission shed committed to memory she saw the disbelief wash over his face then the anger flood it she wanted the anger weve got you nailed they knew wed hang you when we busted this open youre not a general don youre not even a soldier to the ones running this show youre the sacrificial lamb you dont know squat youre nothing but some driedup female trying to pass for a man think so ill show you my balls don you show me yours i wish to consult with my client snyder interrupted privately i wish to terminate this interview until ive consulted with my client you terminated them didnt you eve demanded we executed them dukes spat it at her then swiped out an arm nearly knocking snyder out of his chair when the lawyer tried to interrupt shut up shut the hell up youre part of the problem just like she is enough money and youd defend satan you help put garbage back on the street i dont need you i dont need anyone are you dismissing your legal representation at this time mr dukes eve asked i insist on consulting with fuck you dukes surged to his feet his chair shot out slammed into the wall fuck all of you we did something great you think im afraid to go to prison for it i served my country i served my community how did you serve your community his mouth twisted by exterminating cockroaches mr dukes with admirable calm snyder rose ill ask you one more time to afford yourself of your right to remain silent lieutenant dallas will terminate this interview and well go to a consult room to discuss get the hell out dukes ordered without looking at him you and your cockroach brothers are fired let the record show that snyder and associates are no longer attorneys of record for donald dukes snyder picked up his briefcase signaled to his two associates lieutenant dallas on the door she said and peabody walked over to open it and let the lawyers out donald dukes did you conspire to murder louis k cogburn his shoulders were back his head high and the hate pumped like sweat out of his pores youre damn right i did did you conspire to murder chadwick fitzhugh i created the virus did most of the work myself shes a beauty i shot it into him into all of them by your conspiracy to cause these deaths did you in turn cause the death of detective kevin halloway yes whats another dead cop we took out that bitch george greene along with the whore in training whatever her name was and geller that cover it who gives you your orders i dont take orders did you conspire with mayor steven peachtree to murder the individuals named on record figure it out i have she told him youre done i dont need you get him out of here peabody take him down so he can start living the rest of his life in a cage he came at her a silent panther leap her fist shot out rammed into his chin as his head snapped back she drew her weapon but peabody flipped out her stunner and nailed him damn it eve slapped her hands on her hips when he lay sprawled at her feet i wanted to do that so did i and i beat you besides you got to pop him first teamwork yeah eve smiled but it still didnt reach her eyes nice teamwork peabody roarke corroborated the opinion when he met her in her office a few minutes later the two of you played him like a violin thats superior virtuosity when you figure youd only met him once before i knew him you did yes knew precisely what would get under his skin and push him to pontificate well done lieutenant not yet its not done yet she heard the arguments the raised voices coming through the bullpen toward her office but here comes the next stage you want to hang in for this i wouldnt miss it for worlds of which you own several she murmured before chang burst into her office like a tsunami you will issue a statement ive written it youll issue this statement immediately taking full responsibility for passing misinformation to a media representative he slapped both disc and hard copy down on her desk his hair was wild his eyes feral why would i do that because im telling you to do it because this is the last time youll undermine my work the last time youll make a mockery of what i do what you do is a mockery chang he took a step toward her she was fairly certain he envisioned clamping his hands around her throat and squeezing until her eyes popped out but whether it was the dare in her eyes or roarkes presence he resisted you leak a story to the media before its time you use your influence with an onair reporter to push forward your own agenda you create a storm to distract from the fact that youve mishandled your own work to to plump and preen yourself before the public while leaving me to clean up the mess behind you mayor peachtree has not been charged he has not yet been interviewed yet youve seen to it that hes guilty in the eyes of the public sure looks that way doesnt it one small correction though i didnt leak the story you think you can save yourself by lying to me she shifted her body weight and fascinated roarke eased back he wondered if chang knew how close he was to annihilation dont call me a liar chang you of all people who is it who has a personal relationship with nadine furst who is it who gives regular favoritism to her and channel with exclusives and tips that would be me and you know why because i can trust her to think of more than ratings that relationship is why whoever leaked this saw that the story went to her thats your kind of maneuver chang the hand around the throat image was appealing enough that she used it herself she caught him onehanded rapped him back into the wall and lifted him to his toes all this spin all this storm all this fallout thats going to keep you a very busy boy for a while isnt it get your hands off me ill have you arrested for assault yeah you can bet a whole squad of cops is going to rush in here to save your oily ass from me youre going to get a lot of play out of this fees bonuses add screwing me over to the pie and its real tasty did you leak the story chang he was turning an interesting shade of puce as he batted and shoved at her hand get away get away did you leak the goddamn story no this isnt something you leak until youre prepared until the spin is in place you leaked it no i didnt she released him so that he dropped to the flats of his feet with two sharp thuds think about that now get the hell out of my office im filing a complaint he yanked at his collar youll read the statement or bite me she suggested and shoved him out bodily that was very entertaining roarke commented were not done yet act two should be starting any minute until it does he smoothed his fingers over the ends of her hair then slid his hand around the back of her neck she stiffened looked so mortally embarrassed that he laughed what im on duty here just back off really she turned away quickly and moved to the autochef even as she programmed coffee she heard the fast hard click of high heels thats my cue franco swept in she looked every bit as furious as chang had if more elegant lieutenant dallas she bit down on the words as if she could chew them to bits she gave roarke a brisk nod im sorry but i need to speak with the lieutenant privately of course you may want to go give feeney a hand conference room b eve told him hes working on some tech stuff youd be interested in one level down eve added sector five all right ill leave you ladies to your business with one casual glance at eve he slipped out closed the door youve gone too far this time unlike chang franco kept her voice down and controlled in what area who are you to decide mayor peachtree is guilty to leak information that will ruin his political career damage his personal life and all before youve so much as questioned him you gave him no chance to defend himself leaking the story screwed him pretty good didnt it coffee you dare stand there so arrogant so goddamn cocky after what youve done yeah same as you eve leaned back on the autochef sipped her coffee you leaked the story franco are you mad no neither are you youre a very smart woman what i cant figure is if you did all this formed your organization killed people ruined a number of lives because you wanted to smear peachtree or you really believed in what you were doing ive thought about that a lot this morning but im just not sure i think it was both if you think you can save yourself by painting me with the same brush youre using to paint the mayor youre very wrong he didnt make the transmissions what are you talking about peachtree didnt make the transmissions from his office to dukes you did you used his office you used his link the transmission telling dukes to skip was sent out from that unit at sixteen fortyeight peachtree left for the day at sixteen fortytwo we have him on security cam we have him walking out of the building at the time the transmission was generated those six minutes make a difference eve gestured with her mug then took a long sip you were still in the office dedicated civil servant that you are his assistant saw you go in a couple minutes after he left you were the only one who could have contacted dukes from that unit at that time franco hitched down the jacket of her slate gray suit thats nonsense no thats just niggling details the kind that usually trip up the bad guy you probably didnt think we could trace the source but why chance it youd been using the mayor all along using him as a front politics is a weird area for me but heres how i see it eve walked over sat on the edge of her desk you want his job probably more than that but mayor of new yorks a good place to start hes fairly popular maybe hell get another term and its a pisser to wait to play deputy when you can be chief is that what you think i think you saw an opportunity to remove an obstacle even to use that obstacle to further your own ambitions especially when he makes it easy for you by getting tangled with nick greene mayor peachtrees sexual leanings should be a private matter should be lets go back a while before that you keep up with current events you keep up with community news polls opinions kids are being exploited out there future voters those kids their parents other parents other citizens voters are upset disillusioned and just plain pissed off something should be done and youre just the gal to do it a lot of control a lot of power youve got a law degree you know some of that scum is never going to pay you found a way to make them pay thats a hell of an accomplishment a smile ghosted around francos mouth her eyes were alive with it and eve noted with arrogance do you really believe you can make any of this play ive got dukes eve shrugged a shoulder ive got purity in pieces you slipping by me isnt so hard to take with more than forty other arrests and a closed case on my record so this little scenario youre writing here is between us just you and me girl talk postgame chatter then by all means franco gestured a goahead continue it fell apart on you franco but you still had a button to push leak the story shove the mayor into the muck defend him but carefully if hes convicted you mourn the loss of a man who was corrupted by his own power his own skewed sense of duty if hes acquitted you praise the system for exonerating an innocent man but either way you step into his shoes and run the city maybe maybe some of it was about your twisted sense of justice but under it all it was just politics youre wrong franco wandered over picked up the second cup of coffee eve had programmed since its just the two of us here since i respect you i wont say youre wrong about all of it purity was a solution an extermination of a plague it could be again she angled her head we could have used someone like you pushing to have you as a media symbol wasnt an accident you have impact dallas with your passion your skills your presence youd keep the story hot as long as i needed i think i knew when we met in tibbles office youd find a way to break it apart i had to accept that deal with that i always pick my battles why this one every politician needs a platform this is mine dukes wanted to infect you she added but that wasnt the agenda that wasnt the program how many innocent children did we save dallas is that your spin if i needed one it would be and its the truth peachtree has good intentions but hes soft and hes cautious politically and sooner or later he was going to be exposed for his sexuality why should i go down with him so you nominated and pushed on greene as a twofer you eliminate another predator and you see that peachtrees sexual conduct is exposed and that hes under suspicion at the same time for multiple murder it bothered me that no attempt was made to get to the blackmail vids didnt make sense unless you turned it around that the idea was for them to be recovered and used the people on those vids deserve to be exposed for their weaknesses for their foolishness and for their dealings with a man like greene and youre the judge of all of that of all of them i am or part of a group of people who believe its time for judgment you and i dallas were neither soft nor cautious we act we make things happen ill be mayor of new york she said simply and in a few years governor from there east washington i will be the third female president of the united states before im fifty i could take you up with me wouldnt you like to be new yorks top cop dallas chief of police eve dallas i can make that happen in five maybe six years no thanks too much politics for me how do you plan to do all this franco from a cage how are you going to put me in a cage she countered ive been very careful as far as that transmission from peachtrees office my legal team will get around it it may have been set and saved for sending the assistant may have been mistaken about seeing me go into his office at that particular time its a very busy place but it wasnt set and saved and the assistant wasnt mistaken no but youll never prove it nothing ive said in this room will do you any good itll be your word against mine and at the moment dallas with the very efficient chang convinced you leaked this story to furst with public opinion still deadlocked over purity and your part in destroying it my words got a lot more juice than yours maybe maybe it does but your words are going to work just fine eve picked up her communicator i think that wraps it she said franco set her cup down with a snap you were wired oh yeah nothing said here is admissible you didnt read me my rights and you entrapped me everything i said was said in temper simply to get back at you for leaking the story good thinking well see what your lawyers can do with it jenna franco youre under arrest for conspiracy to murder as she listed the names eve pulled out her restraints even as franco stepped back the door opened the mayor came in first followed by whitney and tibble youre a disgrace jenna peachtree said quietly i hope the system you so callously misused gives you full justice i have nothing to say francos face turned to stone as eve cuffed her i want my attorneys i will not make any statements a little late for that eve glanced over as nadine came to the doorway her camera behind her you get it all every word nadine assured her live feed were through the roof you broadcast francos stony face went sheet white you had cameras in here just my little spin oh and if youre thinking about getting that tossed or using it to bite at the nypsd ill remind you that this is my office and you entered it without invitation i was under no legal obligation to inform you of security or media presence excuse me gentlemen eve maneuvered franco through the men who crowded into her tiny office peabody sir peabody stepped up from her spot in the hall read her her rights book her as franco was led away nadine on her heels shooting questions like laser blasts eve could hear francos terse and furious no comment lieutenant peachtree stepped out welldone id like to thank you for what you did for this department this city and for me personally i did my job if youd been part of it idve taken you down just as hard wasnt i he said looking after franco for not seeing what was under my nose whats under it is usually harder to see than whats in the distance perhaps he held out a hand shook hers chief commander we need to clean this up as tibble passed he nodded at eve media conference in one hour good work lieutenant thank you sir you and your team are commended whitney told her i want your report before the media conference yes sir ill get right on it shed just sat at her desk when roarke walked in that was quite a show yeah feeding her to
