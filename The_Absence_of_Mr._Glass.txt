the absence of mr glass the consulting room of dr orion hood the eminent criminologist and specialist in certain moral disorders lay along the seafront at scarborough in a series of very large and welllighted french windows which showed the german ocean like one endless outer wall of bluegreen marble in such a place the sea had something of the monotony of a bluegreen dado for the chambers themselves were ruled throughout by a terrible tidiness of the sea it must not be supposed that dr hoods apartments excluded luxury or even poetry these things were there in their place but one felt that they were never allowed out of their place luxury was there there stood upon a special table eight or ten boxes of the best cigars but they were built upon a plan so that the strongest were always nearest the wall and the mildest nearest the window a tantalus containing three kinds of spirit all of a liqueur excellence stood always on this table of luxury but the fanciful have asserted that the whisky brandy and rum seemed always to stand at the same level poetry was there the lefthand corner of the room was lined with as complete a set of english classics as the righthand could show of english and foreign physiologists but if one took a volume of chaucer or shelley from that rank its absence irritated the mind like a gap in a mans front teeth one could not say the books were never read probably they were but there was a sense of their being chained to their places like the bibles in old churches dr orion hood paced the length of his string of apartments bounded as the boys geographies say on the east by the german ocean and on the west by the serried ranks of his sociological and criminologist library he was clad in an artists velvet but with none of an artists negligence his hair was heavily shot with grey but growing thick and healthy his face was lean but sanguine and expectant everything about him and his room indicated something at once rigid and restless like that great northern sea by which on pure principles of hygiene he had built his home fate being in a funny mood pushed the door open and introduced into those long strict seaflanked apartments one who was perhaps the most startling opposite of them and their master in answer to a curt but civil summons the door opened inwards and there shambled into the room a shapeless little figure which seemed to find its own hat and umbrella as unmanageable as a mass of luggage the umbrella was a black and prosaic bundle long past repair the had was a broad curved black hat clerical but not very common in england the man was the very embodiment of all that is homely and helpless the doctor regarded the newcomer with a restrained astonishment not unlike that he would have shown if some huge but obviously harmless seabeast had crawled into his room the newcomer regarded the doctor with that beaming but breathless geniality which characterises a corpulent charwoman who has just managed to stuff herself into an omnibus it is a rich confusion of social selfcongratulation and bodily disarray his hat tumbled to the carpet his heavy umbrella slipped between his knees with a thud he reached after the one and ducked after the other but with an unimpaired smile on his round face spoke simultaneously as follows my name is brown pray excuse me i come about that business of the macnabs i have heard you often help people out of such troubles pray excuse me if i am wrong by this time he had sprawling recovered the hat and made an odd little bobbing bow over it as if setting everything quite right i hardly understand you replied the scientist with a cold intensity of manner i fear you have mistaken the chambers i am dr hood and my work is almost entirely literary and educational it is true that i have sometimes been consulted by the police in cases of peculiar difficulty and importance but oh this is of the greatest importance broke in the little man called brown why her mother wont let them get engaged and he leaned back in his chair in radiant rationality the brows of dr hood were drawn down darkly but the eyes under them were bright with something that might be anger or might be amusement and still he said i do not quite understand you see they want to get married said the man with the clerical hat maggie macnab and young todhunter want to get married now what can be more important than that the great orion hoods scientific triumphs had deprived him of many things some said of his health others of his god but they had not wholly despoiled him of his sense of the absurd at the last plea of the ingenuous priest a chuckle broke out of him from inside and he threw himself into an armchair in an ironical attitude of the consulting physician mr brown he said gravely it is quite fourteen and a half years since i was personally asked to test a personal problem then it was the case of an attempt to poison the french president at a lord mayors banquet it is now i understand a question of whether some friend of yours called maggie is a suitable fiance for some friend of hers called todhunter well mr brown i am a sportsman i will take it on i will give the macnab family my best advice as good as i gave the french republic and the king of england no better fourteen years better i have nothing else to do this afternoon tell me your story the little clergyman called brown thanked him with unquestionable warmth but still with a queer kind of simplicity it was rather as if he were thanking a stranger in a smokingroom for some trouble in passing the matches than as if he were as he was practically thanking the curator of kew gardens for coming with him into a field to find a fourleaved clover with scarcely a semicolon after his hearty thanks the little man began his recital i told you my name was brown well thats the fact and im the priest of the little catholic church i daresay youve seen beyond those straggly streets where the town ends towards the north in the last and straggliest of those streets which runs along the sea like a seawall there is a very honest but rather sharptempered member of my flock a widow called macnab she has one daughter and she lets lodgings and between her and the daughter and between her and the lodgers well i daresay there is a great deal to be said on both sides at present she has only one lodger the young man called todhunter but he has given more trouble than all the rest for he wants to marry the young woman of the house and the young woman of the house asked dr hood with huge and silent amusement what does she want why she wants to marry him cried father brown sitting up eagerly that is just the awful complication it is indeed a hideous enigma said dr hood this young james todhunter continued the cleric is a very decent man so far as i know but then nobody knows very much he is a bright brownish little fellow agile like a monkey cleanshaven like an actor and obliging like a born courier he seems to have quite a pocketful of money but nobody knows what his trade is mrs macnab therefore being of a pessimistic turn is quite sure it is something dreadful and probably connected with dynamite the dynamite must be of a shy and noiseless sort for the poor fellow only shuts himself up for several hours of the day and studies something behind a locked door he declares his privacy is temporary and justified and promises to explain before the wedding that is all that any one knows for certain but mrs macnab will tell you a great deal more than even she is certain of you know how the tales grow like grass on such a patch of ignorance as that there are tales of two voices heard talking the room though when the door is opened todhunter is always found alone there are tales of a mysterious tall man in a silk hat who once came out of the seamists and apparently out of the sea stepping softly across the sandy fields and through the small back garden at twilight till he was heard talking to the lodger at his open back window the colloquy seemed to end in a quarrel todhunter dashed down his window with violence and the mad in the high hat melted into the seafog again this story is told by the family with the fiercest mystification but i really think mrs macnab prefers her own original take that the other man or whatever it is crawls out every night from the big box in the corner which is kept locked all day you see therefore how this sealed door of todhunters is treated as the gate of all the fancies and monstrosities of the thousand and one nights and yet there is the little fellow in his respectable black jacket as punctual and innocent as a parlour clock he pays his rent to the tick he is practically a teetotaller he is tirelessly kind with the younger children and can keep them amused for a day on end and last and most urgent of all he has made himself equally popular with the eldest daughter who is ready to go to church with him tomorrow a man warmly concerned with any large theories has always a relish for applying them to any triviality the great specialist having condescended to the priests simplicity condescended expansively he settled himself with comfort in his armchair and began to talk in the tone of a somewhat absentminded lecturer even in a minute instance it is best to look first to the main tendencies of nature a particular flower may not be dead in early winter but the flowers are dying a particular pebble may never be wetted with the tide but the tide is coming in to the scientific eye all human history is a series of collective movements destructions or migrations like the massacre of flies in winter or the return of birds in spring now the root fact in all history is race race produces religion race produces legal and ethical wars there is no stronger case than that of the wild unworldly and perishing stock which we commonly call the celts of whom your friends the macnabs are specimens small swarthy and of this dreamy and drifting blood they accept easily the superstitious explanation of any incidents just as they still accept you will excuse me for saying that superstitious explanation of all incident which you and your church represent it is not remarkable that such people with the sea moaning behind them and the church excuse me again droning in front of them should put fantastic features into what are probably plain events you with your small parochial responsibilities see only this particular mrs macnab terrified with this particular tale of two voices and a tall man out of the sea but the man with the scientific imagination sees as it were the whole clan of macnab scattered over the whole world in its ultimate average as uniform as a tribe of birds he sees thousands of mrs macnabs in thousands of houses dropping their little drop of morbidity in the teacups of their friends he sees before the scientist could conclude his sentence another and more important summons sounded from without some one with swishing skirts was marshalled hurriedly down the corridor and the door opened on a young girl decently dressed but disordered and redhot with haste she had seablown blonde hair and would have been entirelybeautiful if her cheekbones had not been in the scotch manner a little high in relief as well as in colour her apology was almost as abrupt as a command im sorry to interrupt you sir she said but i had to follow father brown at once its nothing less than life or death father brown began to get to his feet in some disorder why what has happened maggie he said james has been murdered for all i can make out answered the girl still breathing hard from her rush that man glass has been with him again i heard them talking through the door quite plain two separate voices for james speaks low with a burr and the other voice was high and quavery that man glass repeated the priest in some perplexity i know his name is glass answered the girl in great impatience i heard it through the door they were quarrelling about money i think for i heard james say again and again thats right mr glass or no mr glass and then two and three mr glass but were talking too much you must come at once and there may be time yet but time for what asked dr hood who has been studying the young lady with marked interest what is there about mr glass and his money troubles that should impel such urgency i tried to break down the door and couldnt answered the girl shortly then i ran round to the back yard and managed to climb on to the windowsill that looks into the room it was all dim and seemed to be empty but i swear i saw james lying huddled up in a corner as if he were drugged or strangled this is serious said father brown gathering his errant had and umbrella and standing up in point of fact i was just putting your case before this gentleman and his view has been largely altered said the scientist gravely i do not think this young lady is so celtic as i had supposed as i have nothing else to do i will put on my hat and stroll down the town with you in a few minutes all three were approaching the dreary tail of the macnabs street the girl with the stern and breathless stride of the mountaineer the criminologist with a lounging grace which was not without a certain leopardlike swiftness and the priest at an energetic trot entirely devoid of distinction the aspect of this edge of town was not entirely without justification for the doctors hints about desolate moods and environments the scattered houses stood farther and farther apart in a broken string along the seashore the afternoon was closing with a premature and partly lurid twilight the sea was of an inky purple and murmuring ominously in the scrappy back garden of the macnabs which ran down towards the sand two black barrenlooking trees stood up like demon hands held up in astonishment and as mrs macnab ran down the street to meet them with lean hands similarly spread and her fierce face in shadow she was a little like a demon herself the doctor and the priest made scant reply to her shrill reiterations of her daughters story with the more disturbing details of her won to the divided vows of vengeance against mr glass for murdering and against mr todhunter for being murdered or against the latter for having dared to want to marry her daughter and for not having lived to do it they passed through the narrow passages in the front of the house until they came to the lodgers door at the back and there dr hood with the trick of an old detective put his shoulder sharply to the panel and burst in the door it opened on a scene of silent catastrophe no one seeing it even for a flash could doubt that the room had been the theatre of some thrilling collision between two or perhaps more persons playingcards lay littered across the table or fluttered about the floor as if a game had been interrupted two wineglasses stood ready for wine on a sidetable but a third lay smashed in a star of crystal upon the carpet a few feet from it lay what looked like a long knife or short sword straight but with an oriental and pictured handle its dull blade just caught a grey glint from the dreary window behind which showed the black trees against the leaden level of the sea towards the opposite corner of the room was rolled a gentlemans silk tophat as if it had just been knocked off his head so much so indeed that one almost looked to see it still rolling and in the corner behind it thrown like a sack of potatoes but corded like a railway trunk lay mr james todhunter with a scarf across his mouth and six or seven strong ropes knotted around his elbows and ankles his brown eyes were alive and shifted alertly dr orion hood paused for one instant on the doormat and drank in the whole scene of voiceless violence then he stepped swiftly across the carpet picked up the tall silk hat and gravely put it upon the head of the yet pinioned todhunter it was so much too large for him that it almost slipped down on to his shoulders mr glasss hat said the doctor returning it and peering into the inside with a pocket lens how to explain the absence of mr glass and the presence of mr glasss hat for mr glass is not a careless man with his clothes this hat is of a stylish shape and systematically brushed and burnished though not very new an old dandy i should think but good heavens called out miss macnab arent you going to untie the man first i say old with intention though not with certainty continued the expositor my own reason for it might seem a little farfetched the hair of human beings falls out in very varying degrees but almost always falls out slightly and with this lens i should see the tiny hairs in a hat recently worn it has none which leads me to guess that mr glass is bald now when this is taken with the highpitched and querulous voice which miss macnab described so vividly patience my dear lady patience when we take the hairless head together with the tone common in senile anger i should think we may deduce some advance in years nevertheless he was probably vigorous and he was almost certainly tall i might rely in some degree on the story of his previous appearance at the window as a tall man in a silk hat but i think i have more exact indication this wineglass has been smashed all over the place but one of its splinters lies on the high bracket beside the mantelpiece no such fragment could have fallen there if the vessel had been smashed in the hand of a comparatively short man like mr todhunter by the way said father brown might it not be as well to untie mr todhunter our lesson from the drinkingvessels does not end here proceeded the specialist i may say at once that it is possible that the man glass was bald or nervous through dissipation rather than age mr todhunter as has been remarked is a quiet thrifty gentleman essentially an abstainer these cards and winecups are no part of his normal habit they have been produced for a particular companion but as it happens we may go further mr todhunter mayor may not possess this wine service but there is no appearance of his possessing any wine what then were these vessels to contain i would at once suggest some brandy or whisky perhaps of a luxurious sort from a flask in the pocket of mr glass we have thus something like a picture of the man or at least of the type tall elderly fashionable but somewhat frayed certainly fond of play and strong waters and perhaps rather too fond of them mr glass is a gentleman not unknown on the fringes of society look here cried the young woman if you dont let me pass to untie him ill run outside and scream for the police i should not advise you miss macnab said dr hood gravely to be in any hurry to fetch the police father brown i seriously ask you to compose your flock for their sakes not for mine well we have seen something of the figure and quality of mr glass what are the chief facts known of mr todhunter they are substantially three that he is economical that he is more or less wealthy and that he has a secret now surely it is obvious that these are the three chief marks of the kind of man who is blackmailed and surely it is equally obvious that the faded finery the profligate habits and the shrill irritation of mr glass are the unmistakable marks of the kind of man who blackmails him we have the two typical figures of a tragedy of hushmoney on the one hand the respectable man with a mystery on the other the west end vulture with a scent for a mystery these two men have met here today and have quarrelled using blows and a bare weapon are you going to take those ropes off asked the girl stubbornly dr hood placed the silk hat carefully on the sidetable and went across to the captive he studied him intently eyen moving him a little and half turning him round by the shoulders but he only answered no i think these ropes will do very well till your friends the police bring the handcuffs father brown who had been looking dully at the carpet lifted his round face and said what do you mean the man of science had picked up the peculiar daggersword from the carpet and was examining it intently as he answered because you find mr todhunter tied up he said you all jump to the conclusion that mr glass has tied him up and then i suppose escaped there are four objections to this first why should a gentleman so dressy as our friend glass leave his hat behind him if he left of his own free will second he continued moving towards the window this is the only exit and it is locked on the inside third this blade here has a tiny touch of blood at the point but there is no wound on mr todhunter mr glass took that wound away with him dead or alive add to all this primary probability it is much more likely that the blackmailed person would try to kill his incubus rather than that the blackmailer would try to kill the goose that lays his golden eggs there i think we have a pretty complete story but the ropes enquired the priest whose eyes had remained open with a rather vacant admiration ah the ropes said the expert with a singular intonation miss macnab very much wanted to know why i did not set mr todhunter free from his ropes well i will tell her i did not do it because mr todhunter can set himself free from them at any minute he chooses what cried the audience on three quite different notes of astonishment i have looked at all the knots on mr todhunter reiterated hood quietly i happen to know something about knots they are quite a branch of criminal science every one of those knots he has made himself and could loosen himself not one of them would have been made by an enemy really trying to pinion him the whole of this affair of the ropes is a clever fake to make us think him the victim of the struggle instead of the wretched glass whose corpse may be hidden in the garden or stuffed up the chimney the face of the little catholic priest which was commonly complacent and even comic had suddenly become knotted with a curious frown it was not the blank curiosity of his first innocence it was rather that creative curiosity which comes when a man has the beginnings of an idea say it again please he said in a simple bothered manner do you mean that todhunter can tie himself up all alone and untie himself all alone that is what i mean said the doctor jerusalem ejaculated brown suddenly i wonder if it could possibly be that he scuttled across the room rather like a rabbit and peered with quite a new impulsiveness into the partially covered face of the captive then he turned his own rather fatuous face to the company yes thats it he cried in a certain excitement cant you see it in the mans face why look at his eyes both the professor and the girl followed the direction of his glance and though the broad black scarf completely masked the lower half of todhunters visage they did grow conscious of something struggling and intense about the upper part of it his eyes do look queer cried the young woman strongly moved you brutes i believe its hurting him not that i think said dr hood the eyes have certainly a singular expression but i should interpret those transverse wrinkles as expressing rather such slight psychological abnormality oh bosh cried father brown cant you see hes laughing laughing repeated the doctor with a start but what on earth can he be laughing at well replied the reverend brown apologetically not to put too fine a point on it i think hes laughing at you and indeed im a little inclined to laugh at myself now i know about it now you know about what asked hood in some exasperation now i know replied the priest the profession of mr todhunter he shuffled about the room looking at one object after another with what seemed to be a vacant stare and then invariably bursting into an equally vacant laugh a highly irritating process for those who had to watch it he laughed very much over the hat still more uproariously over the broken glass but the blood on the swordpoint sent him into mortal convulsions of amusement then he turned to the fuming specialist dr hood he cried enthusiastically you are a great poet you have called an uncreated being out of the void how much more godlike that is than if you had only ferreted out the mere facts indeed the mere facts are rather commonplace and comic by comparison i have no notion what you are talking about said dr hood rather haughtily my facts are all inevitable though necessarily incomplete a place may be permitted to intuition perhaps or poetry if you prefer the term but only because the corresponding details can not as yet be ascertained in the absence of mr glass thats it thats it said the little priest nodding quite eagerly thats the first idea to get fixed the absence of mr glass he is so extremely absent i suppose he added reflectively that there was never anybody so absent as mr glass do you mean he is absent from the town demanded the doctor i mean he is absent from everywhere answered father brown he is absent from the nature of things so to speak do you seriously mean said the specialist with a smile that there is no such person the priest made a sign of assent it does seem a pity he said orion hood broke into a contemptuous laugh well he said before we go on to the hundred and one other evidences let us take the first proof we found the first fact we fell over when we fell into this room if there is no mr glass whose hat is this it is mr todhunters replied brown but it doesnt fit him cried hood impatiently he couldnt possibly wear it father brown shook his head with ineffable mildness i never said he could wear it he answered i said it was his hat or if you insist on a shade of difference a hat that is his and where is the shade of difference asked the criminologist with a slight sneer my good sir cried the mild little man with his first movement akin to impatience if you will walk down the street to the nearest hatters shop you will see that there is in common speech a difference between a mans hat and the hats that are his but a hatter protested hood can get money out of his stock of new hats what could todhunter get out of this one old hat rabbits replied father brown promptly what cried dr hood rabbits ribbons sweetmeats goldfish rolls of coloured paper said the reverend gentleman with rapidity didnt you see it all when you found out the faked ropes its just the same with the sword mr todhunter hasnt got a scratch on him as you say but hes got a scratch in him if you follow me do you mean inside mr todhunters clothes enquired mrs macnab sternly i do not mean inside mr todhunters clothes said father brown i mean inside mr todhunter well what in the name of bedlam do you mean mr todhunter explained father brown placidly is learning to be a professional conjuror as well as juggler ventriloquist and expert in the rope trick the conjuring explains the hat it is without traces of hair not because it is worn by the prematurely bald mr glass but because it has never been worn by anybody the juggling explains the three glasses which todhunter was teaching himself to throw up and catch in rotation but being only at the stage of practice he smashed one glass against the ceiling and the juggling also explains the sword which it was mr todhunters professional pride and duty to swallow but again being at the stage of practice he very slightly grazed the inside of his throat with the weapon hence he has a wound inside him which i am sure from the expression of his face is not a serious one he was also practising the trick of a release from ropes like the davenport brothers and he was just about to free himself when we all burst into the room the cards of course are for card tricks and they are scattered on the floor because he had just been practising one of those dodges of sending them flying through the air he merely kept his trade secret because he had to keep his tricks secret like any other conjuror but the mere fact of an idler in a tophat having once looked in at his back window and been driven away by him with great indignation was enough to set us all on a wrong track of romance and make us imagine his whole life overshadowed by the silkhatted spectre of mr glass but what about the two voices asked maggie staring have you never heard a ventriloquist asked father brown dont you know they always speak first in their natural voice and then answer themselves in just that shrill squawky unnatural voice that you heard there was a long silence and dr hood regarded the little man who had spoken with a dark and attentive smile you are certainly a very ingenious person he said it could not have been done better in a book but there is just one part of mr glass you have not succeeded in explaining away and that is his name miss macnab distinctly heard him so addressed by mr todhunter the rev mr brown broke into a rather childish giggle well that he said thats the silliest part of the whole silly story when our juggling friend here threw up the three glasses in turn he counted them aloud as he caught them and also commented aloud when he failed to catch them what he really said was one two and three missed a glass one two missed a glass and so on there was a second stillness in the room and then everyone with one accord burst out laughing as they did so the figure in the corner complacently uncoiled all the ropes and let them fall with a flourish then advancing into the middle of the room with a low bow he produced from his pocket a big bill printed in blue and red which announced that zaladin the worlds greatest conjuror contortionist ventriloquist and human kangaroo would be ready with an entirely new series of tricks at the empire pavilion scarborough on monday next at eight oclock precisely
