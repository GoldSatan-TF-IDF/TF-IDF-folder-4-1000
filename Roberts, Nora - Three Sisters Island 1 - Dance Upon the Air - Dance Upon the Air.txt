prologue salem village massachusetts june in the dark green shadows of the deep woods an hour before moonrise they met in secret soon the longest day would become the shortest night of the solstice there would be no celebration no rite of thanksgiving for the light the warmth on this sabbat of litha this midsummer was a time of ignorance and of death the three who met met in fear have we all we need the one known here as air pulled her hood closer so that not a single pale lock of hair could be seen in the light of the dying day what we have shall do earth laid her parcel on the ground the part of her that wanted to weep and to rage over what had been done over what was to come was buried deep with her head bent her thick brown hair fell forward free is there no other way for us air touched a hand to earths shoulder and both looked at the third she stood slim and straight there was sorrow in her eyes but behind it lived a firm purpose she who was fire threw back her hood in a gesture of defiance curling waves of red spilled out it is because of our way there is no other they will hunt us down like thieves and brigands murder us as they have already murdered a poor innocent bridget bishop was not a witch earth spoke bitterly as she rose to her feet no and so she told the court of oyer and terminer so she swore yet they hanged her murdered over the lies of a few young girls and the ravings of the fanatics who smell brimstone in every breath of air but there have been petitions air linked her fingers together like a woman preparing to pray or plead not everyone supports the court or this terrible persecution too little earth murmured and far too late it will not end with one death i have seen it fire closed her eyes saw again the horrors to come our protection cannot outlast the hunt they will find us and they will destroy us we have done nothing air dropped her hands to her sides no harm what harm did bridget bishop do fire countered what harm have any of the others accused and waiting trial done to the people of salem town sarah osborne died in a boston prison for what crime temper lanced through her hot and keen and was ruthlessly rejected even now she refused to let power be stained by anger and hate the blood is up in these puritans she continued these pioneers fanatics they are and they will bring a wave of death before sanity returns if we could help we cannot stop it sister no fire nodded at earth all we can do is survive so we leave this place the home we made here the lives we might have led here and make another gently she cupped airs face in her hands grieve not for what can never be but celebrate what can we are the three and we will not be vanquished in this place we will be lonely we will be together and in that last flicker of the day they cast the circle one by two by three fire ringed around the earth and the wind lifted the flames high inside the magic circle they formed another joining hands accepting now air lifted her face to the sky as night takes the day we offer this light we are true to the way and stand for the right truth here is done a circle of one earth defiant raised her voice this hour is our last upon this ground present future past we will not be found strength not rue a circle of two we offered our craft with harm to none but the hunt for our blood has already begun we will make our place away from here fire lifted joined hands high away from death away from fear power lives free a circle of three the wind kicked the earth trembled and the magic fire speared through the night three voices rose in unison away from hate let this land be torn lift it from fear from death and scorn carve rock carve tree carve hill and stream carry us with it on midsummer moonbeam out past the cliff and out past the shore to be severed from this land forever more we take our island out to the sea as we will so mote it be and a great roar sounded in the forest a swirling torrent of wind a wild leap of fire while those who hunted what they never understood slept in their righteous beds an island rose up toward sky circled madly toward sea settled safe and serene on quiet waves and took its first breath of life on that shortest night chapter one contents prev next three sisters island june she kept staring straight ahead as the knuckle of land bumpy and green with distance began revealing its secrets the lighthouse of course what was an offshore new england island without its stalwart spear this one pure and dazzling white rose on a craggy cliff just as it should nell thought there was a stone house near it foggray in the sharp summer sunlight with peaked roofs and gables and what she hoped was a widows walk circling the top story shed seen paintings of the light of the sisters and the house that stood so strong and firm beside it it was the one shed seen in the little shop on the mainland the one that had sent her impulsively to the car ferry shed been following impulse and instinct for six months just two months after her meticulous and hardworked plan had freed her every moment of those first two months had been terror then gradually terror had eased to anxiety and a different kind of fear almost like a hunger that she would lose what she had found again she had died so she could live now she was tired of running of hiding of losing herself in crowded cities she wanted a home wasnt that what shed always wanted a home roots family friends the familiar that never judged too harshly maybe she would find some part of that here on this spit of land cradled by the sea surely she could get no farther away from los angeles than this pretty little island not unless she left the country altogether if she couldnt find work on the island she could still take a few days there a kind of vacation from flight she decided she would enjoy the rocky beaches the little village she would climb the cliffs and roam the thick wedge of forest shed learned how to celebrate and cherish every moment of being it was something she would never ever forget again delighted with the scatter of clapboard cottages tucked back from the dock she leaned on the rail of the ferry let the wind blow through her hair it was back to its natural sundrenched blond when shed run shed hacked it short as a boys gleefully snipping off the long tumbling curls then dying it deep brown over the past months shed changed the color periodically bright red coal black a soft sable brown she still kept it fairly short and very straight it said something didnt it that shed finally been able to let it be something about reclaiming herself she thought evan had liked it long with a riot of curls at times he had dragged her by it across the floor down the stairs using it like chains no she would never wear it long again a shudder ran through her and she glanced quickly over her shoulder scanning the cars the people her mouth went dry her throat hot as she searched for a tall slim man with gilded hair and eyes as pale and hard as glass he wasnt there of course he was three thousand miles away she was dead to him hadnt he told her a hundred times that the only way she would be free of him was in death helen remington had died so nell channing could live furious with herself for going back even for a moment in her mind nell tried to calm herself she breathed in slowly salt air water freedom as her shoulders relaxed again a tentative smile played around her mouth she stayed at the rail a small woman with short sunny hair that danced cheerfully around a delicate face her mouth unpainted and soft curved up and teased out the hint of dimples in her cheeks pleasure brought a rosy glow to her skin she wore no makeup another deliberate act there was a part of her that was still hiding still hunted and she did whatever she could to pass unnoticed once she had been considered a beauty and had groomed herself accordingly shed dressed as shed been told to dress wearing sleek sexy sophisticated clothes selected by a man who claimed to love her above all things shed known the feel of silk against her skin what it was to casually clasp diamonds around her throat helen remington had known all the privileges of great wealth and for three years had lived in fear and misery nell wore a simple cotton shirt over faded jeans her feet were comfortable in cheap white sneakers her only jewelry was an antique locket that had been her mothers some things were too precious to leave behind as the ferry slowed to dock she walked back to her car she would arrive on three sisters with one small bag of belongings a rusted secondhand buick and to her name she couldnt have been happier nothing she thought as she parked the car near the docks and began to wander on foot could have been farther from the pleasure palaces and glitz of beverly hills and nothing she realized had ever called more truly to her soul than this little postcard village houses and shops were both tidy and prim with their colors faded by sea salt and sun cobblestone streets were curvy and whistleclean as they climbed the hilly terrain or arrowed back to the docks gardens were lovingly tended as if weeds were illegal dogs barked behind picket fences and children rode bikes of cherry red and electric blue the docks themselves were a study in industry boats and nets and ruddycheeked men in tall rubber boots she could smell fish and sweat she hiked up the hill from the docks and turned to look back from there she could see the tour boats plugging along in the bay and the little sickle slash of sand beach where people spread out on towels or bobbed in the energetic surf a little red tram with white letters that read three sisters tours was rapidly filling up with daytrippers and their cameras fishing and tourism she supposed were what kept the island afloat but that was economics it stood against sea storms and time surviving and flourishing at its own pace that she thought was courage it had taken her too long to find her own high street speared across the hill shops and restaurants and what she supposed were island businesses lined it one of the restaurants should be her first stop she thought it was possible she could hook a job as a waitress or shortorder cook at least for the summer season if she could find work she could hunt up a room she could stay in a few months people would know her theyd wave as she walked by or call out her name she was so tired of being a stranger of having no one to talk to no one who cared she stopped to study the hotel unlike the other buildings it was stone instead of wood its three stories with elaborate gingerbread iron balconies and peaked roofs were undeniably romantic the name suited it she decided the magick inn it was a good bet that shed find work there waitressing in the dining room or as part of the housekeeping staff a job was the first order of business but she couldnt make herself go inside deal with it she wanted time first a little time before she settled down to the practical flighty evan would have said youre much too flighty and foolish for your own good helen thank god you have me to take care of you because his voice played all too clearly in her ears because the words nipped at the confidence shed slowly rebuilt she turned deliberately away and walked in the opposite direction she would get a damn job when she was ready to but for now she was going to wander to play tourist to explore when she was finished roaming high street shed go back to her car and drive all over the island she wouldnt even stop at the island tourist board to get a map following her nose she hitched up her backpack and crossed the street she passed craft shops gift shops loitered at the windows she enjoyed pretty things that sat on shelves without purpose one day when she settled again shed make a home just as she pleased full of clutter and fun and color an ice cream shop made her smile there were round glass tables and white iron chairs a family of four sat at one laughing as they spooned up whipped cream and confetticolored sprinkles a boy wearing a white cap and apron stood behind the counter and a girl in snug cutoff jeans flirted with him as she considered her choices nell sketched the picture in her mind and walked on the bookstore stopped her made her sigh her home would be full of books too but not rare first editions never meant to be opened and read shed have old scarred books shiny new paperbacks all in a jumble of stories in fact that was one thing she could start now a paperback novel wouldnt add much weight to her pack if she had to move on she looked up from the display in the window to the gothic lettering spilling across the glass café book well that was perfect she would hunt through the stacks find something fun to read and look through it over a cup of coffee she stepped inside to air that was fragrant with flowers and spice and heard music played on pipes and harps not only the hotel was magic nell thought the minute she crossed the threshold books in a banquet of colors and shapes lined deep blue shelves overhead tiny pricks of light showered down from the ceiling like stars the checkout counter was an old oak cabinet deeply carved with winged faeries and crescent moons a woman with dark choppy hair sat on a high stool behind it idly paging through a book she glanced up and adjusted silverframed reading glasses morning can i help you im just going to look around if thats all right enjoy let me know if i can help you find anything as the clerk went back to her book nell roamed across the room two generous chairs faced a stone hearth on the table between stood a lamp fashioned from a figurine of a robed woman with her arms lifted high other shelves held trinkets statues of colored stone crystal eggs dragons she wandered through passing books on one side rows of candles on the other at the rear stairs curved to the second floor she climbed and found more books more trinkets and the café half a dozen tables of glossy wood were arranged near the front window along the side was a glass display and counter boasting an impressive array of pastries sandwiches and a kettle of that days soup the prices were on the high side but not unreasonable nell thought she might have some soup to go with her coffee moving closer she heard the voices from the open door behind the counter jane this is ridiculous and totally irresponsible it is not its tims big chance and its a way off this damn island were taking it the possibility of an audition for a play that may or may not be produced off broadway is not a big chance neither one of you will have a job you wont were going mia i told you id work till noon today and i worked till noon you told me that less than twentyfour hours ago there was impatience in the voice a low lovely voice unable to help herself nell edged closer how the hell am i going to keep the café up without anyone to cook its all about you isnt it you cant even wish us luck jane ill wish you a miracle because thats what its going to take no wait dont go off in a huff nell caught movement in the doorway and stepped to the side but she didnt move out of earshot be careful be happy oh damn it blessed be jane okay there was a loud sniffle im sorry really im sorry for leaving you in the lurch this way but tim needs to do this and i need to be with tim so ill miss you mia ill write nell managed to duck behind shelves just as a weeping woman raced out of the back and ran down the stairs well isnt this just fine nell peeked out blinked in automatic admiration the woman who stood in the doorway was a vision nell couldnt think of another word for her she had a mass of hair the color of autumn leaves reds and golds spilled over the shoulders of a long blue dress that left her arms bare to the silver bracelets that winked bright on each wrist her eyes sparking with temper were gray as smoke and dominated a flawless face slashing cheekbones a full wide mouth painted siren red skin like nell had heard skin compared to alabaster but this was the first time shed seen it she was tall willowslim and perfect nell glanced toward the café tables to see if any of the customers who loitered there were as awestruck as she herself but no one seemed to notice the woman or the temper swirling around her like water on the boil she inched out to get a better look and those gray eyes shifted pinned her hello can i help you i was i thought id like a cup of cappuccino and a bowl of soup please annoyance flashed in mias eyes and nearly sent nell back behind the shelves i can handle the soup we have lobster bisque today im afraid the espresso machine is beyond my current capabilities nell looked at the beautiful copperandbrass machine felt a little tingle i could make it myself you know how to work this thing yes actually i do considering mia gestured and nell scurried behind the counter i could make you one while im at it why not brave little rabbit mia mused as she watched nell take over the machine just what sent you to my door backpacking no oh nell flushed remembering her pack no just exploring a little im looking for a job and a room ah excuse me i know it was rude but i overheard your conversation if i understand it correctly youre in a bit of a jam i can cook mia watched the steam rise listened to the hiss can you im a very good cook nell offered mia the frothing coffee ive done catering ive worked in a bakery and ive waitressed i know how to prepare food and how to serve it how old are you twentyeight do you have a criminal record a giggle nearly burst out of nells throat for a moment it danced lively in her eyes no im tediously honest a dependable worker and a creative cook dont babble dont babble she ordered herself but she couldnt seem to stop i need the job because id like to live on the island id like a job here because i enjoy books and i liked the well the feel of your shop as soon as i walked in intrigued mia angled her head and what did you feel possibilities excellent answer mia mused do you believe in possibilities nell considered yes ive had to excuse me a couple stepped up to the counter wed like to have two iced mochas and two of those éclairs of course just a moment mia turned back to nell youre hired aprons in the back well work out the details later today she sipped her cappuccino well done she added and stepped out of the way oh whats your name im nell nell channing welcome to three sisters nell channing mia devlin ran café book the way she ran her life with a style born out of instinct and largely for her personal amusement she was a crafty businesswoman who enjoyed making a profit but always on her own terms what bored her she ignored what intrigued her she pursued at the moment nell channing intrigued her if nell had been exaggerating her skills mia would have fired her as quickly as shed hired her and with no regret she may have if the spirit moved her helped nell secure a job elsewhere but that wouldnt have taken much time or interfered with her business shed have taken that step only because something about nell had tugged at her the instant those big blue eyes met hers injured innocence that had been mias first impression and she trusted her first impressions implicitly competence as well mia thought though the confidence was a little shaky still once nell had suited up and started work at the café shed steadied in that area too mia observed her through the afternoon noted that she handled the food orders the customers the cash register and the baffling mystery of the espresso machine smoothly theyd need to spruce her up a bit mia decided they were casual on the island but the ancient jeans were a bit too laidback for mias personal taste satisfied for the moment mia walked back into the café kitchen it impressed her that the counters and appliances were clean jane had never managed to be a tidy cook even though most of the baked goods had been prepared by her offsite nell taken by surprise nell jolted and spun around from the stove where shed been scrubbing burners her cheeks flushed as she looked at mia and the young woman beside her didnt mean to startle you this is peg she works the counter from two to seven oh hello hi jeez i cant believe jane and tim are just leaving new york city peg sounded a bit envious she was little and perky with a mop of curly hair bleached nearly white jane made awesome blueberry muffins yes well jane and her muffins arent here anymore i need to talk to nell now so youre in charge of the café no problem catch you later nell why dont we use my office well get to those details were open from ten to seven summer hours in the winter we cut back and close at five peg prefers the afternoon shift she likes to party and isnt a morning person in any case since we start serving at ten ill need you here in the morning thats okay with me she followed mia up another flight of steps she hadnt paid attention nell realized she hadnt known the shop had three floors a few months before she would never have missed that detail shed have checked out the space the exits relaxing didnt mean getting sloppy she reminded herself she had to be ready at any time to run again they passed a large storeroom lined with bookshelves and stacked with boxes then went through a doorway into mias office the antique cherry desk suited her nell thought she imagined mia surrounded by the rich and the beautiful there were flowers here and thriving plants little bits of crystal and polished rocks in bowls along with the stylish furnishings were a topoftheline computer a fax filing cabinets and shelves for publishers catalogs mia gestured to a chair and took the one behind the desk for herself you had a few hours in the café so youve seen the type of fare we offer theres a specialty sandwich each day the days soup a small selection of alternate sandwiches two or three varieties of cold salads pastries cookies muffins biscotti in the past i left the menu choices up to the cook are you comfortable with that yes maam please im barely a year older than you its mia until were sure this is going to work id prefer you make up the next days menu for my approval she took a legal pad out of the drawer passed it across the desk why dont you write down what you have in mind for tomorrow panic wanted to crawl through her tremble in her fingers nell took a deep breath waited until her mind was blank and clear then began to write this time of year i think we should keep the soups light herbed consommé tortellini salad a white bean and a shrimp id do a spicedchicken pita for the sandwich and a vegetarian selection but id have to see whats in season i can make you tarts again depending on what looks good fruitwise the éclairs are popular i can duplicate those a sixlayer chocolateandcream torte awesome blueberry muffins as well as walnut youre low on hazelnut biscotti cookies chocolate chip is never wrong macadamia instead of a third cookie id offer brownies i make an irresistible triplefudge brownie how much can you prepare onsite all of it i guess but if youre going to serve the pastries and muffins starting at ten ill need to start about six if you had your own kitchen oh well what a lovely fantasy that was id prep some of the menu the night before bake fresh in the morning umhmm how much money do you have nell channing enough dont be prickly mia advised breezily i can advance you a hundred dollars going against a salary to start of seven an hour youll log your shopping cooking hours daily youll charge what you need foodwise to the stores account ill want the receipts again daily when nell opened her mouth to speak mia simply lifted one slim coraltipped finger wait youll be expected to serve and to clear tables when theres a rush and to assist customers in the book section on your level during lulls you get two halfhour breaks sundays off and a fifteen percent employee discount on purchases not including food or drink which unless you turn out to be a glutton will be part of your perks with me so far yes but i good im here every day if you have a question or problem you cant handle get me if im not available go to lulu shes usually at the counter on the main floor and she knows everything you look quick enough to catch on if you dont know an answer dont be afraid to ask now youre looking for a place to stay yes it was like being swept away by a fast unexpected wind i hope to come with me mia pulled a set of keys out of a drawer pushed away from the desk and clipped out she wore gorgeous needlethin heels nell noted once they were on the main level she walked straight toward a rear door lulu she called out back in ten feeling clumsy and foolish nell followed her through the back exit and into a small garden paved with steppingstones a huge black cat sunned itself on one of them and blinked open one luminous gold eye as mia stepped nimbly over thats isis she wont trouble you shes beautiful is the garden your work yes no place is a home without flowers oh i didnt ask do you have transportation yes i have a car it can loosely be called transportation thats handy you wont have far to go but itd be troublesome to cart your goods on foot every day at the edge of the lot she turned left kept up her brisk pace passed the backs of shops across from neatly kept houses ms im sorry i dont know your last name its devlin but i told you to call me mia mia im grateful for the job for the chance and i can promise you you wont be sorry but can i ask where were going you need a place she turned a corner stopped and gestured that should do it across the narrow side street sat a little yellow house like a cheerful sunbeam at the edge of a tiny grove of stunted trees the shutters were white as was the narrow strip of porch there were flowers there too in a happy dance of bright summer colors it sat back from the road on a neat square of lawn with trees tucking it into shade and dappled sunlight is this your house nell asked yes for the moment jingling the keys mia walked up the flagstone path i bought it last spring had been compelled to mia remembered an investment shed told herself though she a businesswoman down to the bone had done nothing so far about renting it out shed waited just as she understood the house had waited she unlocked the front door stepped back its been blessed excuse me mia only nodded welcome the furnishings were sparse a simple sofa that desperately needed recovering a deepcushioned chair a scatter of tables bedrooms on either side though the one to the left is more suited to an office or study the bathrooms minute but charming and the kitchens been modernized and should do very well its straight back ive worked on the gardens but they need more care theres no ac but the furnace works still youll be glad the fireplace works as well come january its wonderful unable to resist nell wandered poking her head in the main bedroom where a pretty bed with a white iron headboard stood like a fairy cottage you must love living here i dont live here you do nell turned back slowly there was mia in the center of the little room her hands cupped together with the keys in her palm light beamed through the two front windows and seemed to set her hair to flame i dont understand you need a place i have a place i live on the cliffs i prefer it there this is your place for now dont you feel it she only knew she felt happy and full of nerves at the same time and that the moment shed stepped into the house shed wanted to stretch and settle very much like the cat in the sunshine i can stay here lifes been hard hasnt it mia murmured that youd tremble at good fortune youll pay rent for nothing that comes free holds its value well work the terms out of your salary settle in youll have to come back and sign forms and so on but that can wait for the morning island market is your best source for the ingredients youll need for tomorrows menu ill let them know youre coming so you can charge to the store account any pots pans whatever are your expense but ill float that until the end of the month i expect to see you and your creations by ninethirty sharp she stepped over and dropped the keys into nells limp hand any questions too many to know where to begin i dont know how to thank you dont waste your tears little sister mia replied theyre too precious youll work hard for what you make here i cant wait to get started nell held out her hand thank you mia their hands touched clasped a spark snapped out blue as flame and quickly gone with a half laugh nell jerked back must be a lot of static or something in the air or something well welcome home nell turning mia started for the door mia emotion gathered in her throat ached there i said this was like a fairy cottage you must be my fairy godmother mias smile was dazzling and her laughter low and rich as warmed cream youll find out soon enough im far from it im just a practical witch dont forget to bring me the receipts she added and quietly closed the door behind her chapter two contents prev next the village nell decided was a bit like brigadoon as seen by nathaniel hawthorne shed taken some time to explore before shed gone to the market for months shed told herself she was safe she was free but for the first time wandering the pretty streets with their quaint houses breathing in the sea air listening to the sharp new england voices she felt safe and free no one knew her but they would they would know nell channing the clever cook who lived in the little cottage in the wood she would make friends here and a life a future nothing from the past would touch her here one day she would be as much a part of the island as the narrow post office with its faded gray wood or the tourist center cobbled together by old clinker bricks and the long sturdy dock where fishermen brought their daily catch to celebrate she bought a wind chime fashioned of stars that she saw in a shop window it was her first purchase for pleasure in nearly a year she spent her first night on the island in the lovely bed hugging her happiness to her as she listened to the stars ring and the sea breathe she was up before sunrise eager to begin while the days soup simmered she rolled out pastry dough shed spent every penny she had including most of the advance and a good portion of her next months salary on kitchen tools it didnt matter she would have the best and produce the best mia devlin her benefactor would never have cause to regret taking her on everything in the kitchen was precisely as she wanted it not as shed been told it must be when she had time she would make a run to the islands garden center for herbs some she would plant outside the windowsill all cluttered together the way she liked things to be nothing absolutely nothing in her home would be uniform and precise and stylishly sleek she wouldnt have acres of marble or seas of glass or towering urns of terrifyingly exotic flowers without warmth or scent there wouldnt be she stopped herself it was time to stop reminding herself of what wouldnt be and plan what would be yesterday would hound her until she firmly closed the door on it and shot the bolt while the sun came up turning the eastfacing windows to flame she slid the first batch of tarts into the oven she remembered the rosycheeked woman who had helped her at the market dorcas burmingham such a fine yankee name nell thought and full of welcome and curiosity the curiosity would have shut nell down once turned her inward but shed been able to chat to answer some questions breezily and avoid others tarts cooled on the rack and muffins went into the oven as the kitchen filled with light nell sang to welcome the day lulu folded her arms over her skinny chest it was mia knew her way of trying to look intimidating as lulu barely inched up to five feet weighed ninety pounds soaking wet and had the face of a woeful pixie it took work for her to look intimidating you dont know anything about her i know shes alone looking for work and in the right place at the right time shes a stranger you dont just hire a stranger and lend her money give her a house without at least doing a background check not one reference mia not one for all you know shes a psychopath running from the law youve been reading true crime books again havent you lulu scowled an expression that on her harmless face approximated a pained smile there are bad people in the world yes there are mia printed out the mailorder requests that had come through her computer without them wed have no balance no challenge shes running from something lu but not the law and fate pointed her here it brought her to me and sometimes fates a backstabber im well aware of that with the printouts in hand mia walked out of the office lulu on her heels only the fact that lulu cabot had essentially raised her prevented mia from telling her to mind her own business and you should know i can protect myself you take in strays your guard goes down shes not a stray shes a seeker theres a difference i felt something from her mia added as she started downstairs to fill the orders when shes more comfortable ill look closer at least get a reference mia lifted a brow as she heard the back door open i just got one shes prompt dont poke at her lulu mia ordered as she handed the printouts over shes also tender yet well good morning nell good morning arms full of covered trays nell breezed in i pulled my car around back thats all right isnt it thats just fine need a hand oh no thanks i have everything stacked in the car lulu this is nell you can get acquainted later nice to meet you lulu ill just start setting things up you go right ahead mia waited until nell climbed the stairs looks dangerous doesnt she lulu set her jaw looks can be deceiving moments later nell jogged downstairs again she wore a plain white tshirt tucked into her jeans the little gold locket lay against it like a charm i started a first pot of coffee ill bring some down next trip but i dont know how you like it black for me sweet and light for lu thanks um would you mind not going up to the café until ive finished id really like you to see the whole presentation so just she backed toward the door face flushed as she spoke wait okay eager to please mia commented as she and lulu filled the orders eager to work yes definite psychopathic tendencies call the cops shut up twenty minutes later breathless jangled with pleasure and nerves nell came downstairs again can you come up now i still have time to change things around if it doesnt suit you oh could you come too lulu mia said you know everything about the shop so youd know if it doesnt look the way it should hmph grudgingly lulu stopped ringing up the mail orders cafés not my department but with a shrug she followed mia and nell upstairs the display case was brimming with glossy pastries widetopped muffins and scones popping with golden currants a tall torte gleamed under a sleek chocolate frosting and laces of whipped cream cookies as big as a mans palm covered two delicate white sheets of bakers paper wafting out of the kitchen was the scent of soup simmering on the chalkboard written in a fine and careful hand were the days specials the glass had been polished to a gleam the coffee was irresistibly fragrant and a pale blue canning jar filled with cinnamon sticks stood on the counter mia walked up and down the display like a general inspecting troops while nell stood struggling not to wring her hands i didnt put the salads and the soup out yet i thought if i waited till around eleven for that people would be more apt to go for the pastries therere more tarts in the back and the brownies i didnt put them out because well i think people want them more if it doesnt look as if youre oversupplied and the brownies are more lunch and afternoon items i put the torte out now hoping customers might think about it and end up coming back into the shop again later for a slice but i can rearrange things if youd rather she broke off when mia lifted a finger lets sample one of those tarts oh sure just let me get one from the back she darted into the kitchen then back out again with a tart in a little paper doily saying nothing mia broke it in two handed half to lulu as she took the first bite her lips curved hows that for a reference she murmured then turned back to nell if you keep looking so nervous customers are going to think somethings wrong with the food then they wont order it and theyll miss something very special you have a gift nell you like it nell let out a relieved sigh i sampled one of everything this morning im half sick she said as she pressed a hand to her stomach i wanted everything to be just right and so it is now relax because once word gets out weve got a genius in the kitchen youre going to be very busy nell didnt know if word got out but she was soon too busy for nerves by tenthirty she was brewing another pot of coffee and resupplying trays every time her cash register rang it was a separate little thrill and when she bagged up a half a dozen muffins for a customer who claimed shed never tasted better nell had to order herself not to spring into a dance thanks come back soon beaming she turned to the next customer that was zacks first impression of her a pretty blonde wearing a white apron and a milewide smile with winking dimples it gave him a quick and pleasant little jolt and his own grin flashed in response i heard about the muffins but i didnt hear about the smile smiles free the muffinsll cost you ill take one blueberry and a large black coffee to go im zack zack todd nell she scooped up one of the togo cups she didnt have to shoot him a sidelong glance experience had taught her to read a face fast and remember it his was still in her mind as she filled the cup tanned with faint lines fanning out from sharp green eyes a firm jaw with an intriguing diagonal scar scoring it brown hair a little long with a bit of curl that was already sunstreaked in june a narrow face with a long straight nose a mouth that smiled easily and showed a slightly crooked incisor it struck her as an honest face easygoing friendly she set the coffee on the counter casting him another glance as she plucked a muffin from the tray he had broad shoulders and good arms his shirt was rolled up at the sleeves and faded from sun and water the hand that curled around the coffee cup was big and wide she tended to trust big hands on a man it was the slender manicured ones that could strike so lethally just one she said as she bagged his muffin onell do me for now word is you just got to the island yesterday good timing for me she rang up his order pleased when he opened the bag and sniffed good timing all around if this tastes as good as it smells whered you come in from boston he cocked his head doesnt sound like boston your accent he explained when she simply stared at him oh she took his money with a steady hand made change not originally a little town in the midwest outside of columbus i moved around a lot though her smile stayed in place as she handed him his change and receipt i guess thats why i dont sound like im from anywhere in particular guess so hey sheriff zack glanced over his shoulder nodded morning miz macey you get round to talking to pete stahr about that dog of his heading that way now dog as soon roll in dead fish as he would in roses then whats he do but run right through my hanging wash had to do the lot of it again i like dogs same as the next yes maam but petes got to keep that hound on a leash ill have a word with him this morning you ought to

raw and hot she feared her voice sounded the same im nell can i get you anything maybe ill just have a sitdown with a cup of tea and one of those tarts ive got a weak spot for a good fruit tart none of those fancy teas mind give me good orange pekoe you tell that pete to keep his dog out of my wash she added to zack else hell be doing my laundry yes maam he smiled at nell again kept his eyes on her face deliberately as hed noted how quickly it had paled when gladys macey had called him sheriff nice meeting you nell she gave him a little nod kept her hands busy he noticed but not quite steady just what he wondered would a pretty young woman like that have to fear from the law then again he thought as he walked downstairs some people were just naturally skittish when it came to cops he scanned the main level spotted mia stocking shelves in the mystery section either way zack decided it wouldnt hurt to ask a few casual questions busy in here today mmm she slid paperbacks into slots without looking around i expect it to get busier seasons just underway and i have my new secret weapon in the café just met her youre renting her the yellow cottage thats right you check her employment record references now zack mia did turn now in her heels she was nearly eye to eye with him and she gave his cheek a sassy pat weve been friends a long time long enough for me to tell you to mind your own business i dont want you going up to my café and interrogating my staff okay ill just haul her down to the station house and get out my rubber hose she chuckled then leaned over and gave him a peck on the cheek you brute dont worry about nell she isnt looking for trouble got twitchy when she found out i was sheriff honey youre so handsome you make all the girls twitchy never worked on you he countered a lot you know now go away let me run my business im going have to do my sworn duty and scold pete stahr over his smelly dog sheriff todd youre so brave she batted her lashes what would we islanders do without you and your stalwart sister protecting us ha ha ripleys due in on the noon ferry any sooner id stick her with dog detail is a week up already mia grimaced and went back to shelving oh well nothing good lasts forever im not getting in the middle of you two again id sooner deal with petes dog she laughed at him but once hed gone she looked toward the steps thought of nell and wondered she made it a point to go upstairs late in the morning nell had already put out the salads and the soup subtly shifting the mode toward the lunch crowd the salads mia noted looked fresh and appealing and the scent of the soup was going to tempt anyone who walked into the store hows it going fine weve finally hit a little lull nell wiped her hands on her apron brisk business this morning the muffins won the race but the tarts came in a close second youre officially on break mia told her ill take care of anyone who comes in unless they want something that requires the use of that monster machine in the kitchen mia slid onto a stool crossed her legs stop by my office after your shift well get the employment forms signed okay ive been thinking about tomorrows menu well discuss that then too why dont you get yourself a cup of coffee and relax im already hyped enough but nell did open the fridge removed a small bottle of water ill stick with this youve settled into the house all right it was easy i cant remember ever sleeping better or waking better with the windows open i can just hear the surf its like a lullaby and did you see the sunrise this morning spectacular ill take your word for it i tend to avoid sunrise it insists on coming so early in the day she held out her hand and surprised nell into passing the bottle of water to her for a sip i heard you met zack todd did i nell immediately picked up a cloth began buffing the stove oh sheriff todd yes he had coffee black and a blueberry muffin to go theres been a todd on the island for centuries and zachariahs one of the best of the lot kind mia said deliberately caring and decent without being a pain in the ass about it is he your the word boyfriend just didnt seem to apply with a woman like mia are you and he involved romantically no mia held the bottle back out to nell hes entirely too good for me though i did have a mild crush on him when i was fifteen or sixteen after all hes a prime specimen you must have noticed im not interested in men i see is that what youre running from a man when nell didnt respond mia slid to her feet well if and when youre inclined to talk about it im an excellent listener with a sympathetic ear i appreciate all youve done for me mia i just want to do my job fair enough the bell dinged signaling someone had come to the counter no youre on break mia reminded her before nell could hurry out of the kitchen ill take the counter for a while and dont look so sad little sister youve no one to answer to now but yourself oddly soothed nell stayed where she was she could hear the low ripple of mias voice as she spoke to the customers the store music was flutes now and something fluid she could close her eyes and imagine herself here just here the next day the next year comfortable and comforted productive and happy there was no reason to be sad or afraid no cause to be concerned about the sheriff hed have no purpose in paying attention to her looking into her background and if he did what would he find shed been careful shed been thorough no she was no longer running away shed run to and she was staying she finished off her water started out of the kitchen just as mia turned around the clock in the square began to bong the noon hour in slow ponderous tones the floor beneath her feet seemed to tremble and the light went brilliant and bright music swelled inside her head like a thousand harp strings plucked in unison the wind she could have sworn she felt a hot wind flow over her face and lift her hair she smelled candle wax and fresh earth the world shuddered and spun then righted itself in a blink of time as if it had never moved she shook her head to clear it and found herself staring into mias deep gray eyes what was that an earthquake even as she said it nell saw that no one else in the store looked concerned people milled sat chatted sipped i thought i felt yes i know though mias voice was quiet there was an edge to it nell hadnt heard before well that explains it explains what shaken nell gripped mias wrist and felt something like power rocket up her arm well talk about it later now the noon ferrys in and ripley was back she thought they the three were all onisland now well be busy serve your soup nell she said gently and walked away mia wasnt often taken by surprise and she didnt care for it the strength of what shed felt and experienced along with nell had been more intense more intimate than shed expected and that annoyed her she should have been prepared she of all people knew believed and understood what twist fate had taken so many years before and what twist it could take now still believing in fate didnt mean a woman simply stood there and let it run her down actions could and would be taken but she had to think to sort things out what in the goddesss name was she supposed to do to make things right when she would be bound to a stubborn twit of a woman who consistently denied her power and a scared rabbit on the run who didnt know she had any she closed herself in her office paced she rarely turned to magic here it was her place of business and she deliberately kept it separate and earthbound but there were exceptions she told herself to every rule so thinking she took her crystal globe from the shelf set it on her desk it amused her to see it there along with her twoline phone and computer still magic respected progress even if progress didnt always respect magic laying her hands on either side of the globe she cleared her mind show me what i have to see this island holds the sisters three and we will shape our destiny visions in glass come clear to me as i will so mote it be the globe shimmered and swirled and cleared in its depths like figures in water she saw herself nell and ripley a circle formed in the shadows of the woods and a fire burning the trees were aflame as well but with color struck by autumn light poured out from a full moon like water shimmering a new shadow formed in the trees and became a man beautiful and golden with eyes that burned the circle broke even as nell ran the man struck out she shattered like glass a thousand pieces scattering and the skies opened to lightning blasted with thunder and all mia could see in the glass was a torrent of water as the woods and the island they lived on tumbled into the sea mia stepped back planted her hands on her hips isnt that always the way she said in disgust a man ruins everything well well see about that she put the globe back on the shelf well just see about that by the time nell knocked on her door mia was just finishing up some paperwork right on time she said as she logged off the computer thats a pretty habit of yours i need you to fill out these forms she gestured to the neat stack on the desk ive dated them yesterday hows the lunch crowd moving smoothly enough nell sat her palms no longer sweated when she filled out forms name date of birth social security number those basic facts and figures were hers shed seen to it personally peg dives right in i made up tomorrows menu mmm mia took the folded paper nell pulled out of her pocket read it over while nell filled in the form it looks good more adventurous than janes tended to be too adventurous no just more so what will you do with the rest of your day mia briefly looked at the first completed form nell no middle initial channing take a walk on the beach do some gardening maybe explore the woods around the cottage theres a small stream where columbine grows wild this time of year and in the deeper shade jackinthepulpits and ferns the kind that make you think the faeries hide in them you dont strike me as the kind of person who looks for shy faeries mias lips curved we dont know each other well yet three sisters is alive with legend and lore and the woods have all manner of secrets do you know the story of the three sisters no ill tell you one day when theres time for tales and stories but for now you should be out in the light and air mia what happened before at noon you tell me what do you think happened it felt like an earth tremor but not the light changed and so did the air like a blast of energy it sounded foolish when she said it but she pushed on you felt it too but no one else did no one else felt anything out of the ordinary most people expect the ordinary and thats what they get if thats a riddle i dont know how to solve it impatient nell shoved to her feet you werent surprised by it a little irritated but not surprised mia sat back intrigued and lifted a brow true enough you read people very well survival skill and sharply honed mia added what happened i suppose you could call it a connection what happens when three positive charges occupy the same space at the same time nell shook her head i have no idea neither do i but itll be interesting to find out like recognizes like dont you think i recognized you nells blood went cold and burned under her skin i dont know what you mean not who you are or were mia said gently but what you can trust me to respect that and your privacy i wont pry into your yesterdays nell im more interested in the tomorrows nell opened her mouth she nearly very nearly let it pour out everything shed escaped from everything that haunted her but to do so put her fate in the hands of another that was something she would never do again tomorrow ill serve a summer vegetable soup and a chicken zucchini and ricotta sandwich thats as complicated as its going to get thats as good a start as any enjoy your afternoon mia waited until nell reached the door nell as long as youre still afraid he wins i dont give a damn about winning nell replied then she stepped out quickly and closed the door behind her chapter three contents prev next nell found the stream and the wild columbine like little drops of sun in the green shade sitting on the soft floor of the forest listening to the stream gurgle and the birds chirp she found her peace again this was her place she was as sure of that as shed been of any single thing in all her life she belonged here as shed belonged nowhere else even as a child shed felt displaced not by her parents she thought running her fingers over her locket never by them but home had been wherever her father was stationed and until his orders changed thered been no single place for childhood no pretty spot for memories to take root and bloom her mother had had the gift of making a home wherever they were and for however long but it wasnt the same as knowing you would wake up to the same view out of your bedroom window day after day and that was a yearning nell had carried with her always her mistake had been in believing she could soothe that yearning with evan when she should have known it was something she had to find for herself perhaps she had now here in this place thats what mia had meant like recognizing like they both belonged on the island maybe in some lovely way they belonged to it it was as simple as that still mia was an intuitive woman and an oddly powerful one she sensed secrets nell could only hope she was as good as her word and wouldnt pry if anyone started digging through the layers she would have to leave no matter how much she belonged she couldnt stay it wasnt going to happen nell got to her feet stretching up her arms to the thin sunbeams and turned slow circles she wouldnt let it happen she was going to trust mia she was going to work for her and live in the little yellow cottage and wake each morning with a giddy glorious sense of freedom in time she thought as she began to walk back toward her house she and mia might become real friends it would be fascinating to have a friend that vivid that clever what was it like to be a woman like mia devlin she wondered to be someone so utterly beautiful so sublimely confident a woman like that would never have to question herself to remake herself to worry that whatever she did or could do would never be good enough what a marvelous thing still while a woman might be born beautiful confidence could be learned it could be won and wasnt there amazing satisfaction from winning those small battles every time you did you went back to war better armed enough dawdling enough introspection she thought and quickened her pace she was going to blow the last of her advance at the garden center if that wasnt confidence she decided what was they let her open an account another debt to mia nell thought as she drove back across the island she worked for mia devlin so she was looked upon kindly she was trusted she was allowed to take away merchandise on the strength of her signature on a tally a kind of magic she supposed that existed only in small towns shed struggled not to take advantage and had still ended up with half a dozen flats and pots and soil and a silly stone gargoyle who would guard what she planted eager to begin she parked in front of the cottage and hopped out the minute she opened the back door of the car she was immersed in her small fragrant jungle were going to have such fun and im going to take wonderful care of all of you feet planted firmly she stretched inside to lift the first tray hell of a view zack thought as he stopped across the street a small shapely female bottom in snug faded jeans if a man didnt spend a minute appreciating that he was a sorry individual he got out of his cruiser leaned against the door and watched her take out a flat of pink and white petunias pretty picture she jerked nearly bobbled the tray he noted that just as he noted the alarm shoot into her eyes but he straightened lazily strolled across the street let me give you a hand thats all right ive got it and a lot more gonna be busy he reached past her took out two more flats wherere you going with them just around the back for now i havent decided where im putting everything yet but really you dont have to smells good whatve you got here herbs rosemary basil tarragon and so on the quickest way to be rid of him she decided was to let him cart the trays around so she started across the yard im going to put in an herb bed outside the kitchen maybe add a few vegetables when i have time planting flowers is planting roots my mother always says i intend to do both just on the stoopll be fine thank you sheriff youve got a couple more in the front seat i can ill fetch them did you think to get any soil yes in the trunk he smiled easily held out his hand i need the keys oh well trapped she dug in her pocket thanks when he strolled off she clasped her hands together it was all right he was just being helpful not every man not every cop was a danger she knew better than that he came back loaded and the sight of him a huge bag of soil slung over one shoulder and a flat of pink geraniums and white impatiens in his big hands made her laugh i got too much she took the flowers from him i only meant to get herbs and before i knew it i couldnt seem to stop thats what they all say ill get your pots and tools sheriff it had once been natural to her to repay kindness with kindness she wanted it to be natural again i made some lemonade this morning would you like a glass id appreciate it all she had to do was remind herself to relax to be herself she filled two glasses with ice and poured in the tart lemonade he was already back when she came out something about the way he looked big and male standing in the middle of pink and white flowers gave her a quick little jolt attraction even as she recognized the sensation she reminded herself it wasnt anything she could or wanted to feel again i appreciate the pack mule services welcome he took the glass draining half of it while that little jolt became a twitchy dance in her belly he lowered the glass this is the real thing cant think the last time i had fresh lemonade youre a real find arent you i just like to fuss in the kitchen she bent picked up her new garden spade you didnt buy any gloves no i didnt think of it she wanted him to drink his lemonade and scat zack thought but was too polite to say so because he knew that he sat on the little stoop outside the kitchen door made himself comfortable mind if i sit a minute its been a long day dont let me stop you from getting started though its pleasant to watch a woman in the garden shed wanted to sit on the stoop she thought to sit there in the sunshine and imagine what she would do with the flowers and herbs now all she could do was begin she started with the pots reminding herself if she didnt like the results she could always redo them did you um talk to the man with the dog pete zack asked sipped at his lemonade i think we came to an understanding and peace settles over our little island once more there was humor in the way he said it and a lazy satisfaction as well it was hard not to appreciate both it must be interesting being the sheriff here knowing everyone it has its moments she had small hands he noticed as he watched her work quick clever fingers she kept her head bent her eyes averted shyness he decided coupled with what seemed to him to be a rusty sense of socializing a lot of its refereeing or dealing with summer people whore vacationing too hard mostly its running herd on about three thousand people between me and ripley its simple enough ripley my sister shes the other island cop todds have been island cops for five generations thats looking real nice he said gesturing toward her workinprogress with his glass do you think she sat back on her heels shed mixed some of everything into the pot stuck in some of the vinca it didnt look haphazard as shed feared it might it looked cheerful and so did her face when she lifted it its my first id say youve got a knack ought to wear a hat though fair skin like yours is going to burn if you stay out long oh she rubbed the back of her hand over her nose probably guess you didnt have a garden in boston no she filled the second pot with soil i wasnt there very long it wasnt my place i know what you mean ive spent some time on the mainland never felt home your folks still in the midwest my parents are dead im sorry so am i she tucked a geranium into the new pot is this conversation sheriff or an inquiry conversation he picked up a plant that was just out of her reach and held it a cautious woman he decided in his experience cautious people usually had a reason any point in me inquiring im not wanted for anything never been arrested and im not looking for trouble that about covers it he handed her the plant its a small island miz channing mostly friendly curiosity comes along with it though i suppose she couldnt afford to alienate him she reminded herself she couldnt afford to alienate anyone look ive been traveling for a while now and im tired of it i came here looking for work and a quiet place to live looks like you found both he got to his feet i appreciate the lemonade youre welcome thats a pretty job youre doing youve got a knack for it all right afternoon miz channing afternoon sheriff as he walked back to his car he tallied up what hed learned about her she was alone in the world wary of cops prickly about questions she was a woman of simple tastes and skittish nerves and for reasons he couldnt quite fathom she just didnt quite add up for him he glanced at her car as he crossed to his own scanned the license plate the massachusetts tag looked brand spanking new wouldnt hurt to run it he thought just to settle his mind his gut told him nell channing might not have been looking for trouble but she wasnt a stranger to it nell served apple turnovers and lattes to the young couple by the window and then cleared an adjoining table a trio of women were browsing the stacks and she suspected theyd be lured into the café section before long with her hands full of mugs she loitered by the window the ferry was arriving from the mainland chased by gulls that circled and dived buoys bobbed in a sea that was soft and green today a white pleasure boat sails fat with wind skimmed along the surface once shed sailed on another sea in another life it was one of the few pleasures she took from that time the feel of flying over the water rising on waves odd wasnt it that the sea had always called to her it had changed her life and had taken it now this new sea had given her another life smiling at the thought she turned and bumped solidly into zack even as he took her arm to steady her she was jerking back im sorry did i spill anything on you im clumsy i wasnt watching where no harm done he hooked the fingers of one hand through two mug handles and careful not to touch her again took them from her i was in your way nice boat yes she sidestepped hurried back to the counter behind it she hated having anyone come up behind her but im not getting paid to watch boats can i get you anything take a breath nell what take a breath he said it gently as he set the mugs on the counter get yourself steady again im fine resentment pricked through her she clanged mugs together as she scooped them off the counter i didnt expect to have anyone hulking around behind me his lips twitched thats better ill take one of those turnovers and a large coffee to go did you finish your planting nearly she didnt want to talk to him so she busied herself with the coffee she didnt want to have the island cop making friendly conversation and watching her out of those sharp green eyes maybe you can make use of this when youre finishing up and tending to your flowers he laid a bag on the counter what is it garden tool he counted out his money set that on the counter as well she wiped her hands on her apron scowled but curiosity pushed her into opening the bag baffled humor lit her eyes as she studied the perfectly ridiculous rolledbrim straw hat foolish fake flowers danced around the crown this is the silliest hat ive ever seen oh there were sillier he assured her but itll keep the sun from burning your nose its very considerate of you but you shouldnt around here its called being neighborly the beeper on his belt signaled well back to work she managed to wait until he was halfway down the steps before she snatched the hat and dashed into the kitchen to try it on in the reflection of the stove hood ripley todd poured herself another cup of coffee and sipped it while looking out the front window of the station house it had been a quiet morning and that was just the way she liked it but there was something in the air she was doing her best to ignore it but something was in the air it was easier to tell herself it was overstimulation from the week shed spent in boston not that she hadnt enjoyed herself she had the law enforcement workshops and seminars had interested her given her food for thought she liked police work the routine and detail of it but the demands and chaos of the city wore on her even in that short a time zack wouldve said it was simply that she didnt like people overmuch ripley wouldve been the last one to argue with him about that she caught sight of him now heading down the street it would she estimated take him a good ten minutes to make the half block people stopped him always had a word to say more she thought people just liked being around him he had a kind of she didnt want to use the word aura it was too mialike air she decided zack just had the kind of air about him that made people feel better about things they knew if they took their troubles to him hed have the answer or take the time to find it zack was a sociable creature ripley mused affable and patient and consistently fair no one would accuse her of being any of those things maybe that was why they made a good team since he was heading in she opened the front door to the summer air and street sounds the way he liked it best she brewed a fresh pot of coffee and was just pouring him a cup when he finally arrived frank and alice purdue had a baby girl eight pounds five ounces at nine this morning calling her belinda the younger boy robbie fell out of a tree broke his arm missy hachins cousin in bangor bought a brandnew chevrolet sedan as he spoke zack took the offered coffee sat at his desk propped up his feet and grinned the ceiling fan was squeaking again hed really meant to see to that so whats new with you speeder on the north coast road ripley told him dont know where they thought they were going in such a hurry i explained that the cliffs and the light and so on had been in place for a few centuries and werent likely to move away in an afternoon she plucked a fax out of his in box and this came in for you nell channing thats the new cook at mias place right ummhmm he scanned the motor vehicle report no traffic violations she still carried an ohio drivers license due for renewal in just over two years the car was registered in her name hed been right about the new tags shed had them less than a week before that the car had carried texas tags interesting ripley scooted onto the corner of the desk they shared and sampled his coffee since he wasnt drinking it whyd you run her curious shes a curious woman curious how he started to answer then shook his head why dont you drop into the café for lunch check her out yourself id be interested in your impression maybe i will frowning ripley glanced at the open door i think a storms coming in its clear as glass out there honey somethings coming she said half to herself then grabbed her baseball cap ill take a walk around maybe stop in the café and take a look at our newest resident take your time ill do the afternoon beach patrol youre welcome to it ripley slid on her sunglasses and strode out she liked her village the order of it as far as ripley was concerned everything had a place and thats just where it should stay she didnt mind the vagaries of sea and weather that was just another natural order of things june meant a fresh influx of tourists and summer people temperatures moving from warm to hot beach bonfires and smoking grills it also meant excess partying the routine drunk and disorderly the occasional lost child and the inevitable lovers spats but the tourists who celebrated drank wandered and squabbled brought summer dollars to the island that kept it afloat during the frigid gales of winter she would cheerfully well perhaps not too cheerfully suffer the problems of strangers for a few months in order to preserve three sisters this nine square miles of rock and sand and soil was all the world she needed overbaked people were staggering up from the beach toward the village for lunch she could never figure out what possessed a human being to flop itself down and broil like a trout in the sun besides the discomfort the sheer boredom of it would have driven her wild inside an hour ripley wasnt one to lie down if she could stand not that she didnt enjoy the beach she jogged along the surf every morning summer and winter when weather permitted she finished off her run with a swim when it didnt she often ducked into the hotel and took advantage of its indoor pool but she preferred the sea as a result she had a tight athletic body that was most often clad in khakis and tshirts her skin was tanned like her brothers her eyes the same vivid green she wore her straight brown hair long and most often pulled through the back of her baseball cap her features were an odd mix a wide slightly topheavy mouth a small nose and dark arching brows her looks had made her feel awkward as a child but ripley liked to think shed grown into them and grown out of worrying about them she strolled into café book waved at lulu and headed for the stairs with luck she could get a look at this nell channing and avoid mia altogether she was still three steps from the café level when she saw her luck wasnt going to hold mia was behind the counter looking slick as always in some floaty floral dress her hair was tied back and still managed to explode around her face the woman working beside her looked tidy nearly prim in comparison ripley immediately preferred nell she jammed her thumbs into her back pockets and swaggered toward the counter deputy todd mia angled her head looked down her nose what could possibly bring you here ignoring mia ripley studied nell ill have todays special soup and sandwich nell this is ripley zacks unfortunate sister as shes come in for lunch we can safely assume hell has frozen over kiss ass mia nice to meet you nell ill have a lemonade to go with that yes all right nell shifted her gaze from face to face right away she murmured and ducked into the kitchen to put the sandwich together heard you scooped her up right off the ferry ripley continued more or less mia ladled the soup dont poke at her ripley why would i because youre you mia set the soup on the counter notice anything odd when you stepped off the ferry yesterday no ripley replied too quickly liar mia said quietly as nell came back with the sandwich can i take this to a table for you deputy todd yeah thanks ripley tugged money out of her pocket why dont you ring me up mia ripley timed it sliding into a chair just as nell set the food down looks great i hope you enjoy it im sure i will whered you learn to cook here and there can i get you anything else ripley held up a finger spooned up soup and sampled nope this is great really hey did you make all those pastries yourself yes a lot of work its what im paid for right dont let mia work you too hard shes pushy on the contrary nell said in a voice that chilled shes incredibly generous incredibly kind enjoy your lunch loyal ripley decided as she continued to eat she couldnt fault nell for that polite too even if she was a bit stiff about it as if ripley thought she wasnt quite used to dealing with people nervous shed visibly cringed at the relatively mild byplay between ripley and mia well ripley decided with a shrug some people couldnt handle conflict even when it had nothing to do with them all in all she thought nell channing was harmless and a hell of a good cook the meal put her in such a good mood that she took the time to go by the counter on her way out it was easier to decide to do so since mia was occupied elsewhere well now youve done it nell froze she deliberately kept her face blank her hands loose i beg your pardon now im going to have to start coming in here regularly something ive managed to avoid for years lunch was great oh good you may have noticed mia and i arent exactly chummy its none of my business you live on the island everybodys business is your business but dont worry we manage to stay out of each others way for the most part you wont get squeezed in the middle im going to take a couple of those chocolate chip cookies for later you save if you buy three twist my arm three then ill give one to zack and be a hero relaxed now nell bagged the cookies rang up the bill but when she took the money from ripley and their hands touched the bright shock had her gasping ripley glared one long frustrated stare snagging her cookies she strode toward the stairs deputy clenching her hand tight nell called after her you forgot your change keep it she bit the words off as she stomped down the stairs there was mia at the bottom hands folded brow lifted ripley simply snarled and kept going a storm was coming though the sky stayed clear and the sea calm a storm was coming its violence roared through nells dreams and tossed her helplessly into the past the huge white house sat on a verdant carpet of lawn inside its edges were sharp its surfaces hard colors were pale sands and taupes and grays but for the roses he bought her always bought her that were the color of blood the house was empty but it seemed to be waiting in sleep she turned her head away resisted she didnt want to go into that place not ever again but the door opened the tall white door that opened into the long wide foyer white marble white wood and the cold cold sparkle of crystal and chrome she watched herself walk in long pale hair sweeping past the shoulders of a sleek white dress that sent off an icy glitter her lips were red like the roses he came in with her close behind always so close behind his hand was there lightly on the small of her back she could still feel it there if she let herself he was tall slim like a prince in his evening black with his hair a gold helmet she had fallen in love with the fairytale look of him and she had believed his promises of happyeverafter and hadnt he taken her to this palace this white palace in this fantasy land and given her everything a woman could want how many times had he reminded her of that she knew what happened next she remembered the glittery white dress remembered how tired and relieved she was that the evening was over and that it had gone well shed done nothing to upset him to embarrass him to annoy him or so shed thought until shed turned to say something about how nice an evening it had been and had seen his expression hed waited until they were home until they were alone to make the transformation it was one of his best skills and she remembered the fear that had clutched her belly even as she scrambled to think of what shed done did you enjoy yourself helen yes it was a lovely party but a long one would you like me to fix you a brandy before we go to bed you enjoyed the music very much music had she said something inappropriate about the music she could be so stupid about such things barely she repressed a shudder as he reached out to toy with her hair it was wonderful to be able to dance outside near the gardens she stepped back hoping to turn toward the stairs but his hand fisted in her hair held her in place yes i noticed how much you enjoyed dancing especially with mitchell rowlings flirting with him flaunting yourself humiliating me in front of my friends my clients evan i wasnt flirting i was only the backhanded slap sent her sprawling the bright shock of pain blinding her when she would have rolled into a protective ball he dragged her across the marble floor by the hair how many times has he had his hands on you she denied she wept he accused until he grew weary of it and left her to crawl away and sob in a corner but this time in this dream she crawled off into the shadows of the forest where the air was soft and the ground warm and there where the stream gurgled over its smooth rocks she slept then awoke to the cannonblast of thunder and the jagged rip of lightning awoke to terror she was running through the woods now her white dress a sparkling beacon her blood pumped the blood of the hunted trees crashed behind her and the ground heaved under her feet and boiled with mist still she ran her breath tearing out of her throat and ending in whimpers there were screams in the wind and not all of them hers fear ruled until there was nothing else inside her no reason no sense no answer the wind slapped at her with sharp and gleeful hands and clawing fingers of brush tore her dress to shreds she was climbing scrabbling like a lizard along the rock through the dark the beam from the lighthouse slashed like a silver blade and below the wild violence of the sea churned she kicked and cried and climbed but she didnt look back couldnt force herself to look around and face what pursued her instead choosing flight over fight she leaped from the rocks spun and spun in the wind on her plunge toward the water and the cliffs the light the trees all tumbled in after her chapter four contents prev next on her first day off nell rearranged the furniture what there was of it she watered her flowers and herbs did the wash and baked a loaf of brown bread it was still shy of nine oclock when she cut the first slice for her breakfast evan had hated her earlyrising habit and had complained that that was the reason she was dull at parties now in her little cottage near the sea there was no one to criticize no need to creep about she had her windows open wide and the whole day belonged just to her still munching on bread and with a heel of the loaf in the pocket of her shorts she took herself off for a long walk on the beach the boats were out bobbing and gliding over the water the sea was a soft dreamy blue with frisky waves that rolled up lacy on the sand gulls winged over it whitebreasted in their graceful dance on the air the music of them the long shrill cries pierced the low endless rumble of the surf she turned in a little dance of her own then she tugged the bread from her pocket and tore it into small pieces tossing it high to watch the gulls circle and dive alone she thought lifting her face to the sky but not lonely she doubted she would ever be lonely again at the sound of church bells she turned to look back at the village at the pretty white steeple she glanced down at her shorts with the frayed hem her sandy sneakers hardly dressed for services she decided but she could worship in her own way and offer a prayer of thanksgiving while the bells rang and echoed she sat near the edge of the water here was peace she thought and joy she would never never take either for granted she would remember to give something back every day even if it was just a heel of bread for the gulls she would tend what she planted she would remember to be kind and never forget to offer a helping hand she would keep her promises and expect nothing more than the chance to lead a good life that hurt no one she would earn what shed been given and treasure it she would take pleasure in the simple things she decided starting right now rising she began to collect shells tucking them in her pockets at first when the pockets were full she tugged off her shoes and used them she reached the far end of the beach where rocks jutted out of the sand and began to tumble toward the sea here there were palmsize stones worn cobble smooth she picked one then another wondering if she could fashion an edging for her little herb bed a movement to her left had her wrapping her fingers tight around the stone and turning quickly her heart continued to beat in hard jerks as she watched zack coming down a zigzag of wooden steps morning good morning in automatic defense she glanced back uneasy to realize how far from the village proper shed wandered the beach was no longer empty but the scattered people were some distance away nice day for a long walk on the beach he commented leaning against the handrail to study her youve sure had one hed watched her from her dance with the gulls it was a shame he thought how quickly her face could go from radiant to guarded i didnt realize how far id come nothings really that far on an island this size its going to be a hot one he said easily beachll be crowded before noon its nice to get a little time on it before its full of towels and bodies yes well come on up what come on up to the house ill give you a bag for those shells and stones oh thats all right i dont really need nell is it cops in general men in general or me in particular that worry you im not worried prove it he stayed where he was but held out a hand she kept her eyes on his he had good eyes smart ones but patient too slowly she stepped forward and lifted her hand to his what do you plan to do with your shells nothing her pulse was galloping but she made herself climb the sandy steps with him well nothing brilliant just scatter them around i suppose his hand held hers loosely but even so she could tell it was hard and rough he wore no rings no watch on his wrist no pampering she thought no adornments like her he was barefoot and his jeans were ripped at the knee frayed at the hem with his sunstreaked hair and tawny skin he looked more beach bum than sheriff it tamped down some of her anxiety at the landing they turned walked along a gentle slope below on the far side of the rocks was a sunny inlet where a small red boat bobbed lazily at a rickety pier everythings a picture she said quietly have you done any sailing yes a little she said quickly is that your boat shes mine there was a sudden wild splashing of water and a sleek dark head appeared cruising around the rocks as nell stared a huge black dog leaped onto the shore and shook herself madly her too zack stated mine that is are you all right with dogs tell me now i can hold her off and give you a fair head start no i like dogs then she blinked looked back at him what do you mean head start he didnt bother to answer just grinned as the dog leaped up the slope in powerful bounds she jumped on zack tail wagging and spewing water and licked his face on two short deep barks she bunched her muscles and would have given nell the same treatment if zack hadnt blocked her this is lucy shes friendly but mannerless down lucy lucy got down her entire body wagging now then obviously unable to control her joy and affection she leaped on zack again shes two he explained firmly pushing her down and shoving her butt to the ground with his hand black lab im told they mellow out some when theyre older shes beautiful nell stroked lucys head and at the first touch the dog collapsed on the ground and rolled over belly up no pride either zack began then looked surprised when nell just hunkered down and sent lucy into ecstasy by rubbing her belly with both hands you dont need pride when youre beautiful do you lucy oh theres nothing like a big beautiful dog is there i always oh in a delirium of pleasure lucy rolled scrambled and knocked nell flat on her back zack was fast but not quite fast enough to keep her from being leaped on and licked jesus lucy no hey im sorry zack shoved at the dog and lifted nell to her feet onehanded you okay did she hurt you no im fine shed had the wind knocked out of her but that was only part of the reason for breathlessness he was brushing at her while the dog sat head down tail cautiously thumping he was nell noted frustrated and concerned but not angry you didnt hit your head did you damn dog weighs almost as much as you do banged your elbow a little he added then realized she was actually giggling whats so funny nothing really its just sweet the way shes pretending to look ashamed shes obviously terrified of you yeah i take a bat to her twice a week whether she needs it or not he ran his hands lightly up and down nells arms sure youre okay yes it struck her then that they were now standing very close almost embracing and that his hands were on her and her skin was much too warm from them yes she said again and took a deliberate step in retreat no harm done youre sturdier than you look there were long lean muscles in those arms he noted hed already admired the ones in her legs come on inside he said not you he added pointing at the dog youre banished he scooped nells shoes up from the ground and walked toward a wide porch curious and unable to think of an excuse not to follow nell went through the screened door he opened and into a big bright messy kitchen its the maids decade off comfortable in his own clutter he set her shoes on the floor and went to the refrigerator cant offer you homemade lemonade but weve got some iced tea thats fine thanks its a wonderful kitchen we use it mostly for heating up takeout thats a shame there were acres of granitetoned counters and wonderful roughhewn cabinets with leadedglass fronts a generous double sink with a window over it offered a view of the inlet and the sea plenty of storage and work space she mused with a little organization and a bit of imagination it would be a marvelous we hed said we she realized was he married shed never thought of that never considered the possibility not that it mattered of course but hed flirted with her she may have been out of practice and short on experience but she knew when a man was flirting youve got a lot of thoughts going on inside that head at one time zack held out a glass want to share any of them no that is i was just thinking what a nice room this is it was a lot more presentable when my mother was in charge of it now that its just ripley and me the kitchen doesnt get a lot of attention ripley oh i see you were wondering if i was married or maybe living here with someone who wasnt my sister thats nice its none of my business i didnt say it was just said it was nice id take you through the house but its probably in worse shape than the kitchen and youve got a tidy soul well go this way he took her hand again pulled her back outside where i really should be getting back its sunday and weve hit our day off together ive got something youll like he continued and tugged her across the porch it wrapped around the house edged the side where there was a scrubby garden and a couple of gnarled trees weatherworn steps led up to a secondstory porch that faced the sea he kept his hand over hers and led her up them air and sun washed over her made her think how easy it would be to stretch out in the wooden chaise and let the day rock away a telescope stood by the rail along with a stone troth that had yet to be planted youre right she stepped to the rail leaned out and breathed i do like it you look west you can see the mainland when its clear enough you dont have your telescope pointed west at the moment all his attention was on her very pretty set of legs i guess i dont what do you look at whatever strikes my fancy at the time she glanced over as she moved away he was staring at her now long speculative looks and they both knew it itd be tempting to stay out here all day she said as she turned the corner and looked out on the village watch the comings and the goings i watched you this morning feeding the gulls he leaned on the rail a man at home and drank his tea i woke up thinking you know im going to find a reason to drop by the yellow cottage today get another look at nell channing then i came out here with my morning coffee and there you were so i didnt have to make up a reason to get another look at you sheriff its my day off he reminded her he started to lift his hand to touch her hair but when she edged back he simply slid it into his pocket since it is why dont we spend a couple hours of it on the water we can go for a sail i cant i have to you dont have to hunt up excuses some other time yes the knot that had formed in her belly loosened some other time i really should go thanks for the drink and the view nell he took her hand again kept his fingers light when hers jerked theres a line between making a woman a little nervous and scaring her thats a line i wouldnt want to cross when you get to know me a little better youll believe that he added right now im working on getting to know myself a little better fair enough ill get you a bag for your shells and stones he made a point of going into the café every morning a cup of coffee a muffin a few words to zacks way of thinking shed get used to seeing him talking to him and the next time he worked it around so they were alone together she wouldnt feel compelled to check for running room he was perfectly aware that nell wasnt the only one who noticed his new morning habit zack didnt mind the teasing comments the sly winks and chuckles island life had a rhythm and whenever anything new added a beat everyone felt it he sipped nells truly excellent coffee while he stood on the dock listening to carl macey bitch about lobster poachers three blessed days this week traps been empty and they aint troubling to close it after them neither ive got the suspicion its them college boys renting the boeing place ayah he spat thats whos doing it i catch em at it im gonna give them rich college brats something to remember well carl the fact is it sounds like summer people and sounds like kids on top of it why dont you let me have a talk with them got no call interfering with a mans livelihood that way no but they wouldnt be thinking of it like that theyd better start thinking the weathered face went grim i went up to see mia devlin asked her to put a spell on my traps zack winced now carl better than me peppering their skinny white asses with buckshot now aint it i swear thats next in line let me handle this im telling you aint i scowling carl bobbed his head no harm in covering all my bases besides i got a look at the new mainlander while i was up to the bookstore carls pughomely wrinkled face folded into a snicker see why youre such a regular customer there these days ayah big blue eyes like that sure start a mans day off on the right foot they cant hurt you keep your shotgun in your gun cabinet carl ill take care of things he headed back to the station house first for his list of summer people the boeing place was an easy enough walk but he decided to take the cruiser to make it more official the summer rental was a block back from the beach with a generous screened porch on the side beach towels and swim trunks hung drooping from a nylon line strung inside the screen the picnic table on the porch was heaped with beer cans and the remnants of last nights meal they hadnt had the sense zack thought with a shake of his head to ditch the evidence scrapedout lobster shells lay upended on the table like giant insects zack dug his badge out of his pocket and pinned it on might as well get in their faces with it he knocked and kept right on knocking until the door opened the boy who opened the door was about twenty squinting against the sun his hair a wild disarray he wore brightly striped boxer shorts and a golden summer tan he said ugh sheriff todd island police mind if i come inside whafor timzit hungover bigtime zack decided and translated to talk to you its about tenthirty your friends around somewhere problem christ the boy swallowed winced then stumbled through the living room past the breakfast counter and to the sink where he turned the water on full and stuck his head under the faucet some party huh zack said when he surfaced dripping guess he snagged paper towels rubbed his face dry we get too loud no complaints whats your name son josh josh tanner well josh why dont you rouse your pals i dont want to take up a lot of your time yeah well okay he waited listened there was some cursing a few thuds water running a toilet flushed the three young men who trooped back in with josh looked plenty the worse for wear they stood in various states of undress until one flopped down on a chair and smirked whats the deal all attitude zack calculated and youd be steve hickman boston accent zack concluded upperclass one almost kennedyesque okay steve heres the deal lobster poaching carries a thousanddollar fine reason for that is that while its a kick to sneak out and empty the traps boil up a couple some people depend on the catch for their living an evenings entertainment to you is money out of their pocket as he lectured zack saw the boys shift uncomfortably the one whod answered the door was flushing guiltily and keeping his eyes averted what you had out there on the porch last night wouldve run you about forty down at the market so you look up a man by the name of carl macey at the docks give him forty and thatll be the end of it i dont know what youre talking about does this macey put a brand on his lobsters steve smirked again scratched his belly you cant prove we poached anything true enough zack glanced around the room skimmed faces nerves a little shame this place rents for what about twelve hundred a week in full season and the boat youve rented puts another twofifty onto that add entertainment food beer you guysre shelling out round about a grand apiece for a week here and pumping it into the island economy steve said with a thin smile pretty stupid to hassle us over a couple of allegedly poached lobsters maybe even more stupid not to come up with ten bucks each to smooth things over you think about that its a small island zack said as he started for the door word gets around is that a threat threatening civilians could result in a litigious action zack glanced back shook his head i bet youre prelaw arent you he strolled out back to his cruiser it wouldnt take him long to hit the right spots in the village and make his point ripley walked down high street and met zack in front of the magick inn lobster boys credit card got hung up at the pizza place she began seems the circuits were down or whatever and he had to dig for cash to pay for lunch that so yeah and you know every video they wanted to rent was already out hell of a thing and i hear all the jet skis were already reserved or out of order today thats a shame and continuing in a series of bizarre coincidences the ac in their rental just up and died and its a hot one today too supposed to be muggy tonight bound to be uncomfortable sleeping youre a mean son of a bitch zachariah ripley rose on her toes and gave him a quick smacking kiss on the mouth thats why i love you im going to have to get meaner that hickman boys a tough nut the other threell fold fast enough but hell take some more persuading zack swung an arm around ripleys shoulder so are you going into the café for some lunch i might be why i thought you could do me a little favor since you love me and everything the long whip of her ponytail bobbed as she turned her head to look up at him if you want me to talk nell into dating you just forget it i can get my own dates thanks batting zero so far im still on deck he countered what i was hoping is that youd tell mia were handling the lobster boys and not to do anything what do you meando anything what does she have to do with it ripley stopped her temper flaring damn it dont get riled its just that carl said hed talked to her id just as soon it not get around that our resident witch is cooking up a spell or whatever to keep ripley in check zack tightened his grip on her shoulders id go in myself and have a word with her but the lobster boys should be coming along in a few minutes i want to be standing here looking smug and authoritative ill talk to her you play nice rip and remember it was carl who went to her yeah yeah yeah she shook off his arm and marched across the street witches and spells it was all a bunch of nonsense idiotic hooey she thought as she breezed down the sidewalk a man like carl macey ought to know better stirring up a bunch of silliness it was all right for the tourists to buy all the three sisters lore it was one of the things that brought them over from the mainland but it burned her butt when it was one of her own and mia encouraged it too just by being mia ripley swung into café book and scowled over at lulu who was ringing up a customer where is she upstairs pretty busy today yeah shes a busy little bee ripley muttered and headed up she spotted mia with a customer in the cookbook section ripley bared her teeth mia fluttered her lashes simmering with impatience ripley strode into the café waited her turn then snapped out an order for coffee no lunch today flushed with the bustle of the noon crowd nell poured out from a fresh pot lost my appetite thats too bad mia cooed from behind ripley the lobster salads particularly good today ripley merely jerked a thumb then marched behind the counter and into the kitchen she jammed her hands on her hips when mia strolled in after her zack and i are handling the problem i want you to stay out of it a bowl of top cream was less smooth than mias voice i wouldnt dream of interfering with the law of the land excuse me nell hesitated cleared her throat sandwiches i need to make them up go right ahead mia gestured i imagine deputy fife and i are nearly done just save the smartass comments i do i store them up just for you i dont want you doing anything and i want you to tell carl you didnt do anything too late enjoying herself mia smiled brilliantly its already done a very simple spell even someone with your fumbling abilities could have managed it cancel it no why does it concern you you claim not to believe in the craft i dont but i know how rumors work around here if anything happens to those boys dont insult me all humor fled from mias voice you know very well id do nothing to harm them or anyone you know thats the heart of it thats what youre afraid of afraid that if you opened yourself to whats inside you again you wouldnt be able to control it im not afraid of anything and youre not pulling me in that way she pointed at nell who was struggling to keep very busy with sandwiches youve got no right pulling her in either i dont make the pattern ripley i just recognize it and so do you its a waste of time talking to you ripley stormed out of the kitchen mia let out a little sigh her only sign of distress conversations with ripley never seem particularly productive you mustnt let it worry you nell it has nothing to do with me i can feel your anxiety all the way over here people argue often bitterly they dont all solve the conflict with fists here now she moved behind nell and rubbed her shoulders let the worry go tensions bad for the digestion at the touch nell felt a trickle of warmth melt away the ice that had balled in her belly i guess i like both of you i hate to see you dislike each other i dont dislike ripley she annoys me frustrates me but i dont dislike her you wonder what we were talking about but you wont ask will you little sister no i dont like questions im fascinated by them we need to talk you and i mia stepped back waited for nell to pick up the completed order and turn i have things to do this evening tomorrow then ill buy you a drink lets make it early five at the magick inn the lounge its called the coven you can leave your questions at home if you like mia said as she started out ill bring the answers anyway chapter five contents prev next it went pretty much as zack had expected the hickman kid had to flex his muscles the other three had folded and zack expected carl to get his money from them the next morning but hickman had to prove he was smarter braver and far superior to some dinky island sheriff from his place on the dock zack watched the rented boat putt along toward the lobster traps he was already on the wrong side of the law zack mused nibbling on sunflower seeds boating after dark without running lights that would cost him but it was nothing to the grand that the little defiance was going to cost the college boys father he expected the kid was going to give him some trouble when he hauled him in which meant theyd both be spending a few hours in the station house that night one of them behind bars well lessons learned zack decided lowering his binoculars and reaching down for his flashlight as the boy began to haul up a pot the scream was high and girlish and gave zack a hell of a jolt he switched on his light shot the bright beam of it across the water a light fog crept over the surface so that the boat seemed to bob in smoke the boy stood the trap gripped in both hands the look on his face as he stared into it one of sheer horror before zack could call out the boy flung the trap high and wide even as it splashed into the water he was tumbling in oh well hell zack muttered peeved at the prospect of ending his workday soaking wet he stepped to the end of the dock scooped up a life preserver the kid was doing more screaming than swimming but he was making some progress toward shore here you go steve zack tossed the preserver in head this way i dont want to have to come in after you help me the boy flailed swallowed water choked but he managed to grab the flotation theyre eating my face almost there zack knelt down held out a hand come on up youre still in one piece my head my head steve slipped and slithered onto the dock then lay there on his belly shuddering i saw my head in the trap they were eating my face your heads still on your shoulders son zack hunkered down catch your breath had yourself a hallucination thats all been drinking a bit havent you that and some guilt got to you i saw i saw he sat up laid shaking hands on his face to make certain all his parts were there then began to shake in stupendous relief fog dark water its a tricky kind of situation especially on a couple bottles of beer youre going to feel a lot better when you give carl that forty dollars in fact why dont we go get you cleaned up get your wallet and go by his place now youll sleep better for it yeah sure right okay thats fine zack helped him to his feet ill take care of getting the boat back dont you worry that mia zack thought as he led the unprotesting boy away from the water you had to give her credit for creativity it took a while to calm the boy down then to calm four boys down once hed taken steve back to the rental then there was carl to deal with and the boat which was probably why zack ended up nodding off at the station house just before three am he woke two hours later stiff as a board and annoyed with himself ripley he decided as he stumbled out to his cruiser was taking the first shift he meant to drive straight home but hed gotten into the habit of swinging past the yellow cottage at the end of his shift just to make sure everything was as it should be he made the turn before he realized it and saw the lights in her windows concern as much as curiosity made him pull over and get out of the car because the kitchen light was on he went to the back door he was lifting his hand to knock when he saw her standing on the other side of the screen a long smoothbladed knife gripped in both hands if i tell you i was just in the neighborhood you wont gut me with that will you her hands began to tremble and her breath exploded out of her as she dropped the knife on the table with a clatter im sorry i scared you i saw your light as i was hey hey when she swayed he bolted through the door gripping both her arms and lowering her into a chair sit breathe head down jesus nell im sorry he stroked her hair patted her back and wondered whether she would just keel over on the floor if he jumped up to get her a glass of water its all right im all right i heard the footsteps in the dark its so quiet here you can hear everything and i heard you coming toward the house shed wanted to run like a rabbit in the other direction and keep going she didnt remember picking up the knife hadnt known she could im going to get you some water no im all right mortified now she realized but all right i just wasnt expecting anyone to come to the door guess not its still shy of fivethirty he sat back on his heels when she lifted her head again color was coming back he noted with relief whatre you doing up im usually up by she jumped like a spring as the oven timer buzzed god god with a half laugh she pounded a fist on her heart im going to be lucky to survive till sunrise at this rate my muffins she said and got up quickly to take them out of the oven slide the next batch in i didnt realize you started so early he could see now that he looked around that shed been at it a while there was something simmering on the stove and smelling like glory a huge bowl of batter sat on the counter another bowl covered with a cloth was beside the stove still one more was on the table where shed obviously been mixing something before hed scared ten years off her life ingredients were lined up as organized as a marching band i didnt realize you worked so late she calmed herself by cutting shortening into the flour for her pastry dough i dont usually i had a little project to finish up last night and when it was all said and done dropped off in my office chair nell if you dont give me a cup of that coffee im going to start crying itll embarrass us both oh sorry um you just keep on with what youre doing there cups cabinet to the right of the sink want me to top yours off i suppose he poured a cup filled hers as it sat by the sink you know i dont think these muffins look quite right with the bowl tucked in the crook of her arm she turned her face was a study of alarm and insult what do you mean just dont look quite the thing why dont you let me test one for you he gave her a quick boyish grin that had her lips twitching oh for heavens sake why dont you just ask for one more fun this way no dont bother i can get it myself he plucked one out of the pan burned the tips of his fingers as he tossed the muffin from hand to hand to cool it the scent told him it was going to be worth it ive sure got a soft spot for your blueberry muffins nell mr bigelow lancefort bigelow prefers my cream puffs he said if id make them for him every day hed marry me and wed move to bimini still grinning zack broke the muffin in half treated himself to the fragrant steam thats pretty stiff competition bigelow a confirmed bachelor was ninety he watched her stir the dough form it into a ball then she emptied the muffin pan set them to cool on a rack while she refilled the cups when the timer buzzed again she shifted trays went back to roll out her pastry dough youve got yourself a real system he commented whered you learn to bake my mother she broke off realigned her thoughts it was too easy in the quiet kitchen with all these homey smells to get overly comfortable and reveal too much my mother liked to bake she said and i picked up recipes and techniques here and there he didnt want her to stiffen up so he let it pass do you ever make those cinnamon rolls you know the ones with that sticky white icing mmm i make them sometimes really she began to cut the dough for tarts and glanced back at him he looked so male she thought leaning back on the counter with his ankles crossed and a mug of coffee in his hand i didnt know you cooked sure now and then you buy these tubes down at the market then you take them home rap them against the counter and peel the bun things out cook them and squirt icing on the top nothing to it it made her laugh ill have to try that sometime she went to the refrigerator took out her bowl of filling ill give you some pointers on it he drained his cup set it in the sink i guess id better get home and get out of your way thanks for the coffee youre welcome and the muffin it was just fine thats a relief she stood at the table methodically spooning filling into the center of her rounds of dough when he stepped toward her she tensed a little but continued to work nell she looked up and filling slopped out of her spoon when he put his hand on her cheek i sure hope this doesnt put you off he said and leaning down he laid his lips on hers she didnt move a muscle couldnt her eyes stayed open locked on his watching as a deer might watch when pinned in the crosshairs his lips were warm she registered that and softer than they looked he didnt touch her she imagined shed have leaped out of her skin if hed laid his hands on her now but it was only his mouth light and easy on hers hed prepared himself for her to be annoyed or disinterested he hadnt expected her to be scared that was what he felt from her a rigid anxiety that could easily bloom into fear so he didnt touch her as he wanted to not even a gentle brush of fingers down her arms if shed stepped back hed have done nothing to stop her but her absolute stillness was its own defense it was he who stepped back and kept it light despite a gnawing in the gut that was more than a stir of desire for her it was a cold fury for whoever had hurt her seems i have a soft spot for more than your muffins he tucked his thumbs in his front pockets see you later he strolled out hoping the kiss and the ease of his leaving would give her something to think about he wasnt going to get any sleep resigned to it he thrilled lucy by taking her for an earlymorning swim in the inlet the romp and her sheer foolishness worked off a good portion of his stiffness and his frustration he watched ripley finish her run on the beach and dive into the surf dependable as sunrise he thought as she cut through the waves maybe he didnt always know what went on in her head or how it got there but he rarely had to worry about ripley todd she could handle herself lucy ran out to meet her as she started back and the two wet females had a wrestle and a race they both joined him on the upper porch lucy to flop down in delighted exhaustion and ripley sucking on a bottle of water mom called last night ripley flopped down herself on one of the deck chairs they made it to the grand canyon theyre sending us six million pictures that dad took with his digital im afraid to start the download sorry i missed the call i told them you were on a stakeout she said with her tongue in her cheek they got a kick out of the lobster caper any updates oh yeah he sat on the arm of the adirondack chair and filled her in she turned her face up to the sky and hooted i knew i shouldve gone with you idiot drunk putz lobster boy not you i figured he wasnt that drunk rip she lifted a hand waved it at him dont start that im in too good a mood for you to spoil it by mentioning mia and her double double toil and trouble routine suit yourself i usually do im going to get a shower ill take the first shift you must be wiped im okay listen but he trailed off trying to think how to put what he wanted to say listening i went by the yellow cottage on the way home nells lights were on so i stopped in aha ripley teased gutterface i had a cup of coffee and a muffin gee zack im sorry to hear that normally hed have laughed instead he rose paced to the rail you stop in and see her most every day youre friendly right i guess were friendly enough its hard not to like her women tend to confide stuff to their female friends dont they probably you want me to ask her if she likes you enough to go to the school dance with you she started to snicker but stopped when he turned around and saw his face hey sorry i didnt know it was serious whats up i think shes been abused man ripley stared down at her water bottle thats tough some son of a bitch messed with her im sure of it whether or not shes had counseling or gotten help it seems to me she could use a you know a girlfriend somebody she could talk to about it zack you know im no good at that kind of thing you are ive got the wrong equipment to be nells girlfriend rip just just see if you can spend some time with her go out on the boat or go shopping or he gestured vaguely paint each others toenails excuse me give me a break i dont know what you people do in your mysterious caves when men arent around we have pillow fights in our underwear he brightened because she wanted him to really i was afraid that was a myth so be a friend okay are you starting to get a thing for her yeah so so i guess ill be a friend nell walked into the coven at precisely five it was not as shed feared a dark eerie place but rather cozy the light was faintly blue and added a soft tint to the white flowers in the center of each table the tables themselves were round with deep chairs and small sofas circling them at the glossy bar the glasses sparkled nell had no more than chosen a table when a young waitress in trim unrelieved black set a silver bowl of mixed snacks in front of her can i get you a drink im waiting for someone maybe just a mineral water for now thanks the only other patrons were a couple poring over an island tours brochure while they sipped white wines and nibbled from a cheese plate the music was low and very like what mia tended to play in the bookstore nell tried to relax in her chair wishing shed brought a book ten minutes later mia breezed in the long skirt swirling around her long legs she carried a book and lifted her free hand in a wave toward the bar a glass of cabernet betsy first glass is on carl macey betsy shot mia a wink he gave me orders tell him i enjoyed it she sat down across from nell did you drive over no i walked do you drink alcoholic beverages now and then have one now whats your pleasure the cabernetll be fine thanks two betsy damn i love these things she began to pick through the snack bowl especially the little cheese ones that look like chinese symbols so i brought you a book a gift mia nudged the book toward nell i thought youd like to read about where youve chosen to live yes ive been meaning to the three sisters legends and lore she said reading the cover thank you youre settling in now getting your feet under you i should tell you first that i couldnt be happier with your work im glad to hear it i love working at the café the store i couldnt have tailormade a job id like more oh youre nell catching the comment as she served the wine betsy beamed youre always gone when i get to the caf i try to zip in before i open the bar great cookies thanks you hear from jane mia just today tim got his audition and theyre hopeful theyre paying the rent by working at a bakery in chelsea i hope theyre happy so do i ill leave you two alone let me know if you need anything so mia lifted her glass tapped it to nells slainte im sorry a gaelic toast cheers mia brought the glass to her lips watching nell over the rim what do you know about witches which sort like elizabeth montgomery on bewitched or the ones who wear crystals and burn candles and sell little bottles of love potion mia laughed crossed her legs actually i wasnt thinking of hollywood or pseudowiccans i didnt mean to be insulting i know there are people who take the matter very seriously a kind of religion that should be respected even if they are kooks mia said with a hint of a smile no youre not a kook i understand well you mentioned it that first day then your conversation with ripley yesterday good then weve established that im a witch mia sipped again youre a sweet one nell there you are trying very hard to discuss this intelligently soberly when youre thinking im lets say eccentric well table that for the moment and go back in history so i can lay some groundwork for you you know of the witch trials in salem sure a few hysterical young girls fanatical puritans mob mentality burn the witch hang mia corrected nineteen people all innocents were hanged in one was pressed to death when he refused to declare himself innocent or guilty others died in prison there have been witchhunts throughout time here in europe in every corner of the world even when most stopped believing or admitting to a belief in witchcraft there were hunts nazism mccarthyism the kkk and so on nothing more than fanatics with power pushing their own agendas and finding enough weak minds to do the dirty work and dont mia thought taking a breath get me started but today were concerned with one microcosm of history she leaned back tapped a finger lightly on the book the puritans came here searching they said for religious freedom of course many of them were only looking for a place to force their beliefs and their fears on others and in salem they persecuted and murdered blindly so blindly that not one of the nineteen souls they took was the soul of a witch prejudice and fear are never clearsighted well said there were three among them women whod chosen this place to live their lives and live their craft powerful women who had helped the sick and the sorry they knew these three that they could no longer stay where they would sooner or later be accused and condemned so the isle of three sisters was created created its said that they met in secret and cast a spell and part of the land was torn away from the mainland were living on what they took from that time and that place a sanctuary a haven isnt that what you came for nell i came for work and found it they were known as air and earth and fire for some years they lived quietly and at peace and alone it was loneliness that weakened them the one known as air wished for love we all do nell said quietly perhaps she dreamed of a prince golden and handsome who would sweep her away to some lovely place where they would live happily and have children to comfort her she was careless with her wish as women can be when they yearn he came for her and she saw only that he was golden and handsome she went away with him left her haven she tried to be a good and dutiful wife and bore her children loved them but it wasnt enough for him under the gold he was dark she grew to fear him and he fed on her fear one night mad with that hunger he killed her for being what she was thats a sad story nells throat was dry but she didnt lift her glass theres more but thats enough for now each had a sad story and a tragic end and each left a legacy a child who would bear a child who would bear a child and so on there would come a time it was said when a descendant from each of the sisters would be on the island at the same time each would have to find a way to redeem and break the pattern set three hundred years ago if not the island would topple into the sea lost as atlantis islands dont topple into the sea islands arent created by three women usually mia countered if you believe the first the second isnt much of a stretch you believe it nell nodded and that youre one of the descendants yes as you are im no one thats him talking not you im sorry instantly contrite mia reached out and gripped nells hand before she could rise i said i wouldnt pry and i wont but it annoys me to hear you say youre no one to hear you mean it forget all the rest for now if you must but dont forget who and what you are youre an intelligent woman with spine enough to make a life for herself with a gift magic in the kitchen i admire you im sorry struggling to settle again nell reached for her wine im speechless you had the courage to strike out on your own to come to a strange place and make yourself part of it courage had nothing to do with it youre wrong he didnt break you he did despite herself nells eyes filled i just took the pieces and ran away took the pieces escaped and rebuilt cant you be proud of that i cant explain what it was like you dont have to but you will eventually have to recognize your own power youll never feel complete until you do im only looking for a normal life you cant forget the possibilities mia held out a hand palm up waited unable to resist nell reached out laid her palm against mias and felt the heat a painless burn of power its in you ill help you find it ill teach you mia stated as nell stared dumbfounded at the shimmer of light between their palms when youre ready ripley scanned the beach scene and saw nothing out of the ordinary someones toddler was having a tantrum and the highpitched cranky sound of no no no blasted the air somebody missed his nap she thought people were scattered over the sand staking out their territory with towels blankets umbrellas totes coolers portable stereos nobody just went to the beach anymore she mused they packed for a day on the sand the way they packed to go to europe it never failed to amuse her every day couples and groups would haul their possessions out of their rentals and hotel rooms and set up their temporary nests on the shore and every day they would pack everything up again and haul it along with a good bit of sand back again holiday nomads the bedouins of summer leaving them to it she headed up to the village she carried nothing but her police issue a swiss army knife and a few dollars life was simpler that way she turned on high street intending to spend those few dollars on a quick meal she was off duty as much as either she or zack was ever off duty and was looking forward to a cold beer and a hot pizza when she spotted nell standing in front of the hotel looking dazed she hesitated it was as good a time as any she supposed to make that friendly overture hey nell what oh hello ripley you look a little lost no she knew just where she was nell thought at the moment it was the only thing she was absolutely sure of just a little distracted long day huh listen im about to grab some dinner a little early but im starved why dont we split a pizza my treat oh she continued to blink like someone coming out of a dream the surfside makes the best pizza on the island well its the only pizza place on the island but still howre things going at the café good there was really nothing to do but fall into step she couldnt think clearly and would have sworn that her fingers still tingled i love working there youve classed up the place ripley commented and angled her head to get a look at the book nell carried reading up on island voodoo voodoo oh with a nervous laugh nell tucked the book under her arm i guess if im living here i ought to know things sure ripley pulled open the door of the pizzeria the tourists love all that island mystique crap when we hit the solstice well be flooded with new agers hey bart ripley gave the man behind the counter a salute and grabbed an empty booth it may have been early but the place was jammed the jukebox was blaring and the two video games tucked back in a small alcove shot out noise and light bart and his wife terry run the place ripley shifted stretched her legs out on the bench theyve got your calzones your pasta and yadda yadda she said tossing nell a laminated menu but its really all about the pizza you up for that sure great anything you dont like on it nell scanned the menu why couldnt she think no even better well get a large loaded what we dont eat ill take home to zack hell pick off the mushrooms and onions and be grateful she slid out of the booth again want a beer no no thanks just water coming up seeing no point in waiting for table service ripley walked up to the counter placed the order nell watched the way she joked with the long thin man behind the counter the way she hooked her sunglasses in the collar of her shirt the way she stretched gorgeously toned and tanned arms out for the drinks the way her dark hair bobbed as she turned to walk back to the booth the noise receded like echoes in a dream until it was a wash of white sound under a rising roar like waves cresting as ripley sat across from her again nell saw her mouth moving but heard nothing nothing at all then like a door flung open it all swarmed back right up through labor day ripley finished and reached for her beer youre the third nell gripped her tingling hands together on the table huh the third youre the third sister ripley opened her mouth then closed it again in a long thin line mia she ground the two syllables together then gulped down half her beer dont start with me i dont understand theres nothing to understand just drop it she slapped the glass back on the table leaned forward heres the deal mia can think believe whatever she wants she can behave however she wants as long as she doesnt break the law i dont have to buy into it if you want to thats your business but im here for pizza and a beer i dont know what i buy into it makes you angry it just confuses me look you strike me as a sensible woman sensible women dont go around claiming to be witches descended from a trio of witches who carved an island out of a chunk of massachusetts yes but no buts theres reality and theres fantasy lets stick with reality because anything else is going to put me off my pizza so are you going to go out with my brother go confused nell pushed a hand through her hair could you rewind that question zacks working up to asking you out you interested before you answer let me say hes had all his shots practices good personal hygiene and though he has some annoying habits hes reasonably well adjusted so think about that ill get the pizza nell blew out a breath sat back she had she decided entirely too much to think about in one short evening chapter six contents prev next ripley was right about the solstice café book was so busy mia had taken on two parttime clerks for the shop and added another behind the café counter the run on the vegetarian dishes over a twoday period kept nell in a constant state of panic were running low on eggplant and alfalfa she said as peg came on shift i thought id calculated hell she yanked off her apron im going to run down to the market get what i can i may have to substitute change the menu for the rest of the day hey whatever dont sweat it easy for you to say nell thought as she rushed downstairs shed run out of hazelnut muffins by noon and there was no way the chocolate chunk cookies were going to last the day at the rate they were disappearing it was her responsibility to make certain everything in the café ran as mia expected it to run if she made a mistake in her rush to the back door she all but ran over lulu im sorry im sorry im such an idiot are you all right ill live lulu brushed fussily at her shirt the girl had put in a good three weeks work but that didnt mean lulu was ready to trust her slow down just because youre off shift doesnt mean you have to run out of the place like its on fire no im sorry is mia would you tell mia im sorry and that ill be right back she bolted out the door and didnt stop running until she was in the produce section of island market panic and dread churned in her stomach how could she have been so stupid buying supplies was an essential part of her job hadnt she been told to expect larger crowds over the solstice weekend a moron could have done a better job planning for it the pressure in her chest was making her head light but she forced herself to think to study her choices to select she filled her basket quickly waiting in agony in the checkout line as the minutes ticked away dorcas chatted at her and nell managed to make some responses while all the while her brain was screaming hurry she gathered the three heavy bags and cursing herself for not thinking to bring her car began to carry them as quickly as she could manage back to the shop nell nell wait a minute shaking his head when she didnt respond zack jogged across the street let me give you a hand with those it amazed her she didnt jump straight out of her sneakers as he reached out took two of the bags i can get them i can do it im in a hurry youll move faster if youre not weighed down supplies for the café yes yes she was nearly running again she could get another salad put together ten minutes fifteen tops and prep the ingredients for sandwiches then she could deal with the sweets if she could get started right away there might not be any gap i guess youre pretty busy he didnt like the look on her face it was so grim so set like someone about to go to war i shouldve anticipated theres no excuse for it she shoved through the back door of the shop bolted up the stairs by the time he got to the kitchen she was already unbagging thank you i can take care of it now i know what to do she moved like a dervish zack thought her eyes glassy and face pale i thought you got off at two nell two she didnt bother to look up but continued to chop grate mix no i made a mistake i have to fix it everythings going to be all right its going to be fine no ones going to be upset or inconvenienced i should have planned better i will next time i promise need two sandwich specials and a veggie pita jeez nell peg murmured as she stepped to the doorway zack put a hand on her arm get mia he said quietly two specials and a veggie okay okay nell set the beanandcucumber salad aside hauled out the sandwich ingredients i bought some more eggplant so well be fine just fine no ones upset nell you dont need to worry why dont you sit down a minute i only need a half hour twenty minutes none of the guests will be disturbed she picked up the orders spun around then jerked to a halt as mia came in its all right really its all right well have plenty of everything ill take those peg eased by slipped the orders out of nells hand they look great im just putting together a new salad there were bands around her chest around her head tightening tightening it wont take any time at all then ill take care of the rest ill take care of it dont be angry no ones angry nell i think you should take a break now i dont need one ill just finish in desperation she grabbed a bag of nuts i know i shouldve planned better and im terribly sorry but ill make sure everythings perfect he couldnt stand it couldnt stand to see her standing there trembling now her face white hell with this zack spat and stepped toward her dont she stumbled back dropping the bag flinging her arms up as if to guard her face from a blow the moment she did shame smothered panic oh baby zacks voice was ripe with sympathy she could do nothing but turn away from it i want you to come with me now mia moved to her took her hand all right come with me now miserably embarrassed helplessly shaken nell let herself be led away zack jammed his hands in his pockets and felt useless i dont know what got into me the fact was the last hour was largely a blur id say you had a big whopping panic attack now sit down mia walked across her office opened what nell had taken to be a file drawer instead she saw a minifridge stocked with small bottles of water and juice you dont have to talk to me mia said as she stepped over gave nell an opened bottle of water but you should think about talking to someone i know rather than drinking nell rubbed the chilled bottle over her face it was beyond ridiculous she thought now falling to pieces over eggplant i thought i was over it that hasnt happened in a really long time months we were so busy and supplies were running low it got bigger and bigger in my mind until i thought if i didnt get some more eggplant the world was going to end she drank now deeply stupid not stupid if you were used to being punished for something just that petty in the past nell lowered the bottle hes not here he cant hurt me cant he little sister hes never stopped hurting you if thats true its my problem im not a dishrag anymore im not a punching bag or a doormat good to hear she pressed her fingers to her temple she had to let something out she realized lift something off or shed break again we had a party once and ran out of martini olives it was the first time he hit me mias face registered no shock no judgment how long did you stay with him there was no censure in the question no slick surface of pity or underlying smugness because the question was asked in a brisk and practical tone nell responded in kind three years if he finds me hell kill me i knew that when i left hes an important man wealthy connected hes looking for you no he thinks im dead nearly nine months now id rather be dead than live the way i was living that sounds melodramatic but no it doesnt the employment forms you filled out for me are they safe yes my grandmothers maiden name i broke some laws computer hacking false statement forged documents to get new identification a drivers license social security number computer hacking lifting a brow mia smiled nell you surprise me im good with computers i used to you dont have to tell me its all right i helped run a business a catering business with my mother a long time ago i used a computer for records invoices what have you since i was going to keep the books the records i took some courses when i started planning to run i did a lot of research i knew id only get one chance god ive never been able to talk to anyone about it i never thought i could do you want to tell me the rest im not sure it gets stuck somewhere right about here she said tapping a fist on her chest if you decide you want to come up to the house tonight ill show you my gardens my cliffs meanwhile take a breather take a walk take a nap mia id like to finish in the café not because im upset or worried id just like to finish all right the drive up the coast was breathtaking the curving road with its sudden unexpected twists the steady roar of the water the rush of wind the memories it brought back should have disturbed her left her shaken instead as nell pushed her poor rustbucket of a car for speed she felt exhilarated as if she were leaving all her excess weight on the twisted road behind her maybe it was the sight of that tall white tower against the summer sky and the broody stone house beside it they looked like something out of a storybook old and sturdy and wonderfully secret the painting shed seen on the mainland hadnt done them justice oil and canvas hadnt been able to translate the sweep of the wind the texture of the rocks the gnarled humps of trees and she thought as she rounded the last turn the painting hadnt had mia standing between two vivid flows of flowers in a blue dress with her miles of red hair rioting in the wind nell parked her sad car behind mias shiny silver convertible i hope you dont take this the wrong way nell called out i always take things the right way i was just thinking if i were a man id promise you anything when mia only laughed nell tipped back her head and tried to take in all the house at once the dour stone the fanciful gables the romance of the widows walk its wonderful it suits you it certainly does but so far from everything everyone youre not lonely here i enjoy my own company are you afraid of heights no nell answered no im not have a look at the headland its spectacular nell walked with her between the house and the tower out to the rugged jag of cliffs that jutted over the ocean even here there were flowers tough little blooms that fought their way through cracks or blossomed along the scruffy tufts of wild grass below the waves thrashed and fumed hurling themselves against the base of the cliffs rearing back to slap again beyond the water turned a deep deep blue and stretched forever when i was a girl i would sit here and wonder at all this sometimes i still do nell turned her head studied mias profile did you grow up here yes in this house its always been mine my parents were for the sea and now they sail it theyre currently in the south pacific i think we were always more a couple and a child than a family they never quite adjusted to me nor i to them for that matter though we got along well enough with a little shrug she turned away the lights been here nearly three hundred years sending out its beam to guide ships and seamen still thereve been wrecks and its said as one would expect it to be said of such places that on some nights when the wind is right one can hear the desperate calls of the drowned not a comforting bedtime story no the sea isnt always kind still she was drawn to it compelled to stand and watch its whims its charm and its violence fire drawn to water the house came before she added it was the first house built on the island conjured by magic in the moonlight nell added i read the book well magic or mortar it stands the gardens are my joy and ive indulged myself there she gestured nell looked back toward the house blinked the rear was a fantasy of blooms shapes arbors paths the juxtaposition between raw cliffs and lush fairyland almost made her dizzy my god mia its amazing spectacular like a painting do you do all the work yourself mmm now and then ill dragoon a strong back but for the most part i can handle it it relaxes me she said as they walked toward the first tangle of hedges and gratifies me there seemed to be dozens of secret places unexpected turns an iron trellis buried under wisteria a sudden stream of pure white blossoms curling through like a satin ribbon a tiny pool where water lilies drifted and reeds speared up around a statue of a goddess there were stone fairies and fragrant lavender marble dragons and trailing nasturtium cheerfully blooming herbs tumbled through a rock garden and spilled toward a cushion of moss covered with starry flowers no wonder youre not lonely here exactly mia led the way down a crooked path to a small stone island the table there was stone as well and stood on the base of a laughing winged gargoyle were having champagne to celebrate the solstice ive never met anyone like you mia lifted the bottle out of a gleaming copper pail i should hope not i insist on being unique she poured two glasses sat then stretched out her legs and wiggled the painted toes of her bare feet tell me how you died nell i drove off a cliff she took her glass drank deep we lived in california beverly hills and monterey it seemed at first like being a princess in a castle he swept me off my feet she couldnt sit so she wandered the little island and drew in the scent of the flowers she heard the tinkle of bells and saw that mia had the same starry wind chime shed bought for herself on her first day my father was in the military we moved around a lot and that was hard but he was wonderful so handsome and brave and strong i suppose he was strict but he was never unkind i loved being with him he couldnt always be with us and we missed him i loved seeing him come back in his uniform and the way his face would light up when my mother and i went to meet him he was killed in the gulf war i still miss him she drew a deep breath it wasnt easy for my mother but she got through it thats when she started the catering business she called it a moveable feast hemingway clever mia acknowledged classy she was both shes always been a terrific cook and loved to entertain she taught me it was something we liked doing together a bond between you mia commented a lovely and strong one yes we moved to chicago and she built up an impressive reputation while i went to college took care of the books and pitched in whenever i could manage it around classes when i was twentyone i started working with her fulltime we expanded and developed an elite list of clients thats how i met evan at a party in chicago we were catering a very important party for very important people i was twentyfour he was ten years older and everything i wasnt sophisticated brilliant cultured mia held up a finger why do you say that youre a traveled educated woman with an enviable skill i didnt feel like any of those things when i was with him nell sighed in any case i didnt move in the same circles i cooked for the rich the highpowered the glamorous i didnt share the table with them he made me feel grateful that he would pay attention to me as if it were some fabulous compliment i just realized that she shook her head he flirted with me and it was exciting he sent me two dozen roses the next day it was always red roses he asked me out and took me to the theater to parties to fabulous restaurants he stayed in chicago for two weeks made it clear he was staying reorganizing his schedule putting off his clients his work his life for me i was meant for him nell whispered rubbing arms that were suddenly chilled we were meant for each other then when he told me that it was thrilling later not so very much later it was terrifying he said things to me that seemed romantic then wed always be together wed never be apart he would never let me go he dazzled me and when he asked me to marry him i didnt think twice my mother had reservations asked me to give it some time but i wouldnt listen we eloped and i went back to california with him the press called it the romance of the decade ah yes mia nodded as nell turned back it clicks you looked different then more like a pampered kitten i looked the way he told me to look and behaved the way he told me to behave at first that seemed fine he was older wiser and i was new in his world he made it seem reasonable just as he made it seem instructional when he would tell me i was slow or dull he knew best so if he ordered me to change my dress for another before i was permitted to go out he was only looking out for my interests and our image it was very subtle at first those digs those demands and whenever i pleased him i was given a little treat like a puppy being trained here you performed very well for company last night have a diamond bracelet god it disgusts me how easily i was manipulated you were in love i did love him the man i thought he was and he was so clever so relentless the first time he hit me it was a horrible shock but it never occurred to me that i didnt deserve it id been so well trained it got worse after that but slowly bit by bit my mother was killed hardly a year after i left drunk driver nell said her voice thickening and you were alone then im so sorry he was so kind so supportive he made all the arrangements canceled his appointments for a week to take me to chicago he did everything a loving husband could do and the day we got home he went wild he waited until we were home back in that house and hed sent all the servants away then he knocked me down he raved and slapped he never used his fists on me always an open hand i think it was somehow more degrading he accused me of having an affair with one of the mourners a man whod been a good friend of my parents a kind and decent man whom i thought of as an uncle well surprised that her glass was empty she walked back to the table poured another there were birds singing a pretty chippering among the flowers we dont need a blowbyblow account he abused me i took it she lifted her glass drank steadied herself again i went to the police once he had a lot of friends on the force a lot of influence they didnt take me seriously oh i had some bruises but nothing life threatening he found out and he explained to me in ways id understand that if i ever humiliated him like that again hed kill me i got away once but he found me he told me i belonged to him and that he would never let me go he told me that when his hands were around my throat that if i ever tried to leave him hed find me and hed kill me no one would ever know and i believed him but you did leave him i planned it for six months step by step always careful not to upset him not to give him cause to suspect we entertained we traveled we slept together we were the picture of the perfect affluent couple he still hit me there was always something i didnt do quite right but i would always apologize i pilfered cash whenever i could and hid it in a box of tampons pretty safe bet he wouldnt look there i got a fake drivers license and i hid that too and then i was ready he had a sister in big sur she was having a lavish tea party very female i was expected to go that morning i complained of a headache which of course annoyed him i was just making excuses he said a number of his clients would be there and i just wanted to embarrass him by not showing up so i said id go naturally id go i would just take some aspirin and be fine but i knew my reluctance would ensure him letting me out of the house shed gotten clever too nell thought now at deceit at pretense i wasnt even frightened then he went off to play golf and i put what i needed in the trunk of the car i stopped on the way and put on a black wig i picked up the secondhand bike id bought the week before and put it in the trunk i stopped again before i got to the party hid the bike at a spot id picked out i drove down highway and i went to tea nell sat down spoke calmly while mia sat in silence i made sure that a number of people noted i wasnt feeling very well barbara his sister even suggested i lie down for a bit i waited until most of the guests had left then i thanked her for a lovely time she was worried about me i looked pale i brushed her off and i got back in the car her voice was calm almost flat she was just a woman telling a mildly distasteful story one that had happened to someone else thats what she told herself it was dark now i needed it to be i called evan on my cell phone to tell him i was on my way he always insisted on that i got to the stretch of the road where id hidden the bike and there were no other cars i knew it could be done had to be i took off my seat belt i didnt think id practiced it in my head a thousand times so i didnt let myself think i opened the door still driving swerving going faster i aimed for the edge if i didnt make it well i was no worse off i jumped it was like flying the car soared over the edge just soared like a bird then it crashed on the rocks horrible sound and it tumbled and rolled and fell into the water i ran back to where i had the bike and the bag i pulled off my beautiful suit and put on old jeans and a sweatshirt the wig i still wasnt afraid no she hadnt been afraid not then but now as she relived it her voice began to hitch it hadnt happened to someone else after all i rode down the hills and up and down when i got to carmel i went into the bus station and i paid cash for a oneway ticket to las vegas when i was on the bus and it started to move out of the station i was afraid afraid he would come and stop the bus and i would lose but he didnt in vegas i got on a bus for albuquerque and in albuquerque i bought a paper and read about the tragic death of helen remington nell mia reached out closed a hand over nells she doubted that nell was aware shed been crying for the last ten minutes ive never met anyone like you either nell lifted her glass and as tears spilled down her cheeks toasted thanks at mias insistence she spent the night it seemed sensible after several glasses of champagne and an emotional purge to let herself be led to a big fourposter without protest she slipped on a borrowed silk nightshirt climbed between soft linen sheets and fell instantly asleep and woke in the moonlit dark it took her a moment to orient herself to remember where she was and what had awakened her mias guest room she thought groggily and people were singing no not singing chanting it was a lovely melodious sound just on the edges of her hearing drawn to it she rose and still logy with sleep moved directly to the terrace doors she pushed them open to a warm whipping wind and stepped out into the pearlwhite light of a threequarter moon the scent of flowers seemed to rise up and surround her until her head spun with it as it had with wind the heartbeat of the sea was fast almost a rage and her own raced to keep pace then she saw mia dressed in a robe that gleamed silver in the moonlight step out of the woods where trees swayed like dancers she walked to the cliffs the silver of her gown the flame of her hair whirling there high on the rocks she faced the sea and lifted her arms to star and moon the air filled with voices and the voices seemed filled with joy with her eyes dazzled with wonder stinging with tears she didnt understand nell watched as light shimmering beams of it slid down from the sky to brush the tips of mias fingers the ends of her flying hair for a moment it seemed she was like a candle straight slim incandescent lighting the edge of the world then there was only the sound of the surf the pearlwhite light of the waning moon and a woman standing alone on a cliff mia turned walked back toward the house her head lifted and her eyes met nells held held she smiled quietly moved into the shadow of the house and was gone chapter seven contents prev next it was still dark when nell tiptoed down to mias kitchen the house was huge and took some maneuvering though she wasnt sure what time mia rose for the day she brewed a pot of coffee for her hostess and wrote a note of thanks before she left they would have to talk nell thought as she drove home in the softening light of predawn about a number of things and they would she decided as soon as she could figure out where to begin she could almost convince herself that what shed seen in the moonlight had been nothing more than a champagneinduced dream almost but it was too clear in her mind to be a dream light spilling out of stars like liquid silver a rising wind full of song a woman glowing like a torch such things should be fantasy but they werent if they were real and she had a part in them she needed to know what it all meant for the first time in nearly four years she felt absolutely steady absolutely calm for now that was enough by noon she was too busy to think about more than the job at hand there was a paycheck in her pocket and a day off around the corner iced hazelnut cappuccino large the man who ordered leaned on the counter as nell began to work she judged him as midthirties healthclub fit and a mainlander it pleased her that she could already with very decent accuracy spot a mainlander and feel the slightly smug reaction of an islander so how much aphrodisiac do you put in those cookies he asked her she glanced at him im sorry ever since i tasted your oatmeal raisin i havent been able to get you out of my mind really i couldve sworn i put all the aphrodisiac in the macadamia nut in that case ill take three he said im jim and youve seduced me with your baked goods then youd better stay away from my threebean salad itll ruin you for all other women if i buy all the threebean salad will you marry me and have my children well i would jim but ive taken a sacred oath to stay free to bake for all the world she capped his coffee bagged it do you really want those cookies you bet how about a clambake some friends and i are sharing a house were going to do in some clams tonight tonight a clambake tomorrow a house in the suburbs and a cocker spaniel she rang him up took his money with a smile better safe than sorry but thanks youre breaking my heart he said and sighing heavily he walked away oh man he is so cute peg craned her neck to keep him in sight until hed gone downstairs youre really not interested no nell took off her apron rolled her shoulders then you wouldnt mind if i gave him a shot be my guest theres plenty of bean salad in the fridge oh and peg thanks for being understanding about yesterday hey everybody gets weird now and then see you monday see you monday nell thought it was just that simple she was a member of the team she had friends she had deflected an overture from an attractive man without getting the jitters in fact she enjoyed it the way she used to enjoy such things the day might come when she didnt feel compelled to deflect one day she might go to a clambake with a man and some of his friends talk laugh enjoy the companionship light casual friendships she could do that there couldnt be any serious relationships in her future even if she could learn to handle one emotionally she was after all still legally married but now just now that fact was more of a safety net than the nightmare it had been she was free to be whoever she wanted to be but not free enough to be bound again not to any man she decided to treat herself to an ice cream cone and a detour to the beach people called her by name as she passed and that was a quiet thrill as she crossed the sand she spotted pete stahr and his infamous dog both looked sheepish as zack stood beside them hands on hips he never wore a hat as hed advised her to do when gardening as a result his hair was lighter at the tips and almost always disordered from the ocean breeze he rarely wore his badge either she noted but the gun rode in the holster at his hip almost casually it occurred to her that if he had stopped by the café and asked her to go to a clambake she might not have brushed him off when the dog lifted his paw hopefully zack shook his head pointed to the leash that pete held once the leash was secured man and dog walked off heads hung low zack turned the sun bouncing off his dark glasses and she knew instinctively that he was looking at her nell braced herself and went to him sheriff nell pete let his dog off the leash again mutt smells like a fish house ice creams dripping its hot nell licked at the cone and decided to get it over with about yesterday feeling better yes good gonna share any of that what oh sure she held out the cone felt a little tingle in the blood when he licked just above her fingertips funny she thought she hadnt gotten any tingles from the cute guy with the clambake youre not going to ask not as long as youd rather i didnt yes hed looked at her and had seen the deliberate squaring of her shoulders before she started toward him why dont you walk with me a while theres a nice breeze off the water i was wondering what does lucy do all day when youre out upholding the law this and that dog chores that tickled a laugh out of her dog chores sure some days a dogs got to hang around the house roll in the grass and think long thoughts other times she comes on in to the office with me when shes in the mood swims chews up my shoes im thinking about buying her a brother or sister i was thinking about getting a cat im not sure id be able to train a puppy a cat would be easier i saw a notice on the board in the market for free kittens the stubens girls cat theyve still got one or two left last i heard their place is over on bay white saltbox blue shutters she nodded stopped impulse she reminded herself had served her well so far why stop following it zack im going to try out a new recipe tonight tuna and linguini with sundried tomatoes and feta i could use a guinea pig he lifted her hand took another taste of her dripping ice cream well it happens i dont have any pressing plans for tonight and as sheriff i do what i can to serve the needs of the community what time is seven all right with you works for me fine ill see you then bring an appetite she said as she hurried away count on it he said and tipped down his dark glasses to watch her dash back toward the village at seven the appetizers were ready and the wine was chilling nell had bought a secondhand table and planned to spend part of her day off scraping and painting it but for now she covered the scarred wood and peeling green paint with a sheet it stood on her back lawn along with the two old chairs shed picked up for a song they werent particularly pretty at the moment but they had potential and they were hers shed set the table with two plates two bowls and wineglasses all purchases from the island thrift shop nothing matched but she thought the result was cheerful and charming and as far from the formal china and heavy silver of her past as possible her garden was coming along well and the tomato and pepper plants the squash and zucchini would all be put in the following morning she was very close to broke again and completely content well now doesnt that look sweet nell turned to see gladys macey standing on the edge of her lawn gripping an enormous white purse just as pretty as a picture mrs macey hello hope you dont mind me dropping by this way idve called but you havent got a phone no of course not um can i get you something to drink no no dont you fuss ive come by on business business yes indeed her tidy helmet of black hair barely moved as she gave a sharp nod carl and i got our thirtieth anniversary coming up last part of july congratulations you can say that again two people stick it out for three decades its saying something since it is i want a party and i just finished telling carl hes not getting out of putting on a suit for it either i was wondering if youd take care of putting the refreshments together for me oh well i want a catered affair gladys said definitely and i want it spiffy when my girl got married two years ago last april we hired a caterer from the mainland too snippy for my taste and too dear for carls but we didnt have much to choose from i dont figure youre going to get snippy with me or charge me a kings ransom for a bowl of cold shrimp mrs macey i appreciate you thinking of me but im not set up to cater well you got time dont you ive got a list here of how many people and the kind of business im thinking of she pulled a file folder out of the enormous purse pushed it into nells hand i want to have it right at my house and ive got my mothers good china and so forth you just look over what ive put together there and well talk about it tomorrow you come on by the house tomorrow afternoon id certainly like to help you maybe i can she looked down at the folder saw that gladys had marked it thirtieth anniversary and had added a heart with her initials and carls in the center touched she tucked the folder under her arm ill see what i can do youre a nice girl nell gladys glanced over her shoulder at the sound of a car lifted her eyebrows as she recognized zacks cruiser and youve got good taste you come on by tomorrow and well talk this out have a nice dinner now she strolled toward her car stopping to say a few words to zack she gave him a pat on the cheek noted the flowers in his hand by the time she was behind the wheel she was planning who shed call first to spread the news that zachariah todd was sparking the little channing girl im a little late sorry we had a fender bender in the village put me behind its all right i thought you might like these for your garden she smiled at the pot of shasta daisies theyre perfect thanks she took them set them beside her kitchen stoop ill get the wine and the appetizers he walked into the kitchen behind her something smells great once i got started i tried out a couple of different recipes youve got your work cut out for you im up for it now whats this he crouched down stroked a finger over the smokegray kitten circled on a pillow in the corner thats diego were living together the kitten mewed stretched then began to bat at zacks shoelaces youve been busy cooking buying furniture getting a roommate scooping up diego he turned toward her nobodys going to find any moss on you nell he stood there big and handsome with a gray kitten nuzzling at his shoulder hed brought her white daisies in a plastic pot oh damn she set her tray of appetizers down again took a breath i might as well get this over with i dont want you to get the wrong impression about dinner and things im very attracted to you but im not in a place where i can act on my feelings its only fair to tell you that up front there are good reasons for it but im not willing to get into them so if youd rather just go no hard feelings he listened soberly rubbing a finger between the kittens silky ears i appreciate you spelling that out for me seems a shame to waste all this food though he plucked a stuffed olive from the tray popped it into his mouth ill just hang around if its all the same to you why dont i take the wine outside he picked up the bottle and still carrying diego bumped the screened door with his hip oh and in the interest of fair play ill tell you ill be nudging you out of that place youre in with that said he held the door open you want to bring those on out im not as easy a nudge as you might think honey theres nothing easy about you she picked up the tray sailed by him i take that as a compliment it was meant as one now why dont we have some wine relax and you can tell me what gladys macey was after when they were seated she poured the wine and he settled the kitten in his lap i thought being sheriff youd know all there is to know about whats going on well he leaned over the tray selected a gnocchi i can deduce seeing as im a trained observer theres a file on your counter marked with gladyss handwriting which leads me to believe shes planning on an anniversary party and as im sitting here heading straight toward heaven with whatever the hell it is i just put in my mouth and knowing gladys is a shrewd lady id suppose shes wanting you to cater it howd i do dead on are you going to do it im going to think about it youd do a great job he plucked another selection from the tray examined it suspiciously any mushrooms in this thing i hate mushrooms no were fungifree tonight why would i do a good job i said great job he popped it in his mouth some creamy cheese and herbs in a thin and flaky pastry because you cook like a magician you look like an angel and youre as organized as a computer you get things done and youve got style how come youre not eating any of this i want to see if you live first when he only grinned and kept eating she sat back and sipped her wine im a good cook put me in a kitchen and i rule the world im presentable but i dont look like an angel im the one looking at you im organized she continued because i keep my life simple which is another way of saying youre not going to complicate it with me there you go dead on again im going to get the salad zack waited until her back was turned before he let his amusement show easy enough to ruffle her feathers he said to diego when you know where to scratch let me tell you something ive learned over the years about women keep changing the rhythm and theyll never know what to expect next when nell came back out zack launched into the story of the pediatrician from washington and the stockbroker from new york whod bumped fenders outside the pharmacy on high street he made her laugh put her gently at ease again before she knew it she was telling him about various kitchen feuds in restaurants where shed worked temperaments and sharp implements she said a dangerous combination i once had a line chef threaten me with an electric whisk because dusk was falling he lit the squat red candle shed set on the table i had no idea there was so much danger and intrigue behind those swinging doors and sexual tension she added twirling linguini onto her fork smoldering looks over simmering pots of stock broken hearts shattering in the whipping cream its a hotbed foods got all that sensuality flavor texture scent this tunas getting me pretty worked up so the dish passes the audition its great candlelight suited her he thought it put little gold lights in those deep blue pools do you make this stuff up or collect recipes what both i like to experiment when my mother she trailed off but zack merely picked up the wine bottle topped off their glasses she liked to cook nell said simply and entertain my mother well well just say the kitchen wasnt her best room i was twenty before i realized a pork chop wasnt supposed to bounce if you dropped it she lived on an island most of her life but as far as she was concerned tuna came out of a can shes hell with numbers though numbers certified public accountant retired now she and my dad bought themselves one of those big tin cans on wheels and hit the great american highway about a year ago theyre having a terrific time thats nice and so was the unmistakable affection in his voice do you miss them i do im not going to say i miss my mothers cooking but i miss their company my father used to sit out on the back porch and play the banjo i miss that the banjo it sounded so charming do you play no i never could get my fingers to cooperate my father played the piano he used to she stopped herself again realigning her thoughts as she rose i could never get my fingers to cooperate either strawberry shortcake for dessert can you manage it i can probably choke some down just to be polite let me give you a hand no she waved him down before he could rise ive got it itll just take me she glanced down as she cleared his plate saw diego sprawled bellyup in apparent ecstasy in his lap have you been sneaking that cat food from the table me all innocence zack picked up his wineglass i dont know what makes you think that youll spoil him and make him sick she started to reach down scoop up the kitten then realized that considering diegos location the move was just a tad too personal put him down a while so he can run around and work off that tuna before i take him inside yes maam she had the coffee on and was about to slice the cake when he came through the door with the serving bowl thanks but guests dont clear they did in my house he looked at the cake all fluffy white and succulent red and back at her honey ive got to tell you thats a work of art presentations half the battle she said pleased she went still when he laid his hand over the back of hers nearly relaxed again when he simply moved hers to widen the size of the slice im a big patron of the arts at this rate diegos not the only one whos going to be sick but she cut him a piece twice the size of her own ill bring the coffee i should tell you something else he began as he picked up the plates then held the door for her again i plan on touching you a lot maybe you could work on getting used to it i dont like being handled i didnt plan to start out that way he walked to the table set down the cake plates and sat though handling on both sides can have some satisfying results i dont put marks on women nell i dont use my hands that way im not going to talk about that she answered curtly im not asking you to im talking about me and you and the way things are now things arent any way now like that theyre going to be he scooped up some cake sampled it god woman you sell this on the open market youd be a millionaire inside of six months i dont need to be rich got your back up again he observed and kept right on eating i dont mind that some men look for a woman wholl buckle under tow the line whatever he shrugged speared a fat strawberry now me i wonder why it seems that would get boring fast for both parties involved no spark there if you know what i mean i dont need sparks either everybody does people who set them off each other every time they turn around though well that would just wear you out something told her he didnt wear out or wear down easily but if you dont light a spark now and again he went on you miss the sizzle that comes with it if you cooked without spice or seasoning youd come up with something you could eat but it wouldnt satisfy thats very clever but there are some of us who stay healthier on a bland diet my greatuncle frank zack gestured with his fork before he dived into the cake again ulcers some said it came from pure meanness and its hard to argue he was a hardheaded miserly yankee never married he preferred curling up in bed with his ledgers rather than a woman lived to be ninetyeight and the moral of the story oh i wasnt thinking of morals just greatuncle frank wed go to dinner at my grandmothers the third sunday of every month when i was a boy she made the best damn pot roast you know the kind circled around with the little potatoes and carrots my mother didnt inherit grans talent with a pot roast but anyway greatuncle frank would come and eat rice pudding while the rest of us gorged the man scared the hell out of me i cant look at a bowl of rice pudding to this day without getting the shakes it must be some kind of magic she decided that made it so impossible not to relax around him i think youre making half that up not a single word you can look him up in the registry at the island methodist church francis morris bigelow gran she married a ripley but was a bigelow by birth and older sister to frank she lived to just past her hundredth birthday herself we tend to be longlived in my family which is why most of us dont settle down to marriage and family until into our thirties i see since hed polished off his cake nell nudged hers toward him and wasnt the least bit surprised when he took a forkful id always thought new england yankees were a taciturn breed you know ayah nope maybe we like to talk in my family ripley can be shortwinded but then she isnt overly fond of people as a species this is the best meal ive had since sunday dinner at my grans that is the ultimate compliment wed finish it off exactly right if we were to take a walk on the beach she couldnt chink of a reason to say no maybe she didnt want to the light was fading going deep at the edges a needlethin and needlebright swath of light swept over the horizon and a blush of pink gleamed in the west the tide had gone out leaving a wide avenue of dark damp sand that was cool underfoot the surf teased it foaming out in ribbons while narrowbodied birds with legs like stilts pecked for their supper others strolled the beach almost all couples now nell noted handinhand or arminarm as a precaution shed tucked her own hands in her pockets after shed pried off her shoes and rolled up her jeans here and there were stockpiles of driftwood that would be bonfires when full dark fell she wondered what it would be like to sit by the flames with a group of friends to laugh and talk of nothing important havent seen you go in yet in the water zack explained she didnt own a bathing suit but saw no reason to say so ive waded in a couple of times dont swim of course i can swim lets go he scooped her up so fast her heart stuck between her chest and her throat she could barely manage to breathe much less scream before full panic had a chance to bloom she was in the water zack was laughing spinning her away from an oncoming wave to take the brunt of it himself she was sliding rolling fighting to gain her feet when he simply nipped her at the waist and righted her cant live on three sisters without being baptized tossing his wet hair back he pulled her farther out its freezing balmy he corrected your bloods just thin yet here comes a goodsize one youd better hold on to me i dont want to whatever she did or didnt want the sea had its own ideas the wave hit knocked her off her feet and had her legs tangling with his you idiot but she was laughing as she surfaced when the air hit her skin she quickly dunked neckdeep again the sheriffs supposed to have more sense than to jump in the ocean fully dressed idve stripped down but we havent known each other long enough he rolled over on his back floating lazily the first stars are coming out theres nothing like it nothing in the world like it come on the sea rocked her made her feel weightless as she watched the color of the sky change as the tone deepened bit by bit stars winked to life youre right theres nothing like it but its still freezing you just need a winter on the island to thicken your blood up he took her hand a quiet connection as they drifted an armspan apart ive never spent more than three months at a time offisland and that was for college had three years of that and couldnt take it anymore i knew what i wanted anyway and thats what ive got the rhythm of the waves the sweep of the sky the quiet flow of his voice coming out of the dark its a kind of magic isnt it she sighed as the cool moist breeze whispered over her face to know what you want to just know and to get it magic doesnt hurt work helps so does patience and all kinds of things i know what i want now and im getting it thats magic to me the islands never been short on that commodity comes from being founded by witches i suppose surprise tinged her voice do you believe in that sort of thing why wouldnt i things are whether people believe in them or not there were lights in the sky last night that werent stars a person could look the other way but theyd still have been there he planted his feet again lifting her until she stood facing him with the water fuming at waist level night had drifted in and the lights of the stars sprinkled over the surface of the water you can turn away from something like this he skimmed her wet hair away from her face left his hands resting there but its still going to be there she pressed a hand against his shoulder as his mouth lowered to hers she meant to turn away told herself to turn away to where everything was safe and ordered and simple but the spark hed spoken of snapped inside her warm and bright she curled her fingers into his wet shirt and let herself feel alive cold where the air whisked over her skin hot in the belly where desire began to build testing herself she leaned into him parted her lips under his he took his time as much for himself as for her sampling savoring she tasted of the sea smelled of it for a moment in the stardrenched surf he let himself drown he eased back let his hands run over her shoulders down her arms before he linked his fingers with hers not so complicated he kissed her again lightly though the lightness cost him ill walk you home chapter eight contents prev next mia can i talk to you with ten minutes until opening nell hurried down from the café lulu was already ringing up mail orders and shot her a typically suspicious look while mia continued to put the finishing touches on a new display of course whats on your mind well i the store was small enough and empty enough that lulu would hear every word i thought we could go up to your office for a minute heres fine dont let lulus sour face put you off mia built a small tower out of new summer releases shes worried youre going to ask me for a loan and naturally im such a soft touch along with my soft head ill let you rob me blind so ill die penniless and alone in some filthy gutter isnt that right lu lulu merely sniffed and jabbed keys on the cash register oh no its not about money id never ask for after youve been so damn it nell fisted her hands in her hair tugged until the pain stiffened her spine deliberately now she turned to face lulu i understand youre protective of mia and you have no reason to trust me i came out of nowhere with nothing and havent been here a month but im not a thief and im not a user ive carried my weight here and im going to keep carrying it and if mia asked me to try serving sandwiches while standing on one foot and singing yankee doodle dandy id give it my best shot because i came out of nowhere with nothing and she gave me a chance lulu sniffed again wouldnt mind seeing that myself likely bring in fresh trade too never said you didnt carry your weight she added but that doesnt mean i wont keep a watch on you fine with me i understand all this sentimental bonding mia dabbed at her lashes its ruining my mascara she stepped back from her display nodded in approval now what do you need to talk to me about nell mrs macey is having an anniversary party next month shed like to have a fancy catered affair yes i know mia turned to straighten stock on the shelves shell drive you a bit crazy with changes and suggestions and questions but you can handle it i didnt agree to we just discussed it yesterday i didnt realize youd heard she asked already i wanted to talk to you first its a small island word gets around you dont need to talk to me about an outside catering job nell she made a mental note to order more ritual candies thered been a run on them during the solstice and they were running unacceptably low on passion and on prosperity which just showed she supposed where many peoples priorities lay your free time is your time she added i just wanted to tell you that if i did the job for her it wouldnt interfere with my work here i should hope not particularly since im giving you a raise she glanced at her watch time to open lu youre giving me a raise youve earned it i hired you at a probationary salary youre officially off probation she unlocked the door walked over to turn on the music system how was your dinner with zack the other night mia asked with amusement a small island as i said it was fine it was just a friendly dinner goodlooking boy lulu said quality too im not trying to lure him into temptation something wrong with you then lulu tipped down her silver frames and peered over them it was a look she was particularly proud of if i were a few years younger id be setting out lures got a great pair of hands on him bet he knows how to use them no doubt mia said mildly but youre embarrassing our nell now where was i gladyss anniversary check raise check dinner with zack check she paused tapped a fingertip against her lips ah yes nell i wanted to ask do you have a religious or political objection to cosmetics or jewelry she could find nothing more constructive to do than huff out her breath no thats a relief here she took off the silver dangles on her ears handed them to nell wear these if anyone asks where you got them they come from all that glitters two doors down we like to promote other merchants ill want them back at the end of your shift tomorrow you might try a little blush maybe some lipstick eyeliner i dont have any im sorry mia held up a hand laid the other on her heart and staggered to the counter for support i feel a little faint did you say you dont own any lipstick the corner of nells mouth turned up and brought out a hint of dimples im afraid not lulu we have to help this woman its our duty emergency supplies hurry lips quivering with what might have been a smile lulu hauled a large cosmetic bag out from under the counter shes got good skin a blank canvas lu a blank canvas come with me she ordered nell the café the regulars will be coming in any second im fast and im good lets move she grabbed nells hand hauled her upstairs and into the rest room ten minutes later nell was serving her first customers and wearing silver earrings peachtoned lipstick and expertly smudged slate eyeliner there was something she decided very comforting about feeling female again she took the catering job and crossed her fingers when zack asked if shed like to go for an evening sail she said yes and felt powerful when a customer asked if she could bake a cake in the shape of a ballerina for a birthday party she said absolutely and spent her fee on a pair of earrings as word spread she found herself agreeing to provide picnicstyle food for a party of twenty for july fourth and ten box lunches for a private day sailor at her kitchen table nell spread out notes files menus somehow she was becoming her own cottage industry which she thought looking around seemed perfectly apt she glanced up at the brisk knock on the door and happily welcomed ripley in got a minute sure sit down do you want anything im fine ripley sat then picked up diego when he sniffed at her shoes meal planning ive got to organize these catering jobs if i had a computer well eventually id sell my soul for a professional blender and both feet for a commercialgrade food processor but for now we make do why dont you use the computer at the bookstore mias already doing enough whatever listen ive got this date for the fourth a date with potential she added casual because zack and i are more or less on duty right through the night fireworks and beer sometimes make people a little too festive for their own good i cant wait to see the fireworks everyone says theyre spectacular yeah we do a hell of a job on them the thing is this guy hes a security consultant on the mainland hes been hitting on me and i decided to let him land one ripley thats so romantic i can barely catch my breath hes really built too ripley continued as she scratched diegos ears so the afterfireworks fireworks potential is fairly high if you get me ive been in a downswing sexwise anyway we talked about having this night picnic deal and somehow i got stuck with doing the food since i think id like to jump this guys bones i dont want to poison him first a romantic picnic for two nell made notes vegetarian or carnivore carnivore not too fancy okay ripley plucked a grape from the bowl of fruit on the table popped it in her mouth i dont want him more interested in the food than me check pickup or delivery this is so cool cheerful she popped another grape i can pick it up can we keep it under fifty under fifty tell him to pick up a nice crisp white wine now if you had a picnic hamper weve got one somewhere perfect bring that by and well pack it up youll be set foodwise the bonejumping portion of the evening is up to you i can handle that you know if you want i can ask around see if anybodys got a secondhand computer they want to sell that would be great im glad you came by she rose got out two glasses i was afraid you were annoyed with me no not with you that particular subject annoys me its a bunch of bullshit just like she scowled through the screened door well speak of the devil i try not to why borrow trouble mia sailed in laid a note on the counter phone message for you nell gladys and her newest party brainstorm im sorry you dont have time to run over here this way ill speak to her again and i promise ill see about getting a phone dont worry about it i wanted a walk or id have left it for tomorrow and ill have a glass of that lemonade she needs a computer ripley said flatly she wont use the one at the store because she doesnt want to hassle you ripley mia im perfectly fine working this way she can certainly use the computer at the store when its free mia said to ripley and she doesnt need you running interference between her and me she wouldnt if you werent trying to push your psychic hooey on her psychic hooey sounds like the name of a secondrate rock band and has nothing to do with what i am but even thats better than blind stubborn denial knowledge is always better than ignorance you want ignorance ripley said getting to her feet stop stop it jittering inside nell put herself between them this is ridiculous do you two always go at each other this way yes mia picked up a glass sipped delicately we enjoy it dont we deputy id enjoy popping you one more but then id have to arrest myself try it mia angled her chin i promise not to press charges nobody hits anybody not in my house instantly contrite mia set down her glass rubbed a hand down nells arm it was rigid as steel im sorry little sister ripley and i irritate each other a longstanding habit but we shouldnt put you in the middle we shouldnt put her in the middle mia said to ripley it isnt fair something we agree on how about this if we run into each other here its a neutral zone you know like romulan space no warfare romulan neutral zone ive always admired your grip on popular culture agreed she even picked up the second glass passed it to ripley there you see nell youre a good influence on us already she handed the third glass to nell to positive influences ripley hesitated cleared her throat okay okay what the hell positive influences and standing in a loose circle they tapped glasses they rang like a bell one bright peal as a shower of light fountained up from that connection of secondhand kitchenware mia smiled slowly as nell let out a laughing gasp damn it ripley muttered and gulped down lemonade i hate that celebrants streamed to the island for the fourth red white and blue flags snapped from the rails of the ferries as they chugged to the mainland and back banners and bunting swagged the eaves of the storefronts on high street waving cheerfully as tourists and islanders alike jammed the streets and beaches for nell it was anything but a holiday but that didnt prevent her celebrational mood as she delivered orders she not only had a job she loved she had a business she could be proud of independence day she thought she was going to make it hers for the first time in nine months she began to plan for a future that included bank accounts mail delivery and personal possessions that couldnt be stuffed into a duffel or backpack at a moments notice a normal functioning life she thought as she paused by the display window of beach where the mannequin was wearing breezy summer slacks with bold blue and white stripes and a gauzy white top that scooped low at the breasts strappy white sandals as fun as they were impractical adorned its feet nell bit her lip her pay was burning a hole in the pocket of her ancient jeans that had always been her problem she reminded herself if she had ten dollars she could find a way to spend nine of it shed learned how to save and scrimp and resist how to make five dollars stretch like elastic but she hadnt had anything new anything pretty in so long and mia had been hinting not quite so gently of late that she should spruce up a bit on the job plus she had to make some sort of a showing of herself for the catering sideline if she was going to be a businesswoman she should dress the part on the island that meant casual still casual could mean attractive on the other hand it would be more practical more sensible to save the money and invest it in kitchen tools she needed a food processor more than she needed sandals are you going to listen to the good angel or the bad angel mia vaguely embarrassed at being caught daydreaming over a pair of shoes nell laughed you startled me great sandals on sale too they are mia tapped the glass just below the sale sign my favorite fourletter word i smell possibilities nell lets shop oh but i really shouldnt i dont need anything you really do need work mia tossed back her hair took nells elbow in a firm grip much like a mother with a stubborn child shopping for shoes has nothing to do with need and everything to do with lust do you know how many pair of shoes i own no neither do i she said as she strongarmed nell into the shop isnt that wonderful they have those slacks in a candycane pink theyd look fabulous on you size six yes but i really need to save for a good food processor despite herself she reached out to finger the material of the slacks that mia pulled off the rack theyre so soft try them with this a brief hunt turned up what mia considered the perfect top a clingy white halter dont forget to lose the bra youve got little feet six there too yes actually nell took a discreet peek at the price tags even with the sale it was more than shed spent on herself in months she was stuttering protests as mia shoved her behind a dressing room curtain trying doesnt mean buying she whispered to herself over and over as she stripped down to her practical cotton panties mia was right about the pink she thought as she slipped into the slacks the bright color was an instant mood lifter but the halter well that was another matter it felt decadent to wear something so closefitting without a bra and the back she turned to look over her shoulder there basically wasnt a back evan would never have allowed her to wear something so revealing and casually suggestive even as the thought popped into her mind nell cursed herself okay back up and erase she ordered herself how you doing in there fine mia its an adorable outfit but i dont think before she could finish mia whisked open the curtain and stood the sandals in one hand while she tapped her lip with the finger of her free hand perfect girlnextdoor sexy casual chic add the shoes i saw this little bag just the thing be right back it was like being marched through a campaign by a veteran general nell thought and she a mere foot soldier couldnt seem to do anything but follow orders twenty minutes later her habitual jeans tshirt and sneakers were tucked into a shopping bag what was left of her cash was stuffed into a palmsize purse that she wore crossbody and at the hip of her new slacks which flapped softly around her legs in the frisky breeze how do you feel guilty great unable to resist nell wiggled her toes in her new sandals thatll do now lets buy some earrings to go with it nell abandoned all resistance independence day she reminded herself she fell for the rose quartz drops the minute she saw them what is it about earrings that makes you feel so confident body adornments show that were aware of our bodies and expect others to be aware as well now lets take a walk on the beach and get some reaction nell fingered the pale pink stones swinging from her ears can i ask you a question go ahead ive been here a month now and in all that time i havent seen you with anyone a date i mean a male companion im not interested in anyone at the moment mia held the flat of her hand above her brow to skim the beach yes there was someone once but that was another phase of my life did you love him yes i did very much im sorry i shouldnt pry its no secret mia said lightly and the wounds long healed i like being on my own in control of my destiny and all the little daytoday decisions and choices coupling requires a certain amount of unselfishness im a selfish creature by nature thats not true generosity has levels mia began to walk lifting her face to the breeze and its not synonymous with altruism i do what suits me which stems from selfinterest i dont find that something to apologize for ive had personal acquaintance with the selfish you may do what suits you mia but youd never deliberately hurt anyone ive watched you with people they trust you because they know they can not causing harm is a responsibility that comes from what ive been given youre the same i dont see how that can be ive been powerless and because of it you have empathy for those in pain and those who despair nothing happens to us without purpose little sister what we do because of it what we do about it is the key to who and what we are nell looked out to sea to the boats gliding the jet skiers racing the swimmers gleefully riding the waves she could turn away she thought from what she was being told and what would be asked of her she could have a calm and normal life here or she could have more the night i stayed at your house the night of the solstice when i saw you on the cliffs i told myself i was dreaming mia didnt turn just continued to look calmly out over the ocean is that what you want to believe im not entirely sure i dreamed of this place even when i was a child i had dreams for a long time i ignored them or blocked them out when i saw the painting the cliffs the lighthouse your house i had to come here it was like finally being allowed to come home she looked back at mia i used to believe in fairy tales then i learned better the hard way and so mia thought had she no man had ever lifted his hand to her but there were other ways to bruise and scar life isnt a fairy tale and the gift carries a price a shudder raced up nells spine easier she thought to turn away safer to run away a boat out to sea let off a sky rocket the gleeful shriek of sound ended on a burst of light that showered little specks of gold as it shattered a delighted roar went up from the beach she heard a child call out in wonder you said you would teach me mia let out a breath she hadnt been aware she was holding so much rested on this and so i will they turned together to watch the next rocket soar are you going to stay to watch the fireworks nell asked her no i can see them from my cliffs and its less frantic besides i hate being a fifth wheel fifth wheel ladies zack strolled up it was one of the rare times he had his badge pinned to his shirt im going to have to ask you to move along two beautiful women standing on the beach creates a safety hazard isnt he cute mia reached up to cup his face and give him a noisy kiss when i was in third grade i planned to marry him and live in a sand castle you mightve clued me in on it you were sweet on hester burmingham no i just had lustful feelings for her shiny red schwinn the christmas i turned twelve i got one of my own from santa and hester ceased to exist in my little world men are bastards maybe but ive still got the bike and hesters got twin girls and a minivan happy ending all around hester still checks out your butt when youre walking away mia told him delighted when his mouth dropped open and on that note i take my leave enjoy the fireworks that woman always manages to get the last word zack muttered by the time a man untangles his tongue shes gone and speaking of getting a mans tongue tangled you look great thanks she held her arms out to the side i splurged in all the right places let me cart that for you he slipped the shopping bag out of her hand i need to take it home and see to some things i can walk in that direction for a bit i was hoping to see you around today i heard youve been busy delivering potato salad all over the island i mustve made twenty gallons of it and enough fried chicken to deplete the poultry population for the next three months dont suppose youve got any left her dimples winked i might its been hard to find time to eat traffic control beach patrol i had to sit on a couple of kids who thought itd be fun to toss firecrackers in trash cans and watch them blow up ive confiscated enough firecrackers roman candles and bottle rockets to start my own insurrection and all that on two hot dogs that doesnt seem fair no it doesnt i spotted a couple of your box lunches looked to me like there was apple pie in there you have good vision i could probably hunt up a few drumsticks scrape together a pint of potato salad i might even be able to manage a slab of apple pie and donate it to a hardworking public servant might even be tax deductible ive got to supervise the fireworks display he stopped at the end of the street we usually get it started right around nine he set her shopping bag down to run his hands up her bare arms things start thinning out around ninethirty ninefortyfive i lost the toss with ripley so ive got to take the last patrol cruise around the island to make sure nobodys set their house on fire maybe youd like to take a drive i might his fingers danced up and down her back do me a favor put your hands on my shoulders id like you to have a grip on me when i kiss you this time zack she took two careful breaths id like you to have a grip on me this time too he wrapped his arms around her she circled his neck for a moment they stood lips a breath apart while her system shivered with anticipation mouths brushed retreated brushed again it was she who moaned she who crushed her lips to his on a hot spurt of hunger she hadnt let herself want even when hed stirred those dormant needs to life shed been careful not to want until now she wanted the strength of him the press of that hard male body she wanted the ripe flavor of him and the heat the silky dance of tongues the teasing nip of teeth the edgy thrill of feeling a heart pound against her own she let out a little gasp of pleasure when he changed the angle of the kiss and dived in again she set off aches in him that throbbed like pulse beats quiet sounds of need hummed in her throat and burned in his blood her skin was like hot satin and the feel of it under his hands sent erotic images through his brain desires demands that belonged to the dark dimly he heard another rocket burst and the shouts of approval from the beach behind them he could have her inside her cottage in two minutes naked and under him in three nell breathless churning toward desperate he broke the kiss and she smiled at him her eyes were dark filled with trust and pleasure nell he said again and lowered his forehead to hers there were times when you took he knew and times when you waited ive got to make my rounds all right he picked up her bag handed it to her youll come back yes ill come back she was floating on air as she spun around and headed for her cottage chapter nine contents prev next power mia told nell carries with it responsibility a respect for tradition it must be tempered with compassion hopefully intelligence and an understanding of human flaws it is never to be used carelessly though there is room for humor above all it must never be used to harm how did you know you were how did you know what you were a witch mia sat back on her heels she was weeding her garden she was wearing a shapeless dress of grass green with deep pockets in the skirt thin floral gardening gloves and a widebrimmed straw hat at the moment she couldnt have looked less like the witch she professed to be you can say the word its not illegal were not the pointedhatwearing broomstickriding cacklers that much of fiction drew us to be were people housewives plumbers businesswomen how we live is a personal choice covens another personal choice ive never been much of a joiner myself and most who form groups or study the craft are just looking for a pastime or an answer theres nothing wrong with that calling yourself a witch and holding rituals is one thing being one is another how do you know the difference how do i answer you nell she leaned forward again neatly snipping off deadheads theres something inside you burning a song in your head a whisper in your ear you know these things as well as i do you just didnt recognize them the deadhead went along with her weeds into a basket when you peel an apple havent you ever thought if you could finish it without breaking the chain youd have a wish granted or gather good luck snapped a wishbone crossed your fingers little charms mia said sitting back again old traditions it cant be as simple as that as simple as a wish as complex as love as dangerous potentially as a lightning bolt power is risk its also joy she picked up one of the deadheads cupped it gently in her hands opening them again she offered nell a sunny yellow blossom delighted fascinated nell twirled it in her fingers if you can do this why do you let any of them die theres a cycle a natural order its to be respected change is necessary she rose picked up her basket of weeds and dead flowers and carried it to a composter without it thered be no progress no rebirth no anticipation one flower blooms off to make room for another a lot of the craft is philosophy would you like to try something more practical me yes a simple spell a stir of the air i think considering besides its a warm day and a breeze would be welcome you want me to nell made a circling motion with her finger stir the air its a matter of technique you need to focus feel the air moving over your face your body see it in your mind rippling turning you can hear it the music of it mia no put doubts aside and think of those possibilities focus its a simple goal its all around you you only have to stir it take it in your hands she said lifting her own and say the words air is breath and breath is air stir it round from here to there spin a breeze and spin it lightly as you will nell so mote it be say the words one times three mesmerized nell repeated them felt the faintest flutter across her cheek said them again and saw mias hair lift on the third count mias voice joined hers the wind spun around them a private carousel of air cool and fragrant with a happy little hum the same hum sounded inside her as nell turned circling round and round her short cap of hair dancing it feels wonderful you did it i gave it the last nudge mia laughed as her dress billowed out but you got it started very well done for your first time now quiet it again use your mind visualize it going still thats it good you picture things well ive always liked to draw moments in my head nell said breathless now you know images that appeal or that i want to remember its sort of like that wow im dizzy she sat straight down on the ground i felt a tingling inside not unpleasant almost like you do when youre thinking really thinking about sex magic is sexy mia dropped down beside her especially when you hold the power have you been doing a lot of thinking about sex i didnt give it a thought for eight months steadier now nell shook back her hair i wasnt sure id ever want to be with a man again since the fourth ive been doing a lot of thinking about sex the kind of thinking that makes you very itchy well ive been there why dont you do something about it scratch the itch i thought id assumed that after the fireworks last week zack and i would end up in bed but after we drove around and he finished his patrol he took me home kissed me good night at the door the kind of kiss that lifts the top of your head off and spins it around then he went home i dont suppose it occurred to you to drag him inside toss him on the floor and rip his clothes off the idea made nell chuckle i cant do things like that a minute ago you didnt think you could conjure a breeze either you have the power little sister zachariah todd is the kind of man whos willing to put that power in your hands to give you the choice of time and place if there was a man like that i was attracted to and who was attracted to me id do something about that power she felt the tingle again the stir inside her this time i wouldnt know how to begin visualize little sister mia said wickedly visualize zack couldnt think of a better way to spend a sunday morning than skinnydipping with the girl he loved the water was cool the sun warm and the inlet private enough to allow for such activities they discussed taking a sail later and the adoration in her beautiful brown eyes told him shed follow him anywhere he stroked her sent her into a wiggle of delight before they swam companionably through the crisp and quiet water when a man had a female so uncomplicatedly devoted zack figured he had it all then she gave a yip of excitement splashed a stream of water in his face and headed to shore zack watched his boon companion desert him for the woman standing on the rough bank lucy bounded onto the bank and straight into nell knocking her back two full steps and drenching her with seawater and doggie kisses zack listened to nells laughter watched her scrub her hands enthusiastically over lucys wet fur maybe a man who had a pretty dog didnt have quite everything he decided hey hows it going its going good shoulders she thought the man had amazing shoulders hows the water close to perfect come on in see for yourself thanks but i dont have a suit with me me either he flashed a grin which is why i didnt follow lucys example oh her gaze shot down then immediately back up to hover six inches over his head well ha visualize mia had told her but this didnt seem quite the appropriate time i promise not to look youre already wet all the same i think ill stay out here lucy dived back in retrieved a mangled rubber ball after scrabbling back to shore again she deposited it neatly at nells feet wants to play zack told her and so did he obliging nell picked up the ball and tossed it before it hit the surface lucy was leaping in pursuit pretty good arm weve got a softball game coming up in a couple of weeks if youre interested he drifted closer to the bank as he spoke nell scooped up the ball lucy retrieved heaved it again maybe i was thinking about trying out another recipe is that so the caterings turning into an actual enterprise if i want to expand on it i need to be able to offer a variety of dishes im a strong believer in capitalism so anything i can do to help she looked down he had such a nice face she thought she would just concentrate on that and wouldnt think about the rest of him right now i appreciate that sheriff ive been playing it by ear so far but i think its time to put together an actual list with pricing and services if i do all that formalize it i have to apply for a business license that wouldnt be a problem she assured herself she was clear its going to keep you busy i like being busy theres nothing worse than not being able to do anything with your time or your interests she shook her head and dont i sound dull and boring no but she had sounded grim how do you feel about recreation i approve of recreation her eyebrows lifted as he hooked a hand lightly around her ankle and just what is that i call it the long arm of the law youre too nice to pull me in after ive come over here to offer to feed you no im not he gave her foot a playful little tug but im willing to give you a chance to strip first thats considerate of you my mother raised me right come on in and play nell he glanced back at lucy who was busy paddling around with the ball in her mouth weve got a chaperone why not she thought she wanted to be with him even more she wanted to be the kind of woman who could be with him a woman confident and open enough to do something fun and foolish like tossing off her clothes and diving in the grin she sent him was quick and careless as she toed off her shoes he treaded water i changed my mind im going to watch he warned her id tell you i wouldnt peek but id be lying do you lie not if i can help it his gaze lowered as she gripped the hem of her tshirt so im not going to tell you ill keep my hands off you once you get in here i want you wet and naked nell i just plain want you if i wanted you to keep your hands off me i wouldnt be here she took a deep breath started to peel off her shirt sheriff todd sheriff todd there is no god zack grumbled as the lovely glimpse of creamy flesh vanished under nells hastily tuggeddown shirt out here he called is that you ricky to nell he said itll only take me two three minutes to drown him just stand by yes sir sheriff a towheaded boy of about ten scrambled across the rocky slope his freckled face pink with excitement he gave nell a hasty nod maam sheriff my mom said i was to come right over and tell you the tenants in the abbott rental are having a big fight theres screaming and crashing and cursing and everything is that dale abbotts or busters place busters sheriff the one right across from ours mom says it sounds like the man in theres beating the woman something fierce im on my way go on back go straight home and in the house yes sir nell stayed where she was she saw a blur of tanned muscled body as zack levered himself out of the water sorry nell no you need to go you need to help her it felt as though there were a thin glaze over her brain as she watched him hitch on jeans hurry ill be back as soon as i can he left her there hated leaving her there with her hands gripping each other tightly and bolted up the steps to get a shirt he was at the abbott rental in under four minutes a handful of people edged the street while the sounds of shouting and breaking glasses poured out of the house a man zack didnt recognize jogged up to him as he approached the deck stairs youre the sheriff im bob delano renting the place next door i tried seeing what i could do but the doorsre locked i thought about breaking one in but they said you were on the way ill take care of it mr delano maybe you could keep those people back sure ive seen that guy sheriff big sonofabitch you want to watch yourself i appreciate it get on back now zack pounded a fist on the door though hed have preferred to have ripley with him he hadnt risked waiting for her to answer his beeper call this is sheriff todd i want you to open the door and open it now something shattered inside and a woman began to wail if this door isnt open in five seconds im kicking it in the man came to the door delano was right he was one big sonofabitch sixfour maybe and a good two seventyfive he looked hungover and mad as piss what the hell do you want i want you to step back sir and keep your hands where i can see them you got no right coming in here im renting this place paid in full your rental agreement doesnt give you leave to destroy property now back up youre not coming in here without a warrant bet zack said softly his hand shot out lightningquick gripped the mans wrist and twisted now you want to take a swing at me he continued in the same mild tone well add resisting arrest and assaulting an officer to the mix more paperwork but i get paid for it by the time my lawyers done im going to own this fucking island youre welcome to call him from down at the station house zack cuffed him and looked around with relief as he heard ripley pounding up the stairs sorry i was all the way over on broken shell whats this domestic dispute and then some this is my deputy zack informed his prisoner take my word she can clean your clock put him in the back of the cruiser ripley get his particulars read him his rights whats your name sir fuck you okay mr fuck you youre under arrest for she glanced back at zack who was already moving through the broken glass and crockery to the woman sitting on the floor holding her face in her hands and sobbing destruction of private property disturbing the peace assault you got that now unless you want me to kick your ass in front of all these nice people well just walk to the cruiser and take a little drive you have the right to remain silent she continued giving him a helpful shove to get him going maam she was late thirties zack estimated probably pretty when her lip wasnt split and her brown eyes werent blackened i need you to come with me ill take you to a doctor i dont need a doctor she curled into herself zack noted shallow cuts on her arms gifts from flying glass whats going to happen to joe well talk about that can you tell me your name diane diane mccoy let me help you up ms mccoy diane mccoy sat hunched in a chair with an ice bag held to her left eye she continued to refuse medical assistance after offering her a cup of coffee zack pulled his own chair from behind his desk hoping the move would put her more at ease ms mccoy i want to help you im okay well pay for the damages you just have the rental agency make up a list and well pay for it thats something well need to see to i want you to tell me what happened we just had a fight thats all people do you didnt need to lock joe up if theres a fine well pay it ms mccoy youre sitting there with your lip bleeding your eye black and cuts and bruises all over your arms your husband assaulted you it wasnt like that what was it like i asked for it even as ripley let out a vicious stream of air across the room zack leveled a warning glance you asked him to hit you ms mccoy to knock you down to bloody your lip i aggravated him hes under a lot of pressure the words tumbled out slurred a bit from her swollen lip this is supposed to be a vacation and i shouldntve nagged at him that way she must have sensed ripleys furious disapproval as she turned her head stared defiantly joe works hard fifty weeks a year the least i can do is leave him alone on his vacation it seems to me ripley countered the least he could do is keep from punching you in the face on your vacation ripley get ms mccoy a glass of water and shut up he didnt have to say the last with his mouth when his expression said it so clearly what started the trouble ms mccoy i guess i got up on the wrong side of the bed joe was up late drinking a mans entitled to sit in front of the tv with a few beers on his vacation he left the place a mess beer cans spilled chips all over the rug it irritated me and i started on him the minute he was awake if id shut up when he told me to none of this wouldve happened and not shutting up when you were told gave him the right to use his fists on you ms mccoy she powered up what happens between a husband and wife is nobodys business but theirs we shouldnt have broken things and well pay for them ill clean the place up myself ms mccoy they have counseling programs back in newark zack began and shelters for women who need them i can make some calls get you some information her eyes might have been swollen but they could still flash fury i dont need any information you cant keep joe locked up if i dont press charges and i wont youre wrong there i can keep him locked up for disturbing the peace and the property owners can press charges youll just make it worse tears began to fall she took the paper cup ripley offered her and gulped at the water dont you see youll just make it worse hes a good man joes a good man hes just got a short fuse is all i said wed pay ill write you a check we dont want any trouble im the one who made him mad i threw things at him too youre going to have to lock me up along with him whats the point what was the point zack thought later he hadnt been able to reach her and he wasnt egotistical enough to think he was the first to try he couldnt help when help was rejected the mccoys were caught in a cycle that was bound to end badly and all he could do was remove the cycle from his island it took half the day to straighten out the mess a check for two thousand satisfied the rental company a cleaning crew was already in place by the time the mccoys had packed up zack waited saying nothing as joe mccoy loaded suitcases and coolers into the back of a latemodel grand cherokee the couple got in from opposite sides diane wore big sunglasses to hide the damage they both ignored zack as he got into the cruiser and followed them to the ferry he stayed there watching until the jeep and the people inside it were no more than a dot on their way to the mainland he hadnt expected that nell would have waited for him and decided it was just as well he was too depressed and far too angry to talk to her instead he sat in the kitchen with lucy nursed a beer he was considering indulging in a second when ripley came in i dont get it i just dont get women like that the guys got a hundred fifty pounds on her but its her fault he bashed her face and she believed it she got out a beer for herself jerking the bottle at him as she twisted off the cap maybe she needs to oh like hell zack like hell still simmering she dropped into the chair across from him shes healthy shes got a brain what does she gain hooking herself to a guy who uses her for a punching bag when the mood strikes him if shed pressed charges we couldve held him long enough for her to pack her bags and get gone we shouldve held him anyway she wouldnt have left it wouldnt have made one damn bit of difference okay youre right i know it it just burns me thats all she sipped her beer watching him youre thinking about nell you figure it was like that for her i dont know what it was like for her she doesnt talk about it have you asked if she wanted to tell me she would well dont snap my head off ripley propped her feet on the chair beside her im asking you because i know you big brother if youve got a thing for her and the thing turns into a big thing youre never going to be square with it unless you have the story without the story you cant help and when you cant help it drives you nuts youre brooding right now because you couldnt help to your satisfaction a woman youd never seen before and wont see again its that good samaritan gene of yours isnt there someone else on the island you can go annoy no because i love you best now instead of having another beer why dont you take luce and go for a sail still plenty of daylight yet and itll clear your head and improve your disposition youre just no fun to be around when youre broody maybe i will good go odds of a second crisis in one day are slim to none but ill take a cruise around just in case okay he got up and after a moments hesitation leaned down and kissed the top of her head i love you best too dont i know it she waited until he got to the door you know zack whatever nells story is theres one key difference between her and diane mccoy nell got gone chapter ten contents prev next on monday the incident at the abbott rental was the talk of the village everyone had had time to form an opinion particularly those who hadnt witnessed the event buster said theyd busted up every blessed knickknack in the place ill have some of that lobster salad nell honey dorcas burmingham said then went straight back to gossiping with her companion she and biddy devlin mias third cousin once removed and the proprietor of surfside treasures had a standing lunch date at the café every monday at twelvethirty i heard sheriff todd had to forcibly remove the man from the premises biddy expounded at gunpoint oh biddy no such thing i talked to gladys macey who had it straight from anne potter who sent for the sheriff in the first place that zack had his gun holstered right along can i have an iced mocha with that salad nell domestic disputes are one of the most dangerous calls for a policeman biddy informed her i read that somewhere my that soup smells divine nell i dont believe ive ever had gazpacho before but im going to have to try a cup and one of your brownies ill bring your lunch out to you nell offered if youd like to get a table oh thats all right well wait for it dorcas waved the offer away youve got enough to do anyway i heard that even though that brute bloodied that poor womans lip and blackened her eye she stuck by him wouldnt press charges its a crying shame is what it is odds are her father beat on her mother so she grew up seeing such things and thinking thats just what happens its a cycle thats what the statistics say abuse spawns abuse ill wager you if that woman had grown up in a loving home she wouldnt be living with a man who treated her that way ladies thatll be thirteen eightyfive nells head throbbed like a bad tooth and her nerve endings stretched thin as hair strands while the two women went through their weekly routine of whose turn it was to pay it was always playful and usually it amused nell but now she wanted them gone she wanted to hear no more about diane mccoy what did they know about it she thought bitterly these two comfortable women with their comfortable lives what did they know about fear and helplessness it wasnt always a cycle she wanted to scream it it wasnt always a pattern shed had a loving home with parents whod been devoted to each other and to her there had been arguments irritation annoyances while voices may have been raised fists never had she had never been struck in her life before evan remington she wasnt a goddamn statistic by the time the women headed off to a table thin sharpedged bands of steel had locked themselves around nells temples she turned blindly to the next customer and found ripley studying her you look a little shaky nell just a headache what can i get you today why dont you get yourself an aspirin ill wait no its fine the fruitandcabbage salads good its a scandinavian recipe ive had positive feedback on it okay im game ill take an iced tea with it those two she added nodding toward biddy and dorcas they chatter like a couple of parrots itd give anybody a headache i guess everybodys been yakking about the trouble yesterday well she wanted a dark room an hours quiet big news zack did everything he could to help that woman she didnt want to be helped not everyone does not everyone knows what to do with an offer of help or who they can trust to give it zack can be trusted ripley laid her money on the counter maybe he plays it low key thats his way but when push comes to shove he stands up you ought to do something for that headache nell she added and took her lunch to a table she didnt have time to do more about it than swallow a couple of aspirin peg was late rushing in full of apologies and with a sparkle in her eye that told nell a man had been responsible for her tardiness as nell had an appointment with gladys macey to please god finalize the menu for the anniversary party she had to rush home gather her notes and files the headache had escalated to nightmare territory by the time she knocked on gladyss door nell ive told you you dont have to knock you just call out and walk in gladys said and pulled her inside im just so excited about this i watched this program on the home and garden channel just the other day got me all sorts of ideas to talk over with you i think we ought to string those little white lights through my trees and put those luminaries with little hearts on the bags along the walk and the patio what do you think mrs macey i think you should have whatever you want im really just the caterer now honey i think of you as my party coordinator lets sit down in the living room the room was spotlessly clean as if dust was a sin against nature every stick of furniture matched with the pattern in the sofa picked up in the valance of the window treatments and the narrow border of wallpaper that ran just under the ceiling there were two identical lamps two identical chairs two identical end tables the rug matched the curtains the curtains matched the throw pillows all the wood was honey maple including the cabinet of the bigscreen tv which was currently running a hollywood gossip program ive got a weakness for that kind of show all those famous people i love seeing what clothes theyre wearing you just sit down gladys ordered make yourself comfortable im going to get us a nice cold coke then well roll up our sleeves and dive right in as she had the first time shed toured gladyss house for preparty plans nell found herself bemused every room was tidy as a church pew and as rigidly organized as a furniture showroom floor magazines were fanned precisely on the coffee table and offset by an arrangement of silk flowers in the exact tones of mauve and blues as the upholstery the fact that the house managed to be friendly said more to nells mind about the occupants than the decor nell sat opened her files she knew gladys would bring the tea in pale green glasses that matched her everyday dishes and would set them on blue coasters there was she thought a comfort in knowing that she began to read over her notes then felt her stomach hitch at the chirpy voice of the program host last nights gala brought out the glitter and the glamour evan remington power broker extraordinaire and attorney to the stars looked as sensational as one of his own clients in hugo boss though remington denies rumors of a romance between him and his companion for the evening the delectable natalie winston who simmered in a beaded sheath by valentino sources in the know say differently remington was widowed only last september when his wife helen apparently lost control of her car while driving back to their home in monterey her mercedes sedan crashed over the cliffs on highway her body sadly was never recovered hollywood beat is happy to see evan remington back in stride after this tragic event nell was on her feet her breath short and shallow evans face seemed to fill the wide screen every handsome line every strand of golden hair she could hear his voice clear and terrifyingly calm do you think i cant see you helen do you think ill let you go i didnt mean to take so long but i thought you might appreciate someone elses baking for a change i just made this pound cake yesterday carl packed away nearly half of it i cant think where that man puts it why if i ate a fraction of what he tray in hand gladys stopped her happy chatter shifting instantly to surprised concern when she saw nells face honey youre so pale whats wrong im sorry im sorry im not feeling well panic was an icy poker jabbing through her belly headache i dont think i can do this now of course not poor thing dont you worry im going to drive you home and tuck you right into bed no no id rather walk fresh air im so sorry mrs macey nell fumbled with her files almost sobbing when they slipped through her trembling fingers ill call you reschedule i dont want you to think a thing of it nell sweetheart youre shaking i just need to go home with a last terrified glance at the television screen she bolted for the door she forced herself not to run when you ran people noticed you and they wondered they asked questions fitting in that was essential blending doing nothing to draw attention but even as she ordered herself to breathe slow and steady the air wheezed in her lungs clogged there until she was gulping for it do you think ill let you go sweat ran cold and clammy on her skin and she smelled her own fear the edges of her vision blurred as she shot a single wild look over her shoulder the minute she was through the door of her cottage the nausea hit a bright bite of pain she stumbled to the bathroom was hideously ill when she was empty she lay on the narrow floor and waited for the shaking to pass when she could stand again she peeled off her clothes leaving them in a heap as she stepped into the shower she ran the hot water as hot as she could bear imagining the spray penetrating her skin until it warmed her icy bones wrapped in a towel she crawled into bed pulled the covers over her head and let herself slide into oblivion diego climbed agilely up the bedskirt stretched out alongside her and lay still and silent as a sentry she wasnt sure how long she slept but she woke as if from a long illness that had left her body heavy and tender and her stomach raw she was tempted simply to roll back into sleep and stay there but that would solve nothing it was doing that got her through and always had she sat on the edge of the bed like an old woman testing bone and balance the image of evans face could float back into her mind if she let it so she closed her eyes let it form that too was a kind of test she could look at him would look at him remember what had been and what had changed to deal she reminded herself with what had happened for comfort she gathered the kitten into her lap and rocked she had run again after almost a year the sight of him on a television screen had terrorized her to the point of blind flight had made her ill and stripped away every bit of the hardwon armor shed built until shed been a quivering quaking mass of panic because she had allowed it she let him have that hold on her no one could change that but herself shed found the courage to run nell told herself now she had to find the courage to stand until she could think of him until she could say his name without fear she wasnt free she held the picture of him in her mind imagined it breaking apart her will a hammer against glass evan remington she whispered you cant touch me now you cant hurt me youre over and im just beginning the effort exhausted her but she set diego on the floor then pushed herself to her feet dragged on a sweatshirt and shorts she would go back to work design and evaluate her menu it was time to figure out how to set up an office of sorts in the little bedroom if gladys macey wanted a party coordinator thats just what she was going to get she had dropped the file when she bolted into the cottage and now she gathered up all the scattered notes magazine clippings and carefully written menu selections and carried them into the kitchen she was mildly surprised to see that the sun still shone it felt as if shed slept for hours the clock on the stove told her it was barely six time enough to reevaluate the macey job proposal to create a comprehensive list of menu and service selections for what she was going to call sisters catering she would take mia up on the offer of the store computer and design a look for her handouts her business cards she had to calculate a budget set up books no one was going to take her seriously unless she took herself seriously first but when she put her files down and looked around she wondered why the prospect of putting on water for coffee seemed so far out of her scope the knock on the front door had her spinning around her first thought when she saw zack through the screen was not now not yet she hadnt had time to gather herself back to what she needed to be but he was already opening the door already studying her across the short distance from the front of the cottage to the back are you all right nell yes you dont look all right she could imagine how she looked i wasnt feeling well earlier selfconscious she scooped a hand through her hair i had a headache and so i took a nap im fine now holloweyed and pale and far from fine was zacks judgment he couldnt back off and leave her alone any more than he could have left a stray pup on the side of the road diego gave him an opening pouncing out of a corner to attack his shoes zack picked up the kitten ruffling his fur as he walked to nell you take anything yes eat anything no i dont need a nurse zack it was just a headache just a headache didnt send a woman bolting out of someones house as if the devil were on her heels which was exactly how gladys had described it you look pretty rough honey so im going to fix you the traditional todd family restorer i appreciate it but i was going to work for a while go ahead he handed her the kitten moved past her to the refrigerator im not much in the kitchen but i can manage this just like my mother did when one of us wasnt feeling right got any jelly it was right in front of his face she thought crossly what was it about men that struck them blind the minute they opened a refrigerator door second shelf i dont oh yeah we always used grape but strawberry should work go ahead and work dont mind me nell set diego by his dish of food what are you fixing scrambled eggs and rolledover jelly sandwiches rolledover jelly sandwiches too tired to argue she sat sounds perfect mrs macey called you didnt she no i did run into her though she mentioned you were upset about something i wasnt upset i had a headache the skillets in the bottom cabinet left ill find what i need place isnt big enough to hide much do you make scrambled eggs and rolledover jelly sandwiches for everyone on the island when they have a headache that would depend im making it for you because you tug at me nell have since i first met you and when i walk in here and see you looking like something thats been flattened by a passing steamroller it troubles me she said nothing when he cracked eggs dumped in milk and too much salt he was a good man she believed a kind and decent one and she had no right tugging at him zack im not going to be able to give you what you want what youre looking for i know yesterday i indicated i could that i would i shouldnt have how do you know what im looking for what i want he stirred the eggs in the bowl and whatever it is its my problem isnt it it isnt fair for me to give you the impression there can be anything between us im a big boy he put enough butter in the skillet to make her wince i dont expect everything to be fair and the fact is theres already something between us you pretending otherwise doesnt change it he turned around as the butter melted the fact that we havent slept together doesnt change it either we would have yesterday if i hadnt gotten that call it wouldve been a mistake if life wasnt full of mistakes itd be a mighty tedious process if all i wanted was a roll in the sheets idve gotten you there youre probably right thats my point right about the mistakes or the sex he asked and began slathering jelly on bread she decided that even if she had the answer it wouldnt matter kind decent he was and also stubborn as a mule ill make coffee dont do coffee with this calls for tea and ill make it he filled the kettle set it on the stove poured the eggs into the heated skillet in a sizzling rush now youre angry i walked in half angry and one look at you took care of part two funny thing though i can be pissed off at a woman and hold myself back from knocking her around thats the kind of amazing selfcontrol i have nell drew a calming breath folded her hands on the table im well aware that not every man deals with temper with physical violence thats the kind of amazing intelligence i have good for us he rooted around until he found teabags an herbal blend he felt more suited to fancy china cups than the solid stoneware mugs she had available he scooped eggs onto plates found forks and tore off paper towels in lieu of napkins hed said he wasnt much in the kitchen nell thought as he set a plate in front of her and went back to dunk the teabags in the mugs but even here he had an appeal he never wasted a move she noted and wondered if it came from grace or practicality either way it worked he sat across from her let diego climb adventurously up the leg of his jeans and knead his thigh eat she forked up a bite sampled theyre better than they should be considering you used a pound of salt per egg i like salt dont feed the cat at the table she sighed ate it was so blessedly normal sitting like this eating oversalted eggs and strawberry jelly squished in a piece of folded bread im not the mess i used to be she said but i still have moments until i dont im not prepared to complicate my life or anyone elses thats sensible im going to concentrate on my work a persons got to have priorities there are things i want to do things i need to learn for myself uhhuh he polished off his eggs sat back with his tea ripley said youre scouting for a computer the rental agencys looking to upgrade a couple of theirs you could probably get a fair deal you might want to stop by ask for marge she manages the place thanks ill check it out tomorrow why arent you mad anymore who said im not i know how to read mad he studied her face she had some color back now but she looked exhausted i bet you do not much point in it he took his plate to the sink rinsed it off i might brood some later ive got a real knack for that according to my sister i used to be a champion sulker satisfied that they were back on an even keel she picked up her plate i might see if i can get back into that you were right about the traditional todd meal it did the trick never misses still grape jellys better for it ill stock some just in case good im going to let you get back to work in a minute he yanked her against him jerked her up to her toes covered her mouth with his in a hot possessive kiss the blood seemed to rush to her head then poured out of it again leaving her dizzy weak and achy one strangled moan escaped before she was back on the flat of her feet and gripping the edge of the counter for balance nothing sensible about that zack said but its real youre going to have to shuffle it into your list of priorities dont work too late he strolled out letting the screened door slap comfortably shut behind him in her dream that night there was a circle a thin line upon the earth as silver as starlight within that sphere there were three women robed in white their voices flowed like music though the words were strange to her as they sang spears of light sprang up from the circle shimmering bars of silver against the black curtain of night she saw a cup a knife with a carved handle and sprigs of herbs as green as summer from the cup they drank one by one and she tasted wine sweet and light on her tongue the darkhaired one drew symbols on the ground with the blade of the knife and she smelled earth fresh and dark as they circled chanted a pure gold flame spurted in the center the heat of it warmed her skin then they rose up above the gold of the fire above the cool silver of the spears of light as if they danced on the air and she knew the freedom and the joy as the wind kissed her cheeks chapter eleven contents prev next closed in mias office nell sweated over facts figures reality and possibilities she liked the possibilities best as they included a secondhand computer with all the capabilities she required an attractive sales kit professional business cards a cozy yet functional home office and a commercialgrade food processor the fact was she needed all of these things and several more in order to create a viable reasonably profitable business her figures proved she could make this her reality if she settled for a reality without any frills which included food drink and clothing for approximately twelve months as she saw it her choices were to live like a mole for about a year or to do without the professional tools that would help her build her business living like a mole wasnt so bad she mused shed done essentially that for months before shed come to the island if she hadnt weakened and frittered away money on wind chimes and sandals and earrings she wouldnt have remembered how much fun it was to fritter away money in the first place now it had to stop by her calculations she could provided marge at island realty was patient enough scrape up the money for the computer within three weeks she would need several hundred more of course for the printer the phone line the business license the office supplies once she was set up she could design and generate the sales kits and menus right on the desktop with a sigh she sat back combed her hands through her hair shed left out the uniform she could hardly cater the macey affair in jeans and a tshirt or a sexy little halter she needed good black slacks a crisp white shirt sensible but classy black shoes she looked up when mia walked in hi ill get out of your way no need mia waved her back i just need to check something in the september catalog she plucked it off a shelf flipped through while watching nell over the pages financial worries why do you ask vibes theyre not worries so much as obstacles of varying heights i hate admitting im taking on too much too fast and why is that not hating it but why do you say youre taking on too much mia asked as she sat stretched out like a cat on a hearth rug a few side jobs some boxed lunches one major party and here i am designing logos and business cards trying to squeeze out money for a computer when i can easily keep things organized in a spiral notebook i need to rein myself in theres little thats more boring than reining in mia stated when i started this place most people didnt think i could make it fly a small community a seasonal tourist trade bookstores and fancy coffee were for cities and snazzy suburbs they were wrong i knew what i wanted and what i was capable of achieving so do you in another six months or a year nell agreed but im getting ahead of myself why wait you need capital but you cant risk going to the bank for a business loan so many pesky questions about credit history employment history and so on mia inclined her head when nell sighed she enjoyed hitting the center of the target with the first arrow as careful as youve been you may have left a hole mia continued and youre too smart to take chances there i thought about it nell admitted if i opened myself up that way id never relax nell channing doesnt have a credit history and itll take me time to establish one which is one of the obstacles to that capital there are spells of course but i dislike doing spells for financial gain it seems so crass it doesnt seem so crass when im trying to stretch my budget to buy basic office equipment pursing her lips mia tapped the tips of her fingers together i had an acquaintance who was in a bit of a financial squeeze she worked a spell asking that her current money worries be cleared and won fifty thousand in the lottery the next week really really she was able to pay her debts and treat herself to a week at the doral spa in miami fabulous place by the way when she returned her car broke down her roof sprang a leak her basement flooded and she received an audit notice from the irs in the end shed done nothing more than trade one set of worries for another though she did get that week at the spa which cant be discounted nell acknowledged the humor in mias words with a small grin i hear you magic isnt a crutch to be used for convenience youre a quick study little sister so lets talk business mia toed off her pretty heels curled up her legs im in the market for an investment mia i cant tell you how much i appreciate that but you want to do it yourself and blah blah blah with a flick of the wrist mia swatted nells protest aside please lets behave like grownups are you trying to irritate or intimidate me into accepting a loan i dont generally try to irritate or intimidate though ive been told im good at both and i didnt say anything about a loan were discussing an investment she uncurled lazily and got a bottle of water for each of them out of her minifridge i would consider a loan i suppose for your startup costs say ten thousand payable over a period of sixty months at twelve percent interest i dont need ten thousand nell said giving the bottle cap an annoyed twist and twelve percent is ridiculous a bank would charge less but im not a bank and i wouldnt ask those pesky questions mias lips curved red and shapely over the mouth of the bottle but i prefer an investment im a businesswoman who likes profit you have a skill a marketable one which has already proven itself of interest on the island with working capital you can establish a viable business which i feel will enhance rather than compete with my own ive some ideas on that actually but we can get into that later i make a ten k investment become your silent partner for a reasonable compensation of say eight percent of gross profits i dont need ten it had been a very long time nell thought as she tapped her fingers on the desk since shed negotiated fees contracts amazing how quickly it came back ten thousand would be welcome and would eliminate the sweat and worry but if you avoided the sweat and worry she thought you eliminated the glow of satisfaction that came when you succeeded five will do she decided for six percent of net five then for seven net done excellent ill have my lawyer draw up a contract ill open an account for the business at the bank would it be less sticky if i took care of that and the license application ill do it i have to take a stand sometime little sister you took one months ago but i leave it to you nell she said as she opened the door were going to kick ass she worked like a demon preparing planning implementing her kitchen was a hotbed of experimentation rejections and successes her little office was the scene of hours of lateevening sessions where on her secondhand computer and printer she became her own desktop publisher producing menus flyers business cards invoices and stationery all with the inscription sisters catering and the logo shed designed of three women standing in a circle hands clasped and every one listed nell channing as proprietor and carried her new phone number when she finished putting her first sales kit together she took it along with the best bottle of champagne she could afford and drove to mias to leave them on her doorstep they were in business on the day of the macey party nell stood in gladyss kitchen and surveyed the scene shed been working onsite since four and had thirty minutes before the guests were due to arrive for the first time since nell had begun the setup for the party she finally had a moments peace and quiet if gladys made it through the evening without fainting from excitement and anxiety it would be a miracle every inch of the kitchen was organized to nells specifications in precisely ten minutes she would begin setting out the appetizers as the guest list had expanded to more than a hundred she had used all her powers of persuasion to convince gladys to forgo the formal sitdown meal in favor of fun interesting food stations set up at strategic points throughout the house and on the patio shed seen to the floral arrangements herself and had personally helped carl deal with the fairy lights and luminaries there were candles in rented silver holders and paper napkins that at nells suggestion carried a heart with the happy couples initials inside it still touched her the way gladyss eyes had filled when shed seen them satisfied the kitchen was ready for the battle to come she went out to check on the rest of the field and her troops shed hired peg to help serve and betsy from the magick inn to tend the bar she herself would fill in in both areas whenever she could leave the kitchen unattended it looks great she announced and moved to the patio doors the evening promised to be clear both she and gladys had suffered untold agonies over the possibility of rain nell tugged down the black vest shed added to her uniform selection one more time peg you circulate trying to make a complete circuit every fifteen minutes when your trays empty or nearly so you head back to the kitchen if im not there to refill youll arrange the next selection the way i showed you i practiced it a zillion times i know nell gave her an encouraging pat on the arm betsy ill try to keep up with the empties and discards if i run behind or youre running low on anything just give me a sign check and everything looks great so far so good and she was determined it would only get better carl juniors in charge of the music so im not going to worry about it lets get this show on the road peg vegetable crudites station one it was more than just a party to nell it was a new beginning as she lit the last of the candles she thought of her mother and the first official catering job theyd worked together ive made a circle mom she murmured and im going to make it shine touching the flame to wick with her mother in her mind nell made that vow she glanced over and beamed as gladys macey came out of the master bedroom you look beautiful nervous as a bride she fluffed at her hair i went into boston for this getup not too fussy is it the cocktail suit was a pale mint green with a sparkle of beads glittering on the lapels and cuffs its gorgeous and so are you and theres nothing for you to be nervous about all you have to do is enjoy yourself are you sure theres going to be enough cocktail shrimp im sure i just dont know what people are going to think of that chicken in peanut sauce theyll love it what about gladys stop haranguing the girl scowling dragging at the knot of his tie carl stepped out let her do her job mr macey you make a picture unable to resist nell reached over and straightened his tie herself made me buy a new suit and you look very handsome in it nell assured him done nothing but complain about it since he got home from work well used to their squabbling by now nell smiled personally i like a man whos not too comfortable in suits and ties its very sexy at nells statement carls face went bright pink dont know why we couldnt have had a barbecue and a couple of kegs before gladys could snap back at him nell lifted a tray of appetizers i think youre going to have a wonderful time starting right now manners forced carl to take one of the fancy salmon bites the minute it hit his tongue he pursed his lips got a nice flavor to it he admitted guess itd go down nice with a beer you step right into the living room and betsy will fix you up i think i hear the first guests arriving oh my oh my goodness patting her hair again gladys shot quick looks everywhere i meant to see if everything was as it should be before everythings exactly as it should be you greet your guests leave the rest to me it took less than fifteen minutes for the initial party stiffness to unbend music began to pump conversation began to roll and as nell made her circuit with the chicken kabobs she saw that shed been right people loved them it was fun to see the familiar island residents in their festive best knotted into conversational groups or wandering out to the patio she kept her ears open for comments about the food and the atmosphere and felt a quick tingle with each positive remark but best of all was seeing her client glow like a candle within an hour the house was jammed and she was working at top speed theyre going through these trays like starving hordes peg told her as she scrambled into the kitchen youd think every one of them fasted a week before tonight itll slow down after the dancing starts moving quickly nell refilled the tray station hell i can never remember the numbers the meatballs are about half gone you said i should tell you ill take care of it is anything not going over not that ive seen peg hefted the tray the way its moving id say this crowd would eat the paper napkins if you put sauce on them amused nell took out the miniature egg rolls she had warming in the oven as she arranged them on a tray ripley strolled in some party its great isnt it yeah swank you look pretty swank yourself nell commented ripley looked down at her basic black dress it was short satisfactorily clingy and had the advantage of being able to go to a party or with a blazer double as meeting attire i got this number in black and in white figure that covers the bases as far as dresses go she glanced around saw absolute order heard the hum of the dishwasher smelled the scent of spice how do you keep everything organized in here im brilliant seems like ripley plucked up one of the egg rolls popped it into her mouth foods fabulous she said with her mouth full i never told you but that picnic deal you fixed for me was really great oh yeah how did that work out just dandy thanks ripley replied her smug smile transformed into a scowl when mia stepped in i wanted to extend my compliments she spotted the egg rolls ah a new offering she took one bit in lovely hello ripley i barely recognized you in your girl attire how did you decide whether to wear the black or the white this evening up yours dont start i havent time to referee dont worry ripley snagged one more egg roll i cant waste the energy on hecate here gladyss nephew from cambridge just arrived and is looking just fine im going to go hit on him its so comforting to know some things never change dont touch anything nell ordered then hurried out with the tray so because she preferred being away from the crowd of people but still wanted to eat ripley eased up the lid on a covered tray nell seems okay why wouldnt she dont play dumb mia it doesnt suit that cat face of yours ripley helped herself to a couple of frosted heartshaped cookies i dont need a scrying mirror to see shes had a rough time a woman like her doesnt pop up on the island with nothing to her name but a backpack and a secondhand buick unless shes on the run zack figures some guy knocked her around when mia said nothing ripley leaned back on the counter nibbled look i like her and my brothers gone over her im not looking to hassle her but maybe to help if she needs it with or without your badge either or both it seems to me shes putting down stakes here not just working for you but starting this catering deal shes starting a life on three sisters that makes her one of mine give me one of those mia held out her hand waited until ripley gave her a cookie what are you asking me ripley if zacks right and if he is if someones going to come after her whatever nells told me in confidence has to be respected loyalty ripley was forced to admit was never a question with mia it was more a religion im not asking you to break a confidence mia nipped into the cookie you just cant say it can you oh kiss ass ripley slapped the lid back on the tray started to storm out but there was something about the way nell had been flushed and happy as she worked in the miraculously ordered kitchen that pulled at her she spun back tell me what youve seen i want to help her yes i know mia finished the cookie dusted the crumbs from her fingers theres a man he hunts and he haunts her hes the physical reality of her every fear doubt worry if he comes here if he finds her shell need both of us and shell need the courage to take her own power and use it whats his name i cant tell you that it wasnt shown to me but you know it what she gave to me i cant pass on to you i cant break her trust the worry in mias eyes crawled into ripleys belly if i could and did his name would make no difference this is her path ripley we can guide and support instruct and assist but in the end itll be her choice you know the legend as well as i im not getting into that ripley pushed the subject away with a sharp gesture im talking about someones safety a friends safety so am i but im also talking about a friends destiny if you really want to help her you could start by taking responsibility for your own with that mia walked out responsibility my butt ripley was annoyed enough to pry up the lid for one more cookie she knew what her responsibilities were she was obliged to see to the safety of the residents and visitors of three sisters island to keep order and uphold the law beyond that her responsibilities were nobodys business but hers and it wasnt responsible to go around practicing mumbo jumbo and clinging to some stupid legend that was as much nonsense now as it had been three centuries before she was the island deputy not part of some mystic trio of saviors and she wasnt destined to mete out some nebulous psychic justice now shed lost her appetite and her desire to hit on gladys maceys nephew served her right for wasting time with mia devlin disgusted she stalked out of the kitchen the first thing she saw as she moved back toward the party was zack he was in the middle of things where he always seemed to be when it came to people they were drawn to him but even as he stood in the middle of a group who chattered at him she could see that his gaze and his mind were aimed elsewhere it was all for nell now ripley watched her brother as he watched nell circulate with her fancy little egg rolls there was no doubt about it the man was completely over the moon while she could resist and ignore mias talk of destinies and responsibilities when it came to herself when it came to a newly formed and still evolving friendship it was an entirely different matter especially if it involved her brother there was nothing she wouldnt have done for zack even if it meant linking hands with mia she was going to have to pay close attention to the situation reevaluate periodically do some hard uncomfortable thinking hes on the edge mia whispered in her ear the shimmering edge just before the breathless tumble ive got eyes dont i do you know what happens when he falls ripley took the wineglass out of mias hand drank half of it why dont you tell me hell lay down his life for her without an instants hesitation hes the most admirable man i know she took the glass back sipped that at least is a point of absolute agreement between us because she knew it ripley weakened i want a protective spell i want you to take care of that ive already done what i can in the end it has to be a circle of three i cant think about this now im not going to talk about it now all right why dont we just stand here and watch a strong and admirable man fall in love moments this pure shouldnt be wasted mia laid a hand on ripleys shoulder a casual link she doesnt see it even as it passes over her like a breath of warm air she isnt whole enough to know it with a sigh that may have held the barest whiff of envy mia looked down into her wine come on ill buy you a drink zack bided his time he talked with the other guests danced with the ladies shared a celebratory beer with carl he listened with apparent interest to village complaints and scrutinized the alcohol intake of anyone who held car keys he watched nell serve food chat with the guests replenish pots staying warm over little cans of sterno what he observed he thought was a blooming he started to ask if he could lend her a hand then realized it was laughable not only did he have no clue what needed to be done but she so obviously needed no ones help as the crowd thinned out he drove a few celebrants home himself to be on the safe side it was nearly midnight before he felt his own duties were dispatched and he could hunt nell up in the kitchen empty trays were stacked neatly on gladyss marbled white counter serving bowls were nested the sink was filled with soapy water that sent up little fingers of steam and nell was systematically loading the dishwasher whens the last time you were off your feet i lost track she slid plates into slots but the fact that theyre killing me makes me incredibly happy here he held out a glass of champagne i thought you deserved this i certainly do she took a quick sip before she set it aside all these weeks of planning and its done and i have five count them five appointments for jobs next week did you know mary harrisons daughter is getting married next spring i heard that to john bigelow cousin of mine i have a shot at catering it i vote you put those meatballs of yours on the menu they were really tasty ill make a note of it it felt so good to be able to plan ahead not just a day or a week but months ahead did you see the way gladys and carl danced together she straightened pressing hard on the aching small of her back thirty years and they were dancing on the patio looking at each other like it was the first time it was the best moment of the night for me do you know why why she turned to him because them dancing together them looking at each other the way they were was what this was all about not decorations or pretty lights or cocktail shrimp it was about people making a connection and believing in it in each other what would have happened if either one of them all those years ago had stepped back or turned away theyd have missed dancing on the patio and everything in between i never got to dance with you he reached out skimmed his fingers over her cheek nell there you are eyes damp and brilliant gladys rushed in i was afraid youd slipped out no indeed i need to finish up here then do a runthrough of the house to make sure i have everything back in order you certainly do not youve done enough more than i expected i never had such a party not in my whole life why people will be talking about it for years she took nells shoulders kissed both her cheeks i was a pest and i know it then she hugged nell breathless oh this was such a treat and im not waiting three decades to do it again now i want you to go home and get off your feet she pressed a crisp hundreddollar bill into nells hand this is for you mrs macey youre not supposed to tip me peg and ive taken care of them youre going to hurt my feelings if you dont take this and go buy yourself something pretty now i want you to scat anything else needs to be done itll wait until tomorrow sheriff you help our nell out to her car with her trays ill do that this was better than my wedding gladys said as she started to the door she turned back briefly winked now lets see if we can improve on my wedding night looks like carls in for a surprise zack hefted a stack of trays wed better move along give the young couple some privacy im right behind you it took three trips between them with carl pushing a bottle of champagne into nells hands as he nudged them along heres your hat whats your hurry zack chuckled as he loaded nells trunk wheres your car hmm oh ripley used it to take the last couple of semiimpaired guests home most people walked which helped out nell let herself look at him he was wearing a suit but had already rid himself of the tie she could see the faint bulge where hed stuffed it in his pocket hed opened his collar so she could see the clean tanned line of his throat there was a faint smile on his lips as he watched the lights in the macey house wink out one at a time his profile wasnt perfect his hair hadnt been styled and the way he stood his thumbs tucked in the front pockets of his suit pants was relaxed rather than posed when the shimmer of desire came she didnt try to close it off instead she took a step forward ive only had half a glass of champagne im unimpaired thinking clearly and my reflexes are perfect he turned his head toward her as sheriff im glad to know it still watching him she drew her keys out of her pocket held them dangling come home with me you drive the twinkle in his eyes turned to razorsharp intensity im not going to ask if youre sure he took the keys im just going to tell you to get in the car her knees felt a bit wobbly but she walked to the door slid in while he got behind the wheel when he yanked her across the seat ravished her mouth she forgot all about wobbly knees and did her best to crawl into his lap hold on just hold on christ jesus he stabbed the keys into the ignition the engine whimpered to life and he swung the protesting car into a tight uturn it shimmied in protest making nell giggle nervously if this heap falls apart before we get there well have to run for it zack she flipped off the seat belt shed automatically snapped on and slithered over to bite his ear i feel like im going to explode did i ever mention im particularly partial to women wearing little black vests no really i just found out tonight reaching out he snagged the vest by the center vee tugged her back against him understandably distracted he took the turn too sharp and bumped the wheels over the curb one more minute he panted just one more minute with a squeal of brakes and a violent jerk he stopped in front of nells cottage he managed barely to turn off the ignition before he reached for her dragging her across his lap he found her mouth with his again and let his hands do as they pleased need spurted through her hot and welcome riding on it she tugged at his jacket arched against his hands and thrilled at the first scrape of callus over her flesh inside he felt as randy and impatient as a teenager and as fumbling as he fought to open the car door we have to get inside he whipped her out his breathing already ragged as they continued to fight with each others clothes they stumbled and buttons popped off his shirt as he half carried her toward the cottage her delighted laughter rang in his head oh i love your hands i want them all over me ill take care of that goddamn it whats wrong with this door even as he vented his frustration by rapping his hip hard against it it flew open they ended up in a heap on the floor half in half out right here right here she chanted it while her fingers worked busily at his belt wait just a let me close the he managed to roll scoot and kick the door shut the room was all moonlight and shadows the floor was as hard as brick neither of them noticed as they tore at clothes rolled and tugged he caught glimpses beautiful erotic images of pale skin soft curves delicate lines he wanted to look he wanted to wallow he had to take when her shirt caught at her wrists by the cuffs he gave up gave in and lowered his mouth to her breast she vibrated beneath him a volcano on the brink of erupting flashes of whitehot heat curls of keenedged longing raced through her system until she was raw and ready she arched under him more demand than offer her nails biting restlessly into his back the world was spinning faster and faster as if shed leaped upon some mad carousel and all that kept her earthbound was the glorious weight of his body on hers right now she gripped his hips opened for him right now he plunged letting his body take over letting his mind go there was nothing but the relentless fury to mate she closed around him a hot wet fist and he felt her tighten stretching like a bow beneath him before she let out a cry that rang with triumph her climax ripped through him like madness pleasure geysered through her flooding senses swamping reason flying free she wrapped herself around him clinging tight to take him with her and with her sheer joy drove him over the edge chapter twelve contents prev next his ears were ringing or maybe it was just the sound of his heart banging against his ribs like a fist on piano keys either way he couldnt get his mind clear or his body to move hed have worried about temporary paralysis if he couldve worked up the energy to worry about anything okay he managed and breathed in all right and out again i guess i tripped me too she was flattened under him in the perfect position to nuzzle at his throat did you get banged up anywhere no you broke my fall she gave the strong line of that throat a little scrape with her teeth such a hero yeah you bet i rushed you i hope you dont mind its a little hard to complain just at the moment he found the energy to roll over dragging her with him so she was cushioned against him but im hoping youll give me a chance to show off my style and finesse she lifted her head shook her hair back and just grinned down at him what i was just thinking how much i like your style every time i caught a glimpse of you tonight during the party i just wanted to lick my lips big handsome sheriff todd standing around in a suit he wished he didnt have to wear nursing one lonely beer all evening so he could drive people home safe and watching me with those patient green eyes until i was so turned on id have to go back to the kitchen just to calm down again is that right he ran his hands down her arms amused when he hit the cuffs of her shirt carefully he began to unbutton them do you know what i was thinking when i was watching you not exactly i was thinking how you looked like a dancer all grace and competence and i tried not to think what you might have on under that starched white shirt and sexy little vest once hed freed her wrists he ran his hands back up her arms youve got such a fine streamlined shape to you nell its been driving me crazy for weeks i dont know how to explain how it makes me feel to know that to feel steady enough to want that she threw her head back her arms up oh god i feel so alive i dont want it ever to stop she leaned down again kissed him hard then scrambled to her feet i want that champagne i want to get drunk and make love with you all night i can get behind that idea he sat up then his eyes widened as she pulled open the door what re you doing getting the champagne out of the car let me get my pants on and ill get it nell stupefied he sprang to his feet as she raced outside naked as a jaybird well for gods sake he grabbed his pants carrying them with him to the doorway get back in here before i have to haul you in for indecent exposure theres nobody to see it felt fabulous and exactly right to stand naked in the cool night air to feel it caress the skin so recently heated by passion with the grass tickling her feet she threw her arms out to the side and turned in circles come on out its a beautiful night moon and stars and the sound of the sea she looked impossibly alluring the gold of her hair silvered by starlight her milky skin shimmering with it and her face lifted to the sky then her gaze met his across the little patch of lawn with a power so intense it stole his breath for a moment he would have sworn the whole of her sparkled theres something in the air here she said turning her hands up palms cupped as if she could catch the breath of the night i feel it inside me beating like a pulse and when i feel that it seems i could do anything with her palm still cupped she held out her hand to him will you come kiss me in the moonlight he couldnt resist and didnt try but walked to her took her outstretched hand with the sky sprinkling light over them he lowered his mouth to hers in a kiss that warmed rather than burned the tenderness of it crept into her heart when he lifted her into his arms she cradled her head on his shoulder knowing she was safe and welcome there he carried her inside through the little cottage and to the old bed that shifted quietly under their weight later he told himself as he lost himself in her he would think about how he felt to find himself falling in love with a witch she awoke before dawn from one of the snatches of sleep theyd allowed each other she felt his warmth and his weight the ease of it the sheer and steady normality of him was both comfort and arousal she drew his face for herself in her mind feature by feature when she had it complete she held it there as she slipped out of bed to start her day she showered dressed in shorts and a sleeveless shirt quietly she picked up the clothes theyd scattered in the living room and all but floated into the kitchen shed never experienced desire like that before not the kind that sprang like an animal inside you and swallowed you whole she hoped to have the experience again and the tenderness that had come later the insatiable thirst for more the dark breathless groping all of it nell channing had a lover and he was sleeping in her bed he wanted her and that was a thrill he wanted her for who she was and not who he could mold her to be and that was a balm blissful she brewed coffee and while its scent perfumed the air she worked up a dough for cinnamon buns another for bread while she worked she sang to herself and watched the new day put roses in the sky once her garden was watered and shed sipped at her first cup of coffee she slid a batch of buns into the oven with her mug in one hand a pencil in the other she began to toy with her menu for the coming week whatre you doing she jumped like a rabbit at the sleeproughened sound of his voice and the coffee slopped over onto the paper did i wake you im sorry i tried to be quiet he held up a hand nell dont do that it pisses me off his voice was thick with sleep and despite herself dread curled in her stomach as he stepped toward her theres one thing im going to ask you he picked up her mug drank to clear his mind and voice dont ever mix me up with him if youd waked me up and it annoyed me i would say so but the fact is i woke up because you werent there and i missed you some habits are hard to break no matter how much you try well keep trying he said it lightly moved over to the stove to pour a full mug for himself you got something baking already he sniffed the air mother of god he breathed it reverently cinnamon buns her dimples flickered and if they are ill be your slave youre so easy sheriff she got a hot mitt out of the drawer why dont you sit down ill give you breakfast and we can discuss what i expect from my slave on monday morning nell breezed into café book loaded with boxes of baked goods called out a cheery hello and swung upstairs at the front counter lulu stopped ringing up weekend mail orders her lips twitching as mia turned from stocking shelves somebody mia said got lucky this weekend you going up to squeeze her for details please mia tucked in another book brushed lint from her skirt do dryads dance in the woods amused lulu cackled well dont forget to fill me in mia walked into the café and through the homey irresistible scent of cinnamon buns busy weekend she commented scanning the mornings offerings you bet and a terrific party saturday night hell of a job little sister thanks nell lined up her muffins before pouring the first of the morning coffee for mia ive got several meetings this week with potential clients that came out of it congratulations but mia drew in the scent of her coffee i dont think future catering jobs are what has you glowing today let me try one of those buns there casually she walked around to the rear of the counter while nell selected the bun you definitely have the look of a woman who spent her weekend doing more than baking i did some gardening my tomato plants are coming right along mmmhmm she brought the fragrant bun to her lips took a neat bite im imagining sheriff todd was just as tasty as this give we open in ten i shouldnt talk about it its rude isnt it absolutely not its required and expected have a little sympathy will you i havent engaged in sexual activities for a considerable time so im entitled to a few vicarious thrills you look so damn happy i am it was wonderful nell did a quick little dance then grabbed a bun for herself outrageous he has such stamina oh mmm mia ran her tongue over her lips dont stop now i think we broke several standing records now youre bragging but thats all right youre among friends you know the best part im hoping youll tell me and all the other parts as well he didnt doesnt treat me like im fragile or needy or i dont know wounded so i dont feel fragile or needy or wounded when im with him the first time we barely made it into the house and ended up on the floor tearing at each others clothes it was so normal we could all use a bit of that kind of normal now and then hes a great kisser isnt he oh boy and when he trailing off nell paled i was fifteen mia explained as she bit into the cinnamon bun again he gave me a ride home from a party and we satisfied our mutual curiosity with a couple of very long very intense liplocks while i wont insult your intelligence and claim it was like kissing my brother i will say we didnt suit and have chosen to be friends but they were really fine kisses she licked icing off her finger so i have some small idea just how delightful your weekend was im glad i didnt know that before i might have been intimidated arent you sweet so what are you going to do about zachariah todd enjoy him perfect answer for the moment he has really good hands too doesnt he mia commented as she strolled away now youre going to have to shut up laughing mia started down the steps im opening the doors and so she thought little sister are you it wouldnt have surprised mia to know that zack was undergoing personal interrogation over coffee and buns as well didnt see you around much this weekend had stuff to do and didnt i bring you a present ripley worked her way enthusiastically through the first bun um good she managed to slur guess the stuff had to do with the islands best cook which i cleverly deduced since youve got a bag holding half a dozen buns down to four now he enjoyed one of his own while he slogged through paperwork at his desk john macey still hasnt paid these parking tickets he needs a goose ill goose him so you and nell got down to the mattress rhumba zack gave her a single withering look youve got such a mushy romantic heart rip i dont know how you get through life with it weighing you down avoiding the questions usually answering the question in the affirmative cop howd it go do i ask you about your sex life she waved a finger signaling a pause in the conversation while she swallowed yes only because im older and wiser yeah right she snagged a second bun not only because they were incredible but because she knew it would annoy him if we let you slide on the older and wiser bull then well agree im younger and more cynical are you going to do a deeper run on her background no deliberately he opened a drawer dropped the bag of buns inside shut it if youre serious about her and knowing you you are you need a handle on it zack she didnt drop out of the sky onto three sisters she took the ferry he said coolly whats your problem with her i thought you liked her i do a lot as it happens she eased a hip onto the corner of his desk but for reasons that often escape me i like you a lot too youve got a soft spot for the troubled and wounded zack and sometimes through no fault of their own the troubled and wounded can bite right through the soft parts have you ever known me not to be able to take care of myself youre in love with her when he blinked stared she pushed off the desk paced restlessly around the office area what am i blind and stupid ive known you all my life and i know every move every tone every expression on that dopey face of yours youre in love with her and you dont even know who she is shes exactly who and what ive wanted my whole life ripley stopped in the act of kicking the desk and her eyes went soft and helpless aw damn it zack whyd you have to go and say something like that because its true its the way it is for us todds isnt it we go along go alone then pow it hits and its all over ive been hit and i like it okay lets just back up a little determined to stand up for him whether he wanted it or not she slapped her palms on the desk leaned over shes got trouble shes managed to break free of it at least temporarily but its there he may come after her zack if i hadnt been worried about you id never have asked mia about it rather saw my tongue in half with a rusty kitchen knife but i did ask her and shes not clear on it honey what you said before about knowing me thats true now what do you think my reaction is to what you just said she hissed out a breath if he comes after her hell have to get through you close enough shouldnt you be out on patrol or would you rather take the paperwork portion of our day id rather eat lice she put on her cap yanked the tail of her hair through the back look im glad you found someone who suits you im even more glad i like her but theres more to nell channing than a nice woman with a murky past who can bake like a team of angels you mean shes a witch he said easily yeah i figured that out ive got no particular problem with it so saying he went back to the keyboard chuckling to himself when ripley slammed the door behind her the goddess doesnt require sacrifice mia said shes a mother like a mother she requires respect love discipline and wants happiness for her children the evening was cool mia could already scent the end of summer soon her woods would change from green and lush to wild color shed already seen the woolly caterpillars watched the busy squirrel hoarding nuts signals she thought of a long cold winter but for now her roses bloomed and the most tender of her herbs trailed fragrantly among her garden stones magic springs from the elements and from the heart but its rituals are best served with tools even visual aids if you will any craft depends on certain routines and implements she walked through her garden to her kitchen door opened it for nell i have some for you the room was as fragrant as the garden hanks of herbs dried on hooks pots of flowers that mia had chosen for indoor company stood on the long line of smooth counter what could only be described as a cauldron sat on the stove simmering away with the strong sweetness of heliotrope what are you cooking oh just a little charm for someone who has a job interview later in the week shes nervous mia passed a hand through the steam heliotrope for success sunflower for career a bit of hazel to assist in communication and this and that ill empower some suitable crystals for her that she can carry in a pouch in her purse will she get the job thats up to her the craft doesnt promise us everything we desire nor is it a crutch for weak spines to lean on now your tools she continued gesturing to the table shed selected them carefully with an image of nell in her mind you should once youre home cleanse them no one should touch them without your permission they require your energy the wand is made from a birch branch pruned from a living tree on the winter solstice the crystal on its tip is clear quartz it was a gift to me from the one who trained me it was lovely slim and smooth and felt almost silky when nell trailed a finger over it you cant give me something that was a gift it was meant to be passed on youll want to have others too copper is good this is your broom she continued lifting a brow as nell stifled a laugh sorry i just never thought a broom you wont be riding on it hang it at the door of your home for protection use it to sweep out negative energy a cup again one day youll want to select your own but for now this will serve i bought it at island market glassware section sometimes the simple works best the pentacle is from a maple bur it must always stand upright the athame isnt used for physical cutting but for directing energy she didnt touch it but told nell to do so some prefer swords but i dont think you will she added as nell explored the carved handle with a fingertip the blades dull and meant to be the bolline on the other hand is meant to cut in the physical the handles curved which will give you a good grip for harvesting your herbs and plants carving wands inscribing candles and so on there are those kitchen witches who use it to cut food the choice is yours of course of course nell agreed i assume you can handle the purchase and selection of your own cauldron cast irons best you can find an incense burner that appeals to you at one of the gift shops and the incense as well cones and sticks are more accessible locally when youve time you can make your own incense powder youll need some straw baskets some swatches of silk do you want to write this down nell blew out a breath maybe id better candles mia continued after handing nell a pad and pencil ill explain the purpose of colors and symbols i have some crystals for you but youll want more of your own selection a couple dozen canning jars with lids a mortar and pestle sea salt i have a tarot deck you can borrow and some wooden boxes though ill want them back as well this will get you started its more involved than i thought before the day in the garden all i did was stand there there are things youll be able to do with your mind and heart and others that require things as an extension of power and as a respect for tradition now that you have a computer youll want to keep a record of spells a record of spells on my computer why not be practical and efficient nell have you spoken to zack about any of this no are you worried about his reaction she touched the wand again and wondered thats part of it but before we even get there i dont know how id begin to tell him i havent resolved it completely for myself fair enough what you share or dont is your choice just as what you give or what you take with ripley feeling the way she does i thought he might feel the same guess i dont want to hit any hitches so soon who could blame you lets take a walk i really should be getting back its nearly dark hell wait mia opened a carved box took out her wand the tip was a round of quartz as smoky as her eyes take yours its time you learned how to cast a circle well keep it simple she promised nudging nell through the door and after what i have in mind i can almost guarantee the sex will be sensational its not all sex nell began but thats a definite plus as they walked toward the woods a light mist swirled to hug the ground long shadows spilled out of the trees black lines over pale gray the weathers changing mia said the last weeks of summer always make me melancholy its odd because i love the autumn the smells and the colors of it that slice in the air when you step out first thing in the morning youre lonely nell nearly said it before she checked her tongue how could such a statement help but sound smug and selfsatisfied coming from a woman whod just taken a lover maybe a holdover from childhood she suggested end of summer means back to school she followed mia down a wellbeaten path through mist and shadow i always hated those first couple of weeks of school not so much if my father had a second year on the same base but at those times when i was the new kid and everyone else was already picked off in groups how did you handle it i learned how to talk to people to make friends even though they were transient lived in my own head a lot i guess some of that made me a perfect target for evan he promised to love honor and cherish forever i really wanted forever with someone and now now i just want to carve out my own space and stick something else we have in common this is one of my spaces they stepped into a clearing where the mist was white from the quiet light of the rising moon the full ball of it shimmered between the trees teased the dark summer leaves spilled through at the edges of a stand of three stones from the branches that ringed the clearing hung hanks of herbs the glitter of strung crystals rang gently together in the light wind and the sound of the wind the stones the nearby sea was music there was a primitive essential feel to the place its beautiful here nell began and i want to say eerie but not in a frightening way you almost expect to see ghosts or headless horsemen and if you did it would seem absolutely natural not frightening at all she turned her steps shredding the mist like gray silk and caught the scents of verbena rosemary and sage carried on the breeze from the tree branches caught something else as well a quiet hum that was almost like music this is where you were the night of the solstice before you came out to stand on the cliffs this ground is hallowed mia told her its said the sisters stood here three hundred years and more past and worked their spell to create their haven whether they did or not ive always been drawn here well cast the circle together its a basic ritual mia drew her ritual knife from her pocket and began fascinated nell repeated the words the gestures and found herself unsurprised when a thin ring of light glowed through the smoke of the mist we call on air on earth on water and fire to guard our circle and grant our desire here protect and witness this rite open our minds to the magic of night mia laid down her knife her wand nodded to nell after her chant was repeated you can cast your own circle in your own way with your own words when youre ready i hope you dont mind but i prefer working skyclad when weather permits with this mia slipped off her dress and folded it neatly while nell gaped oh well i dont really its not required at ease with her nakedness mia picked up her wand again i generally prefer it particularly for this ritual there was a tattoo a birthmark nell wondered a small pentagram shape against the milkwhite skin of her thigh what ritual well draw down the moon some most usually do this when theres serious work to be done but i sometimes need or like the extra burst of energy to begin open yourself mind breath heart loin trust yourself every woman is ruled by the moon just as the sea is hold your wand in your right hand mirroring mias gestures nell lifted her arms slowly raising them high then clasping her wand with both hands on this night in this hour we call upon lunas power merge with us light into light slowly the wands were turned aimed at hearts woman and goddess glowing bright power and joy pour down from thee as we will so mote it be she felt it cool and fluid and strong a flood of energy and light inside her pulsing as that white ball of moon seemed to pulse as it rose gracefully above the trees she could all but see it blueedged silver spurts of light that spun down and into her with the power came a rush of joy it came out of nell in a laughing gasp as mia lowered her wand sometimes its just lovely being a girl isnt it well close the circle now i believe little sister youll find an appropriate outlet for all that fresh energy when she was alone mia put her own energy to use working a protective spell nell had a great deal of natural power largely untapped she could and would help her explore it control it and refine it but there was something more immediate preying on her mind now within the circle within the woods shed seen something nell had not shed watched the single dark cloud slide over the heart of the moon chapter thirteen contents prev next the last weeks of summer passed in a blur days were filled with work with plans for the jobs shed won and proposals for more once the weather turned she would lose the summerpeople aspect of her business so she would be the clever ant nell decided who carefully prepared for winter shed solicit jobs for holiday parties for super bowl sunday for cabin fever victims the islanders were growing so accustomed to calling her for their events small and large it would become strange to do otherwise nights were nearly always spent with zack taking advantage of the final burst of warmth with candlelight dinners alfresco evening sails made brisk from the chill rising from the water long luxurious lovemaking in the cozy nest of her bed once she lit red candles for passion they seemed to work exceptionally well at least two evenings a week she worked with mia on what she thought of as her ritual lessons and at dawn she was baking in her kitchen the life shed always looked for was all around her and more she had a power inside her that ran like silver and love that glowed warm gold there were times she caught him watching her quietly patiently the waiting look each time she did there was a tug of guilt a ripple of unease and each time that she took the cowards way and ignored it she disappointed both of them she could rationalize it she was happy and entitled to a time of peace and pleasure only a year before shed risked her life and would have forfeited it rather than live trapped and afraid for so many months following shed been alone constantly on the move wary of every sound she awakened night after night in cold sweats from dreams she couldnt face even in the dark if shed locked that time in a box and buried the key who had a better right it was the now that mattered and she was giving zack all she could of the now as summer slipped into fall she was convinced of it and of the solidity of her haven on three sisters with her latest kitchen catalogs and her new subscription to saveur under her arm nell walked out of the post office and headed down high street toward the market the summer people had been replaced by tourists eager to view new england foliage at its peak she couldnt blame them wedges of the island were covered with a brilliant patchwork of flaming color every morning she studied the changes from her own kitchen window dreaming into her own woods as the leaves took on fire there were times she walked the beach in the evening just to see the slow roll of fog tumble in swallow water cloak the buoys and muffle the long monotonous bongs mornings a fine glassy frost might glitter on the ground only to melt under the strengthening sun until it beaded on the grass like tears on lashes rains swept in pounded the beaches the cliffs then swept out again until it seemed to her that the whole of the world sparkled like something under a glass dome she was under that dome nell thought safe and secure and away from the world that raged beyond sea and inlet with the brisk wind sneaking up her sweater she waved at familiar faces paused briefly at the crosswalk to check traffic then jogged carelessly into the market for the pork chops she intended to make for dinner pamela stevens on an impromptu visit to the island with her husband donald gave a little cry of surprise and rolled down the window of their rented bmw sedan im not stopping at any of these shops pamela no matter how quaint they are until i find the right place to park ive just seen a ghost pamela dropped back on the seat laid a hand over her heart its witches around here pamela not ghosts no no donald helen remington evan remingtons wife id swear ive just seen her ghost dont know why in gods name she would come all the way out here to haunt anybody cant even find a damn parking lot im not joking the woman couldve been her double except for the hair and the clothes helen wouldnt have been caught dead in that frightful sweater she craned her neck to try to keep the market in sight pull over donald ive just got to go back and get a closer look as soon as i find a parking place it looked just like her pamela repeated so odd and it gave me such a jolt poor helen i was one of the last people who spoke to her before that terrible accident and so you said a hundred times for six months after she drove off the cliff something like that stays with you bristling pamela straightened in her seat sent her nose in the air i was very fond of her she and evan were a beautiful couple she was so young and pretty with everything to live for when something tragic like that happens it reminds you that lives can change with the snap of a finger by the time pamela managed to drag her husband back to the market nell was unpacking her single bag of groceries and trying to decide between couscous and a spicy new sauce she wanted to try out on red potato wedges she decided to decide later and flipping on the portable stereo zack had left at her cottage she settled down with alanis morissette and her issue of saveur while she crunched on an apple from the basket on her table she pulled over her notepad and began to scribble ideas sparked from an article on artichokes she moved from there to a feature on australian wines and noted the writers opinion of the best values the sound of footsteps didnt jolt her now but gave her a warm feeling as she glanced over to watch zack come in a little early for the upholder of law and order to call it a day isnt it i swapped some time with ripley whats in the box a present for me shoving her notebook aside she got up stepped hurriedly to the counter her mouth fell open love and lust tangled and burned inside her a food processor commercial grade top of the line with reverent hands she stroked the box the way some women might stroke mink oh my god according to my mother if a man gives a woman anything that plugs into an electric socket for a gift hed better be fully paid up on his life insurance but i didnt think that rule applied here its the best on the market ive wanted it forever ive seen you ogling it in the catalog a few times he caught her when she launched herself into his arms to cover his face with kisses i guess im not going to need that life insurance i love it i love it i love it she finished with a hard smacking kiss then leaped down to attack the box but its outrageously expensive i shouldnt let you give me an outrageously expensive present right out of the blue but im going to because i cant stand the idea of not having it its rude to turn down a gift and anyway its not out of the blue a day early but i didnt think that mattered happy birthday my birthdays in april but im not arguing because she caught herself the pulse began to throb in her temples hot and hard helen remingtons birthday was in april nell channings was listed clearly on all identification as september nineteenth i dont know what i was thinking slipped my mind because her palms sprang with damp she wiped them hastily on her jeans ive been so busy i forgot about my birthday all of his pleasure of giving her the gift curdled left a sour ball in his belly dont do that keeping things to yourself is one thing lying to my face is another im sorry she bit down hard on her lip tasted shame so am i because he wanted her to look at him he cupped her chin lifted it i keep waiting for you to take the step nell but you dont you sleep with me and you dont hold anything back there you talk to me about what you hope to do tomorrow and you listen when i talk to you but therere no yesterdays hed tried not to dwell on that tried to tell himself as hed told ripley that it wasnt important but now slapped in the face with it he couldnt pretend you let me into your life from the day you stepped onto the island it was true perfectly true what point would there be in denying it for me my life started from there nothing before then matters anymore if it didnt you wouldnt have to lie to me panic wanted to climb into her throat she countered it with a snap of temper what difference does it make if my birthdays tomorrow or a month from now or six months ago why does it have to matter what matters is you dont trust me thats hard on me nell because im in love with you oh zack you cant im in love with you he repeated taking her arms to hold her still and you know it and of course that was perfectly true as well but i dont know what to do about it i dont know what to do with what i feel for you trusting that trusting you its not that simple not for me you want me to accept that but you dont want to tell me why its not that simple play fair nell i cant a tear spilled over shimmered down her cheek im sorry if thats the way it is were both fooling ourselves he let her go and walked away knocking on zacks front door was one of the hardest things nell had ever done shed spent so much time stepping back from anger now she would have to face it head on and with little defense this was a turmoil shed caused and only she could resolve it she walked to the front of the house because it seemed more formal than strolling across the beach and up the stairs to the back before she knocked she rubbed her fingers over the turquoise stone shed slipped into her pocket to aid her verbal communication though she wasnt convinced such things worked she didnt see how it could make her situation any worse she lifted her hand cursed herself as she lowered it again there was an old rocker on the front porch and a pot of geraniums that were frostburned and pathetic she wished shed seen them before the weather had turned so she could have urged zack to carry them inside and she was stalling she squared her shoulders knocked was torn between relief and despair when no one answered just as shed given up and turned away the door swung open ripley stood in leggings cropped just below the knee and a tshirt marked with a vee of sweat between her breasts she gave nell one long cool stare then leaned on the doorjamb wasnt sure i heard anyone knock i was lifting and had the music up i was hoping to talk to zack yeah i figured you pissed him off good it takes work to do that me ive had years of practice but you must have an innate talent for it nell slipped her hand in her pocket fingered the stone she would have to get through the shield to get to the target i know hes angry with me and he has a right to be dont i have a right to apologize sure but if you do it with choking little sobs and flutters youre going to piss me off im a lot meaner than zack i dont intend to cry and flutter nells own temper bubbled up as she stepped forward and i dont think zack would appreciate you getting in the middle of this i know i dont good for you satisfied ripley shifted to let nell in hes up on the back deck brooding through his telescope and drinking a beer but before you go up and say whatever you have to say to him im going to tell you something he couldve looked into your background picked the pieces apart i would have but hes got standards personal standards so he didnt the guilt that had settled on her since hed walked out her door took on more weight he wouldve considered that rude right i dont mind being rude so you square this with him or deal with me understood i like you and i respect someone who takes care of business but when you mess with a todd you dont get off free fair warning ripley turned toward the stairs leading to the second floor help yourself to a beer on the way through the kitchen ive got to finish my reps nell skipped the beer though shed have relished a tall glass of ice water to ease the burn in her throat she walked through the comfortably untidy living room through the equally untidy kitchen and took the outside steps up to the deck he sat in a big chair faded to gray by the weather a bottle of sam adams nestled between his thighs and his scope tilted starward he knew she was there but didnt acknowledge her the scent of her was peaches and nerves youre angry with me and i deserve it but youre too fair not to listen i might work my way up to fair by tomorrow youd be smarter to wait ill risk it she wondered if he knew how much it meant how much he meant that she would risk it i lied ive lied often and ive lied well and id do it again the choice was between honesty and survival for me it still is so im not going to tell you everything you need to know everything you deserve to know im sorry if two people dont trust each other theyve got no business being together thats easy for you to say zack when he shifted his gaze from the stars to hers and the heat of it scorched her she stepped closer her heart throbbed she didnt fear that he would strike her but she did fear that hed never want to touch her again no damn it it is easy for you youve got your place here youve always had it and you dont have to question it or fight for it if ive got a place he said in careful measured tones ive had to earn it the same as anyone thats different because you started on a foundation a solid one and built from there these past few months ive been working to earn a place here i have earned it but its different okay maybe it is but you and i started on the same ground nell when it comes to what we were making together were making she thought not are making if this was his line she could stand where she was keep on her side of it or take the first step over it wasnt any harder she decided than driving off a cliff i was with a man for three years i was with a man who hurt me not just the slaps and the shoves those kinds of bruises dont last but others do she had to let out a little breath to ease the pressure in her chest he systematically chipped away at my confidence my selfesteem my courage and my choices and he did it so skillfully they were gone before i realized what was happening its not easy to rebuild those things and im still working on it coming here just walking over here tonight took everything ive managed to store up i shouldnt have gotten involved with you and i didnt intend to but something about being here and about being with you made me feel normal again thats the start of a fine speech why dont you sit down and just talk to me i did what i had to do to get away from him im not going to apologize for it im not asking you to im not going into the details she turned away leaned on the rail and stared out at the nightdark sea ill tell you it was like living in a pit that got deeper and deeper and colder and colder whenever i tried to crawl out he was right there but you found a way i wont go back whatever i have to do wherever i have to run i wont go back so ive lied and deceived ive broken the law and ive hurt you she turned back the only thing im sorry for is the last she said it defiantly almost furiously as she stood with her back to the rail and her hands in whiteknuckled fists terror and courage he thought dragging at each other inside her did you think i wouldnt understand zack she lifted her hands dropped them i still dont understand i wasnt a doormat when i met him i wasnt a victim waiting to be exploited i came from a solid steady family as functional as any family manages to be i was educated independent helping to run a business thered been men in my life before nothing really serious but normal healthy relationships then there i was manipulated and abused and trapped oh baby he thought as he had when shed fallen to pieces in the café kitchen why are you still blaming yourself for it the question broke her rhythm for a moment she could only stare at him baffled i dont know she walked over to sit in the chair beside him itd be a good next step to stop doing that he said it easily taking a sip of his beer there was still temper inside him dregs of it for nell but a new and ripe well of it for the man the faceless nameless entity whod scarred her he thought he might work that off later by pounding the hell out of ripleys punching bag why dont you tell me about your family he suggested and offered her the beer you know my mother cant cook worth a damn and my father likes to take snapshots with his new toy you know they grew up here on the island got married and had a couple of kids and youve had personal acquaintance with my sister my father was in the army he was a lieutenant colonel an army brat since she shook her head at the beer he took another pull himself saw some of the world didnt you yeah we moved around a lot he always liked getting new orders something new to handle i suppose he was a good man very steady with a wonderful warm laugh he liked old marx brothers movies and reeses peanut butter cups oh god grief caught her by the throat choked off her voice dug raw wounds in her stomach hes been gone so long i dont know how it could seem like yesterday when you love somebody its always there i still think about my grandmother now and again he took nells hand held it loosely when i do i can smell her lavender water and peppermint she died when i was fourteen how was it he could understand and so exactly that she thought was the magic of him my father was killed in the gulf war i thought he was invincible hed always seemed to be everyone said he was a good soldier but i remember he was a good father he would always listen if i needed to tell him something he was honest and fair and had this code of honor a personal one that meant more than all the rules and regulations he god she turned her head to study zacks face it just hit me how much youre like him he would have approved of you sheriff todd im sorry i never got the chance to meet him he turned the scope toward her why dont you take a look see what you can find up there she lowered her head toward the viewer scanned the stars youve forgiven me lets say weve made some progress good thing for me otherwise ripley was going to kick my ass and shes a hell of an asskicker too she loves you i always wanted a brother or a sister my mother and i were tight and i guess we got tighter after we lost my father but i always wanted a sister youdve liked my mother she was tough and smart and full of fun started her own business from the ground up after she was widowed and she made it work sounds like someone else i know her lips curved my father always said i took after her zack who i am now is who i was before the three years between they were the aberration you wouldnt recognize the person i became during that lost time i barely do maybe you had to go through it to get where you are now maybe the light through the scope haloed as her eyes misted i feel like i was always headed here all those moves when i was growing up id look around and think no this isnt it not yet the day i crossed over on the ferry and i saw the island floating on the water i knew this is my place he lifted their joined hands kissed the back of hers the day i saw you behind the counter in the café i knew the thrill rocketed up her arm and straight into her heart ive got baggage zack ive got complications more than i can tell you you matter to me more than i thought anyone ever could i dont want to mess up your life with my problems from where im sitting nell its too late to worry about that im in love with you another long thrill rippled through her theres so much you dont know and any one piece of it could change your mind you dont think much of my wherewithal oh yes i do okay she pulled her hand away rose she faced crises better on her feet theres something else i can tell you and i dont expect you to understand or accept it youre a kleptomaniac no an agent for a clandestine splinter group she managed to laugh no zack wait i get one more youre one of those star trek addicts who can recite all the dialogue in every episode no only in the first season of the original well thats all right then okay i give up im a witch oh well i know that im not using that as a euphemism for temperament she said impatiently i mean it literally spells and charms and that sort of thing a witch yeah i got that the night you were dancing naked on your front lawn and glowing like a candle nell ive lived on three sisters all my life do you expect me to be stupefied or to do that crossedfingers thing to ward off evil unsure if she was relieved or disappointed by his reaction she frowned at him i guess i expected you to be something it gave me a moment he admitted but then living with rip sort of tones down the jolt of course she hasnt had anything to do with that kind of thing for years now if you were to tell me youd put some sort of love spell on me i might be a little irked of course i didnt i wouldnt even know how im just learning an apprentice witch then amused at both of them he got to his feet i imagine miall whip you into shape before long did nothing surprise the man a couple of nights ago i drew down the moon what the hell does that mean no never mind i dont have much of a head for the metaphysical im a simple man nell he ran his hands up and down her arms in the way he had that managed to arouse and soothe at the same time no youre not simple enough to know im standing here with a pretty woman and wasting the moonlight he lowered his mouth to hers drew her up and into a sumptuous kiss when her head fell back in surrender and her arms wound around his neck he circled her toward the glass door i want to take you to bed my bed i want to love you the army brat who takes after her mother he slid the door open drew her inside i do love you here she thought as they lowered to the bed was truth and here was compassion he would give these to her as much as desire as much as need when he touched her those thrills those soft and fluid aches were welcome the yearning shed felt for home was satisfied slow and sweet she moved with him freely she opened for him baring her heart as well as her body her skin hummed under the brush of his fingers the long liquid pull inside her made her sigh when her mouth met his again she poured all she had into the kiss what she couldnt give him in words she could give him here with her heart with her body he skimmed his lips over her shoulder tracing the shape of it marveling at the firmness of muscle the delicacy of bone the taste of her intoxicated him a flavor hed come to crave as much as the next breath of air he found her breast pleasured them both with lips and teeth and tongue until her heart began to beat under his mouth like the endless pulse of the sea and as that beat quickened she rose beneath him with a single breathless gasp without hurry he moved down her a skim of fingers a brush of lips felt her begin to tremble while his own blood pounded in sharp anvil strikes of need her hands groped then fisted desperately in the sheets when he lifted her hips and used his mouth on her with a kind of ruthless patience he shot her screaming to peak her breath was sobbing now her skin slick and damp as she rolled with him over the tangled sheets heat spiked seemed to throb in the air under her skin until her body felt like a furnace stoked too high zack not yet not yet he was wild for her for the taste of flesh the urgency of her hands in the pale splash of moonlight through the glass her body seemed unearthly white marble erotically hot to the touch and glimmering with the healthy sweat of lust when he fixed his teeth on her neck it felt like feeding her mouth was wild her body plunging then she cried out again shocked pleasure when his fingers drove her relentlessly over the edge beyond control beyond reason she moved like lightning she would have sworn the bed spun in fast dizzy circles as she straddled him panting she took him rode him drove him as he had driven her curved down to him she ravished his mouth then flung herself back arms bowed behind her head and flew as power whipped through her he reached for her his fingers sliding helplessly down her busy hips his blood was a rage his mind a torrent for a moment all he could see was her eyes flameblue and vivid as jewels he reared up pressed his lips to her heart and shattered chapter fourteen contents prev next ripley stopped her cruiser and watched nell unpack her car the sun had gone down and with the cold snap that had slapped the island with a wicked northeast punch any tourists were snuggled into the hotel sipping hot drinks most of the natives would be sensibly settled in front of the television or finishing up dinner she was looking forward to engaging in both those activities herself but she hadnt managed a oneonone with nell since the evening shed come to the door youre either getting a very late start or a really early one ripley called out nell hefted the box and hunched inside the fleecelined jacket shed mailordered from the mainland a second start the book club that mia runs is back from its summer break first meetings tonight oh yeah ripley got out of the car she was wearing an ancient and wellloved bomber jacket and hiking boots her summerweight ball cap had been replaced by one of plain black wool need a hand i wouldnt turn one down happy that she sensed no lingering animosity nell gestured with her elbow to the second box refreshments for the meeting are you going not a chance dont like to read no i like to read i just dont like groups groups are made up of members she explained and members are almost always people so there you go people you know nell pointed out which gives my stand a firmer base this groups a bunch of hens wholl spend as much time pecking at the latest gossip as they will discussing whatever book they used as an excuse to get out of the house for the evening how do you know that if you dont belong to the club lets just say i have a sixth sense about these things all right nell adjusted the balance of her box as they walked toward the rear entrance despite the weather mias salvia hung on as red and sassy as july is that why you dont accept the craft because its like joining a group that would be reason enough added to that i dont like being told i have to fall in line with something that started three hundred years before i was born a blast of wind blew her ponytail into a thick dark whip she ignored it and the cold fingers that tried to sneak under her jacket i figure whatever needs to be dealt with can and should be dealt with without cackling over a cauldron and i dont like having people wondering if im going to come flying by on my broom wearing a pointy black hat i cant argue with the first two reasons nell opened the door stepped into the welcome warmth but the second two dont hold ive never once heard mia cackle over a cauldron or otherwise and ive never seen anyone look at her as if they expected her to jump on a broom wouldnt surprise me if she did ripley strode into the main store nodded at lulu lu rip lulu continued setting up the folding chairs joining us tonight are they holding the ice capades in hell not that ive heard she sniffed the air do i smell gingerbread got it in one nell told her is there any special way you want the refreshments set up youre the expert there mias upstairs yet if she doesnt like the way youve done it shell tell you nell carried the box to the table that was already waiting shed made some pricks in lulus shell but had yet to crack all the way through it was she admitted becoming a personal challenge do you think i can stay for some of the discussion lulu peered narrowly over the tops of her glasses you read the book damn nell took out the plate of gingerbread first hoping the scent would sweeten her chances well no i didnt know about the club until last week and a persons got an hour a day that can be put to reading i dont care how busy they are oh stop being such a bitch lulu nells jaw dropped at ripleys command but the sidelong look she risked showed her lulus reaction was a happy grin i cant it goes down to the bone you can stay if this one stays she jerked a thumb at ripley im not interested in hanging out with a bunch of females chattering about a book and whos sleeping with who who shouldnt be besides i havent had my dinner cafés open another ten minutes lulu told her split pea and ham soup was good today and itll do you good to spend some time with females explore your inner woman ripley snorted but the idea of the soup in fact any food that she wasnt obliged to fix herself held tremendous appeal my inner woman doesnt need any exploration shes lean and mean but ill check out the soup she sauntered toward the steps i might stay for the first twenty minutes she called back but if i do i want first crack at that gingerbread lulu nell arranged starshaped cookies on a glass plate what ill call you a bitch if itll help bring us closer as people willing to explore our inner woman lulu gave a snort of her own youve got a quick mouth on you when you want to you carry your weight and you keep your word that goes a way with me i also make superior gingerbread lulu walked over picked up a slice ill be the judge of that see that you read octobers book before the next discussion nells dimples flickered i will upstairs ripley annoyed peg by demanding a bowl of soup minutes before closing ive got a date so if you dont finish this before my times up youll just have to wash the bowl yourself i can dump it in the sink the same as you would for nell to deal with in the morning give me a hot chocolate to go with it are you still stepping out with mick burmingham thats right were snugging in and having a video festival were watching scream one two and three very sexy if you want to take off i wont snitch to mia peg didnt hesitate thanks she whipped off her apron im gone appreciating the fact that the café was empty ripley settled down to enjoy her soup in blissful solitude nothing could have spoiled her pleasure more quickly than hearing the click of mias heels on the floor barely one minute later wheres peg i cut her loose hot date i dont appreciate you giving my employees permission to leave early the café doesnt close for another four minutes and its part of her job description to clean the case counters and kitchen after that time well i booted her along so you can kick my ass instead of hers intrigued ripley continued to spoon up soup as she studied mia it was a rare event to see the cool ms devlin heated up and jittery she was twisting the chain of the amulet she wore around her neck continued to worry it as she strode over to the display counter and hissed there are health regulations about cleanliness in food services since you were so generous to peg you can damn well scrub this up yourself in a pigs eye ripley muttered but felt a tug of guilt that threatened to spoil her appetite what bug crawled up your butt i have a business to run here and it takes more than stalking around the village looking cocky which is your specialty oh get fucked mia itll improve your humor mia rounded back unlike you fucking isnt my answer to every whim and itch you want to play the ice maiden because sam logan dumped you thats your ripley trailed off despising herself even as the hot color in mias face drained sorry out of line way out of line forget it when i sucker punch somebody i apologize even if you did come in here looking for a fight in fact ill not only apologize ill ask you whats wrong what the hell do you care normally i dont but normally i dont see you spooked whats the deal theyd been friends once and good ones as close as any sisters because of that it was harder for mia to sit to open up than it would have been if ripley had been a stranger but the matter was more important than feuds or grudges she sat across from ripley leveled her gaze theres blood on the moon oh for before ripley could finish mias hand shot out gripped her wrist trouble bad trouble is coming a dark force you know me well enough to be sure i wouldnt say it wouldnt tell you of all people unless i was sure and you know me well enough to know what i think of portents and omens but there was a cold chill working up her spine its coming after the leaves finish dying before the first snow im sure of that too but i cant see what it is or where it comes from somethings blocking it it disturbed ripley when mias eyes went that deep that dark it seemed you could see a thousand years in them any trouble comes to the island zack and i will handle it itll take more ripley zack loves nell and you love him theyre at the center of this i feel it if you dont flex something will break something none of us can put right again i cant do whatever needs to be done alone and nell isnt ready yet i cant help you that way wont cant or wont comes out to the same thing yes it does mia said as she got to her feet there wasnt temper sparking her eyes that would have been easy to fight there was weariness deny what you are lose what you are i sincerely hope you dont regret it mia went downstairs to greet her book club and deal with the business at hand alone ripley rested her chin on her fist it was a guilt trip that was all when mia wasnt shooting out spiteful little darts she heaped on layers of sticky guilt ripley wasnt falling for it if there was a red haze over the moon it was due to some atmospheric quirk and had nothing to do with her she would leave the omens and portents to mia since she enjoyed them so much she shouldnt have dropped in tonight shouldnt have put herself in a position where mia could try to pin her all they did was annoy each other it had been that way for more than a decade but not always theyd been friends next to inseparable friends until theyd teetered on the cusp of adulthood ripley remembered her mother had called them twins of the heart theyd shared everything and maybe that was the problem it was natural for interests to diverge when people grew up natural for childhood friends to drift apart not that she and mia had drifted she admitted it had been more like a sword slash down the center of their friendship abrupt and violent but shed had the right to go her own way shed been right to go her own way and she wasnt going back now just because mia was jittery over some atmospheric hitch even if mia was right and trouble was coming it would be dealt with through the rules and obligations of the law and not with spellbinding she had put away her childish things the toys and the tools she had no further interest in that had been sensible mature when people looked at her now they saw ripley todd deputy a dependable responsible woman who did her job they didnt see some flaky island priestess who would brew them a potion to beef up their sex lives irritated because even her thoughts sounded defensive and nasty she gathered up her dishes and took them into the kitchen there was just enough guilt still pricking at her to oblige her to rinse the dishes load them in the dishwasher scrub out the sink that she decided paid her debt she could hear the voices all female flowing back from the front of the store where the book club gathered she could smell the incense mia lit a scent for protection ripley snuck out the back a fleet of steamrollers couldnt have pushed her forward and into that noisy clutch of women now just outside the back door she saw the fat black candle burning a charm to repel evil she would have sneered at it but her gaze was drawn up the waning globe of the moon was shrouded in a thin and bloody mist unable to work up that sneer she jammed her hands in her jacket pockets and stared down at her own boots as she walked to her car when the last of the book club members were out the door mia flipped the locks nell was already clearing plates and napkins while lulu closed the register that was fun stoneware rang gaily as nell stacked coffee cups and so interesting ive never discussed a book that way whenever i read one i just think well i liked it or i didnt but i never talked about why and i promise to read next months selection so ill have something to contribute ill see to the dishes nell you must be tired im not nell lifted a loaded tray there was so much energy in here tonight i feel like i just lapped it up isnt zack waiting for you oh not tonight i told him i was going to crash the party lulu waited until nell was upstairs whats wrong she asked mia im not entirely sure to keep her hands busy mia began folding the chairs thats what concerns me most somethings coming and i cant pin it down its all right for tonight she glanced up the stairs as she carted chairs to the storeroom shes all right for tonight shes the center lulu stored her own haul of chairs i guess i felt that all along and didnt cut her much of a break but the fact is thats a sweet girl who works hard does somebody want to hurt her someone already has and i dont intend to let him do it again ill try a foretelling but i need to prepare for it i need to clear my mind theres time i cant tell how much but itll have to be enough will you tell her not just yet shell have her own preparations her own cleansing to do shes in love and that makes her strong shell need to be what makes you strong mia purpose love never worked for me i heard hes in new york mia shrugged a deliberate gesture she knew who lulu meant and it irritated her to have sam logan tossed at her twice in one night its a big city she said flatly hell have plenty of company i want to finish and go home i need sleep idiot man lulu muttered under her breath there were too many idiot men in the world to her way of thinking and most of them ended up bumping up against stubborn women spells were nell decided really just a kind of recipe and there she was on solid ground a recipe required time care and quality ingredients in proper proportions for success add a bit of imagination and it became a personal dish she set aside time between jobs and book work to study the spell book mia had lent her she imagined mia would be amused by the idea of viewing it as a kind of metaphysical cookbook but she didnt think she would be offended time also had to be carved out for meditation visualization for gathering and creating her own tools so that shed have what she liked to consider a wellsupplied witchs pantry but now she intended to reward herself with her first solo practice session love spells banishing spells protection spells she chanted as she flipped through binding spells money spells healing spells something for everybody she thought and remembered mias warning about being careful what she wished for a careless or selfish wish could boomerang in unpleasant or certainly unexpected ways she would keep it simple choosing something that involved no one and couldnt inadvertently cause harm or trouble she used her broom first sweeping the negative energy away then she set it by the kitchen door to prevent any reentry with diego ribboning between her legs she chose her candles inscribed them with the appropriate symbols deciding that she could use all the help she could get she selected crystals to bolster the energy she arranged them and the pot of frostburned geraniums shed taken from zacks front porch expelled a breath drew in fresh she referred back to the healing spell mia had written out on parchment in india ink and closing her eyes adjusted the words in her mind to suit her purpose here goes she whispered this damaged bloom i seek to heal from its withered petals fresh beauty reveal um its blooming time was too soon done its color brings pleasure to all and harm to no one set the flower within it free as i will so mote it be she bit her lip waited the geranium sat stubbornly wilted in its pot nell bent over looking close for some little sign of green she straightened again shoot i guess im not ready to solo but maybe she should try again she needed to visualize to see the plant lush and full and blooming she needed to smell leaves and petals channel her energy or was it the plants energy in any case giving up after one try made her a pretty wimpy witch she closed her eyes again started to process then yelped at the brisk knock on her back door she spun around so quickly she booted diego halfway across the little room which caused him to plop down and begin to wash himself as if that was what hed intended all along chuckling nell opened the door to ripley i was cruising by saw the candlelight are you having power trouble even as she asked she looked past nell and saw the ritual candles on the table oh practicing and from the results i need a lot more come on in i dont want to interrupt since the night of the book club meeting shed made a point to stop by or at least cruise by every evening isnt that the dead plant from our front porch its not dead yet but its close i asked zack if i could try to bring it back working spells on dead geraniums man you slay me i figured if i made any mistakes it couldnt hurt anything do you want some tea i brewed some just a while ago well maybe zack said to let you know hed be by when he finished up we had a d and d drunk and disorderly she explained underage minor hes just about sicked up all of the sixpack he swiped from his parents refrigerator zacks walking him home anyone i know the stubens boy the oldest his girlfriend dumped him yesterday so he decided to cry in his daddys beer since the result was him getting sick as three dogs i think hell look for another way to ease his broken heart next time out whats that smell ive got a pork loin roasting youre welcome to stay for dinner id just as soon not sit here and watch you two make googly eyes at each other but i wouldnt mind you sending a doggie bag home with zack happy to she handed ripley a cup of tea but we dont make googly eyes at each other do so nell got a plate of tiny appetizers out of the fridge man do you guys eat like this every night ripley asked i practice on zack lucky bastard ripley helped herself to a little wedge of bruschetta anything he doesnt go for you can send on to me ill let you know if its any good thats generous of you try a stuffed mushroom zack wont touch them doesnt know what hes missing ripley announced after one bite the catering deals moving along pretty well huh it is but nell dreamed of a convection oven and a subzero refrigerator impossible and impractical in her cozy cottage kitchen she reminded herself and for the moment out of sisters caterings financial grasp im doing sandwiches and cake for a christening on saturday the new burmingham baby right and lulus sister and family from baltimore are coming in next week lulu wants to wow them theres some sibling rivalry there nell jerked a thumb toward the oven im making this pork loin so i wanted to try it out first thats going some for lu she squeezes a penny until lincoln weeps we worked out a deal a barter shes knitting me a couple of sweaters i can use them with winter coming weve got a warm spell coming well snag a bit of indian summer before it hits i hope youre right so ripley bent down picked up diego hows mia doing shes fine she seems a little distracted lately nell lifted her eyebrows why do you ask no reason i guess shes busy making plans for halloween she really gets into it were going to decorate the store the week of the first im warned that every kid on the island hits café book for trick or treat who can resist candy from the witch id better go she gave diego a quick scratch as she set him down zackll be along any minute i can take that pot out of your way if you she trailed off as she glanced over a glory of crimson petals covered healthy green stalks well well son of a bitch i did it it worked oh oh in one leap nell was at the table her nose buried in blooms i cant believe it i mean i wanted to believe it but i didnt really think i could manage it not by myself isnt it lovely yeah its okay she knew what it was like the rush of power that bright thrill the pleasures both small and huge ripley felt an echo of it now as nell lifted the pot high and circled its not all flowers and moonbeams nell what happened nell lowered the pot cradled it like a baby what happened to make you resent what you have i dont resent it i just dont want it ive been powerless this is better whats better isnt being able to make flowers bloom its being able to take care of yourself you didnt need a spell book to figure out how to do that one doesnt have to be exclusive of the other maybe not but lifes a hell of a lot easier when they are she walked to the door opened it dont leave your candles unattended by the time zack arrived nell had the table cleared and set the kitchen was fragrant with her roast and the aftermath of her candles she liked hearing him come to the kitchen door those long strides the way he stopped and wiped his feet on the mat the rush of brisk air he let in when he opened the door and the easy smile he gave her as he kept on walking until his mouth covered hers later than i expected its all right ripley stopped by and told me you would be then i guess i dont need these he took the bouquet of carnations from behind his back no but i do she gathered them up thanks i thought wed try this australian wine i read about if you want to open it fine he turned to shrug out of his jacket and hang it on the kitchen peg his gaze hit the pot of geraniums shed set on the side counter it gave him a little jolt but after the briefest hesitation he went on and pegged his jacket i dont guess you did that with fertilizer no she linked her fingers together around the carnation stems i didnt does it bother you not bother but talking about it even knowing about its different than seeing it at home in her kitchen he pulled open a drawer for a corkscrew in any case you dont have to smooth out every ripple with me i love you zack he stood the corkscrew in one hand the bottle of wine in the other and suddenly couldnt move emotions overwhelmed him its been hard waiting for you to say that to me i couldnt say it before why now because you brought me carnations because i dont have to smooth out every ripple with you because when i hear you coming up to my door everything inside me lifts and sighs and because love is the most vital magic i want to give mine to you he set the wine and corkscrew aside carefully stepped over to her gently he stroked his hands across her cheeks into her hair ive waited my whole life for you tenderly he kissed her forehead her cheeks i want to spend the rest of it with you she ignored the clutch in her belly and concentrated on the joy lets give each other the now every minutes precious she laid her head on his shoulder every minute counts chapter fifteen contents prev next evan remington wandered the palatial rooms of his monterey home bored restless he studied his possessions each one had been selected with care either by him personally or by a decorator following explicit instructions he had always known precisely what he preferred and precisely what he wanted hed always made certain to obtain it whatever the cost whatever the effort everything that surrounded him reflected his taste a taste admired by associates peers and those whose goal it was to fall into either category and everything dissatisfied him he considered an auction he could find some currently trendy charity and generate some nice press while he disposed of items he no longer wanted he could let it leak that he was disposing of those items because they held too many painful memories of his dead wife the lovely lost helen he even considered selling the house the fact was it did remind him of her it wasnt a problem in los angeles she hadnt died in los angeles since her accident he had seldom come to monterey it was rare for him to stay more than a few days and he always came alone he didnt consider the servants they fell along the same lines as the furnishings to him necessary and efficient the first time hed come back hed been raw with grief hed wept like a madman while lying across the bed hed last shared with her clinging to the nightgown shed worn breathing in the scent of her his love was consuming and his pain threatened to eat him alive she had belonged to him when the torrent had passed hed wandered the house like a ghost touching what she had touched hearing her voice echo in his ears catching a whiff of her scent everywhere as if it was inside him hed spent an hour in her closet caressing her clothes and forgetting the night he had locked her in there when shed been late coming home he wallowed in her and when he could stand the confinement of the house no longer hed driven to the site of her death and had stood a solitary figure weeping on the cliffs his doctor prescribed medication and rest his friends encircled him with sympathy he began to enjoy it within a month hed forgotten he had insisted that helen make the trip to big sur that day in his mind in the cradle of his memory he saw himself entreating her not to attend to stay home and rest until she was well again of course she hadnt listened she had never listened grief turned to fury a raging flood of anger that he drowned with liquor and solitude shed betrayed him going out against his wishes insisting on attending some frivolous party rather than respecting her husbands request she had left him unforgivably alone but even rage passes the hole it left in him he filled with a fantasy of her of their marriage even of himself he heard people speak of them as a perfect couple cruelly parted by tragedy he read it thought it believed it he wore one of her earrings on a chain next to his heart and let the affectation leak to a suitable media source it was said gable did the same when hed lost lombard he kept her clothes in her closets her books on the shelves her perfumes in their bottles he had an angel of white marble erected for her in the cemetery where no body lay every week a dozen red roses were placed at its feet to keep himself sane he threw himself into his work he began to sleep again without so many dreams in which helen came to him gradually at the urging of friends he began to go out again socially but the women eager to comfort the widower didnt interest him he dated only because it kept him in the press he bedded a few of the women only because there would be talk otherwise of an unflattering sort sex had never driven him control had he had no wish ever to marry again there would never be another helen they had been destined for each other shed been meant for him meant to be molded and formed by him if hed had to punish her occasionally well discipline was part of the formation hed had to teach her finally in their last few weeks together he had believed she had learned it had been a rare thing for her to make a mistake in public or private shed deferred to him as a wife was meant to defer to a husband and had made certain that he was pleased with her he remembered or convinced himself that he remembered that hed been about to reward her with a trip to antigua she had been fascinated by the ocean his helen and had told him during those first heady weeks of love and discovery how she sometimes dreamed of living on an island in the end the sea had taken her because he could feel the depression rolling into him like a fog he poured a glass of mineral water and took one of his pills no he wouldnt sell the house he decided in one of his lightning mood changes he would open it he would give one of the lavish alist parties the kind he and helen had hosted so often and so successfully it would feel as if she were there beside him as she was meant to be when the phone rang he ignored it and continued to stand gently rubbing an etched gold hoop earring through the fine linen of his shirt sir ms reece is on the phone shed like to speak with you if youre available saying nothing evan held out a hand for the portable phone he never glanced at the uniformed maid who gave it to him but slid open the terrace door and stepped outside in the balm of breeze to speak to his sister yes barbara evan im glad you were in deke and i were hoping youd join us at the club this afternoon we can have a set of tennis lunch by the pool i hardly see my baby brother these days he started to refuse his sisters country club circle held little interest for him but he reconsidered quickly knowing how well barbara planned entertainment and how much of the annoyance of the details she would willingly take from his hands id like that i want to speak to you anyway he glanced at his rolex why dont i meet you there eleventhirty absolutely perfect prepare yourself ive been working on my backhand his tennis game was off barbara had broken his serve yet again and was prancing around like a fool in her designer tennis skirt of course she had time to fritter around any fucking day of the week making time with some slickfingered tennis pro while her asshole husband practiced his putting he on the other hand was a busy man with a demanding business and highpowered clients who whined like babies if he didnt give them his full attention he didnt have time for goddamn games he bulleted one over the net gritted his teeth audibly when barbara hustled and returned it sweat dampened his face ran down his back and his mouth peeled back in a snarl as he raced over the court it was a look nell would have recognized one she would have feared barbara recognized it as well and instinctively bungled a return youre killing me she called out and shook her head as she took her time going back to position evan had always been temperamental she thought it was hard for him not to win not to get his way it always had been as a child his retribution had come in one of two forms icy silence that could bore holes in steel or quick hot violence youre older her mother had said always be a good girl be a good sister let the baby win it was such an old and ingrained habit she barely registered her decision to blow the next return as well and after all the afternoon would be so much more pleasant if he won the match why cause contention over a tennis game so burying her own competitive spirit she took a dive surrendering the game his expression changed almost instantly good game evan i never could keep up with you she sent him an indulgent smile as they positioned themselves for the next boys hate to lose to girls she thought it was another of her mothers homilies and what were men but big boys by the time it was over and hed won the match he was in a fine mood he felt loose and limber and affectionate he swung an arm over barbaras shoulders bussed her cheek your backhand still needs some work there was a little bubble of annoyance in her throat automatically swallowed yours is lethal she picked up her bag and since you humiliated me you get to buy lunch ill meet you on the lounge terrace thirty minutes she kept him waiting always a minor irritation but it pleased him to see how attractive she was how well presented he detested sloppy attire or unkempt hair on a woman and barbara never disappointed him she was four years his senior but could have passed for thirtyfive her skin was pampered and taut her hair sleek and glossy and her figure trim she joined him under the shade of the umbrella smelling subtly of her favored white diamonds im going to console myself with a champagne cocktail she crossed legs garbed in thin raw silk between that and sitting with the most handsome man in the club my mood should immediately improve and i was just thinking what a beautiful woman i have for a sister her face lit up you always say the sweetest things it was true she thought he did when he won it made her all the more pleased that shed tanked the match lets not wait for deke she said still beaming at him lord knows when hell finish his game she ordered her cocktail and a cobb salad moaning dramatically when evan selected shrimp scampi oh i hate you for your metabolism you never gain an ounce im going to have a bite of yours then curse you when im tortured tomorrow by my personal trainer a little more discipline barbara and youd keep your figure without paying someone to make you sweat believe me shes worth every penny the sadist with a contented sigh she sat back careful to keep her face out of the sun tell me darling what did you want to talk to me about im going to give a party at the monterey house its time to yes she leaned forward again to cover his hand with hers squeezed yes it is time im so glad to see you looking well again evan to hear you making plans you went through such a horrible time tears welled and her affection for him was such that she blinked them back thinking not of her mascara but of his sensibilities he detested public scenes youve begun to move on in the past few months thats healthy helen would have wanted that youre right of course he eased his hand away as their drinks were served he didnt like being touched casually of course was one thing in the business world hugs and kisses were just another tool but he detested being touched with intensity i havent entertained not really since it happened business affairs of course but helen and i planned every detail of our parties together she handled so much of it the invitations the menu all subject to my approval of course i was hoping i could impose on you to help me of course i will you just tell me what you have in mind and when i went to a party just last week very lavish and fun ill steal some ideas it was pamela and donald pamelas often a pain in the neck but she does know how to throw a party speaking of her i feel i should tell you and i hope it doesnt upset you im afraid youll hear it from someone else what is it pamelas been nattering you know how she is evan could barely picture the woman about what she and donald took a holiday out east a couple of weeks ago cape cod primarily though she talked him into driving about and staying at a few bedandbreakfasts like nomads she claims while they were out there sightseeing in some little village or other she saw a woman who looked just like helen evans hand vised on his glass what do you mean she cornered me at her party went on and on about it claimed that at first glance she thought shed seen a ghost in fact she was so insistent about how this apparition might have been poor helens double she asked me if helen had a sister i told her no of course i imagine she caught a glimpse of some fineboned blonde about helens age and enhanced the whole thing in her mind the way shes going on about it i didnt want you to hear some rumor that would cause you any pain the womans an idiot well shes certainly imaginative barbara said now that weve gotten that out of the way tell me how many people youre planning to invite two hundred twofifty he said absently just where did pamela claim to see this ghost of hers oh some island off the east coast im not even sure of the name as i was busy trying to change the subject something about sisters formal or casual what the party honey formal or casual formal he murmured and let his sisters voice buzz in his head like bees lulu lived in a saltbox two blocks back from high street it stood out from its more conservative neighbors with its lipstickred shutters and porch on that red porch was a glider splattered and streaked with a rainbow of paint in a mad pattern that rivaled a jackson pollock canvas a purple gazing ball stood on the thin swath of lawn and shaded a gargoyle who squatted permanently sticking out his tongue at passersby a winged dragon of iridescent green flew on the roof as a weather vane along with a wildly striped wind sock in the short driveway sat a dignified latemodel sedan in practical black and lulus dayglo orange vw circa love beads from the same era dangled from the rearview mirror following instructions nell parked on the street one house down then hauled her delivery to the back door lulu swung it open before nell could knock ill give you prompt and with this lulu grabbed nells arm just above the elbow and yanked her inside i sent the lot of them out for a walk and dont figure theyll be back for twenty minutes more if im lucky syls been a pain in my butt since she was born your sister my parents insist she is but i have my doubts lulu poked her head in the box the minute nell set it down on the center island the idea that i share blood with that pompous narrowminded pissy little twerp gives me the willies im eighteen months older so we went through the sixties at close to the same pace difference is she remembers them which says it all ah nell tried to imagine lulu as a freewheeling freeloving hippie and found it wasnt that much of a stretch for the family dinner shed donned a sweatshirt that announced she was all out of estrogen and had a gun fair warning nell decided urn still its nice that you sometimes get together like this she just comes out here once every damn year to lord it over me according to the gospel of sylvia a woman isnt a woman unless she has a husband and children chairs some crappy committee and knows how to make an emergency centerpiece out of twine spit and an empty tuna can were going to do a hell of a lot better than that nell busied herself by putting the roast in the oven turning it to warm i made it au jus so you just spoon that over and serve it with the side dishes the autumn salad goes first tell them to leave room for the pumpkin cheesecake thatll totally amaze her lulu poured another glass of the wine she was tippling to get through the event i had a husband she said it so fiercely so viciously that nell turned to stare oh dont know what made me do it legal i wasnt knocked up or anything stupid i guess i did it to prove i could still rebel he was no good just as useless as he was handsome it turned out his idea of marriage was having someplace to go after hed finished boinking whatever floozie caught his fancy that particular night im sorry no need to be sorry live and learn i kicked his ass out in nineteeneightyfive the only time it bothers me is when syl comes around gloating about her husband whos no more than a paper pusher and has a spare tire you could ride on to cleveland her kids who are a couple of snotty teenagers in twohundred dollar track shoes and the joys of her life in the suburbs id rather be shot dead than live in some cookiecutter house in the burbs since either the wine or the situation with syl was making lulu loquacious nell took advantage so you didnt grow up here together hell no we grew up in baltimore i took off when i was seventeen went straight to haightashbury i lived in a commune in colorado for a while traveled experienced when i came here i wasnt yet twenty ive been here over thirtytwo years now god the idea of that had her knocking back the wine and pouring more mias grandmother gave me a job doing this and that for her then when mia came along her mother hired me to mind her when she needed minding carly devlins a nice enough person but the fact was she didnt have much interest in raising a child so you did i didnt realize no wonder nell thought she was so protective of mia whatever your sister thinks youve got a daughter at the heart of it damn right she gave a little nod then set down her glass do whatever you need to do here ill be right back she started out turned back if syl the pill comes back before i do just tell her how you work at the bookstore and stopped in to ask me something about work no problem keeping tabs on the time nell organized the meal slipping the salad and the dressing in the refrigerator sliding the scalloped potatoes and the herbed green beans in with the roast she peeked into the dining room saw the table had yet to be set and hunted out dishes and linens first half of your payment lulu announced as she came back in with a wrinkled shopping bag thanks listen i didnt know what dishes you wanted but i think thesell work well its family and theyre casual and cheerful good thing as thats all ive got lulu waited while nell dipped into the shopping bag then smiled smugly at the gasp of pleasure oh oh lulu it was a simple design a mock turtleneck that could and would be worn with everything but the color was a deep rich blue and the material was as soft as a cloud i never expected anything like this already nell was holding it up rubbing her cheek against the shoulder its absolutely wonderful you wear too many neutrals pleasing herself lulu tugged and fussed then stood back to admire the result they wash the color out of your face this brings it in goes with your coloring i started on the second one nice tunic length in a good strong red i dont know how to thank you i cant wait to try it on and theyre back lulu hissed and immediately began shoving nell toward the door go get you need to toss the salad just before yes yes go nell clutched her new sweater as lulu slammed the door in her face serving she finished and chuckled all the way to the car the minute she got home she stripped off her sweatshirt and slid into the magnificent sweater unable to get a satisfactory view from top to bottom she dragged a chair in front of the mirror and stood on it thered been a time when shed had dozens of sweaters cashmere silk the softest cottons the thinnest wools none of them brought her the sheer joy of this one handmade by a friend or close enough to a friend she thought and payment for a job well done she took it off again folded it lovingly in a drawer she would wear it to work on monday for now the sweatshirt was a better choice she had messy work to do her trio of pumpkins waited on a bed of newspapers on her kitchen table shed already used a portion of the largest for lulus dessert it only waited to be carved into the appropriate design she would make pumpkin bread she thought as she began on the second and pie cookies the hulls would serve as decorations on her front porch big fat scary pumpkins to entertain the neighbors and children she was up to her elbows in pumpkin meat and seeds when zack strolled in the door i get to do the third one he came up behind her wrapping his arms tight nuzzling her neck im a jackolantern master the things you learn about people want me to dump the guts for you dump them how would i make a pie with a can his brow furrowed as he watched her slide chunks of pumpkin into a large bowl you mean you actually use that stuff of course where do you think they get the stuff in the cans i never thought about it pumpkin factory he picked up the knife to start on the third while nell washed her hands youve obviously led a very sheltered life sheriff todd if thats so i cant think of anyone id rather have corrupt me how about when we finish this we take a drive to the windward side sit in my cruiser and break a few laws love to she came back with a magic marker and began to draw a hideous face on the first pumpkin everything quiet in the village it tends to be on sundays this time of year did you get lulu all set i did i didnt realize shed been married once long time ago some drifter who worked on the docks for a bit im told seems to me i heard it didnt last six months i guess it soured her on men because ive never known her to take up with one since she worked for mias grandmother then her mother thats right lus kept the reins on mia as long as i can remember in fact thinking about it lus the only one mias let hold the reins for very long mia had a thing going with sam logan his family owns the hotel it didnt work out and he left the island jesus its been ten years maybe more oh i see sam logan nell thought the man mia had loved once sam and i hung out together some back when we were younger zack went on as he hollowed out the pumpkin weve lost touch but i remember that when sam and mia were seeing each other lulu watched him like a hawk he grinned remembering it then pulled the knife out of the heart of the pumpkin nell saw it gleam in the overhead light she saw it drip she saw as a rushing wind filled her head the blood that stained his shirt his hands and pooled like a red river on the floor at his feet she made no sound at all as she slid bonelessly from the chair hey hey hey come on nell come on back now his voice was dim as if they were both underwater something cool slid over her face she seemed to rise from fathoms deep slowly toward the surface as her eyes opened she saw a white mist that rolled away layer by gauzy layer until she saw his face zack in terror she grabbed at him yanking his shirt to check for wounds her fingers felt fat and fumbling hold on he might have laughed at the way she pulled at his buttons if her face hadnt been deathly white lie back down get your breath blood so much blood ssh his first reaction when shed fainted had been panic and hed dealt with it as he always did by doing what came next hed picked her up carried her to the couch and revived her now the penetrating fear she exuded tied knots in his belly i bet you havent eaten enough to keep a bird alive today have you somebody who cooks as much as you do should learn how to eat regular meals im going to get you a glass of water something to eat if youre not feeling steady then im calling the doctor im not sick im not hurt you were bleeding her hands shook as they ran over him there was blood all over your shirt your hands the floor the knife i saw im not bleeding honey not so much as a nick he lifted his hands turning them to prove it just a trick of the light thats all it wasnt she locked her arms around him held on ferociously i saw it dont touch the knife anymore dont touch it okay he kissed the top of her head stroked her hair i wont everythings all right nell she closed her hand around her locket ran a charm for protection through her head i want you to wear this steadier now she eased back and slipped the chain over her head all the time dont take it off he looked at the carved heart at the end of the chain and had a normal mans reaction i appreciate that nell really i do but thats a girl thing wear it under your shirt she said impatiently no one has to see it i want you to wear it night and day she looped it over his head even as he grimaced i want you to promise me you will anticipating his next protest nell framed his face with her hands it belonged to my mother its the only thing of hers i still have the only thing i brought away with me please do this for me zack promise me you wont take it off not for any reason all right ill promise that if you promise me youll eat something well have pumpkin soup youll like it that night while she slept she ran wildly through the woods unable to find her way in the dark of the moon the scent of blood and death chased her chapter sixteen contents prev next nell put it all out of her mind or tried to and went to work she served coffee and muffins joked with regulars she wore her new blue sweater and stirred the pumpkin soup she had simmering for the lunch crowd she replenished the stack of business cards mia had suggested that she put beside the cafés cash register it was all so normal almost breezy except she reached for the locket she no longer wore a dozen times through the morning each time she did the image of zack covered with blood flashed through her mind hed had to go to the mainland that morning and the idea of him being offisland was one more fear he could be attacked on the street mugged left to lie bleeding and dying by the end of her shift shed concluded she hadnt done enough and needed help she found mia helping a customer with a selection of childrens books she waited mentally wringing her hands until the choices were made and the customer headed to checkout i know youre busy but i need to talk to you all right let me get my jacket well take a walk she was back moments later with a suede jacket tossed over her short dress both were the color of butternut squash that made her hair glint like a mane of fire she waved at lulu as she walked out the front door taking my lunch break great sweater she added as they stepped outside lulus work isnt it yes youve jumped a hurdle she wouldnt have made you something that fine if she hadnt decided to accept you congratulations thanks i did you want to get some lunch no mia shook her hair back breathed deep there were times rare times when she felt locked inside the bookstore when she needed space desperately i want to walk ripley had been right about indian summer the cold snap had given way to balmy days of warmth and moist breezes that carried the scents of both sea and forest the sky was clouded up and against that dull pewter the trees rose like flaming beacons the ocean mirrored the sky and its kicky waves foretold a storm brewing itll rain within the hour mia predicted and look she gestured out to sea seconds later as if shed ordered it a pale jag of lightning cracked the steel mirror of sky storms coming i love a good storm the air goes electric and the energy of it pumps into your blood makes me restless though i want my cliffs in a storm mia slipped out of her lovely shoes hooked them on her fingers and stepped barefoot into the sand the beach is almost empty she pointed out its a good place to walk and for you to tell me whats troubling you i had a i dont know if it was a vision i dont know what it was it frightens me mia slid her free arm through nells and kept the pace easy tell me when she finished mia kept walking why did you give him your locket it was all i could think of an impulse the thing that mattered most to me i suppose you were wearing it when you died you brought it with you into your new life this symbol of where you came from this connection to your mother your talisman strong magic hell wear it because you asked him to and that makes it stronger yet its a locket mia something my father bought my mother for christmas one year its not particularly valuable you know better than that its value is its meaning to you and the love you have for your parents the love youve given to zack is it enough i dont see how it can be i know what it meant mia and this was the terror that stretched like a beast inside her in the vision his face was gray and the blood there was so much blood in the vision he was dead she made herself say it again he was dead isnt there something you can do shed already done all she could think of all she felt within her power what do you think i can do that you havent i dont know so much more was it a premonition is that what you believe yes yes even thinking of it stopped her breath it was so clear hes going to be killed and i dont know how what we see are possibilities potentials nell nothing is absolute nothing good or bad is guaranteed you were given this vision and you acted to protect isnt there a way to stop whoever will try to hurt him a spell spells arent a cure for every circumstance or shouldnt be and remember what you send out can come back to you or yours threefold attack one thing unleash another she didnt say what went through her mind stop the knife mia thought grimly and you may load a gun a storms coming she repeated and more than the lightning is going to slash through the sky this afternoon you know something i feel something i cant see it clearly perhaps its not for me to see that was a frustration this barrier and the knowledge that she so long a solitary witch couldnt do what needed to be done alone ill help you all i can that i can promise even as she worried it wouldnt be enough she saw ripley standing on the edge of the sand call ripley down shell come for you tell her what youve told me nell didnt have to call only to turn and look in her practical chinos and sensible boots ripley strode toward them youre going to get wet if you stay out here much longer thunder mia said and a dull rumbling of it rolled above the sea some lightning and it burst like a firewall toward the west but no rain for a half hour or so you forecasting the weather now glinda ripley said pleasantly you ought to get yourself a job on tv dont not now nell expected the sky to break open any second but she didnt care im worried about zack yeah me too ive got to worry when my brother starts wearing girlie jewelry but i have to thank you for giving me the opportunity to razz him did he tell you why hes wearing it no and i hesitate to repeat just what he did say to me in such polite company but it got our day off to a fine start i had a vision nell began oh perfect in disgust ripley started to turn away stopping when nell gripped her arm i like you nell but youre going to piss me off let her go nell shes afraid to listen im not afraid of anything and it burned her butt that mia knew exactly which button to push go ahead tell me what you saw in the crystal ball i wasnt looking at a crystal ball i was looking at zack nell said and told her no matter how hard she denied it how carelessly she shrugged ripley was shaken down to the toes zack can take care of himself she paced away and back again look in case you havent noticed hes a capable thoroughly trained officer of the law he carries a weapon and knows how to use it when and if he has to if he makes the job look easy its because he knows how to handle whatever comes along id trust him with my life i think nells asking if she can trust you with his ive got a badge ive got a weapon and a solid right cross thats how i handle things ripley said furiously if someone comes after zack you can bet your ass theyll have to go through me one times three ripley deliberately mia laid a hand on her arm in the end thats what itll take im not going to do it mia nodded they were standing in a circle under the angry sky you already are instinctively ripley stepped back broke the connection dont look for me she said not this way she turned her back on them and the rising wind and kicking at the sand she walked back to the village shell think about this and struggle with it as her heads made of granite its going to take longer than i like but for the first time in years shes wavering mia gave nell a comforting pat on the shoulder she wont risk zack they went back to the bookstore and had no sooner stepped inside when the rain fell in a torrent nell burned the candles in her trio of jackolanterns not just to decorate now but for their original purpose she set them on her porch to frighten away evil between the knowledge gleaned from the books mia had lent her and her own instincts she set about making her cottage as safe a haven as she could manage she swept away negative energy lit candles for tranquility and protection she laid red jasper and small pots of sage on the windowsills and moonstones and sprigs of rosemary under the pillows on her bed she made a pot of chicken soup it simmered while the rain lashed and her little cottage became a cozy cocoon but she couldnt relax in it she paced from window to window door to door she looked for busywork and couldnt find it she forced herself to sit in her office to complete a job proposal but after ten minutes she was up again her concentration as fractured as the lightningstruck sky giving up she called the station house surely zack was back from the mainland by now she would speak to him hear his voice then shed feel better but it was ripley who answered and told her in a voice as cold as a slap that zack hadnt returned that he would be back when he got back now her worry doubled the storm took on the proportions of a tempest for her the howl of the wind was no longer musical but full of teeth and threats the rain was a smothering curtain and the lightning a weapon hurled dark pressed against the windows as if it would break the glass and burst in the power shed learned to accept even to embrace began to waver like a candle flame under hot breath a thousand scenarios raced through her mind each more horrible than the last in the end unable to bear it she grabbed her jacket she would go down to the docks wait for the ferry will him to come she wrenched open the door in a blast of lightning in the blind dark that followed she saw the shadow move toward her she opened her mouth to scream then through the scent of rain and wet earth and the sting of ozone she caught the scent of her lover zack she leaped at him nearly sending the two of them tumbling off the stoop as he caught both her and his balance ive been so worried and now youre wet he carried her into the house i picked a hell of a day to go offisland bitch of a ferry ride back he set her on her feet then stripped off his soaking jacket idve called but i couldnt get my cell phone to connect thatll be the last ferry coming or going tonight in this weather he dragged a hand through his hair scattered rain youre soaked to the bone and because his shirt was wet she saw with relief the faint outline of the locket just above his heart and cold she added when she took his hand ive got to admit ive been dreaming about a hot shower the last half hour and would have had one by now he thought if ripley hadnt met him at the front door interrogated him then told him nell had called in a panic go take one now then you can have a bowl of hot soup definitely the best offer ive had all day he cupped her face in his hands im sorry you worried you shouldnt have now im not go on before you catch cold islanders are hardier stock than that but he kissed her lightly on the forehead and went straight for the shower he left his clothes in a sopping heap on the bathroom floor turned the spray on hot and let out a grateful sigh when he stepped in the little room and the tub in it hadnt been designed for a man of sixone the nozzle was aimed straight at his throat and if he wasnt careful he rapped his elbow against the wall whenever he moved his arms but hed developed a routine during the time hed been with nell bracing his hands on the front wall he bent over so the spray sluiced over his head and back since she tended to use fragrant and feminine soaps and shampoos hed casually placed some of his own on the ledge above the lip of the tub neither of them had mentioned these additions or the change of clothing hed left on the shelf of her closet they didnt talk about the fact that they rarely spent a night apart other people did he knew he saw the winks and was becoming accustomed to having his name and hers roll off peoples tongues together as if they were one word but they hadnt spoken of it maybe it was a kind of superstition he thought not to speak out loud what you were most afraid to lose or maybe it was just another kind of cowardice he wasnt sure it mattered but he was sure it was time to take another step forward hed taken one himself the biggest step hed ever taken on the mainland that afternoon he had to admit he felt good about it hed felt a little jittery but that had passed quickly enough even the hideous ride back from the mainland hadnt managed to dampen his mood the sounds on the other side of the curtain surprised him enough to make him move too quickly the rap of his elbow against the wall echoed in the little room and was followed viciously by a stream of curses are you all right torn between amusement and sympathy nell pressed her lips together tight and kept his wet bundle of clothes crammed against her chest he wrenched off the spray and whipped the curtain back this room is a hazard ive a good mind to check the code and what are you doing with those well i she broke off baffled when he all but leaped naked out of the tub and snatched them back from her i was just going to toss them in the dryer ill take care of it later ive got a change around here he dumped them on the floor again ignoring her wince as they hit with a wet plop behind him at least hang them up theyll just mildew lying in a pile like that okay okay he grabbed a towel ran it roughly over his hair did you just come in here to pick up after me actually yes now her gaze traveled down slowly over the damp chest where her locket glittered the flat belly the narrow hips he swagged in the towel but right at the moment im not thinking tidy is that so one look from her did more to warm his blood than an ocean of hot water what are you thinking im thinking the very best thing to do with a man who has just come in from a storm is tuck him into bed come with me he let her take his hand and draw him through to the bedroom are we going to play doctor because i think i could get really sick if it was worth my while she chuckled then tossed back the quilt in yes maam before he could twitch off the towel she did it for him but when he grabbed for her she evaded then gave him a nudge onto the bed you may know she began and picking up matches walked around the room lighting candles that in lore and legend witches often served as healers candlelight swayed and it shimmered im starting to feel really healthy ill be the judge of that im counting on it she turned to him do you know what ive never done for anyone no but im riveted she slowly lifted the hem of her sweater she remembered the day shed stood poised like this on the sunny back of his inlet i want you to watch me inch by inch she peeled the sweater up her body and want me if hed been struck blind he would have seen her skin glowing in delicate light she slipped out of her shoes in a kind of graceful dance her simple white bra cut low and sweet over the subtle curve of her breasts she lifted her hand to the center clasp watched his eyes follow the move then she deliberately left it fastened and trailed her fingertips down her midriff to the hook of her slacks his pulse began to thrum as the fabric slithered over her hips down her legs when it pooled at her feet she stepped out with that same fluid ease why dont you let me do the rest her lips curved and she stepped closer but not close enough shed never set out to seduce a man before and wasnt ready to surrender the power she could imagine his hands on her as she ran her own up her body as his breath rushed out of his lungs with that faint and knowing smile on her face she flicked open her bra let it slide away her breasts already felt full and tender she peeled the panties over her hips stepped free of them she was already wet i want to take you she whispered slowly i want you to take me she eased onto the bed on hands and knees to straddle him slowly she seemed to melt over him as if therell never be an end to it her lips were warm and soft on his seeking the taste of him slid through her system like a drug when he rolled to take more to deepen it she went with him but not in surrender she ran her fingertips lightly up and down his back finding pleasure in the ridge of muscle the ripple of it as she aroused him she let herself float on sensation as he gave her and took from her the gradual glide shed demanded candlelight shifted then the flames ran straight and true as spears and filled the air with fragrance they rose together danced on that scented air they knelt on the bed centered on it torso to torso and mouth to mouth if it was a spell hed have stayed bound eternally without question without struggle witch or woman a blend of both she was his he watched the way his hand looked against her skin dark to light rough to fragile the way her breasts could be cupped in his palms and how the tips hardened under the brush of his thumb they touched and tasted a brush a sip a lazy caress a long slow drink when at last he slipped inside her the gentle rise and fall was like waves of silk magic shimmered as they watched each other as for each for that moment no one else existed beat to beat with an intimacy that was more than mating that abounded past needs and outraced passion it welled in her heart overflowed in a spill like gold her lips curved again as he lowered his mouth to hers their hands joined fingers linking as they slid off the world together when she lay curled to his side her palm over the steady beat of his heart it seemed nothing could touch them her haven she thought was safe as they were safe inside it all of her fears and worries that creeping dread seemed foolish now they were simply a man and a woman in love lying in a warm bed and listening to the last of a storm pass overhead i wonder if ill ever learn how to manipulate objects honey you manipulate just fine he chuckled no she gave him a playful slap i mean moving things from one point to another if i could id chant the proper incantation and so on and wed have chicken soup in bed it doesnt work like that does it he asked i bet it does for mia if she wants it enough but for lowly students such as me it takes getting up going into the kitchen and doing it all the oldfashioned way she turned her head to give his shoulder a pecking kiss then rolled away why dont you stay here and ill get the soup she tossed a look over her shoulder as she walked to the closet for the robe shed finally gotten around to buying clever of you to suggest that after i was already up i thought so and since you caught me ill throw some clothes on and come out and give you a hand fine bring out that wet heap in the bathroom while youre at it wet heap it took him a minute to remember so she was already out of the room when he leaped out of bed and snatched up his sodden pants from the floor digging in the pocket he let out a breath as his fingers closed around a small box she had a round loaf of bread on a cutting board and was ladling up wide bowls of soup when he came in she looked so pretty so at home in her soft pink robe he thought her feet bare her hair a little mussed nell why dont we let that cool a minute well need to do you want some wine in a minute odd he thought hed be nervous at least a little instead he was rock calm he laid his hands on her shoulders turned her then ran them down to her elbows i love you nell i it was as far as she got before his lips silenced hers i thought of different ways to do this taking you for a drive one night or a walk on the beach next full moon or for a fancy dinner at the hotel but this is the right way for us the right place and the right time the little flutter in her stomach was a warning but she couldnt step back she couldnt move at all i thought of different ways to ask you what words might suit best and how i should say them but the only ones that come to me right now are i love you nell marry me the breath that she had been holding released as joy and grief waged a helpless war inside her zack weve been together such a short time we can wait a while to get married if you want though i dont see the point in it why cant we just leave things the way they are of all the reactions hed been expecting the hitch of fear in her voice hadnt been among them because we need a place of our own a life of our own not pieces of yours and mine marriage is just a legality thats all she turned away reached blindly into the cupboard for glasses for some people he said it quietly not for you or me were basic nell when basic people fall in love and mean it they get married start a family i want to share my life with you make children with you grow old with you tears threatened everything he said was what she wanted so deep in her heart that it was into her soul youre moving too fast i dont think so he took the box from his pocket i bought this today because weve already started our life together nell its time to see where it takes us her fingers curled into her palms as she looked down hed bought her a sapphire a rich warm stone set in a simple band of gold hed have known she would need warmth and simplicity evan had chosen a diamond a brilliant square in platinum that had sat on her finger like ice im sorry zack im so sorry i cant marry you he felt the slice through his heart but he never flinched as he watched her face do you love me nell yes then i deserve to know why you wont make a promise to me and take one from me youre right she struggled to steady herself i cant marry you zack because im already married nothing she could have said would have stunned him more married youre married for gods sake nell weve been together for months i know it wasnt just shock she saw now it wasnt just anger he stared at her as if she were a stranger i left him you see more than a year ago he struggled over the first hurdle the fact that shed been married and hadnt told him but he couldnt make it over the second that she was married still left him but didnt divorce him no i couldnt i and you let me touch you you slept with me let me fall in love with you knowing you werent free yes it was so cold suddenly so cold in the little kitchen that it penetrated her bones i dont have any excuses for it i wont ask when you were planning to tell me obviously you werent he closed the box with a snap jammed it back in his pocket i dont sleep with other mens wives nell a word from you one goddamn word from you and we wouldnt have gotten to this point i know its my fault as his anger grew hardened his face she felt the strength shed rebuilt draining away like the color in her cheeks you think that makes up for it he shot back as temper and misery careened inside him you think taking the blame for it cleans the fucking slate on this no goddamn it he spun away from her and caught the way she flinched at the move ill yell when i need to yell youre only making me madder standing there like youre waiting for a punch im not going to hit you not now not ever and its insulting for you to stand there wondering if i will you dont know what its like no i dont because you wont tell me he reined himself in as much as he could though temper was still sparking or you tell me just enough to keep things running smooth until the next time maybe thats true but i told you i couldnt tell you everything that i wasnt going to go into the details this isnt a damn detail youre still married to the man who did this to you yes are you planning on ending the marriage no well thats plain enough he snatched up his boots his jacket i cant let him find out where i am i cant let him find me he started to yank the door open then stood there a moment his hand on the knob did you ever stop and think just once did you ever stop and look at me and know id do whatever needed to be done for you id have done it nell for a stranger because its my job how could you not know id do it for you she did know she thought as he walked away from her it was only one of the things that frightened her unable to cry she sat miserably in the house she had made safe and empty chapter seventeen contents prev next ive lost him ive ruined it nell sat in mias great gorgeous cavern of a living room in front of an oxroasting fire sipping a cup of healing cinnamon tea isis stretched her lean warm body over her lap like a cozy blanket none of it lifted her mood damaged it perhaps and nothings lost that can be found again i cant fix this mia everything he said to me is true i didnt want to think about it to see it but its true i had no right to let things get as serious as they did i dont happen to have a hair shirt handy but i imagine we can make something up at nells shocked stare mia lifted one shoulder elegantly its not that i dont sympathize with both of you because i do but the fact is nell you fell in love both of you and both of you dealt with it the way you needed to deal with it you brought each other something that not everyone is given thats nothing to regret i dont regret loving him or being loved by him i regret a lot of things but not that all right then you need to take the next step there is no next step i cant marry zack because im legally tied to someone else and even if evan decides to divorce me in absentia or whatever i still couldnt marry zack my identification is false details not to him yes youre right she tapped her pretty fingernails on the side of her cup as she considered some things zack would see because hes zack as black and white im sorry i didnt think this far ahead and warn you of that i know him mia continued as she rose to stretch i didnt anticipate that hed move toward legal binding so quickly im jaded when it comes to love she poured more tea pondered while she roamed the room and sipped there were two sofas both in deep hunter green that begged for a body to sink down and sink in they were scattered with jeweltoned pillows all in soft fabrics texture was essential to luxury and when at leisure mia insisted on luxury the room was populated with antiques because she preferred the old to the new unless it was in business equipment the rugs on the wideplanked chestnut floor were satisfactorily faded there were flowers everywhere in priceless crystal or in cheerful colored bottles of no special value some of the candles she surrounded herself with in every room were lit the white ones for peace youve hurt him nell on two levels one by not falling into his arms in utter delight when he proposed she stopped lifting one brow i told you i was jaded in this area but nonetheless when a man asks a woman to marry him hes not going to be pleased when she says no thank you im not a complete idiot mia no darling im sorry contrite though secretly amused at the biting tone mia stopped behind the sofa and stroked nells hair of course youre not and i should have said three levels the second being his sense of honor he has just discovered himself poaching on what he would consider another mans territory oh really im not a damn rabbit zack would see himself breaking a code the third level is that he would certainly have done so anyway if hed known if youd told him the circumstances he could adjust his line there because he loves you and wants you and because he would be relieved that youd escaped from a horrible situation but the fact that you didnt tell him that you let him go into this let him fall in love with you blind is going to be hard for him to swallow why cant he see that my marriage to evan means nothing im not helen remington anymore do you want comfort or truth mia asked flatly i cant have both it may as well be truth you lied to him and by lying you put him in an untenable position more you told him you didnt intend to end the marriage i cant wait you wont end it and without an end there cant be a beginning this is purely your choice nell and no one can or should take it from you but youve blocked zack from being able to stand for you to stand with you or more to his liking i imagine to step in front of you and face your demon nell she sat again taking nells hands do you think he wears a badge for amusement for the pathetic pay for the power no but he doesnt understand what evan can do what hes capable of mia theres a madness inside him a kind of cold deliberate madness that i cant begin to explain people tend to think the word evil is overdramatic mia said when actually its extremely simple yes a few knots untangled she should have known by now that she didnt have to explain to mia and he doesnt understand that i cant bear the idea of seeing evan again of hearing his voice i think id break this time i think it would shatter me youre stronger than that nell shook her head he shrinks me i dont know if you can understand what i mean yes i do do you want a spell a charm to bolster yourself to shield yourself from one man so you can have the other mia reached over stroked isis along her sleek back the cat raised her head exchanged what seemed to be a telling look with her mistress then curled up there are things that can be done mia said briskly now to protect to center yourself to enhance your own energies but beneath it all nell the powers inside you for now she slipped the silver chain and its silver disk over her head you gave zack your talisman so ill give you one of mine it was my greatgrandmothers i cant take it from you on lend mia said slipping the chain over nells head she was a very canny witch my greatgrandmama married well made a killing on the stock market and kept it for which i continue to be grateful i wouldnt like being poor she acted as doctor on the island before we had one with a medical degree living here she treated warts delivered babies stitched up gashes and nursed half the population through a dangerous run of influenza among other things its lovely what does the carving mean its an old language similar to what was written on the ogham stones in ancient ireland it means courage and now that youre wearing my courage ill give you my advice sleep let him wrestle with his feelings while you examine your own when you go to him and as much as he loves you he wont come back to you be clear in your mind what it is you want and what youre willing to do for it youre being an asshole zack okay now will you shut up ripley considered never shutting up a sisters privilege listen i know she screwed up but dont you want to know why she slapped her hands on his desk leaning down so she could get in his face in a satisfactory manner dont you want to push dig maneuver until she tells you why shes still married she had plenty of time to tell me if she wanted to zack concentrated on his computer his business on the mainland hadnt just been buying a ring he had also testified in a court case now that it was done he could update his file ripley made a sound somewhere between a groan and a scream you make me crazy i dont know how you dont make yourself crazy youre in love with a married woman he spared her a withering glance that fact is very clear in my mind right about now go do your patrol look its obvious she doesnt want the other guy she ditched him also obvious is that shes moony about you and vice versa nells been here what five months and from all appearances shes digging in for the duration whatever came before is over shes legally married that doesnt spell over for me yeah yeah dudley doright the fact that she admired his code of honor didnt mean it couldnt exasperate her so let it ride for a while just let things go as theyve been going why the hell do you have to marry her anyway oh wait i forgot who im talking to but if you want my advice i dont i really dont fine stew in your own juice then she grabbed her jacket then immediately tossed it down again im sorry i cant stand to see you hurting because he knew that he gave up on pretending to update files rubbed his hands over his face i cant make a life with someone who has another life that she hasnt finished i cant take a woman to bed whos legally married to another man and i cant love someone the way i love nell and not want not expect marriage home and children i cant do those things rip no you cant she came to him then wrapping her arms around his neck from the back resting her chin on top of his head maybe i could though she couldnt imagine loving anyone enough to make the choice but i understand you cant what i dont understand is why if you love her and you want her you cant sit her down and make her explain it you deserve to know im not going to make her do anything not only because i dont work that way but because i have a feeling the man shes married to did plenty of making her zack ripley turned her head so that her cheek rested on his hair did it ever occur to you that shes afraid to divorce him yeah his stomach did a quick nasty pitch i came around to that about three oclock in the morning if its true ive got plenty of feelings to punch into that bag but it doesnt change what is shes married she didnt tell me she doesnt trust me enough to be there for her whatever it takes he reached up closed his hand around hers thats how nell saw them when she opened the door holding on to each other and she saw the beam of blame shoot out of ripleys eyes even as the shutters came down on zacks i need to speak with you alone please instinctively ripley tightened her grip but zack gave her hand a squeeze ripley was just heading out on patrol yeah sure toss me out just when its getting good she was shrugging into her jacket contemplating that this was what it felt like when people said you could cut the tension with a knife when betsy poked her head in the door sheriff hi nell ripley sheriff bill and ed sutter are starting to mix it up out in from of the hotel it looks like it could get messy ill take care of it no zack got up at ripleys statement well take care of it the sutter brothers vacillated between staunch family loyally and hating each other like poison since they were both bullheaded and built like the same animal he thought it best not to let ripley get into a twoonone situation he gave nell a brief glance as he walked outside youll have to wait so cold she thought rubbing her arms it was hard to accept ice from a man who had such warmth he wasnt going to make this easy oddly enough even after the worst of it the evening before shed convinced herself that he would he would let her talk he would sympathize understand hold her standing alone in the station house nell watched that little fantasy crack in two and disappear here she was swallowing her pride risking her peace of mind and wellbeing and all he could do was spare her a single icy look well then maybe she should just let bad enough alone stung she pulled open the door two steps out and she could not only see the commotion up the street she could hear it freezing in place she hugged herself and watched it play out one big man with shortcropped hair bellyslammed another big man with shortcropped hair curses were flying an interested crowd was gathering at a safe distance and some of them appeared to be taking sides by hooting and calling out names zack and ripley were already wading in muscling the men apart nell couldnt hear what they were saying but while it quieted the crowd it didnt appear to have much impact on the sutter brothers they were all but snapping at each others faces nell cringed closed in when she saw the first fist strike there was a lot of shouting now and she heard it like the pounding of the surf a lot of motion that seemed lost in a fast blur zack had one mans arm ripley the others both had their handcuffs out bumping shoving curses and clipped warnings then one brother swung viciously at the other missed his mark and plowed his fist into zacks face she watched zacks head snap back heard the crowd gasp as one voice everyone went so still it seemed like a film stopped in a freezeframe she was already rushing across the street as motion and voices started again well goddamn it ed youre under arrest zack snapped the cuffs in place as ripley did the same and for good measure the same goes for you bill couple of hotheaded peckerbrains you people go on about your business now he ordered as he muscled ed around he caught sight of nell standing on the sidewalk like a deer caught in the headlights and cursed again come on sheriff you know i wasnt aiming at you doesnt matter a damn to me who you were aiming at not when he tasted blood in his mouth you just assaulted an officer he started it like hell bill shot back as ripley walked him briskly along but im sure as hell going to finish it when i get the chance you and what army just shut up ripley ordered couple of fortyyearold delinquents eds the one who punched him whatre you hauling me in for youre a damn public nuisance if the two of you want to butt heads do it in the privacy of one of your homes and keep it off the streets youre not going to put us in jail calmer now as he saw his fate ed turned his head to appeal come on now zack you know my wifell skin me if you lock me up it was just family business after all not when its on my street and not when it involves my goddamn face his jaw throbbed like a bitch he marched ed straight into the station house and back to one of the two tiny holding cells youre going to have some time to cool off before i get around to calling your wife whether she cares enough to come down and make your bail is up to her same goes ripley told bill cheerfully as she uncuffed him and nudged him into a cell once the cell doors were shut and locked she dusted her hands ill write up the report i type slower than you do ill call the wives too though i suspect theyll hear about this before i even start on the paperwork yeah disgusted zack swiped the back of his hand over his mouth and smeared blood youre going to want some ice on that jaw lip too ed sutlers got a fist the size of idaho hey nell why dont you take our hero to your place and give him some ice unaware that shed come in zack turned slowly and stared at nell as she stood in the open doorway yes all right theres ice in the back i can take care of it youd be better off putting some distance between yourself and ed ripley advised until youre sure youre not going to unlock that cell and punch him back maybe his eyes werent cold anymore nell noted they were hot green glass she moistened her lips icell help keep the swelling down and some rosemary tea might help the ache fine great his head was already ringing why not finish it off twohundredandfiftydollar fine for both of them he snapped at ripley or twenty days they dont like the sound of that fill out a formal arrest warrant and they can deal with the court yes sir ripley beamed as zack stalked out wasnt this great she thought the whole thing had really brightened her mood they walked to the cottage in silence nell no longer knew what to say or how to say it this furiously angry man was every bit as much a stranger as the icy cold one had been there was no doubt in her mind that he didnt particularly want to deal with her right now she knew just how long it could take to regain equilibrium after a blow to the face still hed taken a fist at short range and other than the head and temper snap hed had little reaction people were always saying someone was tougher than he looked it seemed to be true about zachariah todd she opened the cottage door and still saying nothing walked back to the kitchen and began to make an ice pack out of a plastic bag wrapped in a thin cloth appreciate it ill get the dishcloth back to you shed already lifted the kettle to make tea she blinked at him where are you going to walk off what i can of this mad seeing no choice she set the kettle down again ill go with you you dont want to be with me right now and i dont want to be with you it was quite a discovery to learn that there were times a slap was preferable to words that cant be helped we have things to talk about and the longer its put off the harder itll be she opened the kitchen door waited lets try the woods we can consider it neutral territory he hadnt bothered with a jacket and the rain that had swept in the night before had left cool temperatures in its wake he didnt seem to mind she glanced up at him as they headed into her little wedge of forest that ice isnt going to do any good if you dont use it he pressed it to his aching jaw and felt mildly ridiculous in the summer when i came here i wondered what it would be like to walk through the trees in autumn with all the color and the first bites of cold id missed the cold the change of seasons when i lived in california she let out a little breath drew one in i lived in california for three years los angeles primarily though we spent a lot of time in the house in monterey i preferred it there but i learned not to let him know that or hed have found ways to cancel trips north he liked to find little ways to punish me you married him i did he was handsome and romantic and clever and rich i thought why here comes my prince and well live happily ever after i was dazzled and flattered and in love he worked very hard to make me fall in love with him theres no point in going into all the details youve guessed some of them anyway he was cruel in little ways in big ones he made me feel small small smaller smallest until i all but disappeared when he hit me the first time it was a shock no one had ever hit me before i shouldve left right that minute or tried he would never have let me but i shouldve tried but id only been married a few months and somehow he made me feel id deserved it for being stupid or clumsy or forgetful for all manner of things he trained me like a dog im not proud of that did you get help it was so quiet in the woods she could hear in that quiet every step she and zack took over the ground already strewn with fallen leaves not at first i knew about abuse intellectually id read articles stories but that didnt apply to me i wasnt part of that cycle id come from a good stable home id married an intelligent successful man i lived in a big beautiful house i had servants she slipped a hand into her pocket shed made a magic bag for courage and had tied it with seven careful knots letting her fingers worry it helped calm her nerves it was just that i kept making mistakes that was all i thought that once i learned everything would be fine again but it only got worse and i couldnt keep deluding myself one night he dragged me upstairs by my hair i had long hair then she explained i thought he would kill me i thought he would beat me and rape me then kill me he didnt he didnt do any of those things but i realized he could have and i wouldnt have been able to stop him i went to the police but hes an influential man he has connections i had a few bruises but nothing major they didnt do anything knowing that burned a hole through him they should have they shouldve taken you to a shelter as far as they were concerned i was a rich spoiled trophy wife causing trouble it doesnt matter she said wearily they could have taken me anywhere hed have found me i ran once and he found me and i paid for it he made it clear to me he made sure i understood one vital point i belonged to him and i would never get away wherever i went hed find me he loved me it sent a violent chill through her to say it she stopped turned to face zack his version of love beyond rules beyond bounds selfish cold and obsessive and powerful he would see me dead before hed let me go thats not an exaggeration i believe you but you got away because he thinks im dead she told him her voice clear and empty of emotion what she had done to break the chains jesus christ nell he threw the ice bag to the ground its a miracle you didnt kill yourself either way i was getting away i was coming here i believe completely believe that the minute that car went over the cliff i started coming here and to you because he wanted too strongly to touch her and wasnt yet sure if it would be a caress or a furious shake he jammed his hands in his pockets i had a right to know when things changed between us i had a right to know i didnt expect things to change between us but they damn well did and if you didnt know where we were heading then you are stupid im not stupid her voice took on an edge maybe i was wrong but im not stupid i didnt expect to fall in love with you i didnt want to fall in love with you or even get involved with you you pursued me it doesnt make any difference how it happened the fact is it did you know where you stood and why but you didnt let me know im a liar she said evenly im a cheat im a bitch but dont you ever call me stupid again jesus christ at his wits end he stalked away lifted his gaze to the sky i wont be demeaned not by anyone not ever again i wont be belittled and i wont be brushed aside until its convenient for you to pay attention again curious he turned his head stared at her is that what you think this is im telling you how it is i did a lot of thinking since you walked out of the house yesterday im not going to whimper and slide into the corner just because youre annoyed with me that insults both of us well three cheers oh go to hell he turned completely around and stepped toward her the dread curled in her stomach her palms went clammy but she stood her ground its a hell of a time to pick a fight with me especially when youre wrong im only wrong if im standing where you are standing here i did what i had to do i wish i hadnt hurt you but i cant go back and change that no you cant so we go from here did you leave out anything else i should know the woman who drove off that cliff was named helen remington mrs evan remington i dont answer to that name anymore its not who i am remington he said it softly she could all but see him flipping through some mental data file hollywood type thats right you got about as far away from that as you could manage thats right too ill never go back ive found the life i want here with or without me for the first time since shed begun her story her stomach clutched thats up to you no its not you already know what i want now its what you want i want you you know that then you have to finish what you started you have to end it file for divorce i cant havent you heard anything ive said every word and more that you didnt say part of him wanted to soothe her to draw her close shelter her to tell her none of it mattered now but it did you cant live your whole life wondering looking over your shoulder or pretending three years away neither can i for one thing its going to start eating at you and for another the worlds a small place youll never be sure he wont find you if he does or if youre afraid he has are you going to run again its been more than a year since i left he cant find me if he thinks im dead youll never be sure you have to end it but you dont have to end it alone i wont let him touch you this isnt his turf he said lifting her face with a finger under her chin its mine youre underestimating him i dont think so i know im not underestimating myself or ripley or mia or a lot of people on the island who would go out of their way for you i dont know if i can do what youre asking for more than a year ive focused on doing everything i could to make certain he doesnt find out im alive he doesnt find out where i am i dont know if ive got it in me to step out again i need to think i need you to give me time to think all right tell me what you decide he stooped to get the ice bag the ice was mostly melted as he didnt care a great deal about the pain in his jaw he opened it spilled out the contents if you dont want to marry me nell ill accept that but after you think all this through i need you to tell me what you decide there too i love you i dont have to think that through he stared at her standing in the quiet woods where the leaves rioted color and the air still carried the faintest scent of yesterdays rain he held out a hand for hers ill walk you home chapter eighteen contents prev next ripley gave zack her most pitiful look and whined she saved up her whines to add to the impact when she whipped one out but i dont wanna go to mias living with her for nearly thirty years made him immune to such tactics though he had to give her big points for delivery when you were a kid you practically lived at mias then now see the difference why cant you go because i have a penis ill restrain myself and not ask if you see the difference be a pal rip she spun in a circle her version of drumming her heels on the floor if nells going to be hanging out at mias tonight then mia can keep an eye on her jesus zack dont be such a mommy the asshole in la doesnt even know shes alive yet if im being overprotective well just all have to live with it i dont want her driving to the cliffs alone at night the thought of her car flying over cliffs three thousand miles away left a ball of ice in his gut until this thing is resolved i want to keep an eye on her so keep your eye on her youre the ones trying to decide if youre going to be longsuffering starcrossed lovers or ward and june cleaver he let the insult pass as it was her way of starting a pissing match so she could storm out and get out of doing what he asked ill never figure how it is i know more about women than you do when youre of the same species watch it slick he supposed he hadnt let the insult pass after all she doesnt need me hovering over her she doesnt need a man even such a sterling example of manhood as myself crowding her shes got tough decisions to make im trying to keep a little distance without making an issue of keeping a little distance until shes made them gee you sure do think a lot the simple fact was he was putting her in a hell of a pinch he wanted her to keep an eye on nell and ripley wanted to keep an eye on zack she hadnt had an easy moment in the two days since hed told her nells story blood on the moon she thought nells vision of zack covered with blood a sociopathic potentially homicidal husband and ripleys own disturbing dreams she hated knowing she was dipping into omen territory but hell it didnt bode well what are you going to be doing while im babysitting the love of your life at witch central there was something else hed learned in nearly thirty years of knowing her he could always count on ripley taking both our evening patrols buying some takeout and going home to a lonely dinner if you think that makes me feel sorry for you think again id trade places with you in a heartbeat she walked to the door ill go by nells tell her i want to tag along tonight i want you to watch your back excuse me i dont want to talk about it im just saying ill watch my back and buy some beer you drank the last bottle she slammed the door because just because mia set out fresh charms every day it seemed the air got a little heavier as if something was dragging it down she glanced outside it was already dark there was so much night at the end of october so many hours until dawn there were things it wasnt wise to speak of at night or even think night could be an open window she burned incense of sage to counter negativity fastened on earrings of amethyst to strengthen her intuition shed been tempted to slip some rosemary under her pillow to help chase away her troubled dreams but she needed to see needed to look she added jasper to the chain around her neck a strengthener of energy a reliever of stress it was the first time in years she could recall being so constantly hounded by stress tonight wasnt the time for it she reminded herself she was going to take nell to the next step and such things should be joyful she fingered the magic bag in her pocket filled with crystals and herbs and as shed taught nell tied with seven knots she detested being so edgy as if waiting and waiting for disaster to strike foolish really when shed been preparing for disaster and how to divert it all her life she heard the car saw the streak of lights slash across her front windows as she walked to the door she visualized pouring the stress into a small silver box locking it so she appeared to be her usual calm self as she opened the door until she saw ripley slumming deputy didnt have anything better to do she was surprised to see mia in a long black dress mia rarely wore black the one thing ripley had to admit the woman wasnt often obvious special occasion as it happens i dont have any objections to you being here if nell wants you but dont interfere you dont interest me enough to interfere is this argument going to take long nell asked pleasantly i was hoping for a glass of wine i think were done come in and welcome well take the wine with us with us where are we going to the circle youve brought what i told you yes nell patted the large leather pouch she wore good ill get what i need then well go ripley wandered around freely enough while mia got ready she had always liked the cliff house loved it the big crowded rooms the odd corners the thick carved doors and glossy floors shed have gotten by happily enough with one room and a cot but she had to admit mias place had style and class as far as atmosphere went you couldnt top it class style and atmosphere aside it was always comfortable a place where you knew you could sink into a chair and put your feet up a place she recalled where she had once run as free and as welcome as a pet puppy it was a hell of a note to realize all at once how much shed missed it missed it all you still use the gable room ripley asked casually while mia selected a red wine from the rack when mia glanced back their eyes met shared memories yes some of your things are still there she said as she wrapped three glasses in white linen i dont want them theyre still there in any case since youre here you can carry this bag she gestured then picked up the second that held the wine and glasses she opened the back door and isis streaked through it surprised nell as the cat generally couldnt be bothered to join them its a special night mia threw up the hood of the cloak she swirled over her shoulders black again with a lining of deep winered she knows it its nearly samhain nell needs to practice lighting the balefire ripleys head snapped up moving a little fast arent you mia merely studied the moon as they walked it was down to a thumbnail and would soon be full dark around that sliver of white she could see a haze blacker thicker than the sky no annoyed that mia had made her uneasy yet again ripley shrugged halloween lifting the dead the night boils with evil spirits and only the brave or foolish walk in the dark nonsense mia said lightly and theres no point in taking that route to try to scare nell the end of the third and last harvest of the year nell breathed deep of the night a time for remembering the dead for celebrating the eternal cycle also the night when the veil between life and death is said to be its thinnest hardly a negative time but one of reaffirmation and fun and of course mias birthday the big threeoh this time too said ripley dont be so smug there was a little bite in mias voice a not entirely playful nip youll be hitting it yourself in six weeks yeah but youll always be older than me isis was already in the clearing sitting still as a sphinx in the center we have some candles for working light you can put them on the stones ripley and light them no she shoved her hands very deliberately into the pockets of her bomber jacket carting your bag of tricks is one thing i wont participate oh for pity sakes youll hardly spoil your magic celibacy by lighting one or two candles but mia snatched the bag from her and stalked to the stones ill do it nell insisted theres no point in either of you being angry when youre each doing what you want why are you so angry ripley kept her voice down crouched as mia came back to select what she needed from her bags i usually have to work a lot harder to get under your skin maybe my skins thinner these days you look tired i am tired somethings coming its pushing and pushing closer i dont know how much longer i can hold it back or even if im meant to therell be blood she gripped ripleys wrist held her still and pain terror and grief and im afraid that without the circle therell be death if youre so sure of this afraid of this why havent you sent for someone you know others its not for others and you know it she glanced back toward nell maybe shes strong enough mia straightened tossed back her hood nell well cast the circle whatever shed expected to feel ripley hadnt expected the yearning that ribboned through her as she watched the basic ritual as the familiar words echoed in her head shed given it up she reminded herself shed set it aside she watched wand and athame glimmer she had always preferred the sword her mouth pursed in consideration as mia lit candles with a wooden match even as she opened her mouth to speak to question mia sent her a quieting look fine your way as usual ripley thought and kept her comments to herself earth wind fire water elements hear this call from your daughters while the moon above does ride within the magic circle rise with her head thrown back and her arms raised mia waited and the wind lifted all but sang the candle flames speared rulerstraight despite the swirl of humming air under her feet the earth trembled lightly and in her cauldron fragrant liquid began to bubble as mia lowered her arms again each subsided nell had yet to get her breath back over the past months shed seen and done and been told the fantastic but until tonight she hadnt been treated to such a vivid display power awaits mia told her and held out a hand when nell clasped it she found mias skin warm nearly hot it waits in you your link is air and calling to it comes most easily to you but there are four tonight youll make fire the balefire yes but we didnt bring wood with a little chuckle mia stepped back we wont need it center yourself clear your mind this fire does not burn this fire does no harm it lights the dark and glows from charm when you make its golden tower you will know your strength and power and once begun bring harm to none its too soon for her ripley said from outside the circle quiet youre not to interfere look at me nell you can trust me and yourself watch and see hold on to your hats ripley muttered and stepped a bit further back just in case mia opened her hands empty hands spread her fingers turning them over she held her arms out as if reaching there was a spark electric blue then another then a dozen then too many to count they sizzled like fire on water turned the air within the circle to deep sapphire and there where the bare ground had been rose a bright and gilded pillar of flame nells legs simply folded until her butt hit the ground with a solid thump nothing that was going through her mind had she been able to capture any of the scattered pieces of her thoughts could have made its way out of her mouth told you ripley sighed shook her head quiet mia spun away from the fire held out a hand to help nell to her feet youve seen me do magic before little sister youve done magic yourself not like that its a basic skill basic mia really you made fire out of nothing what she means is its along the lines of losing your virginity its kind of a jolt ripley said helpfully it might be less pleasurable than you expect the first time around but after a while you get better at it close enough mia agreed now center yourself nell you know how clear your mind visualize gather the power make your fire i cant possibly mia cut her off with a lifted hand how do you know unless you try concentrate she stepped behind nell laid her hands on nells shoulders theres light inside you and heat energy you know it bring it together feel it its like a tingling in the belly and it rises toward the heart it spreads up fills you gently she put her hands under nells arms lifting them it runs under your skin like a river flows down your arms to your fingertips let it come its time while they worked ripley watched there was something lovely about it in a strange way something like watching mia balance nell on her first twowheeler offering encouragement keeping pace building confidence the first time wasnt easy on student or teacher she knew nells face was sheened with the sweat of effort the muscles in her arms trembled the clearing never completely silent seemed to vibrate the air here never completely still sighed there was a faint and fitful spark when nell would have leaped back mia was there holding her in place her quiet and steady encouragement like a chant another spark stronger ripley watched mia step back leaving her little sister wobbling on two wheels solo despising the weakness ripley felt tears pure sentiment gather in her eyes and a little spurt of pride as nells fire shimmered to life for the first time since shed begun nell felt the beat of her own heart the rise and fall of her own chest power bright as silver pumped through her blood its better than losing your virginity its beautiful and bright she whispered nothing will ever be the same for me again she turned full of joy but mia was no longer looking at her but at ripley we need three furious ripley refused to let the tears fall you wont get the third from me mia had seen the tears and understood them she also understood ripley very well to nell she said she probably cant do it anymore dont tell me what i cant do ripley piped up itd be hard for her to find that out especially after watching you do so well after such a short time and stop talking like im not here i hate that why are you here mia asked with annoyance nell and i can make the third together which had been mias plan before shed seen ripley at the door we certainly dont need you and your pathetic rusty attempts she was never as good as me she said to nell it always infuriated her that what came so easily to me was such an effort for her i was every bit as good as you hardly better ah mia thought ripley never could turn down a challenge prove it weakened by sentiment stirred by longing and bristling with the dare ripley stepped into the circle no nell thought she swaggered she didnt hold out her arms as mia had but seemed to throw them and the fire that burst from their tips onto the ground the minute she did she hissed like a snake you did that on purpose perhaps but so did you and look here the sky did not fall you made the choice ripley i couldnt have pushed you into it unless youd wanted it this doesnt change anything its one time only if you say so but you might as well have some wine while youre here mia studied the trio of flames as she picked up the bottle ripleys was bigger than hers a result of temper but not mia thought with satisfaction nearly as elegant and pouring the wine she felt a fire inside herself that was hope they had another glass when they returned to mias house restless now ripley wandered from window to window jingling the change in her pocket mia ignored her for as long as shed known her ripley had never been a quiet soul and at the moment mia understood there was a considerably testy war going on inside of her have you decided how youre going to handle your situation with zack nell glanced up at her she sat on the floor mesmerized by the fire no part of me hopes that evan will divorce me take it out of my hands and the rest of me knows thats not the core of the problem if you dont stand up to bullies they tromp all over you nell admired ripley strong wiry and ready she thought knowing that and acting on it are two different things evan would never have taken a piece out of someone like you ripley lifted a shoulder so take it back she will when shes ready mia countered you of all people should know that its impossible to push one persons beliefs ideas or standards on another or to erase someone elses fear shes upset with me because i hurt zack i cant blame you hes a big boy ripley shrugged then sat on the arm of the couch what are you going to do about him zack that is in the meantime do yeah do are you just going to let him slide through his brooding phase which is what comes after the pissedoff phase with him and let me tell you is a lot harder to live with i figure weve gotten to be pals more or less since youve been here do a pal a favor and snap him out of it before i have to smother him in his sleep weve talked i dont mean talk i mean action is she really that much of a sweetie ripley asked mia apparently ripley in her own delicate way is suggesting that you lure zack back to bed and soothe away your troubles with a bout or two of hot jungle sex which is her answer to all manner of pesky annoyances including hangnails bite me mias given up sex which explains why shes such a bitch i havent given it up im simply more selective than a cat in heat it isnt about sex making the statement making it firm and fast was nells only solution to fending off another argument ripley snorted yeah sure right mia sighed it pains me more than i can say to agree with ripley even partially certainly your relationship with zack isnt as all of ripleys are based on sex but its a vital part of it an expression of your feelings a celebration of them and your intimacy you can put flowers on it its still sex ripley gestured with her glass however highminded zack is hes still a guy being around you and not getting laid ripley please not having intimacy she said in a prissy tone after mias reprimand is going to make him edgy if hes going to deal with your la asshole he should be in top form hes been very careful to keep me at a distance in that area then close the distance in that area ripley said simply heres what we do you drop me off at your place ill bunk there tonight you go over to the house and take care of business youve been hanging out with him long enough to know what buttons to push thats sneaky deceitful and manipulative ripley cocked her head at nell whats your point despite herself nell laughed maybe i will go over to talk she added whatever you want to call it ripley polished off her wine maybe you could take these glasses and things back into the kitchen get your stuff together sure she rose began to gather the glasses ill just be a minute take your time mia waited until nell was out of the room it wont take her long so say what you didnt want to say in front of her what i did tonight doesnt change anything thats redundant just shut up she paced again shed opened herself only for a short time but thats all that had been needed shed felt that heaviness in the air the pressure okay troubles coming im not going to pretend i dont feel it and im not going to pretend i havent tried to figure a way to deal with it maybe i could but i wont bet zack on it im going to sign up for this mia she turned back but just for this mia didnt rub it in in fact it didnt occur to her to do so well light the balefires at midnight on samhain eve well meet at ten on the sabbat zack already wears nells talisman but id protect your house if i were you do you remember how i know what to do ripley snapped once this passes things go back the way they were this is yes i know mia retorted a onetimeonly zack had given up on paperwork given up on his telescope and pretty much given up on the idea that he could will himself to sleep he was trying to bore himself to sleep now by reading one of ripleys gun magazines lucy was sprawled beside the bed in a deep sleep that he envied every now and then her legs would twitch as she chased dream gulls or swam in her dream inlet but she lifted her head one sharp motion let out a soft warning woof seconds before zack heard the front door open relax girl its just ripley at the sound of the name lucy was up and scrambling for the door where she stood wagging her entire body forget it its too late to play the knock on the bedroom door had lucy barking joyfully and zack cursing what lucy whipped herself into happy circles as the door opened then she leaped enthusiastically on nell zack shot up in bed lucy down sorry i thought it was rip he nearly threw back the covers then remembered he was buck naked is something wrong no nothing she bent over to pet lucy wondering which of them was more embarrassed and decided it was a tie i just wanted to see you talk to you he peeked at the clock noted it was coming onto midnight why dont you go downstairs ill be right there no he wasnt going to treat her like a guest this is fine she came over sat on the side of the bed he still wore the locket and that meant something i made fire tonight he studied her face okay no she laughed a little and scratched lucys head i made it not with wood and a match with magic oh there was a tickling inside his chest i dont know what im supposed to say to that congratulations or wow it made me feel strong and excited and complete i wanted to tell you it made me feel something like i do when im with you when you touch me you dont want to touch me because i have a legal tie to someone else it doesnt stop the want nell she nodded let the relief of that come you wont touch me because i have a legal tie to someone else but the fact is zack the only man i have a real tie to is you when i ran i told myself i would never tie myself to another man never risk that again then there was you i have magic in me she lifted a hand fisted to her heart and its amazing and thrilling and sweet still its nothing nothing zack to what i have in me for you any defense any rational reason he may have had quite simply crumbled nell i miss you just being with you im not asking you to make love with me i was going to i was going to try to seduce you he skimmed his fingers through her hair what changed your mind i dont want to ever lie to you again even in a harmless way and i wont use one set of your feelings against another set i just want to be with you zack just be dont tell me to go he drew her down until her head was cradled on his shoulder and he felt her long long sigh of contentment echo his own chapter nineteen contents prev next it wasnt easy for an important successful man to get away by himself for a few days it was a complicated and tedious business to reschedule meetings postpone appointments inform clients alert staff there was a whole world of people dependent upon him more tedious yet was making travel arrangements personally rather than using the services of an assistant but after careful thought evan decided there was nothing else to be done no one was to know where he was or what he was doing not his staff not his clients not the press naturally he could be reached via cell phone if there was a crisis of any sort otherwise until hed done what he set out to do he would remain incommunicado he had to know he hadnt been able to get the information his sister had so casually passed on to him out of his mind helens double helens ghost helen he would wake up at night in a cold sweat from images of helen his helen walking along some picturesque beach alive laughing at him giving herself to any man who crooked his finger it couldnt be borne the terrible grief hed felt upon her death was turning slowly inexorably into a cold and killing rage had she tricked him had she somehow planned and executed the faking of her own death he hadnt thought her smart enough certainly not brave enough to try to leave him much less succeed she knew the consequences he had made them perfectly clear till death do us part obviously she couldnt have done so alone shed had help a man a lover a woman especially a woman like helen could never have devised such a scheme on her own how many times had she sneaked off to lie with some wifestealing bastard working out the details of her deception laughing and fucking plotting and planning oh there would be payment made he could calm himself again continue about his business and his life without an outward ripple he could nearly convince himself again that pamelas claims were nonsense she was after all a woman and women by nature were given to flights of fancy and foolishness ghosts didnt exist and there was only one helen remington the helen who had been meant for him but at times in that big glamorous house in beverly hills he thought he heard ghosts whispering or caught the bright sound of his dead wifes taunting laughter what if she wasnt dead he had to know he had to be careful and clever ferrys loading his eyes pale as water blinked i beg your pardon the ferry worker stopped blowing on his takeout cup of coffee and instinctively stepped back from that blank stare it was he would think later like staring into an empty sea ferrys loading he repeated youre going to three sisters aint ya yes the smile that spread over the handsome face was worse than the eyes yes i am according to legend the one known as air had left her island to go with the man who promised to love her to care for her and when hed broken those promises and turned her life into a misery she had done nothing shed borne children in sorrow raised them in fear had bowed and had broken had died her last act had been to send her children back to the sisters for protection but she had done nothing even with her powers to protect or save herself so the first link in the chain of a curse was forged nell thought of the story again of the choices and mistakes and of destiny she kept it clear in her head as she walked down the street of what had become her home what she intended to keep as her home when she walked in zack was delivering a blistering lecture to a young boy she didnt recognize automatically she started to step out again but zack merely held up a finger and never broke rhythm youre not only going straight over to mrs demearas and clean up every last scrap of pumpkin guts and apologize for being a moron but youre going to pay a fine for possession of illegal explosives and willful destruction of property five hundred dollars five hundred dollars the boy thirteen at the outside nell calculated lifted a head that had been sunk low jeez sheriff todd i aint got five hundred dollars my moms going to kill me as is zack merely raised his eyebrows and looked merciless did i say i was finished no sir the boy mumbled and went back to looking so hangdog that nell wanted to go pat his head you can work off the fine by cleaning the station house twice a week three dollars an hour three but itll take me the boy had smartened up enough to shut up yes sir you werent finished his lips wanted to twitch but zack kept them in a firm hard line ive got some odd chores around my place too saturdays and oh zack thought that one stung there was no crueler fate than being imprisoned by chores on a saturday same rate you can start there this saturday and in here monday after school if i hear youre in any more trouble like this your mothers going to have to stand in line to skin you clear yes uncle zack um i mean yes sir sheriff beat it he beat it nearly spinning the air into a funnel as he raced past nell uncle zack second cousins really its an honorary term what did he do to earn the hard labor stuck an ash can thats a firecracker in his history teachers pumpkin it was a damn big pumpkin too blew that shit all over hell and back again now youre sounding proud of him he pokered up as best he could youre mistaken idiot boy couldve blown his fingers off which is what i nearly did at about the same age when i blew my science teachers pumpkin to hell and back which is beside the point especially when well be in for similar halloween pranks tomorrow if i dont make an example now i think you did the job she walked over sat down have you got time for another matter sheriff i could probably carve out time it surprised him that she hadnt leaned over to kiss him and that she sat so straight so still so solemn whats the matter im going to need some help and some advice on the law i suppose ive generated false identification and ive put false information on official forms signing them with a name that isnt legally mine i think faking my own death is illegal too at least there must be something about life insurance fraud there were probably policies he didnt take his eyes off hers i think a lawyer would be able to handle that for you and that when all facts are known therell be no charges brought what are you telling me nell i want to marry you i want to live my life with you and make those children with you to do that i have to end this so i will i need to know what im going to have to do and if ill have to go to jail youre not going to jail do you think id let that happen its not up to you zack the false papers and so on arent going to put anyones sense of justice up the fact is hed given this angle a great deal of thought the fact is nell once you tell the story youre going to be a hero no im no ones hero do you know the statistics on spousal abuse he pulled open his bottom drawer took out a file and dropped it on his desk ive put some data together on it you might want to have a look at it sometime it was different for me its different for everybody every time the fact that you came from a good home and you lived in a big fancy house doesnt change anything a lot of people who think its different for them or that theres nothing they can do to change their situation are going to look at you hear what you did some of them might take a step they might not have taken because of you that makes you a hero diane mccoy it still bothers you that you couldnt help her that she wouldnt let you help her there are a lot of diane mccoys out there she nodded all right but even if public sentiment falls on my side there are still legalities well handle them one at a time as far as the insurance theyll get their money back well pay it back if we have to well do what we have to do together when she heard that a weight lifted i dont know where to start he rose came around to her crouched at her feet i want you to do this for me thats selfish but i cant help it but i want you to do it for yourself too be sure ill be nell todd ill have a name i want she saw his expression alter the deepening of emotion in his gaze and knew she had never been more sure of anything im afraid of him and i cant help that either but i think i realize ill never stop until this is done i want to live with you i want to sit out on the porch at night and look at the stars i want that beautiful ring you bought me on my finger i want so many things with you i thought id never have im scared and i want to stop being scared i know a lawyer in boston well call him and well start okay she let out a breath okay theres one thing i can take care of right now he straightened walked over and opened a drawer in his desk her heart gave a lovely little flutter when she saw the box in his hand ive been carting this around with me putting it in here or in my dresser at home lets put it where it belongs she got to her feet held out her hand yes lets her stomach was jumping when she left to walk back to the bookstore but there was anticipation tangled with the nerves and every time she looked down at the deep blue stone on her finger anticipation won she walked in sent a wave to lulu and practically floated upstairs to mias office i need to tell you mia turned from her keyboard all right i could spoil your moment by saying congratulations and i know youll be very happy together but i wont you saw my ring little sister i saw your face however jaded she considered herself about love the sight of it warmed her heart but i want to see the ring she leaped up snatched nells left hand a sapphire she couldnt stop the sigh its a love gift as a ring it sends out healing and can also be used as protection against evil beyond all that its a doozy she kissed nell on either cheek im happy for you we talked to a lawyer someone zack knows in boston my lawyer now hes going to help me with the complications and with the divorce hes going to file a restraining order against evan i know its only a piece of paper its a symbol theres power in that yeah in a day or two once hes got everything in place hell contact evan so hell know with or without a restraining order hell come mia i know he will you may be right was this what shed been feeling the dread the building of pressure the last leaves had died and the first snow had yet to fall but youre prepared and youre not alone zack and ripley will meet every ferry that comes here after hes been contacted if you dont plan to move in with zack right away then youll stay with me tomorrows the sabbat ripleys agreed to participate when the circles joined he cant break it that i can promise you she intended to tell ripley next if she could find her but the minute nell stepped outside she was stricken with a wave of nausea that rolled thick and greasy through her belly she staggered a little sweat popping out on her skin with no choice she leaned back against the wall of the building and waited for it to pass when the worst of it eased she regulated her breathing the jitters she told herself everything was going to start happening now and happening very fast thered be no turning back there would be questions and press and stares murmurs even from people shed come to know it was natural to be a little queasy she looked down at her ring again the hopeful glint of it and the lingering dregs of sickness passed she would find ripley later she decided right now she was going to buy a bottle of champagne and the makings for a good yankee pot roast evan drove off the ferry and onto three sisters as nell leaned weakly against the wall of the bookstore he surveyed the docks disinterested the beach unimpressed following the instructions hed been given he drove to high street and pulled up in front of the magick inn a holeinthewall in a town suitable for middleclass currier and ives buffs he judged he got out of the car studied the street just as nell turned the corner into the market he walked inside and checked in hed booked a suite but found no charm in the coffered ceilings the lovingly preserved antiques he detested the fussiness of such rooms preferring the streamlined the modern the art if one could call it that ran to misty watercolors and seascapes the minibar didnt hold his favored brand of mineral water and the view he could see nothing but beach and water noisy gulls and what he supposed were fishing boats run by locals dissatisfied he walked to the parlor from there he could see the curve of the land and the sudden sharp jut of cliffs where the lighthouse stood he noted the stone house as well and wondered what type of idiot would choose to live in such an isolated spot then he found himself squinting there seemed to be some sort of light dappling through the trees a trick of the eye he decided already bored in any case he had hardly come for the scenery thank the lord hed come to look for helen or to satisfy himself that what was left of her was still at the bottom of the pacific on an island this size he was sure he could get the task done in a day he unpacked meticulously hanging his clothes so that each garment was aligned precisely one inch from the next he set out his toiletries including his triplemilled soap he never used the amenities offered in hotels even the idea of it revolted him and last he set the framed photograph of his wife on the bureau he leaned over kissed the curved bow of her mouth through the glass if youre here darling helen ill find you on his way out he made a reservation for dinner the only meal he found acceptable to eat in a hotel room was breakfast he stepped out turned left just as nell with her two bags of groceries swung around the end of the block to the right toward home it was nell was sure the happiest morning of her life the sky was silver with sweeps and rises of rose and gold and deep red her lawn was carpeted with leaves that would crunch merrily underfoot and had left the trees bare and spooky which was perfect for an island halloween she had a man sleeping in her bed who had shown his appreciation for a good pot roast in a very satisfactory way muffins were baking the wind was shivering and she was prepared to face her demons she would be leaving her little cottage behind soon and that she would miss but the idea of setting up housekeeping with zack made up for it they would spend christmas together she thought maybe even be married by then if all the legal tangles could be unraveled she wanted to be married outside in the air it was impractical but it was what she wanted she would wear a long dress of velvet blue velvet and carry a spray of white flowers the people she had come to know would all be there to bear witness while she daydreamed the cat meowed piteously diego she bent down stroked him he was no kitten now but a sleek young cat i forgot to feed you im very scattered of brain today she told him im in love and im getting married youll come to live with us in our house by the sea and make friends with lucy she got out his kibble filling his bowl while he wound excitedly through her legs a woman who talks to her cat could be considered strange nell didnt jump which pleased both of them instead she rose and walked to zack who stood in the doorway he might be my familiar but im told thatll be up to him good morning sheriff todd good morning ms channing can i buy a cup of coffee and a muffin payment first he came to her wrapped her up in a long deep kiss that do it oh yeah just let me give you your change she drew him down again lingered over the taste of him im so happy at precisely eightthirty evan sat down to a breakfast of sweetened coffee fresh orange juice an eggwhite omelette and two slices of whole wheat toast hed already made use of the hotel health club such as it was he had only glanced at the pool he disliked using public swimming pools but had considered it until hed seen it was already being used a long lean brunette was streaking through the water as if she was in a race hed thought hed only caught glimpses of her face as she turned it rhythmically in and out of the water in time with her strokes and he didnt see as he dismissed her and walked away her sudden loss of pace the way she pulled up in the water as if gathering for attack how she shoved her goggles treading water as she looked around for what had felt like an enemy hed showered in his room dressed in a pale gray sweater and dark slacks he glanced at his watch ready to be annoyed if his meal should be above one minute late but it arrived just as requested he didnt chat with the waiter he never did such foolish things the man was paid to deliver food not to fraternize with guests he enjoyed his breakfast surprised that he could find no fault with it as he read the morning paper and listened to the news on the parlor television he considered how best to do what hed come to do walking through the village as hed done yesterday driving around the island as he planned to do today might not be enough still it wouldnt do to ask people if they knew anyone of helens description people never minded their own business and there would be questions speculation attention if by some chance helen was alive and here the less attention paid to him the better if she were what would she do she had no skills how could she earn a living without him to provide for her unless of course shed used her body to entice yet another man women were at the center whores he had to sit back and wait for the fury to pass it was difficult to think in logical steps through anger however justified he would find her he reassured himself if she was alive he would find her he would simply know and that took him to what would be done when and if he did there was no question that she would have to be punished for distressing him for deceiving him for attempting to break free of the promises shed made to him the inconvenience the embarrassment of it all couldnt be calculated he would take her back to california of course but not right away they would need to go somewhere quiet somewhere private first so he could remind her of those promises so he could remind her who was in charge they would say shed been thrown from the car that shed struck her head or some such thing shed had amnesia and had wandered away from the scene of the accident the press would love it evan decided they would eat it up they would work out the details of the story once they were settled in that private quiet place if none of that was possible if she tried to refuse him to run again to go crying to the police as shed done before he would have to kill her he made the decision as coolly as he had decided what to have for breakfast her choices were just as simple in his opinion live or die at the knock on his door evan folded the paper precisely walked over to answer good morning sir the young maid said cheerfully you requested housekeeping service between nine and ten thats right he checked his watch noted it was ninethirty he had lingered over his thoughts longer than hed planned i hope youre enjoying your stay would you like me to start in the bedroom yes he sat with his last cup of coffee watched a report on a fresh hot spot in eastern europe that couldnt have interested him less it was too early to call the coast and see if there was anything he needed to know but he could call new york he had a deal cooking there and it wouldnt hurt to stir the pot he went into the bedroom to retrieve his memo book and found the maid her arms full of fresh linen staring at the framed photograph of helen is there a problem what she flushed no sir im sorry she moved quickly to make the bed you were looking at this photograph very intently why is that shes a lovely woman his voice was sending skitters up her spine she wanted to get the suite clean and get out yes she is my wife helen the way you looked at the photograph i thought perhaps you might have met her at some time or other oh no sir i doubt it its just that she reminded me of someone he had to consciously stop his teeth from grinding oh she really looks a lot like nell except nell doesnt have all that beautiful hair or that look of i dont know polish i guess youd say really his blood began to sizzle but he kept his voice mild now almost friendly thats interesting my wife would be fascinated to know theres a woman who looks that much like her nell helens mother had called her nell a simple inelegant name he had always disliked it does she live on the island this nell oh sure shes lived here since early summer in the yellow cottage runs the café at the bookstore does catering too cooks like a dream you should try the café for lunch theres a soupandsandwich special every day and you cant beat it i might do that he said very softly nell strolled through the back door of café book called out a casual greeting to lulu then continued upstairs once she was there she moved like lightning just under two minutes later she called down in a voice she tried to infuse with frustrated apology mia im sorry but could you come up here a minute ought to be able to set up on her own by now lulu mumbled and earned a slanted look from the boss you ought to be able to give her a break by now mia returned and started upstairs nell stood by one of the café tables where a pretty frosted cake glittered under the lighted birthday candles also on the table were a small wrapped box and three flutes frothy with mimosas happy birthday the sweetness of the gesture made up for being caught off guard as she rarely was mias smile bloomed absolute delight thank you cake she lifted a brow as she picked up a flute mimosas and presents it almost makes it worth turning thirty thirty coming up behind her lulu snorted still a baby when you hit fifty well talk she held out another wrapped box a larger one happy birthday thanks well what first wish first nell ordered and blow out the candles it had been a long time since shed made anything as simple as a wish but she did so now then swept her breath over the candles you have to cut the first piece nell handed her a cake knife all right then i want my presents mia cut then picked up the large box and tore in the throw was soft as water the color of midnight sky scattered over it were the symbols of the zodiac oh lu its fabulous keep you warm its beautiful nell stroked the throw i tried to imagine it when lulu described it but its so much more thank you mia turned rubbed her cheek over lulus before kissing it though pleased color pinched lulus cheeks she waved mia away go on open nells before she bursts its just that they made me think of you nell began as mia set the throw aside to open the little box inside were earrings a dangle of silver stars twinkling against tiny globes of moonstone theyre wonderful mia held them up to the light before she kissed nell and perfect particularly today she added holding out her arms she was wearing black again but the sleek sweep of the dress was picked out in tiny silver stars and moons i couldnt resist it for halloween and now these she made quick work of slipping off the earrings shed put on that morning and replacing them with nells just top it off okay then lulu raised her glass to hitting the big threeoh oh lulu dont spoil it but mia laughed as she clicked glasses i want cake she lifted her little silver watch that dangled from one of her chains were going to open just a few minutes late today it wasnt difficult to find the yellow cottage evan drove past it slowing his car to study the small house tucked among the trees little better than a shack was his opinion and the insult of it nearly choked him she would live in that hovel rather than in the beautiful homes hed provided for her he had to fight the urge to go to the café to drag her out and into the street public scenes he reminded himself were not the way to deal with a deceitful wife such things required privacy he drove back to the village parked his car then went back on foot his blood was already bubbling careful study showed him that none of the neighboring houses were close enough to worry him still he strolled into the trees first circled around stood in their shadows watching the house when nothing moved nothing stirred he crossed to the back door there was a wave of something something strong and fretful it seemed to push against him as if to bar him from the door for a moment it laid what might have been fear over his skin and he actually found himself stepping back off the stoop fury bubbled burned away that fear while the stars hanging from the eaves chimed madly in a sudden gust of wind he shoved through what seemed like a wall of solid air and gripped the doorknob she didnt even lock the house he thought in disgust as he let himself in see how careless she was how foolish he saw the cat and nearly snarled he detested animals filthy creatures they stared at each other for one long moment then diego streaked away evan scanned the kitchen then began to walk through the cottage he wanted to see how his dead wife had been living this past year he could hardly wait to see her again chapter twenty contents prev she started to head home half a dozen times that afternoon but there was so much fun in the village most of the merchants had decked themselves out in costumes to celebrate the day there were demons selling hardware and fairies ringing up produce she had a late lunch with ripley and an impromptu meeting with dorcas about catering a christmas party and it seemed that every second person she passed stopped her to congratulate her on her engagement she belonged to the village she thought to zack and finally finally she belonged to herself she swung by the station house to make a date with zack to hand out the goody bags shed already made up for the ghosts and goblins expected at dusk i might be a little late have to run herd on some of the older kids zack told her ive already dealt with a couple of teenagers who tried to convince me the twelve rolls of toilet paper they were buying were for their mothers how did you get the toilet paper for rolling houses when you were a kid i stole it out of the bathroom closet at home like anyone with half a brain her dimples deepened any more exploding pumpkins no i think the word got out on that he cocked his head you sure look chipper today i am chipper today she stepped forward wrapped her arms around his neck hed just gotten his arms around her when his phone rang hold that thought he told her and answered sheriffs office yeah mrs stubens hmm he stopped lowering his hip to the corner of the desk and stood straight again is anybody hurt good no just stay right there im on my way nancy stubens he told nell as he strode over to the coat rack for his jacket teaching her boy how to drive he ran straight into the bigelows parked honda civic but is he all right yeah ill just go sort things out for them it might take a while that honda was brandnew you know where to find me she walked out with him felt a nice steady glow when he leaned down to kiss her goodbye then they walked in opposite directions shed gone half a block when gladys macey hailed her nell hold on puffing a little at the effort to catch up gladys patted her heart let me see that ring im hearing so much about before nell could offer her hand gladys was grabbing it bending over close to get a good long look should have known that todd boy would do a good job she gave a nod of approval then looked up at nell you got a winner there and i dont mean the ring i know it i watched him grow up once he got some man on him if you know what i mean i used to wonder what sort of woman would catch his fancy i like knowing its you ive got a fondness for you mrs macey undone nell hugged her thank you youll be good for him she patted nells back and hell be good for you i know youve had some troubles she simply nodded as nell drew back you had something in your eyes when you came here its not there much anymore i left all that behind im happy it shows have you set the date no not yet nell thought of lawyers of conflict of evan she would deal with it she told herself with all of it as soon as we can i want a frontrow seat at the wedding youll have one and all the champagne you can drink at our thirtieth anniversary party ill hold you to it well ive got to get on monstersll come knocking at the door before long and i dont want my windows soaped you tell that man of yours i said he did well i will that man of hers nell thought as she began to walk again what a wonderful phrase she quickened her steps she was going to have to hurry to beat dusk she went to the front of the cottage glancing around a bit selfconsciously secure that she was alone in the lowering light she held her arms out toward her jackolanterns breathed in focused it took some work a hard slap of effort and a match would certainly have been quicker but it wouldnt have given her the same rush as watching the candles spurt flame and the pumpkins glow from the fire in her mind boy she let out her breath on a quick laugh boy oh boy that was so cool it wasnt just the magic she decided it was the knowing who and what she was it was finding her strength her purpose and her heart taking back control so that she could share it with a man who believed in her whatever happened tomorrow or a year from tomorrow she was now and always nell she danced up the steps and into the front door diego im home you wouldnt believe the day ive had absolutely the best day she twirled into the kitchen flipping on the light she put on the kettle for tea before beginning to fill a big wicker basket with her goody bags i hope we get a lot of kids its been years since ive done trick or treat i cant wait she opened a cupboard oh for heavens sake i left my car at the bookstore what was i thinking you always were absentminded the mug she reached for slipped like water out of her hand smashed on the counter shattered on the floor a roaring filled her ears as she turned hello helen evan walked slowly toward her its so good to see you she couldnt say his name could make no sound at all she prayed it was another vision a hallucination but he reached out and those slender fingers brushed her cheek she went cold to the marrow ive missed you did you think i wouldnt come those fingers slid around the back of her neck now and brought on a hideous wave of nausea wouldnt find you havent i told you helen so many times that nothing would ever keep us apart she only closed her eyes when he bent brushed his mouth over hers what have you done to your hair his hand fisted it tugged viciously you know how i love your hair did you cut it off to displease me a tear slithered down her cheek as she shook her head his voice his touch seemed to drain everything she was away and leave her as shed been she felt nell fading away it does displease me helen youve caused me a great deal of trouble a great deal youve stolen a year of our lives his fingers tightened went biting cruel as he jerked her chin up look at me you stupid little bitch look at me when i speak to you her eyes opened and all she could see were his those clear empty pools youll have to pay for it you know that more than a year erased and all the while youve been living in this miserable little shack laughing at me working as a waitress serving people trying to start your pitiful little business kitchen business humiliating me his hand slid from her cheek to her throat squeezed im going to forgive you after a time helen after a time because i know youre slow and just a bit stupid have you nothing to say to me my love nothing to say after this long separation her lips were cold felt as if they might crack how did you find me he smiled then and made her shudder i told you id always find you wherever you went whatever you did he gave her a hard shove that jammed her back into the counter the pain registered in kind of an absent way like a memory do you know what i found here in your little nest helen helen my whore mens clothing how many men have you slept with slut the kettle began to shriek but neither of them heard did you find yourself some strapping local fisherman let him put his fumbling workingmans hands all over you all over what belongs to me zack it was her first clear thought clear enough that her swimming eyes registered bright fear theres no fisherman she said and barely cried out when he slapped her liar you know how i detest liars theres no the tears escaped at the next slap but it snapped her back to who she was she was nell channing and she would fight keep away from me keep away she grabbed for the knife block but he was quicker hed always been quicker is this what you want he drew the long jaggededged blade free turned it in the light an inch from her nose she braced herself she thought so hell kill me after all instead he reared back smashing the side of her face with a vicious backhanded slap that sent her flying she crashed into the table striking her head against the edge of the thick wood the world went bright went dark she didnt feel her body hit the floor mia treated a young space explorer the bookstore was one of the most popular spots on halloween she had dancing skeletons grinning pumpkins flying ghosts and of course a coven of witches her usual store music had been replaced with howls and shrieks and rattling chains she was having the time of her life she served a cowboy ghoul a cup of punch from a cauldron as the dry ice packed beneath it sent out curls of smoke his eyes were huge as he watched her are you gonna ride on your broomstick tonight of course she bent down what kind of a witch would i be otherwise the witch who chased dorothy was a bad witch she was a very bad witch mia agreed i happen to be a very good one she was ugly and had a green face youre pretty he giggled and slurped his punch thank you very much you on the other hand are very scary she handed him a bag of candy i hope you wont trick me huhuh thanks lady he dropped the bag in his begging sack then ran off to find his mother amused mia started to straighten the pain came fast bright like a spear of light through the temple she saw a man with pale eyes and bright hair and the gleam of the blade call zack she rushed to the door calling out to a startled lulu theres trouble nells in trouble call zack she raced into the street swung around a group of costumed children and nearly plowed into ripley nell i know it ripleys head was still ringing we have to hurry she came to slowly her vision fractured her head screaming there was absolute silence she rolled moaning and managed to get to her hands and knees nausea sent her curling into a ball again the kitchen was dark now lit only by the faint glow of a candle in the center of the table he sat there in one of her kitchen chairs she could see his shoes the gleam of them the perfect crease in his slacks and she wanted to weep why do you make me punish you helen i can only think you must enjoy it he nudged her with his shoe is that it she started to crawl away just a moment she prayed give me one moment to breathe and i can find my strength again he simply pressed his foot into her back were going to go somewhere where we can be alone where we can discuss all this foolishness all this trouble youve caused me he frowned a little how was he to get her away he hadnt meant to put marks on her not where they could be noticed she had pushed him to it well walk to my car he decided youll wait there for me while i pack and check out she shook her head she knew it was useless but she shook her head then began to cry quietly when she felt diego brush against her legs youll do exactly as i say he tapped the tip of the knife against the table if you dont youll leave me no choice people already believe youre dead helen beliefs can easily become reality his head snapped up as he heard a sound outside the door perhaps the fishermans come calling he whispered and rose turning the knife in his hand zack opened the door hesitating cursing as the phone on his belt rang the break in stride saved his life he caught a blur of movement a glimpse of the blade hacking down he twisted going for his weapon with a crossbody draw the knife ripped through his shoulder instead of burying itself in his heart nell screamed gained her feet only to have her head spin and send her staggering in the dark kitchen she could see the two silhouettes struggle a weapon she thought biting her lip to keep from passing out again the bastard would not take what was hers he would not harm what she loved she stumbled for the knife block but it was gone she turned back prepared to leap to use teeth and nails and saw evan standing over zacks body the knife dripping in his hand oh my god no no your knight in shining armor helen is this the man youve been fucking behind my back hes not dead yet i have a right to kill him for trying to steal my wife dont she drew in a breath released it struggled to gather herself and find her core of strength ill go with you ill do anything you want you will anyway evan commanded he doesnt matter she began to edge around the counter saw diego crouched teeth bared he doesnt matter to either of us its me you want isnt it you came all this way for me he would go after her if she could get out the door hed go after her and leave zack it took all her will to keep herself from throwing herself down over zack to shield him if she did if she so much as looked at him now they were both dead i knew you would she continued every muscle trembling as she watched evan lower the knife to his side i always knew evan took one step toward her and the cat leaped like a tiger on his back with his howl of rage in her ears nell ran she veered toward the street toward the village but even as she glanced back he was coming through the door she would never make it so it would be the two of them after all putting her faith in the fates she dived into the trees zack pulled himself to his knees as evan bolted out the door the pain was like hot teeth gnawing at his shoulder blood dripped from his fingers as he got to his feet then he thought of nell and forgot the pain he was flying out the door just as the trees swallowed her and the man who pursued her zack he paused only to flick a terrified glance at his sister and mia hes after her hes got a knife and she doesnt have much lead ripley bit down on the worry his shirt was soaked with blood she nodded drew her weapon as he did whatever youve got she said to mia we use she plunged into the woods behind her brother in the dark of the moon the night was blind she ran like a wild thing tearing through brush leaping over fallen branches if she could lose him get him deep enough in and lose him she could circle back to zack she prayed with every beat of her heart that he was alive she could hear evan behind her close too close her breath was coming in gasps tattered by fear but his was a steady determined beat dizziness swept over her urged her to drop to her knees she fought it off nearly stumbled she would not lose now then his body slammed into hers and sent her sprawling she rolled kicked her only thought to get free of him then froze when he yanked her head back by her short cap of hair and pressed the knife tip to her throat her body emptied went limp as a dolls why dont you just do it she said wearily just end it you ran from me there was as much bafflement as rage in his voice you ran and ill keep running until you kill me ill keep running id rather be dead than live with you ive already died once so do it ive stopped being afraid of you she felt the blade bite at the sound of running feet he dragged her up even with a knife at her throat she felt joy when she saw zack alive the dark stain on his shirt glimmered in the faint starlight but he was alive and nothing mattered more let her go zack took his stance supporting his gun hand with his weak one drop the knife and step away from her ill slit her throat shes mine and i wont hesitate evans eyes passed from zacks to ripleys to mias as they stood in a half circle hurt her and youre dead you wont walk away from here youve no right to interfere between a husband and wife there was something almost reasonable in his voice something sane under the madness helen is my wife legally morally eternally he jerked her head back another inch with the blade throw your guns down and walk away this is my business i cant get a clear shot ripley said under her breath not enough light to be sure its not the way put the gun down ripley mia stretched out her hand the hell with that her finger itched on the trigger the bastard was all she could think as she saw nells exposed throat smelled her brothers blood ripley mia said again soft insistent under the sharp clipped orders from zack to drop the knife to step away damn it damn it you better be right zack didnt hear them theyd ceased to exist for him his only reality was nell ill do more than kill you zack held the gun rock steady and his voice was calm as a lake if you cut her so much as nick her ill take you apart piece by piece ill put bullets in your knees in your balls in your gut ill stand over you and watch while you bleed out the color that rage brought to evans face drained away he believed what he saw in zacks eyes believed the pain and death he saw there and was afraid his hands trembled on the handle of the knife but he didnt move she belongs to me ripleys hand gripped mias nell felt the punch of energy they created felt the hot waves of love and terror that rolled off zack as he stood bleeding for her and felt as she had never felt fear from the man who gripped her her name was nell channing now and always and the man behind her was less than nothing she closed her hand over the pendant mia had given her it vibrated i belong to myself power trickled back into her a slow pool i belong to me and faster and to you she said her eyes locked on zacks hes done hurting me now she lifted her other hand laid it on evans wrist lightly let me go evan and youll walk away well put all of this behind us its your chance the last chance his breath hissed at her ear you stupid bitch do you think ill ever let you go and your choice there was pity in her voice your last the chant was in her head rising as if it had only been waiting for her to free it she wondered how she could have been so afraid of him what youve done to all and me turns back to you one times three from you this night ill forever be free as i will so mote it be her skin glowed like sunlight her pupils dark as stars the knife trembled whispered along her skin away then fell she heard the choking gasp the high whine that couldnt reach a scream as evan collapsed behind her she didnt spare him a glance dont shoot him she said quietly to zack dont kill him like this it wouldnt be good for you because she could see the intent she walked to zack as evan began to moan it wouldnt be good for us hes nothing now she laid a hand over zacks heart felt its wild beat hes what he made himself evan lay on the ground twitching as if something vile slithered under his skin his face was bone white zack lowered the gun wrapped his good arm around nell he held her there a moment as she reached out clasping hands with mia and linking them all stay with them zack told her ill deal with him i wont kill him hell suffer more if he lives ripley watched her brother walk toward the writhing man take out his handcuffs he needed to do this last thing she thought and she needed to let him he gets two minutes to secure and mirandize that smear of slime then i want him taken to the clinic i dont know how bad hes hurt ill take him nell looked down at the blood zacks blood on her hand curled her fist over it and felt life pump ill stay with him courage mia reached out touched the pendant breaks the spell love weaves another she pulled nell into her arms for a fierce hug you did well little sister she turned toward ripley and you found your fate early on the feast of the saints long after the balefires were charmed away before dawn broke the sky nell sat in the kitchen of the yellow cottage her hand resting loosely in zacks she needed to come back to be there to tidy away what had happened and what might have happened shed swept away the negative forces that had lingered and had lit candles and incense i wish youd stayed overnight at the clinic she turned her hand under zacks squeezed i could say the same ive got a few stitches youve got the concussion mild she reminded him and twentythree stitches is more than a few twentythree stitches he thought a long nasty gash the doctor had called it a miracle that no muscle or tendons had been severed zack called it magic nells magic she reached out to touch the fresh white bandage then trailed her fingers over the gold locket you didnt take it off you asked me not to it got hot he told her and brought her gaze back to his an instant before he cut me i could see in my head in that quick blur the blade going toward my heart then being deflected as if it hit a shield i thought i imagined it but i didnt we were stronger than he was nell brought their joined hands to her cheek i was afraid drowning in fear from the minute i heard his voice it took away everything id built everything id learned about myself he paralyzed me sucked out my will that was his power over me but it began to come back and when he hurt you it flooded back but i couldnt think not clearly hitting my head was part of it i suppose you ran to save me and you followed to save me were a couple of heroes he touched her face gently there were bruises on it that he felt throb in his own hes never going to hurt you again ill go in and relieve ripley at dawn and contact the prosecutors office on the mainland a couple of attemptedmurder charges will keep him locked up no matter how fancy his lawyers are im not afraid of him anymore he looked pathetic in the end eaten up by his own cruelty terrified of it his madness is staring back at him now hell never be able to hide it again he could still see evan remingtons colorless eyes wide and wild in a face white as bone a padded rooms as good as a cell she got to her feet to pour more tea but when she came back to the table zack wrapped an arm around her pressed his face into her body its going to take a while for me to get the picture of you with a knife to your throat out of my head she stroked his hair we have a lifetime to put others in its place i want to marry you sheriff todd i want to start that lifetime very soon she slid into his lap sighing as she rested her head on his good shoulder through the window she could see the first streaks of color announcing dawn the pale burn across the sky laying a hand on his heart she timed its beats to her own and knew the truest magic was there turn the page for a preview of heaven and earth the second book in nora robertas three sisters island trilogy hedidnt look so very different from the other passengers on the ferry his long black coat flapped in the wind his hair an ordinary sort of dark blond flew around his face and had no particular style hed remembered to shave and had only nicked himself twice just under the strong line of his jaw his face and it was a good one was hidden behind one of his cameras as he snapped pictures of the island using a long lens his skin still held the tropical tan hed picked up in borneo against it his eyes were the luminous golden brown of honey just bottled his nose was straight and narrow his face a bit thin the hollows in his cheeks tended to deepen when he lost himself in work for long periods and forgot regular meals it gave him an intriguing starvingscholar look his mouth smiled easily sensually he was somewhat tall somewhat lanky and somewhat clumsy he had to grip the rail to keep a shudder of the ferry from pitching him over it hed been leaning out too far of course he knew that but anticipation often made him forget the reality of the moment he steadied himself again dipped into his coat pocket for a stick of gum he came out with an ancient lemon drop a couple of crumpled sheets of notepaper a ticket stub which baffled him as he couldnt quite remember when hed last been to the movies and a lens cap hed thought hed lost he made do with the lemon drop and watched the island hed consulted with a shaman in arizona visited a man who claimed to be a vampire in the mountains of hungary been cursed by a brujo after a regrettable incident in mexico hed lived among ghosts in a cottage in cornwall and had documented the rights and rituals of a necromancer in romania for nearly twelve years macallister booke had studied recorded and witnessed the impossible hed interviewed witches ghosts lycanthropes alien abductees and psychics ninetyeight percent of them were delusional or con artists but the remaining two percent well that kept him going he didnt just believe in the extraordinary hed made it his lifes work the idea of spending the next few months on a chunk of land that legend claimed had been torn from the mainland of massachusetts by a trio of witches and settled as a sanctuary was fascinating to him hed researched three sisters island extensively and had dug up every scrap of information he could find on mia devlin the current island witch she hadnt promised him an interview or access to any of her work but he hoped to persuade her a man who had talked himself into a ceremony held by neodruids should be able to convince a solitary witch to let him watch her work a few spells besides he imagined they could make a trade he had something he was sure would interest her and anyone else who was tied into the threehundredyearold curse he lifted his camera again adjusting the framing to capture the spear of the white lighthouse the brooding ramble of the old stone house both clinging to the high cliffs he knew mia lived there high above the village close to the thick slice of forest just as he knew she owned the village bookstore and ran it successfully a practical witch who by all appearances knew how to live and live well in both worlds he could hardly wait to meet her facetoface the blast of the horn warned him to prepare for docking he walked back to his land rover put his camera in its case on the passenger seat the lens cap in his pocket was once again forgotten while he had these last few minutes to himself he updated some notes then added to the days journal entry the ferry ride was pleasant the days clear and cold i was able to take a number of pictures from different vantage points though ill need to rent a boat for views of the windward side of the island geographically topographically theres nothing unusual about three sisters island its area is approximately nine square miles and its yearround inhabitants largely in the fishing or the retail and tourist trade number less than three thousand it has a small sand beach numerous inlets coves and shale beaches it is partially forested and the indigenous fauna include whitetail deer rabbit raccoon typical seabirds for this area as well as owls hawks and palliated woodpeckers in the forested regions there is one village the majority of the residents live in the village proper or within a halfmile radius though there are some houses and rental units farther afield there is nothing about the islands appearance that would indicate it is a source of paranormal activity but ive found that appearances are unreliable documentary tools im eager to meet mia devlin and begin my study he felt the slight bump of the ferrys docking but didnt look up docked three sisters island january glanced at his watch pm est the village streets were storybook tidy the traffic light mac drove through circled logging various spots on his tape recorder he could find an ancient mayan ruin in the jungle with a map scribbled on a crushed napkin but he had a habit of forgetting more pedestrian locations bank post office market ah pizzeria hot damn he found a parking place without trouble only a stop down from café book he liked the look of the place immediately the display window the view of the sea he fished around for his briefcase tossed the minirecorder inside just in case and climbed out he liked the look of the store even more on the inside the cheerful fire in a stone hearth the big checkout counter carved with moons and stars seventeenth century he decided and suitable for a museum mia devlin had taste as well as talent he started to cross to it and the little gnomelike woman sitting on a high stool behind it a movement a flash of color caught his attention mia stepped out of the stacks and smiled good afternoon can i help you his first clear thought was wow im ah hmm im looking for ms devlin mia devlin and youve found her she walked toward him held out a hand macallister booke yeah her hand was long and narrow rings sparkled on it like jewels on white silk he was afraid to squeeze too hard welcome to three sisters why dont you come upstairs ill buy you a cup of coffee or perhaps some lunch were very proud of our café ah i wouldnt mind some lunch ive heard good things about your café perfect i hope your trip in was uneventful up till now he thought it was fine thanks he followed her up the stairs i like your store so do i i hope youll make use of it during your stay on the island this is my friend and the artist of our café nell todd nell dr booke nice to meet you she showed her dimples and leaned over the counter to shake his hand dr booke has just arrived from the mainland and i imagine he could use some lunch on the house dr booke just tell nell what youd like ill take the sandwich special and a large cappuccino thanks do you do the baking too thats right i recommend the apple brown betty today ill try it mia nell asked just a cup of the soup and the jasmine tea coming up ill bring your orders out i can see im not going to have to worry about my next meal while im here mac commented as they took a window table nell also owns and runs sisters catering she delivers good to know he blinked twice but her face the sheer glory of it didnt dim okay i just have to get this out and i hope youre not offended youre the most beautiful woman ive ever seen in my life thank you she sat back and im not the least bit offended good i dont want things to start off on the wrong foot since im hoping to work with you and as i explained over the phone i dont work for audiences im hoping youll change your mind after you get to know me better he had a potent smile she decided charmingly crooked deceptively harmless well see about that as for your interest in the island itself and its history you wont lack for data the majority of the permanent residents here are from families whove lived on sisters for generations todd for instance he said glancing back toward the counter nell married a todd just a little under two weeks ago in fact zachariah todd our sheriff while shes new to the island the todds have indeed lived here for generations he knew who nell was the former wife of evan remington a man who had once wielded considerable power and influence in the entertainment industry a man who had been found to be a violent abuser and who was now deemed legally insane and under lock and key it had been sheriff todd whod arrested him right here on three sisters after what were reputed to be strange events on halloween night the sabbat of samhain it was something mac intended to explore in more depth even as he started to bring it up something in mias expression warned him to bide his time there looks great thanks he said instead to nell as she served their lunch enjoy mia is tonight still good for you absolutely ill come up about seven then let me know if you need anything else dr booke nells just back from her honeymoon mia said in a quiet voice when she was alone with him again i dont think questions about certain areas of her life are appropriate just now all right are you always so cooperative dr booke mac probably not but i dont want to make you mad right off the bat he bit into his sandwich good he managed really good she leaned forward toyed with her soup lulling the natives into complacency youre really good too do you have psychic abilities dont we all on some level didnt one of your papers explore the development of what you called the neglected sixth sense youve read my work i have what i am mac isnt something i neglect neither is it something i exploit or allow to be exploited i agreed to rent you the cottage and to talk with you when the mood strikes me because of one simple thing okay what you have a brilliant and more important a flexible mind i admire that as far as trusting that time will tell she glanced over and gestured and here comes a bright enough and very inflexible mind deputy ripley todd mac looked over saw the attractive brunette stride on long legs to the café counter lean on it chat with nell ripleys another common surname on the island yes shes zacks sister their mother was a ripley they have long ties on both sides of their family to the sisters very long ties mia repeated if youre looking for a cynic to weigh in on your research ripleys your girl unable to resist mia caught ripleys attention and motioned her over ordinarily ripley would merely have sneered and walked in the opposite direction but a strange face on the island usually bore checking out a goodlooking guy she thought as she strolled over in a bookish kind of way as soon as the thought hit her brows drew together bookish mias doctor of freakology dr macallister booke deputy ripley todd nice to meet you he got to his feet surprising ripley with his length as he unfolded himself from the chair most of his height she judged was leg i didnt know they gave out degrees for the study of crapola isnt she adorable mia beamed i was just telling mac that he should interview you for your narrow closed mind after all it wouldnt take much time yawn ripley hooked her thumbs in her pockets and studied macs face i dont think id have much to say that youd want to hear mias the goddess of woowoo stuff around here you have any questions about the practicalities of daytoday life on the island you can usually find me or the sheriff around appreciate it oh ive only got a masters in crapola havent finished my thesis on that one yet her lips twitched cute that your rover out front yes had he left the keys in it again he wondered already patting pockets is there a problem no nice ride im going to grab some lunch she isnt abrasive and annoying on purpose mia said when ripley walked away she was born that way its okay he sat again picked up his meal where hed left off i get a lot of that kind of thing he nodded at mia i imagine you do too now and then youre awfully well adjusted and affable arent you dr macallister booke afraid so its pretty boring i dont think so mia picked up her tea studied him over the rim no i dont think so at all
