the root of ampoi clark ashton smith a circus had arrived in auburn the siding at the station was crowded with long lines of cars from which issued a medley of exotic howls growls snarls and trumpetings elephants and zebras and dromedaries were led along the main streets and many of the freaks and performers wandered about the town two bearded ladies passed with the graceful air and walk of women of fashion then came a whole troupe of midgets trudging along with the look of mournful sophisticated children and then i saw the giant who was slightly more than eight feet tall and magnificently built with no sign of the disproportion which often attends giantism he was merely a fine physical specimen of the ordinary man somewhat more than lifesize and even at first glance there was something about his features and his gait which suggested a seaman i am a doctor and the man provoked my medical curiosity his abnormal bulk and height without trace of acromegaly was something i had never happened to meet before he must have felt my interest for he returned my gaze with a speculative eye and then lurching in sailor like fashion he came over to me i say sir could a chap buy a drink in this ere town he queried cautiously i made a quick decision come with me i replied im an allopath and i can tell without asking that youre a sick man we were only a block from my office i steered the giant up the stairs and into my private sanctum he almost filled the place even when he sat dovm at my urging i brought out a bottle of rye and poured a liberal glassful for him he downed it with manifest appreciation he had worn an air of mild depression when i first met him now he began to brighten you wouldnt think to look at me that i wasnt always a bloomin giant he soliloquized have another drink i suggested after the second glass he resumed a little mournfully no sir jim knox wasnt always a damn circus freak then with little urging on my part he told me his story knox an adventurous cockney had followed half the seas of the world as a common sailor and boatswain in his younger years he had visited many strange places had known many bizarre experiences before he had reached the age of thirty his restless and daring disposition led him to undertake an incredibly fantastic quest the events preceding this quest were somewhat unusual in themselves shipwrecked by a wild typhoon in the banda sea and apparently the one survivor knox had drifted for two days on a hatch torn from the battered and sinking vessel then rescued by a nativefishingproa he had been carried to salawatti the rajah of salawatti an old and monkeylike malay was very nice to knox the rajah was a teller of voluminous tales and the boatswain was a patient listener on this basis of congeniality knox became an honored guest for a month or more in the rajahs palace here among other wonders retailed by his host he heard for the first time the rumor of a most remarkable papuan tribe this unique tribe dwelt on a wellnigh inaccessible plateau of the arfak mountains the women were nine feet tall and white as milk but the men strangely were of normal stature and darker hue they were friendly to the rare travelers who reached their domains and they would trade for glass beads and mirrors the pigeons blood rubies in which their mountainslopes abounded as proof of the latter statement the rajah showed knox a large flawless uncut ruby which he claimed had come from this region knox was hardly inclined to credit the item about the giant women but the rubies sounded far less improbable it was characteristic of him that with little thought of danger difficulty or the sheer absurdity of such a venture he made up his mind at once to visit the arfak mountains bidding farewell to his host who mourned the loss of a good listener he continued his odyssey by means that he failed to specify in his history knox procured two sackfuls of mirrors and glass beads and managed to reach the coast of northwestern new guinea at andai in arrak he hired a guide who purported to know the whereabouts of the giant amazons and struck boldly inland toward the mountains the guide who was half malay and half papuan bore one of the sacks of baubles on his shoulders and knox carried the other he fondly hoped to return with the two sacks full of smouldering darkred rubies it was a little known land some of the peoples were reputed to be headhunters and caanibals but knox found them friendly enough but somehow as they went on the guide began to exhibit a growing haziness in his geography when they reached the middle slopes of the arfak range knox realized that the guide knew little more than he himself regarding the location of the fabulous rubystrewn plateau they went on through the steepening forest before them above trees that were still tall and semitropical arose the granite scarps and crags of a high mountainwall behind which the afternoon sun had disappeared in the early twilight they camped at the foot of a seemingly insuperable cliff knox awoke in a blazing yellow dawn to discover that his guide had departed taking one of the sacks of trinkets which from a savage viewpoint would constitute enough capital to set the fellow up in business for life knox shrugged his shoulders and swore a little the guide wasnt much of a loss but he didnt like having his jewelpurchasing power diminished by haif he looked at the cliffs above tier on tier they towered in the glow of dawn with tops scarce distinguishable from the clouds about them somehow the more he looked the surer he became that they were the cliffs which guarded the hidden plateau with their silence and inaccessible solitude their air of eternal reserve and remoteness they couldnt be anything else but the ramparts of a realm of titan women and pigeons blood rubies he shouldered his pack and followed the granite wall in search of a likely startingplace for the climb he had determined to attempt the upright rock was smooth as a metal sheet and didnt offer a toehold for a spider monkey but at last he came to a deep chasm which formed the bed of a summerdried cataract he began to ascend the chasm which was no mean feat in itself for the streambed was a series of high shelves like a giant stairway half the time he dangled by his fingers without a toehold or stretched on tiptoe and felt precariously for a fingergrip the climb was a ticklish business with death on the pointed rocks below as the penalty of the least miscalculation he dared not look back on the way he had climbed in that giddy chasm toward noon he saw above him the menacing overhang of a huge crag where the straitening gully ceased in a blackmouthed cavern he scrambled up the final shelf into the cave hoping that it led as was likely to an upper entrance made by the mountain torrent by the light of struck matches he scaled a slippery incline the cave soon narrowed and knox could often brace himself between the walls as if in a chimneys interior after long upward groping he discerned a tiny glimmering ahead like a pinprick in the solid gloom knox nearly worn out with his efforts was immensely heartened but again the cave narrowed till he could squeeze no farther with the pack on his back he slid back a little distance and removed the sack which he then proceeded to push before him up a declivity of fortyfive degrees in those days knox was of average height and somewhat slender but even so he could barely wriggle through the last ten feet of the cavern he gave the sack a final heave and landed it on the surface without then he squirmed through the opening and fell exhausted in the sunlight he lay almost at the fountainhead of the dried stream in a saucerlike hollow at the foot of a gentle slope of granite beyond whose bare ridge the clouds were white and near knox congratulated himself on his gift as an alpine climber he felt no doubt whatever that he had reached the threshold of the hidden realm of rubies and giant women suddenly as he lay there several men appeared against the clouds on the ridge above striding like mountaineers they came toward him with excited jabberings and gestures of amazement and he rose and stood awaiting them knox must have been a singular spectacle his clothing and face were bestreaked with dirt and with the stains of particolored ores acquired in his passage through the cavern the approaching men seemed to regard him with a sort of awe they were dressed in short reddishpurple tunics and wore leather sandals they did not belong to any of the lowland types their skin was a light sienna and their features were good even according to european standards all were armed with long javelins but seemed friendly wideeyed and apparently somewhat timorous they addressed knox in a language which bore no likeness to any melanesian tongue he had ever heard he replied in all the languages of which he had the least smattering but plainly they could not understand him then he umtied his sack took out a double handful of beads and tried to convey by pantomime the information that he was a trader from remote lands the men nodded their heads beckoning him to follow them they returned toward the cloudrimmed ridge knox trudged along behind them feeling quite sure that he had found the people of the rajahs tale topping the ridge he saw the perspectives of a long plateau full of woods streams and cultivated fields in the mild and slanting sunlight he and his guides descended a path among flowering willowherbs and rhododendrons to the plateau there it soon became a welltrodden road running through forests of dammar and fields of wheat houses of roughhewn stone with thatched roofs evincing a higher civilization than the huts of the papuan seaboard began to appear at intervals men garbed in the same style as knoxs guides were working in the fields then knox perceived several women standing together in an idle group now he was compelled to believe the whole story about the hidden people for these women were eight feet or more in height and had the proportions of shapely goddesses their complexion was not of a milky fairness as in the rajahs tale but was tawny and creamlike and many shades lighter than that of the men knox feit a jubilant excitement as they turned their calm gaze upon him and watched him with the air of majestic statues he had found the legendary realm and he peered among the pebbles and grasses of the wayside half expecting to see them intersown with rubies none was in evidence however a town appeared circling a sapphire lake with onestoried but wellbuilt houses laid out in regular streets many people were strolling or standing about and all the women were tawny giantesses and all the men were of average stature with umber or sienna complexions a crowd gathered about knox and his guides were questioned in a quite peremptory manner by some of the titan females who eyed the boatswain with embarrassing intentions he divined at once the respect and obeisance paid these women by the men and inferred the superior position which they held they all wore the tranquil and assured look of empresses knox was led to a building near the lake it was larger and more pretentious than the others the roomy interior was arrased with roughly pictured fabrics and furnished with chairs and couches of ebony the general effect was rudely sybaritic and palatial and much enhanced by the unusual height of the ceilings in a sort of audienceroom a woman sat enthroned on a broad dais several others stood about her like a bodyguard she wore no crown no jewels and her dress differed in no wise from the short kilts of the other women but knox knew that he had entered the presence of a queen the woman was fairer than the rest with long rippling chestnut hair and fine oval features the gaze that she turned upon knox was filled with a feminine mingling of mildness and severity the boatswain assumed his most gallant manner which must have been a little nullified by his dirtsmeared face and apparel he bowed before the giantess and she addressed him with a few soft words in which he sensed a courteous welcome then he opened his pack and selected a mirror and a string of blue beads which he offered to the queen she accepted the gifts gravely showing neither pleasure nor surprise after dismissing the men who had brought knox to her presence the queen turned and spoke to her female attendants they came forward and gave knox to understand that he must accompany them they led him to an open court containing a huge bath fed by the waters of the blue lake here in spite of his protests and strugglings they undressed him as if he had been a little boy they they plunged him into the water and scrubbed him thoroughly with scrapers of stiff vegetable fiber one of them brought him a brown tunic and a pair of sandals in lieu of his former raiment though somewhat discomforted and abashed by his summary treatment knox couldnt help feeling like a different man after his renovation and when the women brought in a meal of taro and milletcake and roast pigeon piled on enormous platters he began to forgive them for his embarrassment two of his fair attendants remained with him during the meal and afterwards they gave him a lesson in their language by pointing at various objects and naming them knox soon acquired a knowledge of much domestic nomenclature the queen herself appeared later and proceeded to take a hand in his instruction her name he learned was mabousa knox was an apt pupil and the days lesson was plainly satisfactory to all concerned knox realized more clearly than before that the queen was a beautiful woman but he wished that she was not quite so large and imposing he felt so juvenile beside her the queen on her part seemed to regard knox with a far from unfavorable gravity he saw that she was giving him a good deal of thought and consideration knox almost forgot the rubies of which he had come in search and when he remembered them he decided to wait till he had learned more of the language before broaching the subject a room in the palace was assigned to him and he inferred that he could remain indefinitely as mabousas guest he ate at the same table with the queen and a halfdozen attendants it seemed that he was the only man in the establishment the chairs were all designed for giantesses with one exception which resembled the high chair in which a child sits at table amongst its elders knox occupied this chair many days went by and he learned enough of the language for all practical purposes it was a tranquil but far from unpleasant life he soon grew familiar with the general conditions of life in the country ruled by mabousa which was called ondoar it was quite isolated from the world without for the mountain walls around it could be scaled only at the point which knox had so fortuitously discovered few strangers had ever obtained entrance the people were prosperous and contented leading a pastoral existence under the benign but absolute matriarchy of mabousa the women governed their husbands by sheer virtue of physical superiority but there seemed to be fully as much domestic amity as in the households of countries where a reverse dominion prevails knox wondered greatly about the superior stature of the women which struck him as being a strange provision of nature somehow he did not venture to ask any questions and no one volunteered to tell him the secret he kept an eye open for rubies and was puzzled by the paucity of these gems a few inferior rubies ae well as small sapphires and emeralds were worn by some of the men as earring pendants though none of the women was addicted to such ornaments knox wondered if they didnt have a lot of rubies stored away somewhere he had come there to trade for red corundum and had carried a whole sackload of the requisite medium of barter up an impossible mountainside so he was loath to relinquish the idea one day he resolved to open the subject with mabousa for some reason he never quite knew why it was hard to speak of such matters to the dignified and lovely giantess but business was business he vas groping for suitable words when he suddenly noticed that mabousa too had something on her mind she had grown uncommonly silent and the way she kept looking at him was disconcerting and even embarrassing he wondered what was the matter also he began to wonder if these people were cannibalistic her gaze was so eager and avid before he could speak of the rubies and his willingness to buy them with glass beads mabousa startled him by coming out with a flatly phrased proposal of marriage to say the least knox was unprepared but it seemed uncivil as weh as unpolitic to refuse he had never been proposed to before by a queen or a giantess and he thought it would be hardly the proper etiquette to decline a heart and hand of such capacity also as mabousas husband he would be in a most advantageous position to negotiate for rubies and mabousa was undeniably attractive even though she was built on a grand scale after a little hemming and hawing he accepted her proposal and was literally swept off his feet as the lady gathered him to the gargantuan charms of her bosom the wedding proved to be a very simple affair a mere matter of verbal agreement in the presence of several female witnesses knox was amazed by the ease and rapidity with which he assumed the bonds of holy matrimony he learned a lot of things from his marriage with mabousa he found at the weddingsupper that the high chair he had been occupying at the royal table was usually reserved for the queens consort later he learned the secret of the womens size and stature all the children boys and girls were of ordinary size at birth but the girls were fed by their mothers on a certain root which caused them to increase in height and bulk beyond the natural limits the root was gathered on the highest mountain slopes its peculiar virtue was mainly due to a mode of preparation whose secret had been carefully guarded by the women and handed down from mother to daughter its use had been known for several generations at one time the men had been the ruling sex but an accidental discovery of the root by a downtrodden wife named ampoi had soon led to a reversal of this domination in consequence the memory of ampoi was highly venerated by the females as that of a savioress knox also acquired much other information on matters both social and domestic but nothing was ever said about rubies he was forced to decide that the plenitude of these jewels in ondoar must have been sheer fable a purely decorative addition to the story of the gant amazons his marriage led to other disillusionments as the queens consort he had expected to have a share in the government of ondoar and had looked forward to a few kingly prerogatives but he soon found that he was merely a male adjunct of mabousa with no legal rights no privileges other than those which she out of wifely affection might choose to accord him she was kind and loving but also strongminded not to say bossy and he learned that he couldnt do anything or go anywhere without first consulting her and obtaining permission she would sometimes reprimand him would often set him right on some point of ondoarian etiquette or the general conduct of life in a sweet but strict manner and it never occurred to her that he might even wish to dispute any of her mandates he however was irked more and more by this feminine tyranny his male pride his manly british spirit revolted if the lady had been of suitable size he would in his own phrase have knocked her about a little but under the circumstances any attempt to chasten her by main strength hardly seemed advisable along with all this he grew quite fond of her in his fashion there were many things that endeared her to him and he felt that she would be an exemplary wife if there were only some way of curbing her deplorable tendency to domineer time went on as it has a habit of doing mabousa seemed to be well enough satisfied with her spouse but knox brooded a good deal over the false position in which he felt that she had placed him and the daily injury to his manhood he wished that there were some way of correcting matters and of asserting his natural rights and putting mabousa in her place one day he remembered the root on which the women of ondoar were fed why couldnt he get hold of some of it and grow big himself like mabousa or bigger then he would be able to handle her in the proper style the more he thought about it the more this appealed to him as the ideal solution of his marital difficulties the main problem however was to obtain the root he questioned some of the other men in a discreet way but none of them could tell him anything about it the women never permitted the men to accompany them when they gathered the stuff and the process of preparing it for consumption was carried on in deep caverns several men had dared to steal the food in past years two of them indeed had grown to giant stature on what they had stolen but all had been punished by the women with lifelong exile from ondoar all this was rather discouraging also it served to increase knoxs contempt for the men of ondoar whom he looked upon as a spineless effeminate lot however he didnt give up his plan but after much deliberation and scheming he found himself no nearer to a solution of the problem than before perhaps he would have resigned himself as better men have done to an inevitable lifelong henpecking but at last in the birth of a female baby to mabousa and himself he found the opportunity he had been seeking the child was like any other girl infant and knox was no less proud of it no less imbued with the customary parental sentiments than other fathers have been it did not occur to him till the baby was old enough to be weaned and fed on the special food that he would now have in his own home a firstrate chance to appropriate some of this food for his personal use the simple and artless mabousa was wholly without suspicion of such unlawful designs male obedience to the feministic law of the land was so thoroughly taken for granted that she even showed him the strange foodstuff and often fed the child in his presence nor did she conceal from him the large earthen jar in which she kept her reserve supply the jar stood in the palace kitchen among others filled with more ordinary staples of diet one day when mabousa had gone to the country on some political errand and the waiting women were all preoccupied with other than culinary matters knox stole into the kitchen and carried away a small bagful of the stuff which he then hid in his own room in his fear of detection he felt more of an actual thrill than at any time since the boyhood days when he had pilfered apples from london streetbarrows behind the backs of the vendors the stuff looked like a fine variety of sago and had an aromatic smell and spicy taste knox ate a little of it at once but dared not indulge himself to the extent of a full meal for fear that the consequences would be visible he had watched the incredible growth of the child which had gained the proportions of a normal sixyear old girl in a fortnight under the influence of the miraculous nutrient and he did not wish to have his theft discovered and the further use of the food prevented in the first stage of his own development to ward gianthood he felt that some sort of seclusion would be advisable till he could attain the bulk and stature which would ensure a position as master in his own household he must somehow remove himself from all female supervision during the period of growth this for one so thorougbly subject to petticoat government with all his goings and comings minutely regulated was no mean problem but again fortune favored knox for the hunting season in ondoar had now arrived a season in which many of the men were permitted by their wives to visit the higher mountains and spend days or weeks in tracking down a certain agile species of alpine deer known as the oklah perhaps mabousa wondered a little at the sudden interest shown by knox in oklahhunting and his equally sudden devotion to practice with the javelins used by the hunters but she saw no reason for denying him permission to make the desired trip merely stipulating that he should go in company with certain other duti ful husbands and should be very careful of dangerous cliffs and crevasses the company of other husbands was not exactly in accord with knoxs plan but he knew better than to argue the point he had contrived to make several more visits to the palace pantry and had stolen enough of the forbidden food to turn him into a robust and wifetaming titan somehow on that trip among the mountains in spite of the meek and lawabiding males with whom he was condemned to go he would find chances to consume all he had stolen he would return a conquering anakim a roaring and swaggering goliath and everyone especially mabousa would stand from under knox hid the food disguised as a bag of millet meal in his private supply of provisions he also carried some of it in his pockets and would eat a mouthful or two whenever the other men werent looking and at night when they were all sleeping quietly he would steal to the bag and devour the aromatic stuff by the handful the result was truly phenomenal for knox could watch himself swell after the first square meal he broadened and shot up inch by inch to the manifest bewilderment of his companions none of whom at first was imaginative enough to suspect the true reason he saw them eyeing him with a sort of speculative awe and curiosity such as civilized people would display before a wild man from borneo obviously they regarded his growth as a kind of biological anomaly or perhaps as part of the queer behaviour that might well be ex pected from a foreigner of doubtful antecedents the hunters were now in the highest mountains at the northernmost end of ondoar here among stupendous riven crags and piled pinnacles they pursued the elusive oklah and knox began to attain a length of limb that enabled him to leap across chasms over which the others could not follow at last one or two of them must have gotten suspicious they took to watching knox and one night they surprised him in the act of devouring the sacred food they tried to warn him with a sort of holy horror in their demeanor that he was doing a dreadful and forbidden thing and would bring himself the direct consequences knox who was beginning to feel as well as look like an actual giant told them to mind their own business moreover he went on to express his frank and uncensored opinion of the sapless decadent and effeminate males of ondoar after that the men left him alone but murmured fearfully among themselves and watched his every move with apprehensive glances knox despised them so thoroughly that he failed to attach any special significance to the furtive disappearance of two members of the party indeed at the time he hardly noticed that they had gone after a fortnight of alpine climbing the hunters had slain their due quota of longhorned and goatfooted oklah and knox had consumed his entire store of the stolen food and had grown to proportions which he felt sure would enable him to subdue his domineering helpmate and show her the proper inferiority of the female sex it was time to return knoxs companions would not have dreamt of exceeding the limit set by the women who had enjoined them to come back at the end of a fortnight and kaox was eager to demonstrate his newwon superiority of bulk and brawn as they came down from the mountains and crossed the cultivated plain knox saw that the other men were lagging behind more and more with a sort of fearfulness and shrinking timidity he strode on before them carrying three fullsized oklah slung over his shoulders as a lesser man would have carried so many rabbits the fields and roads were deserted and none of the titan women was in sight anywhere knox wondered a little about this but feeling himself so much the master of the general situation he did not overexert his mind in curious conjectures however as they approached the town the desolation and silence became a trifle ominous knoxs fellowhunters were obviously stricken with dire and growing terror but knox did not feel that he should lower his dignity by even asking the reason they entered the streets which were also strangely quiet there was no evidence of life other than the pale and frightened faces of a few men that peered from windows and furtively opened doors at last they came in sight of the palace now the mystery was explained for apparently all the women of ondoar had gathered in the square before the building they were drawn up in a massive and appallingly solid formation like an army of giant amazons and their utter stillness was more dreadful than the shouting and tumult of battlefields knox felt an unwilling but irresistible dismay before the swelling thews of their mighty arms the solemn heaving of gargantuan bosoms and the awful and austere gaze with which they regarded him in unison suddenly he perceived that he was quite alone the other men had faded away like shadows as if they did not even dare to remain and watch his fate he felt an almost undeniable impulse to flee but his british valor prevented him from yielding to it pace by pace he forced himself to go on toward the embattled women they waited for him in stony silence immovable as caryatides he saw mabousa in the front rank her servingwomen about her she watched him with eyes in which he could read nothing but unutterable reproach she did not speak and somehow the jaunty words with which he had intended to greet her were congealed on his lips all at once with a massed and terrible striding movement the women surrounded knox he lost sight of mabousa in the solid wall of titanesses great brawny hands were grasping him tearing the spear from his fingers and the oklah from his shoulders he struggled as became a doughty briton but one man even though he had eaten the food of giantesses could do nothing against the whole tribe of eightfoot females maintaining a silence more formidable than any outcry they bore him through the town and along the road by which he had entered ondoar and up the mountain path to the outmost ramparts of the land there from the beetling crag above the gully he had climbed they lowered him with a tackle of heavy ropes to the dry torrentbed two hundred feet below and left him to find his way down the perilous mountainside and back to the outer world that would accept him henceforward only as a circus freak
