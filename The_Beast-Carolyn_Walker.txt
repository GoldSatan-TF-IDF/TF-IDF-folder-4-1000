chapter one the zoo today susie blackmore thought to herself is going to be another bad day she was alone in her little flat in west london it was the end of september the last quarter of the last year of the century the millennium in fact the sun was coming through the window and outside the trees were moving slowly in the autumn wind a bus came along the road stopped outside the house and moved off again susie listened for a few moments to the traffic sounds outside her window life was going on as usual slowly susie stood up and made herself some tea she took it back to the table by the window and sat holding the cup this was no good she didnt want to do any work the dream shed had last night was still with her following behind her like a ghost shed started having bad dreams several weeks ago the night after her father died sometimes in the dreams she was in a place she didnt know she knew that she had to escape from something she was very afraid of the dark deathly thing that was chasing her often a voice called her name loudly in her dream and she woke up although it was a dream she was sure that the voice was real she finished her tea and looked at her watch it was just after ten oclock come on she told herself time to go out get moving she found her coat and camera and left a message on the telephone answering machine for her husband charlie ive gone out to do a job ill be back around midday leave a message and ill call you back the underground station was fairly quiet at this time in the morning she bought her ticket and waited for the train between stations the train stopped for a few moments and susie looked at the other travellers she studied their faces in the glass in the window opposite outside the window everything was black she thought of her father again she tried to see his face in the window glass as well but his kind eyes and smile didnt come had she forgotten his face so soon she felt a wave of sadness shed felt so terrible when she got the phone call from the hospital it had all happened very suddenly they told her her father went to hospital very quickly by ambulance but they couldnt help him the doctor said he was very sorry now susie felt like a small child again lost in the big adult world well ok she had charlie but that was different her mother had died when she was a baby the only family she had left now were her cousins in slovenia but she didnt know her slovene cousins very well they phoned her when they heard about her father it was the first time she had spoken to them since she was a child his heart just stopped she told them noone could do anything it was very sudden she had dreams about her father too in last nights dream he was smiling dont worry about me he said im fine he was back home in the village in slovenia where he was born he was having a great time seeing old friends and family ill come and see you as soon as i get home he promised just as he used to when he was alive every week in the dream she had thought ah he isnt dead after all it was all a terrible mistake and then shed woken and remembered she got out of the train at regents park and walked towards the zoo this was one of her favourite parts of the city it was such a different place from the busy world of shops and business and london traffic she liked to watch the animals as they played ate or lay on the ground asleep the zoo wanted some photographs of the animals you had to be very good in the photography business and susie knew she was good but that was not enough she had to work hard taking photographs at the same time she had to find new jobs to do she loved her work but it was a difficult life she was beginning to feel tired of it and now her father was gone was it time for a change for the first time in her life she wanted a child a child for her fathers lost life this morning there were not many visitors she almost had the place to herself except for the zoo keepers who were giving food to the animals susie stopped to look at the grey wolves as they walked hungrily up and down they were like large friendly dogs really not at all wild or dangerous she remembered the stories her father used to tell her about the volkodlak it was a terrible thing a sort of manwolfvampire who stole bad children away in the night and drank their blood when she was little of course she thought the stories were true she smiled as she thought about it she lifted up her camera one of the wolves stopped moving and watched her susie found herself looking back through the camera the hair on her skin stood up and she felt suddenly afraid she couldnt move she felt sure that the animal wanted to tell her something the next thing she knew was that she was lying on the ground the worried face of one of the zoo keepers was above her are you all right love he asked ive sent for the doctor umm was all that she could say chapter two voice of the beast i sleep with my eyes open my ears hear the smallest sound and i wake if air moves softly over the hairs on my body i will know that there is a living thing near me smells of animals brought by the wind can reach me over hundreds of kilometres are you afraid of the dark you are right to be afraid we live in the darkness and there we do our work you can be sure that we want only what is bad only what can hurt you when you are feeling weak we will know then we will watch you while you sleep waiting for the time when we can take you into our darkness in the night we talk to you and call you to come to us the knock on the door that wakes you in the night that is one of us come to invite you to a living death do not listen close your ears if you want to escape with your life we have always been here we have been here from the start of time many thousands of years ago people ate with the gods at that time in arcadia in greece there was a man called lykaon in greek stories lykaon was the son of the first man on earth he was the king of the people who lived on the hills and in the woods of arcadia but lykaon was a man who did bad things and one day the god zeus heard about them so he paid a surprise visit lykaon killed a child and gave it to zeus to eat zeus was so angry that he turned lykaon into a wolf lykaon had to leave his people and live in the woods by himself he was half man and half wolf the sons of lykaon my brothers and i have been on the earth all this time but we left arcadia and travelled the world each one of us went alone we lived in hiding in many different places sometimes we showed ourselves to people but they were terribly afraid of us they used guns and shot us with silver bullets they made big fires and burnt us alive and cut off our heads but we did not die we just changed into the undead we move around the earth in many forms you do not see us but we are among you in all parts of the world from the east to the west from the north to the south in venezuela france mexico and florida from the caucasus to the alps from georgia to greece from the icy fields of russia to the green hills of england you can hear our cries if you listen hard they are carried on the hot winds from the south and across the white mountains of the north there is nothing you can do to escape from us you may think you can kill us with your silver bullets but you cannot we move from one body to another from one place to another we need blood and dead meat and we are always hungry we will kill anything that lives babies cows children sheep goats chickens men women how can you know us well what do you think you will see sometimes for example i am an animal of the night like a bat or a wolf or an owl or a wild black dog like the dog that sits at the entrance to the underworld sometimes i am the ghost that lies down next to you when you sleep or i am a beautiful young man or woman whom you want more than anything else in the world i am all of these things and i am none of them i move between your world and mine as easily as a fish through water you cannot understand how easily you may see something moving in the corner of your eye if you turn to look there will be nothing there just a leaf blowing in the wind you think but i am following in the darkness behind you i am your worst dream chapter three a holiday are you ok charlie asked susie that evening as they sat in their small kitchen youre very quiet he watched her her dark eastern european eyes always made her face look white but today she seemed whiter than usual there were dark circles under her eyes yes im fine im not sleeping well at the moment thats all susie said i keep having these dreams it was about dad last night i thought he was alive again her voice shook a little charlie felt worried about susie last august after her father died shed seemed lost shed looked so ill that charlie had made her go to the doctor it was quite usual to feel bad after the death of a parent the doctor had said she would be better in a few weeks hed given her some pills to help her sleep but today she seemed almost more afraid than sad charlie thought susie didnt say any more and charlie didnt ask her to talk he had always felt that there was a side of her that he could never understand although her mother was english and susie had lived all her life in london she still seemed a little foreign actually this was what hed liked about her in the first place and now he loved her dearly but sometimes he felt that he didnt know her maybe they needed something else in their lives a child charlie asked himself if a baby would help susie feel better after the death of her father he was nearly thirty now a good age to be a father i think we should have a holiday he said to susie suddenly you know relax a bit get away from everything well susie started we should spend some time together you know charlie said were both always so busy sometimes i dont see you for days susie looked at him yes perhaps youre right she said slowly we could find a house in the country somewhere somewhere completely different a long way from london good idea charlie said what about wales i used to go there for holidays when i was a child there are some lovely little houses up in the hills great lets do that said susie but there are one or two jobs i need to finish first me too charlie said i cant get away until after next month ive got a big show to organise two months later on a cold grey saturday in november charlie and susie were driving along a narrow country road in the welsh hills theyd left london early in the morning and now it was nearly lunchtime they seemed to be in the middle of nowhere are you sure this is the right way charlie asked the last houses had been in a village at least three kilometres before yes i think so susie replied looking again at a hand drawn map the road was full of holes and a thick line of grass was growing down the middle it led them through a dark wood and down a hill just as they started to go up again a fox came out of the trees it ran along the road in front of the car hey look at that susie cried shed never seen a wild fox before oh charlie was just as surprised the fox stopped for a moment and looked with cold interest at the people in the car then it continued along the road and suddenly turned to the right its showing us where to go susie laughed the fox disappeared into the woods just as through the trees they could see a dark stone building cynghordy house a painted piece of wood said at last their holiday house inside the little house felt cold and the tall trees outside made it rather dark the front door opened into a small kitchen from there a door led into the sittingroom where there was an old sofa and an armchair in front of a fireplace beyond the sittingroom was a light airy room which looked south looking out of the window susie could see that the ground rose towards a high round hill at the foot of the hill there was a small wood but the top was empty of trees two large birds were flying round and round in the empty sky above the hill charlie come and look what are those birds susie called charlie looked over her shoulder red kites he said theyre very unusual in britain you only find them in a few places and this part of wales is one of them theyre meateaters theres probably some kind of dead animal down there which is going to be their dinner ugh what a terrible thought said susie it says here that the nearest shops are in the village we came through llandafydd charlie told her he was looking at a piece of paper with information about the house and there are a couple of pubs there too its like an ice box in here susie said how do we heat the house ah said charlie it says the woodburning fire in the sittingroom heats the hot water and all the house but its ok he laughed as susies face fell it says theres lots of wood already cut outside in the garage lets light the fire then susie said and im hungry why dont we go back to the village after that we can have some lunch in a pub and do some shopping all right good idea charlie went out to the car to bring in their suitcases susie watched him his thin blond hair was falling into his eyes he was much taller than her he had a way of moving his head down towards her when he spoke to her suddenly she wanted to cry these days the smallest things made her want to cry red in the face and hot charlie put the last of their suitcases on the kitchen floor thats it thank god he said what on earth have you got in that one its terribly heavy just my camera and things thats all she said can you help me with the fire the wood wont burn why cant women light fires thats what id like to know charlie smiled at her he went into the sittingroom where he found an old newspaper he began to put pieces of it into the fire outside the birds screamed in the sky and the wind shook the tall trees susie felt cold again there must be a window open somewhere she thought as the air moved softly against her short dark hair chapter four voice of the beast let me tell you a story it was midsummers eve in the year the moon was full over brynmawr hill in central wales a farmer was out with his dog he was waiting for the animal which had killed several of his sheep a gun was under his arm in the moonlight he suddenly saw the sheep run across the field something large and dark was following them moving fast he held up his gun and shot the thing cried out with a terrible sound like a wolf and stood up on its back legs to the farmer it seemed more than three metres tall it was hurt but it ran off on two legs down the hill into the woods the farmers dog turned and ran for home as fast as it could the farmer shot his gun into the trees a few times and then followed his dog back his face was white he was cold and afraid when he arrived home he said nothing to his wife about the thing in the woods but that night he did not sleep the next morning the farmers wife went into the village to do her shopping someone told her about something that had happened to the son of a rich family who lived near the village soon everyone was talking about the young man what do you think the farmers wife said to her husband when she returned the boy has shot himself in the leg he was playing with his gun and it went off by mistake really hes nearly a man now hes old enough to know better the farmer said nothing but only shook his head after a while everyone forgot about what had happened to the young man everyone except the farmer he could not forget what he had seen on brynmawr hill he noticed too that the young man had disappeared noone ever saw him again on the nights when he could not sleep the farmer sat and wrote in a notebook he wrote about that strange night on midsummers eve after he died a few years later his wife found the notebook when the story came out everyone said the oldfarmer had been completely mad of course people did not think that the story was true but by that time the rich family had moved away and their large house was empty strangely noone wanted to buy it why am i telling you all this well i was that young man after i was hurt i travelled to that part of europe which goes from hungary in the east across austria slovenia and the north of italy there i lived with others of my kind in the hills and mountains until i was better then i went south to greece i visited mount lykaon the place where lykaon was changed into a wolf the place where it all began i was careful hiding in woods all the time i took peoples sheep or goats to eat only when there were not enough wild animals for many years i was not seen again but then i started to get careless i went to many places in europe a soldier saw me in germany in outside a place called morbach i know that people tell stories about this ah but now i have returned i have come back to the hills and old woodlands of wales this is my home the right place i think to welcome in the new millennium chapter five in the black dog pub lets try that one shall we charlie said he was looking at a pub on the road going into the village of llandafydd they stopped next to a dirty old van which was outside the pub in the back of the van was a sheep which looked unhappily at them through the van window they walked up to the front entrance of the pub charlie tried to open the heavy door pulling first then pushing it it opened suddenly and he almost fell inside the pub wasnt busy although it was lunchtime susie went quickly to a seat by a welcoming fire charlie walked up to the woman behind the bar and asked for two beers and a menu the room was very quiet a man at the bar watched as charlie sat down opposite susie after a while he turned back to the landlady behind the bar and started talking to her speaking in welsh susie and charlie studied the menu while the strange sounds of the foreign language made it hard to think looking up for a moment susies eyes were caught by a picture on the other side of the room in front of dark moonlit hills a black dog with strange red eyes was looking at her as she studied the picture a man who was sitting below it stood up he walked slowly towards the bar with his empty glass he looked across at susie he had dark greying hair and very white skin like a plant that has grown without light she found herself looking into his clear blue eyes she had an uncomfortable feeling that she knew him from somewhere suddenly she did not want to be there in that pub in wales same again richard the landlady said to the man yes please richard replied problems tom he asked the man at the bar a farmer im afraid so yes tom answered in english now found two of my sheep dead today looked terrible they did tongues gone ears and noses bitten off never seen anything like it his voice became quieter and no blood there was no blood not on the ground not on the body it was probably just a fox or a dog wasnt it tom the landlady said tom the farmer shook his head oh no he said theres no animal on earth that kills like that its the beast of brynmawr richard told the landlady its come back again oh come on now the landlady said theres no such thing of course there is richard said smiling its a werewolf everyone knows that half man half wolf last seen on brynmawr hill a hundred years ago the landlady laughed loudly susie and charlie couldnt help listening to this conversation i think ill just have a cheese sandwich susie said quietly to charlie well im going to have steak and chips im really hungry charlie told her and went up to the bar on holiday are you then the landlady asked as she took charlies order she seemed friendly charlie thought yes he answered were staying up at cynghordy house for a couple of weeks aha on brynmawr hill she smiled and looked at richard and tom theyd better watch out for the beast of brynmawr then hadnt they richard laughed tom didnt its no joke he said in a low voice after lunch susie and charlie went into the centre of llandafydd it was a quiet little village with only a few shops a small supermarket a post office a tea shop and a shop which sold presents for holidaymakers to take home susie wanted to look in the tourist shop she bought a plate with a red kite on it it was getting dark by the time they arrived back at cynghordy house but the wood fire was still burning and the house was warmer ok what are we going to do now then charlie said he was not used to being on holiday usually he spent most of his waking hours at work always on the phone talking and talking or on the computer he never stopped moving susie began to put their shopping away in the cupboards in the kitchen im tired she said after a while i think ill lie down for a bit lets have something to eat soon and have an early night shall we charlie went outside to get in some more wood the cold november light was beginning to go above the hill the red kites were still flying round and round to the east a full moon was rising slowly up into the night sky charlie was surprised to see that this moon was an orangered colour not the usual yellowwhite he remembered the words a hunters moon from when he was a child was this a hunters moon chapter six voice of the beast now i look from my window and see that the light is going from the earth tonight the moon will be up for most of the night its silver light will fall like soft rain on the woods and trees on the tops of the hills soon i will feel the cold night wind on my face the air moving through the hairs on my head and arms and back i will listen to the sound of my feet as they walk on the wet earth and the grass i will hear the small sounds of animals as they move quickly to get out of my way i am going out tonight you ask why i will tell you some visitors have arrived i watched them come through the woods i saw them looking around in the strange new place they are city people here they are unsure they move carefully then later they were in the pub death has touched her with its cold fingers i could see that in her eyes now she is afraid of the darkness that is following her but also there is something in her face that i know i have seen that face before im sure maybe in greece northern italy maybe in a mountain village somewhere she interests me i cannot stop thinking about her i want her to come with me to be with me i know she is ready to come into my world but she does not know it herself yet when i tell her she will understand what she must do but i must be careful the time must be right first i will go and welcome her take a present i must make myself ready i walk across the room in the darkness to the fireplace daylight makes me weak and ill the soft silvery light of the moon is what i like from the wall i take my belt it is large and heavy black and silver on the silver there is the face of a dog the dog that sits at the entrance to the underworld i put the belt carefully on the floor in front of the fire i get down on my knees and put both my hands on the belt softly i repeat the words that i must say the words are in a language no man or woman can speak i feel the heat from the fire on my face in the centre of the fire i watch my thoughts come and go after a while after all the words are finished i stand up and put on the belt immediately my arms and legs start to feel strong i look towards the blackening sky and give a wild shout then in one great jump i am gone from the room through the open window the night is cold but i do not feel it i will not feel it until i become a man again i touch the belt around the middle of my body i will know what to do when the moment comes chapter seven the present it was still dark when susie woke up looking at her clock she saw it was three oclock in the morning she lay in bed in the darkness for a while charlies warm body next to her it was strange that shed woken so suddenly had someone knocked at the door and called her name or was it just a dream as usual suddenly her body gave a jump there was a small noise at the bedroom window was something trying to get in the noise came again and again charlie theres something outside she said her voice seemed very loud to her um what go back to sleep theres nothing there charlie said sleepily susie sat up outside the wind had become stronger and was blowing noisily through the trees she climbed out of bed and went to the window pulling back the curtain she could see that a tree was moving against the glass so it was the tree that was making the noise outside in the light of the full moon the trees and grass were waving and shaking in the wind anything could be hiding in the darkness susie put on the lights and walked round the house looking into every room there was nothing there of course it was just the house itself maybe moving in the wind like a boat at sea which had made the knocking noise she got back into bed moved close to charlie and went back to sleep when susie woke the next morning she could see the sunlight through the thin curtains in the bedroom charlie was asleep still it must be late she thought she decided to get up make some breakfast for both of them and bring it back to bed downstairs the fire was nearly out theyd used all the wood the night before so she decided to get some more from the garage she pulled on a coat over her nightclothes and put on some shoes she went to open the door strangely the door didnt move at first something seemed to be holding it she gave it a pull as the door opened susie heard herself scream it was a strange sound which came from somewhere far inside her she had never made a noise like that before in her life charlie charlie she couldnt move there was the sound of feet on wood as charlie came running down the stairs what on earth is the matter charlie said oh my god he saw the open door and the large and terrible thing on the ground half in and half out of the kitchen whatever is that doing there what is it charlie susie found it difficult to speak its a dead sheep charlie replied after a few moments listen you go back to bed and ill do something with it he added the sheeps body was not pretty to look at the mouth was open charlie couldnt help seeing that the tongue wasnt there the sheep was cut open from the throat down under the body as far as the back legs but the cut was clean and there was no blood looking more brave than he felt charlie took hold of the two back legs he pulled the body out of the kitchen and then across the road outside the house and into the field opposite we ought to tell somebody about it he thought the farmer probably he asked himself why the sheep was there did it just die there or did an animal leave it by the door he tried not to think about who or what had put the sheep there perhaps there really was a beast of brynmawr anyway he felt sick he went back into the house made a cup of tea and took it up to his wife susie was lying in the bed her pretty face with her dark hair cut like a boys looked small and white god charlie that was one of the worst things ive ever seen she said i heard some strange noises in the night you know i thought i heard someone knocking at the door do you think someone is trying to play some sort of terrible joke on us susie you mustnt think about it it was probably just a fox or something maybe it decided it would eat its dinner outside our back door come on lets try and forget it were here to have a holiday and enjoy ourselves well yes ok youre right ill try susie said but she could still see the cold eye of the sheep looking up at her from the kitchen floor do you think the beast of she began again no charlie spoke quickly i dont forget about it theres no such thing chapter eight a walk on brynmawr hill after breakfast charlie said look its a wonderful day lets go for a walk ok then ill bring my camera susie tried to sound happy they walked towards the big round hill which was opposite the house the day was fine with a soft autumn sun which came and went behind thick grey clouds it wasnt cold but there was a wind they were pleased that they had their jackets charlie susie said as they climbed the grassy hillside do you think this is brynmawr hill you know the place they talked about in the pub where someone saw a werewolf a hundred years ago charlie smiled probably come on lets just get to the top he said from the top of the hill the country looked beautiful all around they could see the great dark hills of central wales the clouds moved slowly across the sky and on the lower parts of the hills the sun on the grass looked like watery gold the light was perfect and susie put up her camera as fast as she could she couldnt wait to take some photographs listen charlie said im going to walk on a little way while youre doing that ok ill take a few photos from here then ill go over towards that place there susie was looking at a small hill several hundred metres from where they were standing ill wait for you there she said charlie walked quickly planning to go in a large circle he looked back but susie had disappeared the dead sheep had worried both of them quite a lot they had not talked about it again but charlie could still see the body lying there with bits of it missing and one eye open also he realised because there had been no blood coming from the animal it had probably died somewhere else but who or what had put it outside their house he couldnt stop thinking about it he knew that susie was finding it hard to forget as well it wasnt a good start to their holiday charlie stood for a moment on the hill far below him he saw that some sheep were running across one of the fields he watched as the white animals moved in a group across the large green field the sounds of the sheep rose up towards him carried on the wind then he saw why they were running something was chasing them it stopped to sit and watch the animals then it ran on and stopped again a dog charlie thought was it possible that a dog had left the sheep at their door he didnt know much about dogs just then the clouds above him turned a dark grey the wind got stronger and rain came down in great fat drops hed better go and find susie when charlie arrived at the small hill susie was lying down charlie was surprised to see that she was asleep her camera was on the ground it looked as if shed dropped it susie susie charlie shook her what on earth are you doing its raining your cameras getting wet wake up susie opened her eyes and looked at charlie for a moment charlie saw something in her eyes that he had never seen before she was terribly terribly afraid are you ok he said why did you go to sleep are you ok it was a few moments before susie seemed to wake up charlie was really worried now she looked so strange no im not ok well maybe i am i dont know i was just standing here taking a picture of that big tree across there see when i looked through the camera i had the strangest feeling i tried to move but i just couldnt i felt as if i was in fast moving water i couldnt make my legs move forward then there was a cold icy wind and i heard an animal sound kind of like a wolf and then everything went black charlie i hope theres nothing wrong with me am i going mad charlie looked at her unhappily the horror of the dead sheep had clearly made her ill lets get back to the house were both wet through and its terribly cold in this wind come on lets go he replied softly chapter nine an accident a few days later susie looked at the sittingroom window where the rain water was still running down the glass theyd been nowhere since that first day she hadnt wanted to do anything much she just felt like sitting and reading or looking at the fire putting on the wood and thinking charlie lets go out tonight susie said suddenly lets go to the pub shall we ok if you want the black dog he said wed better go soon theres going to be snow later how do you know that susie asked heard it on the car radio just now i was mending that light you know that light on the front of the car it was already dark by the time they started out for the pub susie watched her husband as he drove down the little road through the woods in the yellow of the car lights she could see he looked serious he was thinking about something what was it then she thought about who would be in the pub tonight the farmer perhaps or the man called richard oh no look its starting to snow already charlie said oh so it is susie could see little bits of snow caught in the lights of the car the snow came flying towards them as they drove along its not very heavy she said they turned onto the main road into llandafydd now they were driving into the wind and here the snow was falling fast perhaps we should go back charlie said its getting quite thick its only a little way now susie said were nearly there we could just have a quick drink and then go home well all right but its getting difficult to see charlie sounded worried the snow was coming towards the car in thick straight lines he moved forward to look through the hole in the snow on the car window just then susie saw something watch out she screamed something large and dark was moving towards them in the falling snow it looked like a person walking along the white line in the middle of the road then the car lights went out what the charlie said he tried to stop the car but on the snow it just went faster there was a crashing screaming sound of metal as they hit something a little while later susie opened her eyes at first everything was black her head hurt a little then she saw that their car was no longer on the road theyd hit a tree the tree seemed to be half inside the car on charlies side in the darkness she couldnt see what was charlie and what was tree the only sound was the wind in the trees there was noone else around charlie susie touched his arm there was no answer charlie was he dead what should she do should she try to get him out of the car was the car going to catch fire just then a soft noise almost like a voice came from the other side of the road and she looked across a dark thing moved between the trees she couldnt see if it was a person or an animal it disappeared quickly a small sound came from charlie thank god he wasnt dead after all at the same time car lights appeared along the road she must get out and get help outside on the road her legs shook and she couldnt stand she sat down suddenly in the snow a land rover stopped and a voice said are you all right no susie said we need a doctor my husbands hurt badly i think she found that she was crying the man got out and helped susie to stand up now then im sure hes all right my dear susie saw that the farmer from the pub was looking worriedly at her she remembered that his name was tom ive got a mobile phone in my car susie began thats ok you come and sit in my land rover where its warm now tom said ill go and have a look at your husband and ill get your phone tom took a blanket from the back of his car and went across the road what terrible luck susie thought why does charlie always try to mend things himself she was always telling him to take the car to a garage and not to do it himself he probably did something stupid she thought to the lights in the car so they went out had there been a person on the road it wasnt possible she thought perhaps it had been an animal or nothing at all just the way the light fell from her seat inside the land rover susie could hear low voices charlie must be awake then tom returned after a while and said to susie its ok my dear your husband says his arm and leg hurt but hes not too bad hes probably just broken something im afraid i dont know how to use these things he gave susie her phone you call and then we can get your husband to a hospital her hands shaking susie pushed the numbers could you talk please she asked tom i cant explain where we are tom spoke into the phone and then turned to susie not long to wait he said theyll be here soon no my dear you stay here now he said as susie started to get out of the land rover ill go and see if your husbands ok tom went back to the crashed car it seemed a long time before he returned susie was cold and afraid how badly hurt was charlie she started to think about the worst things possible perhaps he would die this is terrible she thought i must go and see him she got out and stood by the land rover in the falling snow starting to walk across the road she suddenly felt sick and her legs shook she wasnt hurt but she felt so weak after the crash she couldnt walk any further she went slowly back to the land rover then after a time the farmer came back and started to talk to her on holiday then are you tom asked yes susie began it was difficult to talk but she tried to be friendly were staying up in cynghordy house we were on our way to the black dog for a drink oh yes tom said i remember now you came into the pub a few days ago didnt you yes susie said wed just arrived im susie blackmore the farmer smiled tom lloyd pleased to meet you he replied just then another car arrived and a mans voice asked if he could help no tom told him everything was all right they had phoned and help was on the way the car drove off again going to the pub he is i expect tom said hes new around here richard is but he seems nice enough you know quite friendly hes bought an old house which hes working on so he says feeling a little better now susie asked was he in the pub the other day you know when charlie and i were there ah yes i believe he was tom said they didnt speak for a bit then susie saw with some surprise that there was a gun on the seat next to her do you shoot for sport then she asked tom no he replied i only shoot animals when i need to foxes birds and so on and dogs too if they go after my sheep we found a dead sheep outside our front door a few days ago susie said remembering suddenly it was very strange we think something put it there and ate bits of it too perhaps it was one of yours maybe ive lost five sheep now theres something out there im sure something thats very hungry and very large tom said in a low voice but im going to find it and kill it susie could hear that he was very angry he looked at susie for a moment and then took something from his pocket he gave it to susie it was small and made of metal and lay heavily on her hand it was a bullet its silver tom said softly chapter ten voice of the beast so far so good that was well done my plan is working well im good at this im patient and i think of everything i know how to take one small step at a time i know how to get what i want time means nothing to me i can wait and wait for the right moment it is like taking a photograph of a child or an animal you must think hard think of nothing else you must know what will happen before it does or it is like flying a plane or sailing a boat in a strong wind a little touch here a touch there and everything will keep going in a straight line to the end the husband is not there now he is hurt but i dont care he is hurt just enough enough to keep him in the hospital away from her but not so badly that she will be worried about him i dont want her to think too much about him i want her to be happy to talk to me things will be difficult for her now she needs someone who can help her to do everything the small everyday things she is weak because the darkness is getting nearer and she knows it before the darkness was only in her dreams now she feels it close behind her when she is awake and she is afraid she is alone and she needs someone she can talk to i am going to help her she will talk to me because i will listen to her not like her husband he does not know how to listen little by little step by step thats the way to do it chapter eleven an unexpected visitor it was past ten oclock at night when tom finally left susie in the little kitchen of cynghordy house she couldnt stay in the hospital with charlie so tom had driven her back how kind and helpful tom is she thought she sat down at the table and looked at the white walls the cupboards the table the fridge nothing moved she felt strange in the thick quietness without charlie in london she didnt mind being alone but here in this house she was uncomfortable she knew she was afraid now charlie was in hospital with a broken leg and a broken arm he was lucky not to have a broken neck poor charlie they said he had to stay in hospital for at least a week poor me too she thought what am i going to do now i havent got a car whose idea was it to have a holiday anyway what a wonderful holiday this is here i am in this house by myself on a cold wet welsh mountain in the middle of nowhere i cant even walk to llandafydd from here theres noone near and what if she stopped quickly before she could finish that thought well anyway ive got my mobile phone and at least theres tom she told herself hes been very kind tom had told her that he lived on the other side of the hill she could ring him any time if she needed anything he would try to come the next morning to see her but he had a lot to do and he wasnt sure if hed have time anyway she could call a taxi from llandafydd to take her to the hospital she felt safer thinking of tom she remembered the gun that shed seen in his land rover when hed shown her the silver bullet she hadnt understood at first then she had remembered the stories her father used to tell her tom didnt really think that a werewolf was killing his sheep did he she had asked him if he was joking but he had just smiled and said you never know do you you cant be sure she couldnt believe he was serious where my father came from shed told him lightly they believe that when a werewolf dies it turns into a vampire you cant kill them you know its impossible they just change into something else do they really tom had said of course its stupid she told herself now vampires and werewolves are just stories she got up to look at the fire in the sittingroom she thought of the time on brynmawr hill and the time at the zoo but the danger wasnt real there was nothing out there it was only in her head and she must fight it she wished charlie was there oh no she said aloud the fire had gone out that meant no hot water and the house was cold now too and of course there was no wood in the box either ok she thought lets see if i can do this by myself she picked up the wood box and opened the front door she left the door open so that she could see a little and went out to the garage when the wood box was full she stood up again to go back inside just then she suddenly realised that someone or something was near her and was moving towards her in the dark she screamed and dropped the box pieces of wood fell everywhere she stood still and couldnt move oh im terribly sorry a friendly voice said she knew the voice at once it was richard the man from the pub i made you jump didnt i he went on i just came to see if you were ok i thought you might need something tom told me it was you two who were in the accident i saw it on my way to the pub earlier tonight he made it sound like a question yes susie said i know i saw it was you its kind of you to come im fine but charlies in hospital with a broken arm and a broken leg some holiday im so sorry poor charlie richard said here let me help you pick up the wood thanks susie said she added i didnt hear you drive up or anything no i walked the last bit richard answered the snows quite bad on this road and i didnt want to have any trouble with the car i havent got a land rover like the farmers round here well would you like to come in susie said unsure what to do he could help her with the fire anyway and it would be nice to talk to someone for a bit she made them both a cup of tea while richard lit the fire the room soon started to feel warmer susie found herself talking to richard as if he was an old friend she told him about her life in london her father her family in slovenia her work while she talked he smiled at her and listened shed never talked like this before to a man she didnt know he made her feel that everything she said was important and interesting she realised that he was very goodlooking in an unusual way his blue eyes watched her while she spoke it was strange how comfortable she felt he was so easy to talk to she might almost fall in love with him suddenly susie realised what she was doing charlie was in hospital and here she was with a strange man in the house how could she possibly be thinking of such a thing er im afraid ill have to go to bed now susie said of course im terribly sorry how stupid of me its late richard said you must be very tired id better go look if you like i could take you in to the hospital to see charlie tomorrow ive got to go into town anyway oh well thats very kind yes please susie said ill come and pick you up about twelve then richard said that would be wonderful thanks very much see you tomorrow she replied when susie got into bed she realised that she was very tired but in the night the dreams started again a voice called to her come with me it said in the dream she knew the voice but she couldnt quite say whose it was suddenly she was awake outside there was a kind of scream it must be an animal caught by something susie thought it came again and then again a hopeless deathly scream she pulled the blankets over her head to shut out the noise chapter twelve richards house looking out of her window the next morning susie saw that dark bits of grass were showing above the snow on the fields on the road the snow was quite thin it wasnt as bad as shed thought last night she remembered that richard was coming later to take her to the hospital he would be able to drive right up to her house this time she phoned the hospital the nurse said charlie was fine but hed had an uncomfortable night susie told the nurse she would go to visit him later she wasnt sure when her phone rang hello my dear a womans voice said its kathryn lloyd im toms wife tom asked me to call you im afraid toms had to go out he wont be able to come up to your house this morning are you all right now do you need anything no its ok susie said im fine im going in to the hospital later richard is going to take me richard kathryn asked yes susie said realising that she didnt know richards family name er tom knows him hes new in the village tom said anyway richard saw the accident and he came here last night to see if we were all right ah that was kind of him kathryn said well thats ok then richard arrived at about midday as he had said he would hello there he said smiling how are you fine susie replied she was pleased to see him lets go then shall we he said im afraid i forgot to bring my wallet with me so well have to go back to my house do you mind its not far in fact the house is only about a kilometre from here over the hill by road you have to go back down to the main road and take the next turning but it doesnt take very long no problem susie said anyway ill show you my house im sure youll find it interesting oh susie wanted to know more yes richard talked on smiling warmly at susie actually it used to be my familys house a long time ago when i came here for a visit one day i found that the person who owned it wanted to sell it i decided to buy it immediately oh so where did you live before then susie asked well europe for a number of years i was there on business but i got tired of always moving and living out of a suitcase i decided to stop working for a bit id made enough money not to have to and ive got enough to spend some on the house too how nice susie said thinking how nice it would be not to have to work but she wouldnt want to live on top of a welsh mountain for the rest of her life too quiet noone around to speak to oh look she said as they passed a group of men in dark jackets standing by the side of the road they wore hats and boots and were carrying guns they were looking across a field towards some woods do you think theyre hunting for the beast of brynmawr she smiled at richard probably he said but i dont think theyll find it at this time of day do you no she agreed laughing its probably asleep somewhere they drove round a corner and richard said there it is oh goodness susie cried for a moment i thought you meant the beast is that really your house ahead of them at the end of the road she saw a beautiful stone building there were ten windows on the top floor and eight on the ground floor in the centre was a large front door with a pretty roof over it it was a very big house built in the eighteenth century probably susie thought it must be the house of a rich family she hadnt expected this yes it needs a lot of work richard said does it susie replied and as they got closer she could see that many of the windows had no glass the front wall of the house seemed to be all that was there if the wind blew it might just fall down like a building made of cards so youre actually living here she asked well yes there are a couple of rooms that are ok richard said its not very comfortable but i dont mind he stopped by the front door and they got out come on he said ill show you round going through the great front door susie found herself in a large room with a stone floor some stairs led up to the first floor but large holes showed where several steps were missing richard smiled i dont think well try that way follow me he led her through several large rooms everywhere there were stones and dirt nearly there richard said they seemed to be walking for ages susie felt a drop of water on her head she looked up there was no floor above her she could see the sky through the holes in the roof they went up some narrow stairs past glassless windows which looked down over the road finally richard opened a door into a room which felt quite warm a fire was burning and there were chairs and a sofa have a seat richard said would you like some coffee er really susie wanted to get to the hospital to see charlie what should she say ive just remembered something else that i havent done richard said before she could answer im sorry its going to take me a moment or two why dont you sit down ill bring you some coffee while you wait then well get going again ok he looked at her well ok then yes some coffee would be great susie said sitting on one of the rather dirty chairs near the fire richard went out and susie looked around her on the dark wood walls there were large pictures of men and women from years ago there was a man who looked a little like richard she realised were these people his family she felt uncomfortable with all these dead people looking at her they made her think of the pictures in horror films where the eyes move she laughed at herself perhaps she should phone the hospital again she could tell them that she would be in to see charlie very soon she opened her handbag oh im so stupid she said to herself the phone was not there of course shed left it on the kitchen table in cynghordy house richard came back with her coffee giving her the cup he went to stand with his back to the fire thanks susie said um do you have a phone i could use to phone the hospital no he almost shouted theres no phone here then he became quiet his face had lost the friendly smile he seemed to be waiting for something suddenly everything had changed the room was deathly quiet susie looked at the fire and drank her coffee a strange light came into richards blue eyes as he watched susie drink she started to feel very sleepy and she sat back on the chair her eyes were closing she tried hard to keep them open richard stood still in front of the fire she saw that he was wearing a large black belt with silver on it she looked up at richards face hes got a beard she thought to herself thats strange he didnt have one before then the dream started she is looking at the dark deathly thing that has been following her in her dreams all this time the face is hidden a hand takes hers she knows very well whose it is she feels terribly afraid you are one of us you know that dont you she knows the voice as well as her own no im not i will not listen to you i will not she cries i knew when you came here you came to find me didnt you the voice continues it will not stop no no i didnt i dont know you she says take me to charlie please please you dont really want charlie the voice tells her you are mine you know that in your heart and she feels herself beginning to move towards him he is right perhaps she will do anything he wants she cannot stop herself chapter thirteen escape when susie woke up the room was in darkness a small light was coming from the fireplace where the fire was still burning a little a large white moon could be seen through the window what time was it susie stood up to look at her watch in the moonlight as she got to her feet her head started to hurt badly right between the eyes quickly she sat down again was she ill why did she feel so bad and where was she she had had a terrible dream the worst ever but it wasnt real it was just a dream or was it looking around she saw that she was in a place she did not know not the flat in london not the holiday house where then there were some large pictures on the walls ah richard of course in his house that was where she must be had she fallen asleep here they were going to see charlie werent they what had happened where was richard trying hard she remembered having a cup of coffee and feeling sleepy then she thought of something and began to be afraid perhaps richard had drugged her there was a drug she knew that people used she had read stories about women who were given this drug and then hurt what was its name the drug she could not remember standing up again she moved carefully towards the door she tried to put the light on but it didnt work the door was locked richard she shouted there was no answer again she shouted but her voice only sounded in the empty room now she knew she was right to be afraid what was richard trying to do what did he want from her he must be mad and dangerous she must escape run away from here from him now she went quickly to the window it was locked too of course but looking down she saw that the room was above the front door of the house she could see the small roof over the door just below her she could get down onto the roof and jump to the ground from there she must break the window but how she went back to the fire ah a half burnt piece of wood she could use that the glass in the window broke with a lot of noise richard would hear for sure quickly she climbed out and dropped down onto the small roof that wasnt too bad she thought now for the big jump she looked down at the ground it seemed a long way away was that a sound in the room behind her there was no time to lose she shut her eyes and stepped over the side of the roof she landed hard on the ground but she hadnt hurt herself she stood up everything was ok there was a shout in the room above the door she must go fast the moon made it easy to see the road as she ran a sound came from richards house which made her blood run cold it was a terrible angry scream she looked behind her at the house but there was nothing following her yet in front of her the road was clear the snow on the road shining in the grey light then a moment later she saw a man coming towards her further down the road he was holding a gun without thinking she turned from the road and ran across a field towards a high hill she started to climb the hill it was difficult in the dark and the snow she held onto plants and small trees to stop herself falling soon her hands were cut she used her clothes to clean the blood from her hands when she got to the top she realised that she was on brynmawr hill of course richard had said that his house was quite near cynghordy house perhaps she could get back there but it was locked she remembered the key was in her bag and she had left her bag in richards house oh god what was she going to do and what about charlie he must be very worried about her what would he think perhaps she should go to toms house he lived near too didnt he but which way was it to his house looking around her on the hill she had no idea where to go she was very tired she must stop for a bit first she must sit down and rest she needed to think what to do she had a terrible headache and her arms and legs were hurting she could go no further the ground was cold and wet with snow but she didnt care just then she realised that an icy wind was blowing across the top of the hill she was in the same place where she had taken the photographs on that first day on the little hill as she looked back at the way she had just come the wind became stronger the noise of the wind was in her ears and she could hear nothing else then she saw that coming up the small hill towards her was a very large black animal the moonlight lit up its eyes and they were burning like fires when the animal saw her it began to make a strange and terrible noise like a wolf this was not a dream this was real she must run but she could not move the animal was coming closer quickly its great legs working to carry it it was moving faster than the wind susie watched unable to do anything it was very near now and about to jump at her suddenly there was the sound of a gunshot the animal rose up on its back legs it seemed more than three metres tall its lips were pulled back in a terrible smile and its large dangerous teeth were white in the moonlight something silver could be seen in the hair of its stomach as susie screamed another shot rang out a black hole seemed to open in the animals body it turned with a wild shout and ran towards the wood on its two back legs at that moment susie realised something with a terrible certainty what she had seen was not an animal it was a man well ill be a voice said behind her a voice she knew was toms come on young lady wed better take you home chapter fourteen silver bullet it was a long time before susie could stop shaking she felt so cold the worried faces of tom and his wife kathryn watched her as she drank the hot sweet tea they were good people but she felt small and lost theyd taken away her wet and bloody clothes theyd put a blanket around her like a child she was in the warm light sittingroom of their house she was safe now after the darkness and danger kathryn smiled at her youd better stay here with us my dear she was quite worried about the young woman who was sitting and shaking on the sofa something terrible had happened it was clear that susie could not return to her holiday house tell me kathryn wanted to know tom says he found you out walking about up on the hill its the middle of the night did something happen what were you doing there i i dont really know she was too tired to try to remember she started to cry and cry she couldnt stop now kathryn tom said see what youve done no more questions now come on my dear you need to get to bed that first night in tom and kathryns house susie slept deeply and dreamlessly several times during the following morning kathryn looked at her she saw how white susies face was as she slept kathryn knew that she needed to sleep she moved away quietly susie did not wake until the afternoon slowly in the days that followed susie began to return to the world again but she couldnt remember much about what had happened she said to kathryn someone richard was taking me to see charlie we went to his house then i dont know what happened perhaps i went for a walk and got lost i dont know what must charlie be thinking can i phone him now theres no need to be worried about that husband of yours tom has already seen him and told him what happened kathryn said to her what did tom tell charlie susie asked oh that he found you up on brynmawr hill in the middle of the night while he was out hunting for the thing thats been killing his sheep kathryn replied what did charlie say i dont know my dear kathryn looked at her but i know tom told him that youre fine he promised your charlie that youll go and see him very soon just as soon as youre strong again charlie must think ive really gone mad susie thought to herself perhaps i have ive lost my bag she said to kathryn i dont know where it is my moneys in it and the key to cynghordy house she felt stupid perhaps its in your holiday house kathryn said i dont think so i dont know susie said unhappily well then perhaps richards got it kathryn said ah yes perhaps he has it susie said finally she realised that the sound of richards name made her feel strangely afraid she started to shake a little now now kathryn put her arm around her its all right dont worry about it now ill ask tom to go over to richards house and get your bag for you susie knew that she had been into a place of darkness the underworld for a moment she had wanted to stay there yet somehow she had escaped with her life she didnt want to try to understand yet it was too soon she just knew that the place she had seen was dangerous it was somewhere that living people do not usually go if they do they do not usually return a day or two later tom was sitting at the kitchen table eating his dinner susie saw that her bag was on the table next to him you got it then she said yes he said his mouth full of food he kept his eyes on his plate he didnt look at susie he knew what she was going to ask he wasnt sure that he wanted to answer did richard have it she asked er well yes tom stopped looking uncomfortable something in toms voice made susie ask another question did you see him then no he wasnt there tom looked at the table strange thing is noones seen richard lately you know he hasnt been into the pub since that night replied tom oh and whats even stranger tom spoke very quietly he told everyone you know in the pub that he was working on his house yes susie said he was i saw it a lot of it had fallen down and the windows were broken he said he had to start building some of it again there were a couple of rooms that were ok i think she remembered a room full of large pictures well this morning tom began i had to move my sheep down onto a field on the other side of the hill down near richards house so i decided to go and ask if he had your bag go on susie said well he looked carefully at her if it ever was a house its not a house any more its fallen down theres trees and grass growing on the stones too i went for a closer look id say noones touched that place for years noones been near it or done anything to it its just a mountain of stones id say its been like that for a hundred years or so toms voice shook susie could hear that he was afraid of what he was saying the hair on her skin stood up and a cold feeling went down her body where was the bag tom she asked finally it was lying there on the stones and i found something else too he said softly in the woods on the hill what susie asked after a few seconds tom got up and went out of the room returning with something in his hands he put it on the table in front of susie looking down susie saw that it was a large heavy black belt with a silver dogs face on it tom watched her closely her face had lost all its colour tom i have to ask you something she said slowly what really happened up there on the hill you know that night when you found me was it a dog out after the sheep and you shot it perhaps tom said i was fairly sure i hit him not the first time the second time i think susie looked at him he hadnt answered the real question yes im pretty sure i got him in the heart tom went on strange thing was i went to look the next day and well there was no blood or body nothing then he said you had a lucky escape lucky i had this and some of these he held up his gun and a silver bullet you know he nearly got you tom said he susie asked they looked at each other they both knew that what they were thinking was impossible after a few moments susie said quietly id like to see charlie sure no problem tom said kathryns going shopping this afternoon she said she can take you in later thanks youve both been very kind you know susie said she thought about seeing charlie and what she could say to him she wanted to say that the days theyd spent together here had been good in london they hadnt seen each other much in the last few months they had such busy lives she wanted to tell him she was sorry that he was hurt perhaps they could try again to have a holiday and she wanted to talk about having a child some time not now but soon chapter fiveteen voice of the beast from where i am now the rivers are silver snakes the fields are green squares and the trees are like small flowers below me your world is just a map i see the sheep they are the size of stones on a beach they are dirty and grey against the snow that still lies in the fields the woods on the side of the hill are black as the night a thin line of smoke rises from a house at the bottom of the hill my hill two women come out of the house they look like toy people they get into their toy car and i hear it start it sounds like an angry fly shall i call to them just for fun just to see even from here if she is still afraid i can see very well you know i have the eyes of a bird that kills so what happened to me you may ask do you remember what i said no probably not ill tell you again there is nothing you can do to escape from us you may think you can kill us with your silver bullets but you cannot well yes ok the farmer did hit me with his silver bullet then my body became a stone one of the stones that the farmer passed in fact as he searched for me if you think this sounds impossible look carefully at the large stones that sit on hills in wild places look for the eyes and faces of the stones ask yourself what lies locked inside them i returned for a short time to the world of darkness and the undead but as i have told you i will always need the blood of living things i will always need to move into your world i cannot stay away bad luck for you we just move from one body to another from one place to another this time im tired you cannot possibly understand how tired it makes me time after time having to find a new hiding place so no i will not go again around the earth i will stay here among these woods and fields now i am one of the red kites that fly over the welsh hills one of those birds that look for animals to kill and eat this is good from where i am i can see everything it is true that my plan did not work as i wanted she was stronger than i thought she escaped from me when i thought she was mine i made a mistake my plan was not careful enough but there is something she does not yet know and i will wait now for that something to happen wait what does that mean that time passes you people i feel sorry for you you talk of beginnings and endings but the beginning and the end of the world are beyond your understanding you are too stupid dont you know that the beginning is still happening those sounds that come from beyond the stars that your scientists pick up on their radios they think those sounds will show them how the world began actually they are the last sounds of a timeless lazy laugh your world is a great and terrible joke and those strange animals that people talk of the loch ness monster in scotland the yeti in the himalayas the mono grande in brazil the chupacabras in mexico the volkodlak in central europe what are they they are children of the darkness they are part of the joke they carry messages from the joker sorry i am forgetting what was i going to say you are waiting to know arent you all right then because you ask ill tell you she will have a child soon when she looks through her camera at her baby she will see that i am the father for the camera does not lie but shows the world as it really is with her camera she sees things that her eyes cannot see and i promise by my own father lykaon who killed a child and gave it to the god zeus to eat that i will return to take what is mine
