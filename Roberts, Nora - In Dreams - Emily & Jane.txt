prologue all he had were the dreams without them he was alone always and ever alone for the first hundred years of his solitude he lived on arrogance and temper he had plenty of both to spare for the second he lived on bitterness like one of his own secret brews it bubbled and churned inside him but rather than healing it served as a kind of fuel that pushed him from day to night from decade to decade in the third century he fell into despair and selfpity it made him miserable company even for himself his stubbornness was such that it took four hundred years before he began to make a home for himself to struggle to find some pleasure some beauty some satisfaction in his work and his art four hundred years before his pride made room for the admission that he may have been perhaps just slightly and only partially responsible for what had become of him still had his actions his attitude deserved such a harsh judgment from the keepers did his mistake if indeed it had been a mistake merit centuries of imprisonment with only a single week of each hundredyear mark in which to really live when half a millennium had passed he surrendered to the dreams no it was more than surrender he embraced them survived on them escaped into them when his soul cried out for the simple touch of another being for she came to him in dreams the darkhaired maid with eyes like blue diamonds in dreams she would run through his forest sit by his fire lie willing in his bed he knew the sound of her voice the warmth of it he knew the shape of her long and slender as a boy he knew the way the dimple would wink to life at the corner of her mouth when she laughed and the exact placement of the crescent moon birthmark on her thigh he knew all of this though he had never touched her never spoken to her never seen her but through the silky curtain of dreams though it had been a woman who had betrayed him a woman who was at the root of his endless solitude he yearned for this darkhaired maid yearned for her as the years passed as much as he yearned for what had been he was drowning in a great dark sea of alone chapter contents prev next it was supposed to be a vacation it was supposed to be fun relaxing enlightening it was not supposed to be terrifying no no terrifying was an exaggeration slightly a wicked summer storm a strange road snaking through a dark forest where the trees were like giants cloaked in the armor of mists kayleen brennan of the boston brennans wasnt terrified by such things she was made of sterner stuff she made a point of reminding herself of that every ten seconds or so as she fought to keep the rental car on the muddy ditch that had started out as a road she was a practical woman had made the decision to be one quite deliberately and quite clearly when she was twelve no flights of fancy for kayleen no romantic dreams or foolish choices she had watched was still watching such occupations lead her charming adorable and baffled mother into trouble financial trouble legal trouble man trouble so kayleen had become an adult at twelve and had stayed one an adult was not spooked by a bunch of trees and a few streaks of lightning or by mists that thickened and thinned as if they breathed a grown woman didnt panic because shed made a wrong turn when the road was too narrow as this one was to allow her to safely turn around she simply kept going until she found her way again and a sensible person did not start imagining she heard things in the storm like voices should have stayed in dublin she told herself grimly as she bumped over a rut in dublin with its busy streets and crowded pubs ireland had seemed so civilized so modern so urbane but no shed just had to see some of the countryside hadnt she just had to rent a car buy a map and head out to explore but honestly it had been a perfectly reasonable thing to do shed intended to see the country while she was here and perhaps find a few treasures for her familys antique shop back in boston shed intended to wander the roads to drive to the sea to visit the pretty little villages and the great grand ruins hadnt she booked her stay in a licensed bedandbreakfast for each night that shed be traveling confirmed reservations ensured there would be no inconvenience and no surprises at the end of each days journey hadnt she precisely mapped out her route and each point of interest how long she intended to stay studying each she hadnt anticipated getting lost no one did the weather report had indicated some rain but this was ireland after all it had not indicated a wild windy wicked thunderstorm that shook her little car like a pair of dice in a cup and turned the long lovely summer twilight into raging dark still it was all right it was perfectly all right she was just a bit behind schedule and it was partly her own fault shed lingered a bit longer than she intended at powerscourt demesne on her way south and a bit longer again at the churchyard shed come across when she headed west she was certainly still in county wicklow certainly somewhere in avondale forest and the guidebook had stated that the population through the forested land was thin the villages few and far between she had expected to find it charming and atmospheric a delightful drive on her way to her nights stay in enniscorthy a destination shed been scheduled to reach by seventhirty she tipped up her arm risked a quick glance at her watch and winced when she saw she was already a full hour late doesnt matter surely they wouldnt lock the doors on her the irish were known for their hospitality she intended to put that to the test as soon as she came across a town a village or even a single cottage once she did shed get her bearings again but for now she stopped dead in the road realizing she hadnt even seen another car for over an hour her purse as ruthlessly organized as her life sat on the seat beside her she took out the cell phone shed rented turned it on and swore softly when the readout told her as it had since shed driven into the forest far enough to realize she was lost that she had no signal why dont i have a signal she nearly rapped the phone against the steering wheel in frustration but that would have been foolish what is the point of renting mobile phones to tourists if theyre not going to be able to use them she put the phone away took a deep breath to calm herself she closed her eyes tilted her head back and allowed herself two minutes of rest the rain lashed the windows like whips the wind continued its feral howl at jolting intervals the thick darkness was split by yet another lance of blueedged lightning but kayleen sat quietly her dark hair still tidy in its band her hands folded in her lap her mouth full and shapely gradually relaxed its tight line when she opened her eyes blue as the lightning that ripped the sky they were calm again she rolled her shoulders took one last cleansing breath then eased the car forward as she did she heard someone something whisper her name kayleen instinctively she glanced to the side out the rainspattered window into the gloom and there for an instant she saw a shadow take shape the shape of a man eyes green as glass glittered she hit the brakes jerking forward as the car slid in the mud her heart raced her fingers shook have you dreamed of me will you fighting fear she quickly lowered the window leaned out into the driving rain please can you help me i seem to be lost but there was no one there no one who would could have said so low and sad so am i of course there was no one with one icy finger she jabbed the button to send the window back up just her imagination just fatigue playing tricks there was no man standing in the forest in a storm no man who knew her name it was just the sort of foolishness her mother would have dreamed up the woman lost in the enchanted forest in a dramatic storm and the handsome man most likely a prince under a spell who rescued her well kayleen brennan could rescue herself thank you very much and there were no spellbound princes only shadows in the rain but her heart rapped like a fist against her ribs with her breath coming fast she hit the gas again she would get off of this damned road and she would get to where she intended to be when she got there she would drink an entire pot of tea while sitting neckdeep in a hot bath and all of this inconvenience would be behind her she tried to laugh it off tried to distract herself by mentally composing a letter home to her mother who would have enjoyed every moment of the experience an adventure she would say kayleen you finally had an adventure well i dont want a damn adventure i want a hot bath i want a roof over my head and a civilized meal she was getting worked up again and this time she couldnt seem to stop wont somebody please help me get where im supposed to be in answer lightning shot down a threepronged pitchfork hurled out of the heavens the blast of it exploded the dark into blinding light as she threw up an arm to shield her eyes she saw standing like a king in the center of the road a huge buck its hide was violently white in the slash of her headlights its rack gleaming silver and its eyes cool and gold met her terrified ones through the rain she swerved stomped on the brakes the little car fishtailed seemed to spin in dizzying circles propelled by the swirling fog she heard a scream it had to be her own before the car ran hard into a tree and so she dreamed of running through the forest while the rain slapped down like angry fingers eyes it seemed a thousand of them watched her through the gloom she fled stumbling in the muck stirred up by the storm her bones jolting as she fell her head was full of sound the roar of the wind the booming warning of thunder and under it a thousand voices chanting she wept and didnt know why it wasnt the fear but something else something that wanted to be wrenched out of her heart as a splinter is wrenched from an aching finger she remembered nothing neither name nor place only that she had to find her way had to find it before it was too late there was the light the single ball of it glowing in the dark she ran toward it her breath tearing out of her lungs rain streaming from her hair down her face the ground sucked at her shoes another fall tore her sweater she felt the quick burn on her flesh and favoring her left arm scrambled up again winded aching lost she continued at a limping run the light was her focus if only she could make it to the light everything would be all right again somehow a spear of lightning struck close so close she felt it sear the air felt it drench the night with the hot sting of ozone and in its afterglow she saw that the light was a single beam from a single window in the tower of a castle of course there would be a castle it seemed not odd at all that there should be a castle with its tower light glowing in the middle of the woods during a raging storm her weeping became laughter wild as the night as she stumbled toward it tramping through rivers of flowers she fell against the massive door and with what strength she had left slapped a fist against it the sound was swallowed by the storm please she murmured oh please let me in by the fire hed fallen into the twilightsleep he was allowed had dreamed in the flames hed set to blaze of his darkhaired maid coming to him but her eyes had been frightened and her cheeks pale as ice hed slept through the storm through the memories that often haunted him even in that drifting place but when she had come into those dreams when she had turned those eyes on him he stirred and spoke her name and jolted awake that name sliding out of his mind again the fire had burned down nearly to embers now he could have set it roaring again with a thought but didnt bother in any case it was nearly time he saw by the pretty crystal clock on the ancient stone mantel he was amused by such anachronisms that it was only seconds shy of midnight his week would begin at that stroke for seven days and seven nights he would be not just a shadow in a world of dreams but flesh blood and bone he lifted his arms threw back his head and waited to become the world trembled and the clock struck midnight there was pain he welcomed it like a lover oh god to feel cold burned his skin heat scorched it his throat opened and there was the blessed bliss of thirst he opened his eyes colors sprang out at him clear and true without that damning mist that separated him for all the other time lowering his hands he laid one on the back of his chair felt the soft brush of velvet he smelled the smoke from the fire the rain that pounded outside and snuck in through his partially open window his senses were battered so overwhelmed with the rush of sensations that he nearly swooned and even that was a towering pleasure he laughed a huge burst of sound that he felt rumble up from his belly and fisting his hands he raised them yet again i am even as he claimed himself as the walls echoed with his voice he heard the pounding at the door jolted he lowered his arms turned toward a sound hed not heard in five hundred years then it was joined by another please and it was his dream who shouted oh please let me in a trick he thought why would he be tortured with tricks now he wouldnt tolerate it not now not during his week to be he threw out a hand sent lights blazing furious he strode out of the room down the corridor down the circling pieshaped stairs they would not be allowed to infringe on his week it was a breach of the sentence he would not lose a single hour of the little time he had impatient with the distance he muttered the magic under his breath and appeared again in the great hall he wrenched open the door met the fury of the storm with fury of his own and saw her he stared transfixed he lost his breath his mind his heart she had come she looked at him a smile trembling on her lips and sending the dimple at the corner of her mouth to winking there you are she said and fainted at his feet chapter contents prev next shadows and shapes and murmuring voices they swirled in her head swelling fading in a cycle of confusion even when she opened her eyes they were there revolving what was her only thought what is it she was cold and wet and every part of her was a separate ache an accident of course an accident but what is it she focused and saw overhead high overhead a curved ceiling where plaster faeries danced among ribbons of flowers odd she thought how odd and lovely dazed she lifted a hand to her brow felt the damp thinking it blood she let out a gasp tried to sit up her head spun like a carousel uhoh trembling now she looked at her fingers and saw only clear rainwater and turning her head saw him first came the hard jolt of shock like a vicious strike to the heart she could feel panic gathering in her throat and fought to swallow it he was staring at her rudely she would think later when fear had made room for annoyance and there was anger in his eyes eyes as green as the rainwashed hills of ireland he was all in black perhaps that was why he looked so dangerous his face was violently handsome violent was the word that kept ringing in her ears slashing cheekbones lancing black brows a fierce frown on a mouth that struck her as brutal his hair was as dark as his clothing and fell in wild waves nearly to his shoulders her heart pounded a primal warning even as she shrank back she gathered the courage to speak excuse me what is it he said nothing had been unable to speak since hed lifted her off the floor a trick a new torment was she after all only a dream within a dream but hed felt her the cold damp of her flesh the weight and the shape of her her voice came clear to him now as did the terror in her eyes why should she be afraid why should she fear when she had unmanned him five hundred years of solitude hadnt done so but this woman had accomplished it with one quick stroke he stepped closer his eyes never leaving her face you are come why i i dont understand im sorry do you speak english one of those arching brows rose hed spoken in gaelic for he most often thought in the language of his life but five hundred years of alone had given him plenty of time for linguistics he could certainly speak english and half a dozen other languages besides i asked why you have come i dont know she wanted to sit up but was afraid to try it again i think there must have been an accident i cant quite remember however much it might hurt to move she couldnt stay flat on her back looking up at him it made her feel foolish and helpless she set her teeth pushed herself up slowly her stomach pitched her head rang but she managed to sit and sitting glanced around the room an enormous room she noted and filled with the oddest conglomeration of furnishings there was an old and beautiful refectory table that held dozens of candlesticks silver wrought iron pottery crystal pikes were crossed on the wall and near them was a dramatic painting of the cliffs of mohr there were display cabinets from various eras charles ii james i neoclassic bumped up against venetian chippendale against louis xv an enormous bigscreen television stood near a priceless victorian davenport placed at random were waterford bowls tang horses dresden vases and several pez dispensers despite discomfort the eccentricity tickled her humor what an interesting room she glanced up at him again hed yet to stop staring can you tell me how i got here you came yes apparently but how and i seem to be very wet its raining oh she blew out a breath the fear had ebbed considerably after all the man collected pez dispensers and georgian silver im sorry mister im flynn mister flynn flynn he repeated all right im sorry flynn i cant seem to think very clearly she was shivering violently now and wrapped her arms around her chest i was going somewhere but i dont know where i am who does he murmured youre cold and hed done nothing to tend to her he would see to her comfort he decided and then he would simply see he scooped her off the couch faintly irritated when she pushed a hand against his shoulder defensively im sure i can walk im more sure i can you need dry clothes he began as he carried her out of the room a warm brew and a hot fire oh yes she thought it all sounded wonderful nearly as wonderful as being carried up a wide sweeping staircase as if she weighed nothing but that was a romantic notion of the kind her mother lived on the kind that had no place here she kept that cautious hand pressed to a shoulder that felt like a sculpted curve of rock thank you for she trailed off shed turned her head just a fraction and now her face was close to his her eyes only inches from his eyes her mouth a breath from his mouth a sharp unexpected thrill stabbed clean through her heart the strike was followed by a hard jolt that was something like recognition do i know you wouldnt you have the answer to that he leaned in just a little breathed your hair smells of rain even as her eyes went wide he skimmed his mouth from her jawline to her temple and your skin tastes of it hed learned to savor over the years to sip even when he wished to gulp now he considered her mouth imagined what flavors her lips would carry he watched them tremble open ah yes he shifted her drawing her ever so slightly closer and she whimpered in pain he jerked back looked down and saw the raw scrape just below her shoulder and the tear in her sweater youre injured why the bloody hell didnt you say so before out of patience not his strong suit in any case he strode into the closest bedchamber set her down on the side of the bed in one brisk move he tugged the sweater over her head shocked she crossed her arms over her breasts dont you touch me how can i tend your wounds if i dont touch you his brows had lowered drawn together she was wearing a bra he knew they were called that as hed seen them worn on the television and in the thin books that were called magazines but it was the first time he had witnessed an actual female form so attired he liked it very much but such delights would have to wait until he saw what condition the woman was in he leaned over unhooked her trousers stop it she shoved tried to scramble back and was hauled not so gently into place dont be foolish ive no patience for female flights if i was after ravishing you twould already be done since she continued to struggle he heaved a breath and looked up it was fear he saw not foolishness but raw fear a maiden he thought for gods sake flynn have a care kayleen he spoke quietly now his voice as soothing as balm on a burn i wont harm you i only want to see where youre hurt are you a doctor certainly not he seemed so insulted she nearly laughed i know of healing now be still i ought to have gotten you out of your wet clothes before his eyes stayed on hers seemed to grow brighter and brighter still until she could see nothing else and she sighed lie back now theres a lass mesmerized she lay on the heaps of silk pillows and docile as a child let him undress her sweet mary youve legs that go to forever his distraction with them caused the simple spell to waver and she stirred a mans entitled to the view he muttered then shook his head look what youve done to yourself bruised and scraped one end to the other do you like pain then no her tongue felt thick of course not some do he murmured he leaned over her again look at me he demanded look here stay her eyes drooped half closed as she floated where he wanted just above the aches he wrapped her in the quilt flicked his mind toward the hearth and set the fire roaring then he left her to go to his workshop and gather his potions he kept her in the light trance as he tended her he wanted no maidenly fidgets when he touched her god it had been so long since hed touched a woman flesh against flesh in dreams hed had her under him her body eager hed laid his lips on her and his mind had felt her give and arch her rise her fall and so his body had hungered for her now she was here her lovely skin bruised and chilled now she was here and didnt know why didnt know him despair and desire tangled him in knots lady who are you kayleen brennan where do you come from boston thats america yes she smiled it is why are you here i dont know where is here nowhere nowhere at all she reached out touched his cheek why are you sad kayleen overcome he gripped her hand pressed his lips to her palm do they send you to me so i might know joy again only to lose it who are they he lifted his head felt the fury burn so he stepped away and turned to stare into the fire he could send her deeper into the dreaming place there she would remember what there was would know what she knew and would tell him but if there was nothing in her he wouldnt survive it not sane he drew a breath i will have my week he vowed i will have her before its done this i will not cast off this i will not abjure you cannot break me with this not even with her can you break flynn he turned back steady and resolved again the seven days and seven nights are mine and so is she what remains here at the last stroke of the last night remains that is the law shes mine now thunder blasted like cannon shot ignoring it he walked to the bed wake he said and her eyes opened and cleared as she pushed herself up he strode to a massive carved armoire threw the doors open and selected a long robe of royal blue velvet this will suit you dress then come downstairs he tossed the robe on the foot of the bed youll want food thank you but well talk when youve supped yes but i want she hissed in frustration as he walked out of the room and shut the door behind him with a nasty little slam manners she thought werent high on the list around here she dragged a hand through her hair stunned to find it dry again impossible it had been dripping wet when hed brought her up here only moments before she combed her fingers through it again frowning obviously she was mistaken it must have been all but dry the accident had shaken her up confused her that was why she wasnt remembering things clearly she probably needed to go to a hospital have x rays taken though a hospital seemed silly really when she felt fine in fact she felt wonderful she lifted her arms experimentally no aches no twinges she poked gingerly at the scrape hadnt it been longer and deeper along her elbow it was barely tender now well shed been lucky and now since she was starving shed take the eccentric flynn up on a meal after that her mind was bound to be steadier and shed figure out what to do next satisfied she tossed the covers back and let out a muffled squeal she was stark naked my god where were her clothes she remembered yes she remembered the way hed yanked her sweater off and then hed damn it she pressed a trembling hand to her temple why couldnt she remember shed been frightened shed shoved at him and then then shed been wrapped in a blanket in a room warmed by a blazing fire and hed told her to get dressed and come down to dinner well if she was having blackouts the hospital was definitely first on the agenda she snatched up the robe then simply rubbed the rich fabric over her cheek and moaned it felt like something a princess would wear or a goddess but certainly nothing that kayleen brennan of boston would slip casually into for dinner this will suit you hed said the idea of that made her laugh but she slid her arms into it and let herself enjoy the lustrous warmth against her skin she turned caught her own reflection in a cheval glass her hair was a tumble around the shoulders of the deep blue robe that swept down her body and ended in a shimmer of gold lace at the ankles i dont look like me she thought i look like something out of a fairy tale because that made her feel foolish she turned away the bed shed lain in was covered with velvet as well and lushly canopied with more on the bureau and certainly that was a charles ii in perfect condition sat a ladys brush set of silver with inlays of lapis antique perfume bottles of opal and of jade roses fresh as morning and white as snow stood regally in a cobalt vase a fairy tale of a room as well she mused one fashioned for candlelight and simmering fires there was a queen anne desk in the corner and tall windows draped in lace and velvet pretty watercolors of hills and meadows on the walls lovely faded rugs over the thick planked floors if shed conjured the perfect room this would have been it his manners might be lacking but his taste was impeccable or his wifes she corrected for obviously this was a womans room because the idea should have relieved her she ignored the little sinking sensation in her belly and satisfied her curiosity by opening the opal bottle wasnt that strange she thought after a sniff the bottle held her favorite perfume chapter contents prev next flynn had a stiff whiskey before he dealt with the food it hit him like a hot fist thank god there were still some things a man could count on he would feed his woman for she was unquestionably his and he would take some care with her he would see to her comfort as a man was meant to do then he would let her know the way things were to be but first he would see that she was steadier on her feet the dining hall fireplace was lit he had the table set with bone china heavy silver a pool of fragrant roses the delicacy of slim white candles and the jewel sparkle of crystal then closing his eyes lifting his hands palms out he began to lay the table with the foods that would please her most she was so lovely his kayleen he wanted to put the bloom back in her cheeks he wanted to hear her laugh he wanted her and so that was the way things would be he stepped back studied his work with cool satisfaction pleased with himself flynn went out again to wait at the base of the stairs and as she came down toward him his heart staggered in his chest speirbhean kayleen hesitated im sorry youre beautiful you should learn the gaelic he said taking her hand and leading her out of the hall ill teach you well thank you but i really dont think thatll be necessary really want to thank you too for taking me in like this and i wonder if i might use your phone a little detail kayleen thought that had suddenly come to her i have no telephone does the gown please you no phone well perhaps one of your neighbors might have one i can use i have no neighbors in the closest village she said as panic began to tickle her throat again there is no village why are you fretting kayleen youre warm and dry and safe that may be but how do you know my name you told me i dont remember telling you i dont remember how i youve no cause to worry youll feel better when youve eaten she was beginning to think she had plenty of cause to worry the wellbeing shed felt upstairs in that lovely room was eroding quickly but when she stepped into the dining room she felt nothing but shock the table was large enough to seat fifty and spread over it was enough food to feed every one of them bowls and platters and tureens and plates were jammed end to end down the long oak surface fruit fish meat soups a garden of vegetables an ocean of pastas where her voice rose snapped and had to be fought back under control where did this come from he sighed hed expected delight and instead was given shock another thing a man could count on he thought women were forever a puzzle sit please eat though she felt little flickers of panic her voice was calm and firm i want to know where all this food came from i want to know who else is here wheres your wife i have no wife dont give me that she spun to face him steady enough now and angry enough to stand and demand if you dont have a wife you certainly have a woman aye i have you just stay back she grabbed a knife from the table aimed it at him dont come near me i dont know whats going on here and im not going to care im going to walk out of this place and keep walking no he stepped forward and neatly plucked what was now a rose from her hand youre going to sit down and eat im in a coma she stared at the white rose in his hand at her own empty one i had an accident ive hit my head im hallucinating all of this all of this is real no one knows better than i the line between whats real and what isnt sit down he gestured to a chair swore when she didnt move have i said i wouldnt harm you among my sins has never been a lie or the harm of a woman here he held out his hand and now it held the knife take this and feel free to use it should i break my word to you youre the knife was solid in her hand a trick of the eye she told herself just a trick of the eye youre a magician i am his grin was like lightning fast and bright whereas he had been handsome now he was devastating his pleasure shone that is what i am exactly sit down kayleen and break fast with me for ive hungered a long time she took one cautious step in retreat its too much thinking she meant the food he frowned at the table considered perhaps youre right i got a bit carried away with it all he scanned the selections nodded then sketched an arch with his hand half the food vanished the knife dropped out of her numb fingers her eyes rolled straight back oh christ it was impatience as much as concern at least this time he had the wit to catch her before she hit the floor he sat her in a chair gave her a little shake then watched her eyes focus again you didnt understand after all understand understand itll need to be explained then he picked up a plate and began to fill it for her you need to eat or youll be ill your injuries will heal faster if youre strong he set the plate in front of her began to fill one for himself what do you know of magic kayleen brennan of boston its fun to watch it can be she would eat she thought because she did feel ill and its an illusion it can be he took the first bite rare roast beef and moaned in ecstasy at the taste the first time hed come to his week hed gorged himself so that he was sick a full day and had counted it worth it but now hed learned to take his time and appreciate do you remember now how you came here it was raining yes and is still i was going how were you going how she picked up her fork sampled the fish without thinking i was driving i was driving she repeated on a rising note of excitement of course i was driving and i was lost the storm i was coming from she stopped struggling through the mists dublin id been in dublin im on vacation oh thats right im on vacation and i was going to drive around the countryside i got lost somehow i was on one of the little roads through the forest and it was storming i could barely see then i the relief in her eyes faded as they met his i saw you she whispered i saw you out in the storm did you now you were out in the rain you said my name how could you have said my name before we met shed eaten little but he thought a glass of wine might help her swallow what was to come he poured it handed it to her ive dreamed of you kayleen dreamed of you for longer than your lifetime and dreaming of you i was when you were lost in my forest and when i awoke youd come do you never dream of me kayleen i dont know what youre talking about there was a storm i was lost lightning hit very near and there was a deer a white deer in the road i swerved to avoid it and i crashed i think i hit a tree i probably have a concussion and im imagining things a white hind the humor had gone from his face again you hit a tree with your car they didnt have to hurt you he muttered they had no right to hurt you who are you talking about my jailers he shoved his plate aside the bloody keepers i need to check on my car she spoke slowly calmly not just eccentric she decided the man was unbalanced thank you so much for helping me if you want to check on your car then we will in the morning theres hardly a point in going out in a storm in the middle of the night he laid his hand firmly on hers before she could rise youre thinking this flynn hes lost his mind somewhere along the way well i havent though it was a near thing a time or two look at me leannana do i mean nothing to you i dont know and that was what kept her from bolting he could look at her as he was now and she felt tied to him not bound by force but tied by her own will i dont understand what you mean or whats happening to me then well sit by the fire and ill tell you what it all means he rose held out his hand irritation washed over his face when she refused to take it do you want the knife she glanced down at it back up at him yes then bring it along with you he plucked up the wine and the glasses and led the way he sat by the fire propped his boots on the hearth savored his wine and the scent of the woman who sat so warily beside him i was born in magic he began some are others apprentice and can learn well enough but to be born in it is more a matter of controlling the art than of learning it so your father was a magician no he was a tailor magic doesnt have to come down through the blood it simply has to be in the blood he paused because he didnt want to blunder again he should know more of her he decided before he did what is it you are back in your boston im an antique dealer that came through the blood my uncles my grandfather and so on brennans of boston has been doing business for nearly a century nearly a century is it he chuckled so very long i suppose it doesnt seem so by european standards but americas a young country you have some magnificent pieces in your home i collect what appeals to me apparently a wide range appeals to you ive never seen such a mix of styles and eras in one place before he glanced around the room considering it wasnt something hed thought of but hed had only himself to please up until now you dont like it because it seemed to matter to him she worked up a smile no i like it very much in my business i see a lot of beautiful and interesting pieces and ive always felt it was a shame more people dont just toss them together and make their own style rather than sticking so rigidly to a pattern no one can accuse you of sticking to a pattern no thats a certainty she started to curl up her legs caught herself what in the world was wrong with her she was relaxing into an easy conversation with what was very likely a madman she cut her gaze toward the knife beside her then back to him and found him studying her contemplatively i wonder if you could use it there are two kinds of people in the world dont you think those who fight and those who flee which are you kayleen ive never been in the position where i had to do either thats either fortunate or tedious im not entirely sure which i like a good fight myself he added with that quick grin just one of my many flaws fact is i miss going fist to fist with a man i miss a great many things why why do you have to miss anything thats the point isnt it of this fireside conversation the why are you wondering mavourneen if im off in my head yes she said then immediately froze im not though perhaps it wouldve been easier if id gone a bit crazy along the way they knew i had a strong mind part of the problem in their thinking and part of the reason for the sentence weighed on me they her fingers inched toward the handle of the knife she could use it she promised herself she would use it if she had to no matter how horribly sad and lonely he looked the keepers the ancient and the revered who guard and who nurture magic and have done so since the waiting time when life was no more than the heavens taking their first breath gods she said cautiously in some ways of thinking he was brooding again frowning into the flames i was born of magic and when i was old enough i left my family to do the work to heal and to help even to entertain some of us have more of a knack you could say for the fun of it like um sawing a lady in half he looked at her with a mixture of amusement and exasperation this is illusion kayleen yes i speak of magic not pretense some prophesy some travel and study for the sake of it others devote their art to healing body or soul some choose to make a living performing some might serve a worthy master as merlin did arthur there are as many choices as there are people and while none may choose to harm or profit for the sake of it all are real he slipped a long chain from under his shirt held the pendant with its milky stone out for her to see a moonstone he told her and the words around are my name and my title draiodoir magician its beautiful unable to resist she curved her hand around the pendant and felt a bolt of heat like the rush of a comet spurt from her fingertips to her toes god before she could snatch her hand away flynn closed his own over hers power he murmured you feel it can all but taste it a seductive thing and inside you can make yourself think theres nothing impossible look at me kayleen she already was could do nothing else wanted nothing else there you are she thought again there you are at last i could have you now you would willingly lie with me now as you have in dreams without fear without questions yes and his need was a desperate thing leaping snapping at the tether of control i want more his fingers tightened on hers what is it in you that makes me crave more when i dont know what more is well weve time to find the answer for now ill tell you a story a young magician left his family he traveled and he studied he helped and he healed he had pride in his work in himself some said too much pride he paused now thinking for there had been times in this last dreaming that hed wondered if that could be so his skill this magicians was great and he was known in his world still he was a man with the needs of a man the desires of a man the faults of a man would you want a man perfect kayleen i want you leannana he leaned over pressed his lips to her knuckles this man this magician he saw the world he read its books listened to its music he came and went as he pleased did as he pleased perhaps he was careless on occasion and though he did no harm neither did he heed the rules and the warnings he was given the power was so strong in him what need had he for rules everyone needs rules they keep us civilized do you think it amused him how prim her voice had become even held by the spell she had a strong mind and a strong will well discuss that sometime but for now to continue the tale he came to know a woman her beauty was blinding her manner sweet he believed her to be innocent such was his romantic nature did you love her yes i loved her i loved the angelfaced innocent maid i saw when i looked at her i asked for her hand for it wasnt just a tumble i wanted from her but a lifetime and when i asked she wept ah pretty tears down a smooth cheek she couldnt be mine she told me as much as her heart already was for there was a man a wealthy man a cruel man who had contracted for her her father had sold her and her fate was sealed you couldnt let that happen ah you see that too it pleased him that she saw it stood with him on that vital point no how could i let her go loveless to another to be sold like a horse in the marketplace i would take her away i said and she wept the more i would give her father twice what had been given and she sobbed upon my shoulder it could not be done for then surely the man would kill her poor father or see him in prison or some horrible fate so long as the man had his wealth and position her family would suffer she couldnt bear to be the cause of it even though her heart was breaking kayleen shook her head frowned im sorry but that doesnt make sense if the money was paid back and her father was wealthy now he could certainly protect himself and he would have the law to the heart doesnt follow such reason he interrupted impatiently because if hed had the wit in his head at the time instead of fire in his blood hed have come to those same conclusions it was saving her that was my first thought and my last protecting her and yes perhaps by doing so having her love me the more i would take this cruel mans wealth and his position from him i vowed this and oh how her eyes shone diamonds of tears i would take what he had and lay it at her feet she would live like a queen and i would care for her all my life but stealing will you just listen exasperation hissed through his voice of course her chin lifted a little tilt of resentment i beg your pardon so this i did whistling the wind drawing down the moon kindling the cold fire this i did and did freely for her and the man woke freezing in a crofters cot instead of his fine manor house he woke in rags instead of his warm nightclothes i took his life from him without spilling a drop of blood and when it was done i stood in the smoldering dark of that last dawn triumphant he fell into silence a moment and when he continued his voice was raw the keepers encased me in a shield of crystal holding me there as i cursed them as i shouted my protests as i used the heart and innocence of my young maid as my defense for my crime and they showed me how she laughed as she gathered the wealth id sent to her as she leapt into a carriage laden with it and fell into the arms of the lover with whom shed plotted the ruin of the man she hated and my ruin as well but you loved her i did but the keepers dont count love as an excuse as a reason i was given a choice they would strip me of my power take away what was in my blood and make me merely human or i would keep it and live alone in a half world without companionship without human contact without the pleasures of the world that i in their estimation had betrayed thats cruel heartless so i claimed but it didnt sway them i took the second choice for they would not empty me i would not abjure my birthright here i have existed since that night of betrayal a hundred years times five with only one week each century to feel as a man does again i am a man kayleen with his hand still gripping hers he got to his feet drew her up am he murmured sliding his free hand into her hair fisting it there he lowered his head his lips nearly meeting hers then hesitated the sound of her breath catching releasing shivered through him she trembled under his hand and he felt inside himself the stumble of her heart quietly this time he murmured quietly and brushed his lips a whisper once twice over hers the flavor bloomed inside him like a first sip of fine wine he drank slowly even when her lips parted invited he drank slowly savoring the texture of her mouth the easy slide of tongues the faint faint scrape of teeth her body fit against his so lovely so perfect the heat from the moonstone held between their hands spread like sunlight and began to pulse so even drinking slowly he was drunk on her when he drew back her sigh all but shattered him a ghra weak wanting he lowered his brow to hers with a sigh of his own he tugged the pendant free her eyes soft loving clouded began to clear before the change was complete he pressed his mouth to hers one last time dream he said chapter contents prev next she woke to watery sunlight and the heady scent of roses there was a low fire simmering in the grate and a silk pillow under her head kayleen stirred and rolled over to snuggle in then shot up in bed like an arrow from a plucked bow my god it had really happened all of it and for lords sake for lords sake she was naked again had he given her drugs hypnotized her gotten her drunk what other reason could there be for her to have slept like a baby and naked as one in a bed in the house of a crazy man instinctively she snatched at the sheets to cover herself and then she saw the single white rose an incredibly sweet charmingly romantic crazy man she thought and picked up the rose before she could resist that story hed told her magic and betrayal and five hundred years of punishment hed actually believed it slowly she let out a breath so had she shed sat there listening and believing every word then hadnt seen a single thing odd about it but had felt sorrow and anger on his behalf then hed kissed her she remembered she pressed her fingertips to her lips stunned at her own behavior the man had kissed her had made her feel like rich cream being gently lapped out of a bowl more shed wanted him to kiss her had wanted a great deal more than that and perhaps she thought dragging the sheets higher there had been a great deal more than that she started to leap out of bed then changed her mind and crept out instead she had to get away quickly and quietly and to do so she needed clothes she tiptoed to the wardrobe wincing at the creak as she eased the door open it was one more shock to look inside and see silks and velvets satins and lace all in rich bold colors such beautiful things the kind of clothes she would covet but never buy so impractical so frivolous really so gorgeous shaking her head at her foolishness she snatched out her own practical trousers her torn sweater but it wasnt torn baffled she turned it over inside out searching for the jagged rip in the arm it wasnt there she hadnt imagined that tear she couldnt have imagined it because she was beginning to shake she dragged it over her head yanked the trousers on trousers that were pristine though they had been stained and muddy she dove into the wardrobe pushing through evening slippers kid boots and found her simple black flats flats that should have been well worn caked with dirt scarred just a little on the inside left where she had knocked against a chest the month before in her shop but the shoes were unmarked and perfect as if theyd just come out of the box she would think about it later shed think about it all later now she had to get away from here away from him away from whatever was happening to her her knees knocked together as she crept to the door eased it open and peeked out into the hallway she saw beautiful rugs on a beautiful floor paintings and tapestries on the walls more doors all closed and no sign of flynn she slipped out hurrying as quickly as she dared wild with relief she bolted down the stairs raced to the door yanked it open with both hands and barreling through ran straight into flynn good morning he grasped her shoulders steadying her even as he thought what a lovely thing it would be if shed been running toward him instead of away from him it seems weve done with the rain for now i was i just oh god i want to go check on my car of course you may want to wait till the mists burn off would you like your breakfast no no she made her lips curve id really like to see how badly i damaged the car so ill just go see and let you know then ill take you to it no really but he turned away whistled he took her hand ignoring her frantic tugs for release and led her down the steps out of the mists came a white horse at the gallop the charger of folklore with his mane flying his silver bridle ringing kayleen managed one short shriek as he arrowed toward them powerful legs shredding the mists magnificent head tossing he stopped inches from flynns feet blew softly then nuzzled flynns chest with a laugh flynn threw his arms around the horses neck with the same joy she thought that a boy might embrace a beloved dog he spoke to the horse in low tones crooning ones in what she now recognized as gaelic still grinning flynn eased back he lifted a hand flicked the wrist and the palm that had been empty now held a glossy red apple no i would never forget theres for my beauty he said and the horse dipped his head and nipped the apple neatly out of flynns palm his name is dilis it means faithful and he is with economical and athletic grace flynn vaulted into the saddle held down a hand for kayleen thank you all the same and hes very beautiful but i dont know how to ride ill just the words slid back down her throat as flynn leaned down gripped her arm and pulled her up in front of him as though she weighed less than a baby i know how to ride he assured her and tapped dilis lightly with his heels the horse reared and kayleens scream mixed with flynns laughter as the fabulous beast pawed the air then they were leaping forward and flying into the forest there was nothing to do but hold on she banded her arms around flynn buried her face in his chest it was insane absolutely insane she was an ordinary woman who led an ordinary life how could she be galloping through some irish forest on a great white horse plastered against a man who claimed to be a fifteenthcentury magician it had to stop and it had to stop now she lifted her head intending to tell him firmly to rein his horse in to let her off and let her go and all she did was stare the sun was slipping in fingers through the arching branches of the trees the air glowed like polished pearls beneath her the horse ran fast and smooth at a breathless surely a reckless pace and the man who rode him was the most magnificent man shed ever seen his dark hair flew his eyes glittered and that sadness he carried which was somehow its own strange appeal had lifted what she saw on his face was joy excitement delight challenge a dozen things and all of them strong and seeing them her heart beat as fast as the horses hooves oh my god it wasnt possible to fall in love with a stranger it didnt happen in the real world weakly she let her head fall back to his chest but maybe it was time to admit or at least consider that shed left the real world the evening before when shed taken that wrong turn into the forest dilis slowed to a canter stopped once again kayleen lifted her head this time her eyes met flynns this time he read what was in them as the pleasure of it rose in him he leaned toward her no dont she lifted her hand pressed it to his lips please his nod was curt as you wish he leapt off the horse plucked her down it appears your mode of transportation is less reliable than mine he said and turned her around the car had smashed nearly headlong into an oak the oak quite naturally had won the bout the hood was buckled back like an accordion the safety glass a surrealistic pattern of cracks the air bag had deployed undoubtedly saving her from serious injury shed been driving too fast for the conditions she remembered entirely too fast but how had she been driving at all that was the question that struck her now there was no road the car sat broken on what was no more than a footpath through the forest trees crowded in everywhere along with brambles and wild vines that bloomed with unearthly flowers and when she slowly turned in a circle she saw no route she could have maneuvered through them in the rain in the dark she saw no tracks from her tires in the damp ground there was no trace of her journey there was only the end of it cold she hugged her arms her sweater she thought wasnt ripped cautiously she pushed up the sleeve and there where shed been badly scraped and bruised her skin was smooth and unmarred she looked back at flynn he stood silently as his horse idly cropped at the ground temper was in his eyes and she could all but see the sparks of impatience shooting off him well she had a temper of her own if she was pushed far enough and her own patience was at an end what is this place she demanded striding up to him who the hell are you and what have you done how have you done it how the devil can i be here when i cant possibly be here that car she flung her hand out i couldnt have driven it here i couldnt have her arm dropped limply to her side how could i you know what i told you last night was the truth she did know with her anger burned away she did know it i need to sit down the grounds damp he caught her arm before she could just sink to the floor of the forest here then and he lowered her gently into a highbacked chair with a plump cushion of velvet thank you she began to laugh and burying her face in her hands shook with it thank you very much ive lost my mind completely lost my mind you havent but it would help us both considerably if youd open it a bit she lowered her hands she was not a hysterical woman and would not become one she no longer feared him however savagely handsome his looks hed done her no harm the fact was hed tended to her but facts were the problem werent they the fact that she couldnt be here but was that he couldnt exist yet did the fact that she felt what she felt without reason once upon a time she thought then drew a long breath i dont believe in fairy tales now then thats very sad why wouldnt you do you think any world can exist without magic where does the color come from and the beauty where are the miracles i dont know i dont have any answers either im having a very complex dream or im sitting in the woods in a she got to her feet to turn and examine the chair a marquetry side chair dutch i believe early eighteenth century very nice yes well she sat again im sitting here in this beautiful chair in a forest wrapped in mists having ridden here on that magnificent horse after having spent the night in a castle tisnt a castle really more a manor whatever with a man who claims to be more than five hundred years old five hundred and twentyeight if were counting really you wear it quite well a fivehundredandtwentyeightyearold magician who collects pez dispensers canny little things and i dont know how any of it can be true but i believe it i believe all of it because continuing to deny what i see with my own eyes makes less sense than believing it there he beamed at her i knew you were a sensible woman oh yes im very sensible very steady so i have to believe what i see even if its irrational if that which is rational exists that which is irrational must as well there is ever a balance to things kayleen well she sat calmly glancing around i believe in balance the air sparkled she could feel it on her face she could smell the deep dark richness of the woods she could hear the trill of birdsong she was where she was and so was he so im sitting in this lovely chair in an enchanted forest having a conversation with a fivehundredandtwentyeightyearold magician and if all that isnt crazy enough theres one more thing that tops it all off im in love with him the easy smile on his face faded what ran through him was so hot and tangled so full of layers and routes he couldnt breathe through it all ive waited for you through time through dreams through those small windows of life that are as much torture as treasure will you come to me now kayleen freely she got to her feet walked across the soft cushion of forest floor to him i dont know how i can feel like this i only know i do he pulled her into his arms and this time the kiss was hungry possessive when she pressed her body to his wound her arms around his neck he deepened the kiss took more filled himself with her her head spun and she reveled in the giddiness no one had ever wanted her not like this had ever touched her like this needed her desire was a hot spurt that fired the blood and made logic reason sanity laughable things she had magic what did she need of reason mine he murmured it against her mouth said it again and again as his lips raced over her face her throat then throwing his head back he shouted it shes mine now and ever i claim her as is my right when he lifted her off her feet lightning slashed across the sky the world trembled they rode through the forest he showed her a stream where golden fish swam over silver rocks where a waterfall tumbled down into a pool clear as blue glass he stopped to pick her wildflowers and thread them through her hair and when he kissed her it was soft and sweet his moods she thought were as magical as the rest of him and just as inexplicable he courted her making her laugh as he plucked baubles out of thin air and painted rainbows in the sky she could feel the breeze on her cheeks smell the flowers and the damp what was in her heart was like music fairy tales were real she thought all the years shed turned her back on them dismissed the happilyeverafter that her mother sighed over her own magic had been waiting for her nothing would ever could ever be the same again had she known it somehow deep inside had she known it had only been waiting that he had only been waiting for her to awake they walked or rode while birds chorused around them and mists faded away into brilliant afternoon there beside the pool he laid a picnic pouring wine out of his open hand to amuse her touching her hair her cheek her shoulders dozens of times as if the contact was as much reassurance as flirtation shed never had a romance never taken the time for one now it seemed a lifetime of love and anticipation could be fit into one perfect day he knew something about everything history culture art literature science it was a new thrill to realize that the man who held her heart who attracted her so completely appealed to her mind as well he could make her laugh make her wonder make her yearn and he brought her a contentment she hadnt known shed lived without if this was a dream she thought as twilight fell and they mounted the horse once more she hoped never to wake chapter contents prev next a perfect day deserved a perfect night she had thought hoped that when they returned from their outing he would take her inside take her to bed but he had only kissed her in that stirring way that made her weak and jittery and asked if she might like to change for the evening so she had gone up to her room to worry and wonder how a woman prepared after the most magical of days for the most momentous night of her life of one thing she was certain it wouldnt do to think if she let her thoughts take shape the doubts would creep in doubts about everything that had happened and about what would happen yet for once she would simply act she would simply be the bath that adjoined her room was a testament to modern luxury stepping from the bedchamber with its antiques and plush velvets into this sea of tile and glass was like stepping from one world into another which was she supposed something shed done already she filled the huge tub with water and scent and oil let the low hum of the motor and quiet jets relax her as she sank in up to her chin silvertopped pots sat on the long white counter from them she scooped out cream to smooth over her skin and watched herself in the steamhazed window this was the way women had prepared for a lover for centuries scenting and softening themselves for a mans hands for a mans mouth a womans magic she wouldnt be afraid she wouldnt let anxiety crowd out the pleasure in the wardrobe she found a long gown of silk in the color of ripe plums it slid over her body like sin and scooped low over her breasts she slipped her feet into silver slippers started to turn to the glass no she thought she didnt want to see herself reflected in a mirror she wanted to see herself reflected in flynns eyes he felt like a green youth all eager nerves and awkward moves in his day hed had quite a way with the ladies though five hundred years could certainly make a man rusty in certain areas hed had dreams but even in dreams he hadnt wanted so much how could he he thought as kayleen started down the staircase toward him dreams paled next to the power of her he reached out almost afraid that his hand would pass through her and leave him nothing but this yearning youre the most beautiful woman ive ever known tonight she linked her fingers with his everythings beautiful she stepped toward him and was confused when he stepped back i thought will you dance with me kayleen as he spoke the air filled with music candles hundreds of them spurted into flame the light was pale gold now and flowers blossomed down the walls turning the hall into a garden id love to she said and moved into his arms they waltzed in the great hall through the swaying candlelight and the perfume of roses that bloomed everywhere doors and windows sprang open welcoming the glow of moon and stars and the fragrance of the night thrilled kayleen threw back her head and let him sweep her in stirring circles its wonderful everythings wonderful how can you know how to waltz like this when there was no waltz in your time watching through dreams i see the world go by in them and i take what pleases me most ive danced with you in dreams kayleen you dont remember no she whispered i dont dream and if i do i never remember but ill remember this she smiled at him forever youre happy ive never in my life been so happy her hand slid from his shoulder along his neck to rest on his cheek the blue of her eyes deepened went dreamy flynn wine he said when fresh nerves kicked in his belly youll want wine no the music continued to swell as they stood i dont want wine supper then no her hand trailed over cupped the back of his neck not supper either she murmured and drew his mouth to hers you she breathed it only you kayleen hed intended to romance her charm her seduce her now she had done all of that to him i dont want to rush you ive waited so long without even knowing theres never been anyone else now i think there couldnt have been because there was you show me what its like to belong theres no woman ive touched who mattered theyre shadows beside you kayleen this he said and lifted her into his arms is real he carried her through the music and candlelight up the grand stairs and though she felt his arms the beat of his heart it was like floating here is where i dreamed of you in the night he took her into his bedchamber where the bed was covered with red silk and the petals of white roses where candles stood flaming and the fire shimmered and here is where ill love you this first time flesh to flesh he set her on her feet i wont hurt you that i can promise ill give you only pleasure im not afraid then be with me he cupped her face in his hands laid his lips on hers in dreams there had been longing and echoes of sensations here and now with those mists parted there was so much more gently so gently his mouth took from hers warmth and wanting with tenderness and patience his hands moved over her soft and seductive when she trembled he soothed murmuring her name and promises he slid the gown off her shoulders trailed kisses over that curve of flesh and thrilled to the flavor and the fragrance let me see you now lovely kayleen he skimmed his lips along her throat as he eased the gown down her body when it pooled at her feet he stepped back and looked his fill there was no shyness in her the heat that rose up to bloom on her skin was anticipation the tremble that danced through her was delight when his gaze finished its journey and his eyes locked on hers he reached out caressed the curve of her breast let them both absorb the sensation when his fingertips trailed down he felt her quiver under his touch she reached for him her hands not quite steady as she unbuttoned his shirt and when she touched him it was like freedom a ghra he pulled her against him crushed her mouth with his lost himself in the needs that stormed through him his hands raced over her took sought more until she gasped out his name too fast too much god help him he fought back through the pounding in his blood gentled his movements chained the raw need when he lifted her again laid her on the bed his kiss was long and slow and gentle this she thought was what the poets wrote of this was why a man or a woman would reject reason for even the chance of love this warmth this pleasure of anothers body against your own this gift of heart and all the sighs and secrets it offered he gave her pleasure as he had promised drowning floods of it that washed through her in slow waves she could have lain steeped in it forever she gave to him a taste a touch so that sensation pillowed the aches he savored and lingered and held fast to the beauty she offered when flames licked at the edges of warmth she welcomed them the pretty clouds that had cushioned her began to thin falling through them she cried out a sound of triumph as her heart burst inside her and heard him moan heard the quick whispers a kind of incantation as he rose over her through the candlelight and the shimmer of her own vision she saw his face his eyes so green now they were like dark jewels swamped with love she laid a hand on his cheek murmured his name look at me aye at me his breath wanted to tear out of his lungs his body begged to plunge only pleasure he took her innocence filled her and gave her the joy she opened for him rose with him her eyes swimming with shocked delight and with the love he craved like breath and this time when she fell he gathered himself and plunged after her her body shimmered she was certain that if she looked in the mirror she would see it was golden and his she thought trailing a hand lazily up and down his back his was so beautiful strong and hard and smooth his heart was thundering against hers still what a fantastic sensation that was to be under the weight of the man you loved and feel his heart race for you perhaps that was why her mother kept searching kept risking for this one moment of bliss love kayleen thought changes everything and she loved was loved she repeated that over and over in her head she was loved it didnt matter that he hadnt said it in those precise words he couldnt look at her as he did couldnt touch her as he did and not love her a woman didnt change her life believe in spells and fairy tales after years of denial and not be given the happy ending flynn loved her that was all she needed to know why do you worry she blinked herself back what i feel it inside you he lifted his head and studied her face the worry no its only that everythings different now so much is happening to me in so little time she brushed her fingers through his hair and smiled but its not worry i want your happiness kayleen i know and wasnt that love after all i know and laughing she threw her arms around him and you have it you make me ridiculously happy theres often not enough ridiculous in a life he pulled her up with him so they were sitting tangled together on silk roses so lets have a bit the stone in his pendant glowed brighter as he grinned he fisted his hands shot them open in a wink the bed around them was covered with platters of food and bottles of wine it made her jolt she wondered if such things always would angling her head she lifted a glass id rather champagne if you please well then she watched the glass fill bottom to top with the frothy wine and laughing she toasted him and drank it down chapter contents prev next all of her life kayleen had done the sensible thing as a child shed tidied her room without being reminded studied hard in school and turned in all assignments in a timely fashion she had grown into a woman who was never late for an appointment spent her money wisely and ran the family business with a cool clear head looking back through the veil of what had been kayleen decided she had certainly been one of the most tedious people on the face of the planet how could she have known there was such freedom in doing the ridiculous or the impulsive or the foolish she said as much to flynn as she lay sprawled over him on the bed of velvety flowers you couldnt be tedious oh but i could she lifted her head from his chest she wore nothing but her smile with its dimple and flowers in her hair i was the queen of tedium i set my alarm for six oclock every morning even when i didnt have to get up for work i even set alarms when i was on vacation because you didnt want to miss anything no because one must maintain discipline i walked to work every day rain or shine along the exact same route this was after making my bed and eating a balanced breakfast of course she slithered down so that she could punctuate her words with little kisses over his shoulders and chest i arrived at the shop precisely thirty minutes before opening in order to see to the morning paperwork and check any displays that might require updating thirty minutes for a proper lunch fifteen minutes exactly at four for a cup of tea then close shop and walk home by that same route she worked her way up his throat mmmm watched the news during dinner must keep up with current affairs read a chapter of a good book before bed except for wednesdays wednesdays i went wild and took in an interesting film and on my half day i would go over to my mothers to lecture her though her pretty mouth was quite a distraction he paid attention to her words and the tone of them you lectured your mother oh yes she nibbled at his ear my beautiful frivolous delightful mother how i must have irritated her shes been married three times engaged double that at least it never works out and shes heartbroken about it for oh about an hour and a half with a laugh kayleen lifted her head again thats not fair of course but she manages to shake it all off and never lose her optimism about love she forgets to pay her bills misses appointments never knows the correct time and has never been known to be able to find her keys shes wonderful you love her very much yes very much sighing now kayleen pillowed her head on flynns shoulder i decided when i was very young that it was my job to take care of her that was after her husband number two he combed his fingers through her flowerbedecked hair did you lose your father no but you could say he lost us he left us when i was six i suppose you could call him frivolous too which was yet another motivation for me to be anything but he never settled into the family business well or into marriage or into fatherhood i hardly remember him he stroked her hair said nothing but he was beginning to worry were you happy in that life i wasnt unhappy brennans was important to me maybe all the more so because it wasnt important to my father he shrugged off the tradition of it the responsibility of it as carelessly as he shrugged off his wife and his daughter and hurt you at first then i stopped letting it hurt me did you flynn wondered or is that just one more pretense i thought everything had to be done a certain way to be done right if you do things right people dont leave she said softly and youll know exactly whats going to happen next my uncle and grandfather gradually let me take over the business because i had a knack for it and they were proud of that my mother let me handle things at home because well shes just too goodnatured not to she sighed again snuggled into him shes going to get married again next month and shes thrilled one of the reasons i took this trip now is because i wanted to get away from it from those endless plans for yet another of her happy endings i suppose i hurt her feelings leaving the way i did but id have hurt them more if id stayed and spoke my mind you dont like the man shell marry no hes perfectly nice my mothers fiancés are always perfectly nice funny since ive been here i havent worried about her at all and i imagine somehow shes managing just fine without me picking at her the shops undoubtedly running like clockwork and the world continues to spin odd to realize i wasnt indispensable after all to me you are he wrapped his arms around her rolled over so he could look down at her youre vital to me thats the most wonderful thing anyones ever said to me it was better wasnt it she asked herself even better than i love you i dont know what time it is or even what day i dont need to know ive never eaten supper in bed unless i was ill never danced in a forest in the moonlight never made love in a bed of flowers ive never known what it was like to be so free happy kayleen he took her mouth a little desperately youre happy i love you flynn how could i be happier he wanted to keep her loving him keep her happy he wanted to keep her beautifully naked and steeped in pleasures more than anything he wanted to keep her the hours were whizzing by so quickly tumbling into days so that he was losing track of time himself what did time matter now to either of them he could give her anything she wanted here anything and everything what would she miss of the life she had outside it was ordinary and tedious hadnt she said so herself he would see that she never missed what had been before long she wouldnt even think of it the life before would be the dream he taught her to ride and she was fearless when he thought of how shed clung to him in terror when hed pulled her up onto dilis the first time he rationalized the change by saying she was simply quick to learn he hadnt changed her basic nature or forced her will that was beyond his powers and the most essential rule of magic when she galloped off into the forest her laughter streaming behind her he told himself he let his mind follow her only to keep her from harm yet he knew deep inside himself that if she traveled near the edge of his world he would pull her back he had that right flynn thought as his hands fisted at his sides he had claimed her what he claimed during his imprisonment was his to keep that is the law he threw his head back scowling up at the heavens it is your law she came to me by rights of magic by the law of this place she is mine no power can take her from me when the sky darkened when lightning darted at the black edges of clouds flynn stood in the whistling wind feet planted in challenge his hair blew wild around his face his eyes went emeraldbright and the power that was his that could not be taken from him shimmered around him like silver in his mind he saw kayleen astride the white horse she glanced uneasily at the gathering storm shivered in the fresh chill of the wind and turned her mount to ride back to him she was laughing again as she raced out of the trees that was wonderful she threw her arms recklessly in the air so that flynn gripped the halter to keep dilis steady i want to ride every day i cant believe the feeling feeling he thought with a vicious tug of guilt was the one thing he wouldnt be able to offer her much longer come darling he lifted his arms up to her well put dilis down for the night a storms coming she welcomed it too the wind the rain the thunder it stirred something in her some whippy thrill that made her feel reckless and bold when flynn set the fire to blaze with a twist of his hand her eyes danced i dont suppose you could teach me to do that he glanced back at her the faintest of smiles the slightest lift of brow i cant no but youve your own magic kayleen have i it binds me to you as ive been bound to no other i will give you a boon any that you ask that is in my power to give any a smile played around her mouth now as she looked up at him from under her lashes the blatantly flirtatious move came to her much more naturally than shed anticipated well thats quite an offer ill have to consider very carefully before making any decision she wandered the room trailing a fingertip over the back of the sofa over the polished gleam of a table would that offer include say the sun and the moon look at her he thought she grows more beautiful by the hour such as these he held out his hands from them dripped a string of luminous white pearls with a clasp of diamonds she laughed even as her breath caught those arent bad as an example theyre magnificent flynn but i didnt ask for diamonds or pearls then i give them freely he crossed to her laid the necklace over her head for the pleasure of seeing you wear them ive never worn pearls surprised by the delight they brought her she lifted them let them run like moonbeams through her fingers they make me feel regal holding them out she turned a circle while the diamond clasp exploded with light where do they come from do you just picture them in your mind and poof poof he decided she hadnt meant that as an insult more or less i suppose they exist and i move them from one place to another from there to here whatever is that has no will i can bring here and keep nothing with heart or soul can be taken but the rest its sapphires im thinking that suit you best as kayleen blinked a string of rich black pearls clasped with brilliant sapphires appeared around her neck oh ill never get used to move them she looked back at him you mean take them mmm he turned to pour glasses of wine but catching her bottom lip between her teeth she looked around the room the gorgeous antiques the modern electronics which shed noticed ran without electricity the glamour of ming vases the foolishness of pop art almost nothing in the room would have existed when hed been banished here flynn where do all these things come from your television set your piano the furniture and rugs and art the food and wine all manner of places how does it work she took the wine from him i mean is it like replicating do you copy a thing perhaps if ive a mind to it takes a bit more time and trouble for that process you have to know the innards so to speak and the composition and all matter of scientific business to make it come right easier by far just to transport it but if you just transport it if you just take it from one place and bring it here thats stealing im not a thief the idea im a magician the laws arent the same for us patience was one of her most fundamental virtues werent you punished initially because you took something from someone that was entirely different i changed a life for anothers gain and i was perhaps a bit rash not that it deserved such a harsh sentence how do you know what lives youve changed by bringing these here she held up the pearls or any of the other things if you take someones property it causes change doesnt it and at the core of it its just stealing not without regret she lifted the jewels over her head now you have to put these back where you got them i wont fully insulted now he slammed his glass down you would reject a gift from me yes if it belongs to someone else flynn im a merchant myself how would i feel to open my shop one morning and find my property gone it would be devastating a violation and beyond that which is difficult enough the inconvenience id have to file a police report an insurance claim thered be an investigation and those are problems that dont exist here he interrupted you cant apply your ordinary logic to magic magic is right is flynn and even magic cant negate whats right these may be heirlooms they may mean a great deal to someone even beyond their monetary value i cant accept them she laid the pearls the glow and the sparkle on the table you have no knowledge of what governs me the air began to tremble with his anger no right to question whats inside me your world hides from mine century by century building its pale layers of reason and denial you come here and in days you stand in judgment of what you cant begin to comprehend i dont judge you flynn but your actions the wind had come into the room it blew over her face through her hair and it was cold though her belly quaked she lifted her chin power shouldnt take away human responsibility it should add to it im surprised you havent learned that in all the time youve had to think his eyes blazed he threw out his arms and the room exploded with sound and light she stumbled back but managed to regain her balance managed to swallow a cry when the air cleared again the room was empty but for the two of them this is what i might have if i lived by your rules nothing no comfort no humanity only empty rooms where even the echoes are lifeless five hundred years of alone and i should worry that another whose life comes and goes in a blink might do without a lamp or a painting yes temper snapped off him little flames of gold then he vanished before her eyes what had she done panicked she nearly called out for him then realized he would hear only what he chose to hear shed driven him away she thought sinking down in misery to sit on the bare floor driven him away with her rigid stance on right and wrong her own unbending rules of conduct just as she had kept so many others at a distance most of her life shed preached at him she admitted with a sigh this incredible man with such a magnificent gift she had wagged her finger at him just the way she wagged it at her mother taken on as she habitually did the role of adult to the child it seemed that not even magic could burn that irritating trait out of her not even love could overcome it now she was alone in an empty room alone as she had been for so long flynn thought he had a lock on loneliness she thought with a half laugh shed made a career out of alone she drew up her knees rested her forehead on them the worst of it she realized was that even now sad angry aching she believed she was right it wasnt a hell of a lot of comfort chapter contents prev next it took him hours to work off his temper he walked he paced he raged he brooded when temper had burned off he sulked though if anyone had put this term on his condition hed have swung hard back into temper again shed hurt him when anger cleared away enough for that realization to surface it came as a shock the woman had cut him to the bone shed rejected his gift questioned his morality and criticized his powers all in one lump in his day such a swipe from a mere woman would have he cursed and paced some more it wasnt his day and if there was one thing hed learned to adjust to it was the changes in attitudes and sensibilities women stood toetotoe with men in this age and in his readings and viewings over the years hed come to believe they had the right of it he was hardly steeped in the old ways hadnt he embraced technology with each new development hadnt he amused himself with the quirks of society and fashion and mores as they shifted and changed and became and hed taken from each of those shifts what appealed most what sat best with him he was a wellread man had been well read and well traveled even in his own time and since that time hed studied science history electronics engineering art music literature politics he had hardly stopped using his mind over the last five hundred years the fact was he rarely had the chance to use anything else so he used it now and went over the argument in his head she didnt understand he decided magic wasnt bound by the rules of her world but by itself it was and that was all no conscientious magician brought harm to another deliberately that was certain all hed done was take a few examples of technology of art and comfort from various points in time he could hardly be expected to live in a bloody cave could he stealing why the very idea of it he sat on a chair in his workshop and indulged in more brooding it wasnt meant to be stealing he thought now magicians had moved matter from place to place since the beginning of things and what were jewels but pretty bits of matter then he sighed he supposed they were considerably more from her point of view and hed wanted her to see them as more hed wanted her to be dazzled and delighted and dote on him for the gift of them much as he had he admitted wanted to dazzle and delight the woman whod betrayed him or to be honest the woman whod tempted him to betray himself and his art that woman had greedily gathered what hed given what hed taken and left him to hang what had kayleen done had she been overpowered by the glitter and the richness seduced by them not in the least shed tossed them back in his face stood up for what she believed was right and just stood up to him his lips began to curve with the image of that he hadnt expected her to he could admit that shed looked him in the eye said her piece and stuck to it god what a woman his kayleen was strong and true not a bauble to ride on a mans arm but a partner to stand tall with him that was a grand thing for while a man might indulge himself in a pretty piece of fluff for a time it was a woman he wanted for a lifetime he got to his feet studied his workroom well a woman was what he had hed best figure out how to make peace with her kayleen considered having a good cry but it just wasnt like her she settled instead for hunting up the kitchen which was no easy task on the search she discovered flynn had chosen to make his point with only that one empty room the rest of the house was filled to brimming and in his fascinatingly eclectic style she softened by the time she brewed tea in a kitchen equipped with a restaurantstyle refrigerator a microwave oven and a stone fireplace in lieu of stove it took her considerable time to get the fire going and to heat water in the copper pot but it made her smile how could she blame him really for wanting things around him pretty things interesting things he was a man who needed to use his mind amuse himself challenge himself wasnt that the man shed fallen in love with she carried the tea into the library with its thousands of books its scrolls its manuscripts and its deepcushioned leather chairs and snappy personal computer she would light the fire and enough candles to read by then enjoy her tea and the quiet kneeling at the hearth she tried to light the kindling and managed to scorch the wood she rearranged the logs lodged a splinter painfully in her thumb and tried again she created a hesitant little flame and a great deal of smoke which the wind cheerfully blew back in her face she hissed at it sucked on her throbbing thumb then sat on her heels to think it through and the flames burst into light and heat she set her teeth fought the urge to turn around i can do it myself thank you as you wish lady the fire vanished but for the smoke she coughed waved it away from her face then got to her feet its warm enough without one id say its unnaturally chilly at the moment he walked up behind her took her hand in his youve hurt yourself its only a splinter dont she said when he lifted it to his lips being strongminded and being contrary are two different matters he touched his lips to her thumb and the throbbing eased but not contrary enough i notice to ignore the comforts of a cup of tea a book and a pleasant chair i wasnt going to stand in an empty room wringing my hands while you worked out your tantrum he lifted his eyebrows disconcerting isnt it emptiness she tugged her hand free of his all right yes and i have no true conception of what youve dealt with nor any right to criticize how you compensate but right is right he finished this place and what i possessed was all i had when first i came here i could fill it with things the things that appealed to me thats what i did i wont apologize for it i dont want an apology no you want something else entirely he opened his hands and the rich loops of pearls gleamed in them flynn dont ask me to take them i am asking i give you this gift kayleen theyre replicas and belong to no one but me until they belong to you her throat closed as he placed them around her neck you made them for me perhaps id grown a bit lazy over the years it took me a little longer to conjure them than it might have but it made me remember the pleasure of making theyre more beautiful than the others and much more precious and heres a tear he murmured and caught it on his fingertip as it spilled onto her cheek if it falls from happiness it will shine if its from sorrow it will turn to ashes see the drop glimmered on his finger shimmered then solidified into a diamond in the shape of a tear and this is your gift to me he drew the pendant from beneath his shirt passed his hand over it the diamond drop sparkled now beneath the moonstone ill wear it near my heart ever she leapt into his arms clung to his neck i missed you i let temper steal hours from us so did i she leaned back weve had our first fight im glad now we never have to have a first one again but others well have to she kissed his cheek theres so much we dont understand about each other and even when we do we wont always agree ah my sensible kayleen no dont frown he said tipping up her chin i like your mind it stimulates my own it annoyed you at the first of it he circled her around lighting the fire the candles as he did and i spent a bit of time pondering on how much more comfortable life would be if youd just be biddable and agree with everything i said and did yes flynn my darling you would say no indeed my handsome flynn oh really but then id miss that battle light in your eyes wouldnt i and the way your lovely mouth goes firm makes me want to he nipped her bottom lip but thats another kind of stimulation altogether im willing to fight with you kayleen as long as youre willing to make up again with me and im willing to have you stomp off in a temper i didnt stomp metaphorically speaking as long as you come back she laid her head on his shoulder closed her eyes the storms passed she murmured moonlights shining through the windows so it is he scooped her up i have the perfect way to celebrate our first fight he closed her hand over his pendant would you like to fly kayleen fly but and she was soaring through the air through the night air swirled around her then seemed to go fluid so it was like cutting clean through a dark sea the stone pulsed against her palm she cried out in surprise and then in delight reaching out as if she could snatch one of the stars that shone around her fearless flynn thought even now or perhaps it was more a thirst for all the times shed denied herself a drink when she turned her face to his her eyes brighter than the jewels brighter than the stars he spun her in dizzying circles they landed in a laughing tumble to roll over the soft cushion of grass by the side of his blue waterfall oh that was amazing can we do it again soon enough here he lifted a hand and a plump peach balanced on the tips of his fingers you havent eaten your supper i wasnt hungry before charmed she took the peach bit into the sweetness so many stars she murmured lying back again to watch them were we really flying up there its a kind of manipulation of time and space and matter its magic thats enough isnt it its everything the worlds magic now but youre cold he said when she shivered mmm only a little even as she spoke the air warmed almost seemed to bloom i confess it he leaned over to kiss her i stole a bit of warmth from here and there but i dont think anyone will miss it i dont want you chilled can it always be like this there was a hitch in his chest it can be what we make it do you miss what was before no but she lowered her lashes so he was unable to read her eyes do you i mean the people you knew your family theyve been gone a long time was it hard she sat up handed him the peach knowing youd never be able to see them again or talk to them or even tell them where you were i dont remember but he did this was the first lie hed told her he remembered that the pain of it had been like death im sorry she touched his shoulder it hurts you it fades he pushed away got to his feet all of that is beyond and it fades its the illusion and this is all thats real all that matters all that matters is here flynn she rose hoping to comfort but when he spun back his eyes were hot bright and the desire in them robbed her of breath i want you a hundred lifetimes from now ill want you its enough for me is it enough for you im here she held out her hands and i love you its more than i ever dreamed of having i can give you more you still have a boon then ill keep it until i need more because hed yet to take her offered hands she cupped his face in them ive never touched a man like this with love and desire do you think flynn that because ive never felt them before i dont understand the wonder of knowing them now of feeling them now for one man ive watched my mother search all of her life be willing to risk heartbreak for the chance just the chance of feeling what i do right at this moment shes the most important person to me outside this world youve made and i know shed be thrilled to know what ive found with you then when you ask me for your hearts desire ill move heaven and earth to give it to you thats my vow i have my hearts desire she smiled stepped back tell me yours not tonight tonight i have plans for you that dont involve conversation oh and what might they be well to begin he lifted a hand and traced one finger down through the air between them her clothes vanished chapter contents prev next oh this time she instinctively covered herself you might have warned me ill have you bathed in moonlight and dressed in starshine she felt a tug gentle but insistent on her hands her arms lowered spread out as if drawn by silken rope flynn let me touch you he kept his eyes on hers as he stepped forward as he traced his fingertips down her throat over the swell of her breasts excite you he took her mouth in quick little bites possess you something slid through her mind her body at the same time a coiled snake of heat that bound both together the rise of it so fast so sharp slashed through her she hadnt the breath to cry out she could only moan he had barely touched her how can you how could i i want to show you more this time now his hands were on her rough and insistent her skin was so soft so fragrant in the moonlight it gleamed so that wherever he touched the warmth bloomed on it roses on silk i want to take more this time for a second time he took her flying though her feet never left the ground she spun through the air a fast reckless journey his mouth was on her devouring flesh she had no choice but to let him feed and his greed erased her past reason so that her one desire was to be consumed abandoning herself to it she let her head fall back murmuring his name like a chant as he ravished her he mated his mind with hers thrilling to every soft cry every throaty whimper she stood open to him in the moonlight soaked with pleasure and shuddering from its heat and such was his passion for her that his fingers left trails of gold over her damp flesh trails that pulsed binding her in tangled ribbons of pleasure when his mouth found hers again the flavor exploded sharp and sweet drunk on her he lifted them both off the ground now freed her arms came tight around him her nails scraping as she sought to hold sought to find she was hot against him wet against him her hips arching in rising demand he drove himself into her one desperate thrust then another another with her answering beat for urgent beat he let the animal inside him spring free his mind emptied but for her and that primal hunger they shared the forest echoed with a call of triumph as that hunger swallowed them both she lay limp useless used a thousand wild horses could have stampeded toward her and she wouldnt have moved a muscle the way flynn had collapsed on her and now lay like the dead she imagined he felt the same im so sorry she said on a long long sigh sorry he slid his hand through the grass until it covered hers umm so sorry for the women who dont have you for a lover he made a sound that might have been a chuckle generous of you mavourneen i prefer being smug that im the only man whos had the delights of you i saw stars and not the ones up there so did i youre the only one whos given me the stars he stirred pressing his lips to the side of her breast before lifting his head and you give me an appetite as well for all manner of succulent things i suppose that means you want your supper and we have to go back we have to do nothing but what pleases us what would you like at the moment id settle for some water ive never been so thirsty water is it he angled his head grinned that i can give you and plenty he gathered her up and rolled she managed a scream and he a wild laugh as they tumbled off the bank and hit the water of the pool with a splash it seemed miraculous to kayleen how much she and flynn had in common considering the circumstance and all that differed between them it was an amazing thing that they found any topic to discuss or explore but then flynn hadnt sat idle for five hundred years his love of something well made even if its purpose was only for beauty struck home with her all of her life shed been exposed to craftsmanship and aesthetics the history of a table the societal purpose of an enameled snuffbox or the heritage of a serving platter the few pieces shed allowed herself to collect were special to her not only because of their beauty but also because of their continuity she and flynn had enjoyed many of the same books and films though he had read and viewed far more for the simple enjoyment of it than she he listened to her posing questions about various phases of her life until she was picking them apart for him and remembering events and things shed seen or done or experienced that shed long ago forgotten no one had ever been so interested in her before in who she was and what she thought what she felt if he didnt agree he would lure her into a debate or tease her into exploring a lighter side of herself rarely given expression it seemed she did the same for him nudging him out of his brooding silences or leaving him be until the mood had passed on its own but whenever she made a comment or asked a question about the future those silences lasted long so she wouldnt ask she told herself she didnt need to know what had planning and preciseness gotten her really but a life of sameness whatever happened when the week was up god why couldnt she remember what day it was she would be content for now every moment was precious hed given her so much smiling she wandered the house running her fingers along the exquisite pearls which she hadnt taken off since hed put them around her neck not the gifts she thought though she treasured them but romance possibilities and above all a vision she had never seen so clearly before love answered all questions what could she give him gifts she had nothing what little she still possessed was in the car shed left abandoned in the wood there was so little there really of the woman shed become and was still becoming she wanted to do something for him something that would make him smile food delighted with the idea she hurried back toward the kitchen shed never known anyone to appreciate a single bite of apple as much as flynn of course since there wasnt any stove she hadnt a clue what she could prepare but she swung into the kitchen stopped short in astonishment there certainly was one beauty of a stove now white and gleaming all shed done was mutter about having to boil water for tea over a fire and poof hed made a stove well she thought and pushed up her sleeves she would see just what she could do with it in his workroom flynn gazed through one of his windows on the world hed intended to focus on kayleens home so that he could replicate some of her things for her he knew what it was to be without what you had what had mattered to you for a time he lost himself there moving his mind through the rooms where she had once lived studying the way shed placed her furniture what books were on her shelves what colors shed favored how tidy it all was he thought with a great surge in his heart everything so neatly in place and so tastefully done did it upset her sense of order to be in the midst of his hodgepodge he would ask her they could make some adjustments but why the hell hadnt the woman had more color around her and look at the clothes in the closet all of them more suited to a spinster no that wasnt the word used well these days plain attire without the richness of fabric and the brilliance of color that so suited his kayleen she would damn well leave them behind if he had any say in it but she would want her photographs and that lovely pier glass there and that lamp he began to set them in his mind the shape and dimensions the tone and texture so deep was his concentration that he didnt realize the image had changed until the woman crossed his vision she walked through the rooms her hands clasped tightly together a lovely woman he noted smaller than kayleen fuller at the breasts and hips but with the same coloring she wore her dark hair short and it swung at her cheeks as she moved compelled he opened the window wider and heard her speak oh baby where are you why havent you called its almost a week why cant we find you oh kayleen she picked up a photograph from a table pressed it to her please be all right please be okay with the picture hugged to her heart she dropped into a chair and began to weep flynn slammed the window shut and turned away he would not be moved he would not time was almost up in little more than twentyfour hours the choice would be behind him behind them all he closed his mind to a mothers grief but he wasnt fully able to close his heart his mood was edgy when he left the workroom he meant to go outside to walk it off perhaps to whistle up dilis and ride it off but he heard her singing hed never heard her sing before a pretty voice he thought but it was the happiness in it that drew him back to the kitchen she was stirring something on the stove something in the big copper kettle that smelled beyond belief it had been a very long time since hed come into a kitchen where cooking was being done but he was nearly certain that was what had just happened since it was almost too marvelous to believe he decided to make sure of it kayleen what are you about there oh her spoon clattered fell out of her hand and plopped into the pot damn it flynn you startled me now look at that ive drowned the spoon in the sauce sauce i thought id make spaghetti you have a very unusual collection of ingredients in your kitchen peanut butter pickled herring enough chocolate to make an entire elementary school hyper for a month however i managed to find plenty of herbs and some lovely ripe tomatoes so this seemed the safest bet plus you have ten pounds of spaghetti pasta kayleen are you cooking for me i know it must seem silly as you can snap up a fivestar meal for yourself without breaking a sweat but theres something to be said for home cooking im a very good cook i took lessons though ive never attempted to make sauce in quite such a pot it should be fine the pots wrong oh well id do better with my own cookware but i think ive made do you had plenty of fresh vegetables in your garden so i just give me a few moments wont you ill need a bit of time and before she could answer he was gone well she shook her head and went back to trying to save the spoon she had everything under control again had adjusted the heat to keep the sauce at low simmer when a clatter behind her made her jolt the spoon plopped back into the sauce oh for heavens sake she turned around then stumbled back there was a pile of pots and pans on the counter beside her i replicated them flynn said with a grin which took me a little longer but i didnt want to argue with you about it then you might not feed me my pots she fell on them with the enthusiasm of a mother for lost children more enthusiasm flynn realized as she chattered and held up each pan and lid to examine than shed shown for the jewels hed given her because they were hers something that belonged to her something from her world and his heart grew heavy this is going to be good she stacked the cookware neatly selected the proper pot i know it must seem a waste of time and effort to you she said as she transferred the sauce but cookings a kind of art its certainly an occupation im used to being busy a few days of leisure is wonderful but id go crazy after a while with nothing to do now i can cook while the sauce simmered in the twentyfirstcentury pot she carried the ancient kettle to the sink to wash it and dazzle you with my brilliance she added with a quick laughing glance over her shoulder you already dazzle me well just wait i was thinking as i was putting all this together that i could spend weeks months really organizing around here not having a pattern is one thing but having no order at all is another you could use a catalogue system for your books and some of the rooms are just piled with things i dont imagine you even know what there is you could use a listing of your art and the antiques your music you have the most extensive collection of antique toys ive ever seen when we have children she trailed off her hands fumbling in the soapy water children could they have children what were the rules might she even now be pregnant theyd done nothing to prevent conception or she hadnt she thought pressing her lips together how could she know what he might have done listen to me she shook her hair back briskly rinsed the pot old habits lists and plans and procedures the only plan we need right now is what sort of dressing i should make for the salad kayleen no no this is my performance here youll just have to find something to do until curtain time she heard the sorrow in his voice the regret and had her answers everything should be ready in an hour so out she turned smiling shooing at him but her voice was too thick ill go and tend to dilis then good thats fine he left the room waited when the tear fell from her eye he brought it from her cheek into his palm and watched it turn to ashes chapter contents prev next he brought her flowers for the table and they ate her meal with the candles glowing he touched her often just a brash of fingers on the back of her hand a dozen sensory memories stored for a endless time of longing he made her laugh to hear the sound of it and store that as well he asked her questions only to hear her voice the rise and fall of it when the meal was done he walked with her to see how the moonlight shone in her hair late into the night he made love with her as tenderly as he knew how and knew it was for the last time when she slept when he sent her deep into easy dreams he was resolved and he was content with what needed to be done she dreamed but the dreams werent easy ones she was lost in the forest swallowed by the mists that veiled the trees and smothered the path light shimmered through it so drops of moisture glittered like jewels jewels that melted away at the touch of her hand and left her nothing she could hear sounds footsteps voices even music but they seemed to come from underwater drowning sounds that never took substance no matter how hard she tried to find the source she could come no closer the shapes of trees were blurred the color of the flowers deadened when she tried to call out her voice seemed to carry no farther than her own ears she began to run afraid of being lost and being alone she only had to find the way out there was always a way out and her way back to him as panic gushed inside her she tried to tear the mists away ripping at them with her fingers beating at them with her fists but her hands only passed through and the curtain stayed whole finally through it she saw the faint shadow of the house the spear of its turrets the sweep of its battlements were softened like wax in the thick air she ran toward it sobbing with relief then with joy as she saw him standing by the massive doors she ran to him now her arms flung out to embrace her lips curved for that welcoming kiss when her arms passed through him she understood he was the mist and so was she she woke weeping and reaching out for him but the bed beside her was cold and empty she shivered though the fire danced cheerfully to warm the room a dream just a dream that was all but she was cold and she got out of bed to wrap herself in the thick blue robe where was flynn she wondered they always woke together almost as if they were tied to each others rhythms she glanced out the windows as she walked toward the fire to warm her chilled hands the sun was beaming and bright which explained why flynn hadnt been wrapped around her when she woke shed slept away the morning imagine that she thought with a laugh slept away the morning dreamed away the night it was so unlike her so unlike her she thought again as her hands stilled dreaming she never remembered her dreams not even in jumbled pieces yet this one she remembered exactly in every detail almost as though shed lived it because she was relaxed she assured herself because her mind was relaxed and open people were always saying how real dreams could be werent they shed never believed that until now if hers were going to be that frightening that heartbreaking shed just as soon skip them but it was over and it was a beautiful day there were no mists blanketing the trees the flowers were basking in the sunlight their colors vibrant and true the clouds that so often stacked themselves in layers over the irish sky had cleared leaving a deep and brilliant blue she would pick flowers and braid them into diliss mane flynn would give her another riding lesson later perhaps shed begin on the library it would be fun to prowl through all the books to explore them and arrange them she would not be obsessive about it she wouldnt fall into that trap again the chore would be one of pleasure rather than responsibility throwing open the windows she leaned out breathed in the sweet air ive changed so much already she murmured i like the person im becoming i can be friends with her she shut her eyes tight mom i wish i could tell you im so much in love he makes me so happy i wish i could let you know and tell you that i understand now i wish i could share this with you with a sigh she stepped back leaving the windows open he kept himself busy it was the only way he could get through the day in his mind in his heart hed said goodbye to her the night before hed already let her go there was no choice but to let her go he could have kept her with him drawing her into the long days the endless nights of the next dreaming his solitude would be broken the loneliness diminished and at the end of it she would be there for that brief week to touch to be the need for her the desire to have her close was the strongest force hed ever known but for one love not just with the silken beauty of the dreams hed shared with her but with the pains and joys that came from a beating heart he would not deny her life steal from her what she had known what she would be how had he ever believed he could had he really thought that his own needs the most selfish and selfserving of them outweighed the most basic of hers to live to feel heat and cold hunger thirst pleasure and pain to watch herself change with the years to shake the hand of a stranger embrace a loved one to make children and watch them grow for all his power all his knowledge he could give her none of those things all he had left for her was the gift of freedom to comfort himself he pressed his face to diliss neck drew in the scents of horse and straw of oat and leather how was it he could forget each time forget the wrenching misery of these last hours the sheer physical pain of knowing it was all ending again he was ending again youve always been free you know i have no claim to keep you here should you choose to go he lifted his head stroking the stallions head as he looked into his eyes carry her away safe for me and if you go beyond ill not count it against you he stepped back drew his breath there was work yet and the morning was passing fast when it was done the last spell the thin blanket of forget spread at the edges of his prison he saw kayleen in his minds eye she wandered through the gardens toward the verge of the forest looking for him calling his name the pain was like an arrow in the heart almost driving him to his knees so he was not prepared after all he fisted his hands struggled for composure resolved but not prepared how would he ever live without her she will live without me he said aloud that i want more well end it now quick and clean he could not will her away will her back into her world and into life but he could drive her from him so that the choice to go was her own taking diliss reins only for the comfort of contact he walked for the last time as a man for yet a century to come through the woods toward home she heard the jingle of harness and the soft hoofbeats relieved she turned toward the sound walking quickly as flynn came out of the trees i wondered where you were she threw her arms around his neck and he let her her mouth pressed cheerfully to his and he absorbed the taste of it oh i had a bit of work the words cut at his throat like shards of glass its a fine day for it and for your travels for my travels indeed he gave her a little pat then moved away to adjust the stirrups of diliss saddle ive cleared the path so youll have no trouble youll find your way easily enough youre a resourceful woman my way where he glanced back gave her an absent smile out of course its time for you to go go there that should do he turned to her fully every ounce of power he owned went into the effort dilis will take you as far as you need id go with you myself but ive so much to see to yet i saw you have one of those little pocket phones in your car fascinating things i have to remember to get one myself for the study of it you should be able to use it once youre over the border i dont understand what youre saying how could she when her mind had gone numb when her heart had stopped beating im not going kayleen darling of course you are he patted her cheek not that it hasnt been a delight having you here i dont know when ive been so diverted di diverted mmm god youre a tasty bit he murmured then leaned down to nip at her bottom lip perhaps we could take just enough time to his hands roamed down her giving her breasts a teasing squeeze stop she stumbled back came up hard against dilis who shifted restless a diversion thats all this was to you a way to pass the time passed it well didnt we ah sweetheart i gave as much pleasure as i got you cant deny it but weve both got things to get back to dont we i love you she was killing him god bless the female heart and he said it with a chuckle its so generous then he lifted his brows rolled his eyes under them ah dont be making a scene and spoil this parting moment weve enjoyed each other and thats the end where did you think this was going its time out of time kayleen now dont be stubborn you dont love me you dont want me i loved you well enough he winked at her and wanted you plenty when the tears swam into her eyes he threw up his hands as if exasperated for pitys sake woman i brought some magic and romance into a life you yourself said was tedious i gave you some sparkle he lifted her pearls with a fingertip i never asked for jewels i never wanted anything but you took them though didnt you just as another took the sparkles from me once do you think after having a woman damn me to this place id want another around for longer than it takes to amuse myself im not like her you cant believe a womans a woman he said carelessly and ive given you a pretty holiday with souvenirs besides the least you can do is be grateful and go along when i bid you ive no more time for you and none of the patience to dry your tears and cuddle up you go he lifted her all but tossed her into the saddle you said you wouldnt hurt me she dragged the pearls over her head hurled them into the dirt at his feet she stared at him and in his face she saw the savageness again the brutality and none of the tenderness you lied you hurt yourself by believing what wasnt there go back to your tame world youve no place in mine he slapped a hand violently on diliss flank the horse reared then lunged forward when she was gone swallowed up by the forest flynn dropped to his knees on the ground and grieved chapter contents prev she wanted to find anger bitterness anything that would overpower this hideous pain it had dried up even her tears had smothered any rage or sorrow before it could fully form it had all been a lie magic was nothing but deceit in the end love hadnt been the answer love had done nothing but make her a fool didnt it prove shed been right all along her disdain of the happy ending her mother had regaled her with had been sense not stubbornness there were no fairy tales no loves that conquered all no grand sweep of romance to ride on forever letting herself believe even for a little while had shattered her yet how could she not have believed wasnt she even now riding on a white horse through the forest that couldnt be denied if shed misplaced her heart she couldnt deny all that shed seen and done and experienced how did she logical kayleen resolve the unhappy one with the magnificent other how could he have given her so much shown her so much and thought of her as only a kind of temporary entertainment no no something was wrong why couldnt she think dilis walked patiently through the trees as she pondered it had all happened so quickly this change in him had come like a fingersnap and left her reeling and helpless now she willed her mind to clear to analyze but after only moments her thoughts became scattered and jumbled once again her car was unmarked shining in the sunlight that dappled through the trees it sat tidily on a narrow path that ran straight as a ruler through the forest hed cleared the path hed said well he certainly was a man of his word she slid off the horse slowly circled the car not a scratch she noted considerate of him she wouldnt have to face the hassle that a wrecked car would have caused with the rental company yes hed cleared that path as well but why had he bothered with such a mundane practicality curious she opened the car door and sliding behind the wheel turned the key the engine sprang to life purred runs better than it did when i picked it up she thought and look at that to top things off we have a full tank did you want me out of your life so badly flynn that you covered all contingencies why were you so cruel at the end why did you work so hard to make me hate you hed given her no reason to stay and every rational reason to go with a sigh she got out of the car to say goodbye to dilis she indulged herself running her hands over his smooth hide nuzzling at his throat then she patted his flank go back to him now she murmured and turned away to spare her heart as the horse pranced off because she wanted some tangible reminder of her time there she picked a small nosegay of wildflowers twined the stems together and regardless of the foolishness of the gesture tucked them into her hair she got into the car again and began to drive the sun slanted in thin beams through the trees angled over the little lane as she glanced in her mirror she saw the path shimmer then vanish behind her in a tumble of moss and stones and brambles soon there would be nothing but the silent wood and no trace that she had ever walked there with a lover but she would remember always the way hed looked at her the way he would press his lips to the heart of her hand the way hed bring her flowers and scatter them over her hair the way his eyes would warm with laughter or heat with passion when his eyes what color were his eyes slightly dizzy she stopped the car pressed her fingers to her temples she couldnt bring his face into her mind not clearly how could she not know the color of his eyes why couldnt she quite remember the sound of his voice she shoved out of the car stumbled a few steps what was happening to her shed been driving from dublin on the way to her bedandbreakfast a wrong turn a storm but what without thinking she took another step back down the now overgrown path and her mind snapped clear as crystal her breath was coming short she turned stared at the car the clear path in front of it the impassable ground behind flynns eyes are green she said his face came clearly into her mind now and when she took a cautious step forward her memory of him went hazy this time she stepped back quickly well back you wanted me to forget you why why if none of it mattered did you care if i remembered you or not why would it matter if i broke my heart over you a little shaky she sat down on the ground and she began to do what shed always done best be logical flynn sat as he had on the night it had begun in the chair in front of the fire in the tower hed watched in the flames until kayleen had gotten into her car after that he hadnt been able to bear it so he had hazed the vision with smoke hed lost track of the time that hed sat there now chained by his own grief he knew the day was passing the slant of sunlight through the window had shortened and was dimming she would be beyond now and would have forgotten him that was for the best there would be some confusion of course a loss of time never fully explained but she would put that behind her as well in a year or two or twenty he might look into the fire again and see how she was but he would never open his mind to her in dreams for that would be more torment than he could ever possibly bear she would be changed a little by what had passed between them more open to possibilities to the magic of life he lifted the strings of pearls watched them glow in the light of the dying fire at least that was a gift she hadnt been able to hurl at his feet with the pearls wrapped around his fingers he lowered his face into his hands he willed the time to come when pain could strike only his mind when every sense wasnt tuned so sharply that he could smell her even now that soft scent that whispered in the air bring on the bloody night he muttered and threw his head back then he was stumbling to his feet staring she stood not three feet away her hair was tangled her clothes torn scratches scored her hands and face what trick is this i want my boon i want what you promised me what have you done his knees unlocked and he lunged toward her grabbing her hard by the arms how are you hurt look at you your hands are all torn and bleeding you put briars in my way she gave him a shove and such was his shock that she knocked him back two full steps you bastard it took hours to get through them get through his head snapped back as if shed slapped him you have to go go now whats the time he was pushing her out of the room and when that wasnt quick enough he began to drag her im not going not until you grant my boon you damn well are terrified he tossed her over his shoulder and began to run as she struggled and cursed him he began to fly the night was closing in time that had dripped began to flood he went as deep into the forest as he dared the edges of his prison seemed to hiss around him there fear for her slicked his skin your cars just up ahead get in it and go why so i can drive a little farther and forget all this forget you youd have stolen that from me ive no time to argue with you he grabbed her shoulders and shook there is no time if you stay past the last stroke of twelve youre trapped here a hundred years will pass before you can walk away again why do you care its a big house a big forest i wont get in your way you dont understand go this place is mine and i dont want you here youre trembling flynn what frightens you im not frightened im angry youve abused my hospitality youre trespassing call the cops she suggested call your keepers or why dont you just flick me out the way you flick things in but you cant can you if i could youd be gone already he yanked her a few steps toward the car then swore when the ground in front of his boots began to spark and smoke that was the edge of his prison big powerful magician but you cant get rid of me that way you couldnt bring me here and you cant send me away not with magic because i have heart and soul i have will so you tried to drive me away with careless words cruel careless words you didnt think id see through them did you didnt think id figure it all out you forgot who you were dealing with kayleen he took her hands now squeezing desperately do this thing i ask now wont you a diversion she said thats a crock you love me of course i love you he shook her harder shouted so his voice boomed through the forest thats the bloody point and if you care for me youll do what i tell you and do it now you love me her breath came out on a sob as she flung herself against him i knew it oh im so angry with you im so in love with you his arms ached to grip to hold he made himself push her away hold her at arms length listen to me kayleen clear the stars out of your eyes and be sensible ive no right to love you be quiet he snapped when she started to speak you remember what i told you about this place about me do you feel my hands on you kayleen yes theyre trembling after midnight one breath after you wont feel them or anything else no touch no contact youll pick a flower but you wont feel the stem or the petals its perfume will be lost to you can you feel your own heart beat beating inside you you wont its worse than death to be and yet not be day by day into the decades with nothing of substance nothing but whats in your mind and a ghra you havent even the magic to amuse yourself into some sanity youll be lost little more than a ghost i know like the dream she thought a mist within the mist theres more there can be no children during the dreaming nothing can grow in you nothing can change in or of you you will have no family no comfort no choice this is my banishment it will not be yours though her nerves began to dance her gaze stayed steady ill have my boon he swore threw up his hands woman you try me to the bone all right then what will you to stay no you took a vow and so i break it what more can be done to me ill stay anyway you cant stop me but he could there was one way to save her in the time left him one final way you defeat me he drew her close rocked her against him youve a head like a rock i love you kayleen i loved you in dreams when dreams were all there was for me i love you now it killed me to hurt you i want to be with you no matter how short the time or how long well dream together until we can live together again he took her mouth a deep kiss a drugging one that spun in her head blurred her vision joy settled sweetly in her heart when she sighed he stepped back from her five hundred years he said quietly and only once have i loved only you flynn she started to move toward him but the air between them had hardened into a shield what is this she lifted her fisted hands to it pushed what have you done theres a choice and its mine to make i will not damn you to my prison kayleen no power can sway me i wont go she pounded a fist on the shield i know it and understand it as well i should have before i would never leave you either manim astheee hu my soul he said in the language of his birth is within you you brought me a gift kayleen love freely given the wind began to kick from somewhere a sound boomed slow and dull like a clock striking the hour i give you a gift in return life to be lived i have a choice one offered me long ago a hundred years times five what are you no she flung herself at the shield beat against it no you cant youll die youre five hundred years old you cant live without your powers its my right my choice dont do this how many strikes of the clock had there been ill go i swear it theres no time now my powers he said lifting his arms my blood my life for hers lightning spewed from the sky struck like a comet between them for foolishness for pride for arrogance i abjure my gifts my skills my birthright and for love i cast them away his eyes met kayleens through the wind and light as the clock struck for love i offer them freely let her forget for there is no need for her to suffer he fisted his hands crossed his arms over his chest braced as the world went mad around him now and the clock struck twelve the world went still overhead the skies broke clear so the stars poured free the trees stood as if carved out of the dark the only sound was of kayleens weeping do i dream flynn whispered cautious he held out a hand opened and closed his fist felt the movement of his own fingers the air began to stir a soft sweet breeze an owl called i am flynn dropped to his knees beside kayleen with wonder in his eyes i am flynn she threw her arms around him dragging him close breathing him in youre real youre alive i am restored he dropped his head on her shoulder i am freed the keepers he was breathless fighting to clear his mind drawing her back he framed her face in his hands solid warm his youre free she pressed her hands against his the tears that fell from her eyes shimmered into diamonds on the ground between them youre alive youre here the keepers said i have atoned i was given love and i put the one i loved before myself love he pressed his lips to her brow they told me it is the simplest and most potent of magic i took a very long time to learn it so have i we saved each other didnt we we loved each other manim astheee hu he said again these are the words i give you he opened his hand and held out the pearls will you take them and this gift as a symbol of betrothal will you take them and me i will he drew her to her feet soon then for ive a great respect for time and the wasting of it now look what youve done he trailed his fingers gently over the scratch on her cheek theres a mess youve made of yourself thats not very romantic ill fill you with romance but first ill tend those hurts he scooped her off her feet my mothers going to be crazy about you im counting on it because he wanted to savor he walked for a bit will i like boston do you think yes i think you will she twirled a lock of his hair around her fingers i could use someone who knows something about antiques in my family business is that so ha a job imagine that i might consider that if there was thought of opening a branch here in ireland where a certain wildlyinlove married couple could split their time so to speak i wouldnt have it any other way she laughed as he spun her around pressed her lips to his and held on tight as they leaped into space and flew toward home and happilyeverafters
