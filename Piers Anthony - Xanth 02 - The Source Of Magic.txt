xanth w isle of illusion any resemblance to any mundane peninsula is strictly in the mind of the author who lives near the north village centaur isle chapter closet skeleton i he magicsniffer ambled toward bink its long limber snout snuffling industriously when the creature reached him it went into a frenzy of enthusiasm snorting out flutelike notes wagging its bushy tail and prancing in a circle sure i like you too sniffer bink said squatting to embrace it the creatures snout kissed his nose wetly you were one of the first to believe in my magic when bink paused for the creature was acting strangely it had stopped frisking and become subdued almost frightened whats the matter little friend bink asked concerned did i say something to hurt your feelings i apologize but the sniffer curled its tail between its legs and slunk away bink stared after it chagrined it was almost as if the magic had been turned off causing the thing to lose its function but binks talent like all others was inherent it could not dissipate while he lived something else must have frightened the sniffer bink looked about feeling uneasy to the east was the castle roogna orchard whose trees bore all manner of exotic fruit vegetables and sundry artifacts like cherry bombs and doorknobs to the south was the untamed wilderness of xanth bink remembered how that jungle had herded him and his companions inhere seeming so menacing way back when today fthe trees were basically friendly they had only wanted u magician to stay and make castle roogna great again king trent had done that now the consider able power of this region exerted itself for the benefit of the kingdom everything seemed to be in order well on with his business there was to be a ball tonight and his shoes were badly worn he proceeded to the edge of the orchard where a stray shoetree had rooted shoes liked to move about and often planted themselves in outoftheway places this one had several ripe shoes bink inspected individual ones without plucking them until he was sure he had found a pair that fit him then he twisted them off shook out the seeds and put them carefully on his feet they were quite comfortable and looked nice because they were fresh he started back walking with exaggerated motion to break in the shoes without scuffing them bis mind still nagged by the episode with the magicsniffer was it an omen omens always came true here in the land of xanth but it was seldom possible to understand them properly until too late was something bad going to happen to him that really seemed unlikely bink knew it was no exaggeration to assume that serious evil would have to fall on all xanth before bink himself was harmed so it must be a misreading the magicsniffer had merely suffered a fit of indigestion and had to scoot off soon bink was within sight of his home it was a fine cottage cheese just off the palace grounds which he had moved into when he married the rind had long since hardened and lost the better part of its flavor and the walls were finegrained creamyyellow petrified cheese it was one of the most tasteful cottages extant but since he hadnt hollowed it out himself he didnt see fit to brag about it bink took a deep breath nerved himself and opened the front rinddoor a sweetish waft of seasoned cheese blew out together with a raucous screech that you bink about time where did you sneak off to right when theres work to be done you have no consideration at all do you i needed shoes he said shortly shoes she exclaimed incredulously you have shoes idiot fhis wife was much smarter than he at the moment chameleons intelligence varied with the time of month as did her appearance when she was t autiful she was stupidin the extreme for both when she was smart she was ugly very smart and very ugly at the moment she was at the height of the latter phase this was one reason she was keeping herself secluded virtually locked in her room i need goodlooking ones tonight he said mustering patience but even as the words were out he realized he had phrased it badly any reference to good looks set her off the hell you do dunce he wished she wouldnt keep rubbing in his inferior intelligence ordinarily she was smart enough not to do jfbat bmk knew he was no genius but he wasnt subnormal either she was the one who was both i have to attend the anniversary ball he explained though of course she already knew that it would be an insult to the queen if i attended sloppily dressed dolt she screamed from her hideaway youre attending in costume no one will see your stinking shoes oops that was right he had made his trip for nothing but thats all too typical of your selfishness she continued with righteous ire bugging off to the party to have a good tune while i suffer home alone chewing on the walls that was literal the cheese was old and hard but she gnawed on it when she got angry and she was angry most of the time now still he tried to be positive he had only been married a year and he loved chameleon he had known at the outset that there would be good times bad times and this was a bad time a very bad why dont you come to the ball too dear she exploded with cynical wrath me when im e this spare me your feebleminded sarcasm but as you reminded me its a costume party the leen is cloaking every attendee in a disguise of her sing so no one will see you utter moronic nincompoop she bawled ragh the wall and he had heard something crash now she was throwing things hi a genuine temper tantrum how can i go to a party hi any guise when im rune months pregnant and that was what was really bothering her not her normal smartugly phase that she had lived with all her life but the enormous discomfort and restriction of her pregnancy bink had precipitated that condition during her lovelystupid phase only to learn when she got smarter that she had not wanted such a commitment at this time she feared her baby would be like heror like him she had wanted to find some spell to ensure that the child would be positively talented or at least normal and now it was up to blind chance she had accepted the situation with extremely poor grace and had not forgiven him the smarter she got and the more pregnant she got the more intense her ire became well soon she would be over the hump and getting prettierjust hi time for the baby it was due in a week or so maybe the baby would be normal perhaps even strongly talented and chameleons fears would be laid to rest then she would stop taking it out on him if however the baby were abnormal but best not even think of that sorry i forgot he mumbled you forgot the irony in her tone cut through his sensitivities like a magic sword through the cheese of the cottage imbecile youd like to forget wouldnt you why didnt you think of that last year when you i have to go chameleon he muttered hastily retreating out the door the queen gets upset when people are tardy in fact it seemed to be the nature of women to get upset at men and to throw tantrums that was one of the things that distinguished them from nymphs who looked like women but were always amenable to the idle whims of men he supposed he should count himself lucky that his wife did not have a dangerous talent like setting fire to people or generating thunderstorms why does the queen have to throw her ridiculous pointless dull party now chameleon demanded right when she knows i cant attend ah the logic of women why bother to try to undferstand it all the intelligence hi the land of xanth could not make sense of the senseless bink closed the door behind him actually chameleons question had been rhetorical they both knew the answer queen iris took every opportunity to flaunt her status and this was the first imniversary of that status theoretically the ball was to honor of the king but actually king trent cared fittie for theatrics and would probably skip the festivities the party was really for the queenand though she could not compel the king to attend woe betide the lesser functionary who played hooky tonight bhik was such a functionary and why was this so he asked himself as he trod glumly on he was supposed to be an important per tile royal researcher of xanth whose duty it was to probe the mysteries of magic and report directly to the king but with chameleons pregnancy and the necessary organization of his homestead bink had not gotten around to any real research for that he had only himself to blame really he should indeed have considered the consequence of impregnating his wife at the time fatherhood had been the last thing on his mind but chameleonlovely was a figure to cloud mans mind and excite hisnever mind ah nostalgia back when love was new carefree uncomplicated without responsibility chameleonlovely was very like a nymph no that was a false feeling his life before he met chameleon had not been all that simple and he had encountered her three times before he recognized her he had feared he had no magic talent he shimmeredand suddenly his appearance changed the queens costume had arrived bink was same person mentally and physically but now he jked like a centaur the queens illusion so he id play the game she had devised in her infinite acity to generate minor mischief each person had guess the identities of as many others as possible re making his way to the palace ballroom and was a prize for the one who guessed the most rectly in addition she had set up a mockmazehedge around castle roogna even tf he did not play the peopleguessing game he would be forced to thread his way through the giant puzzle damn the queeni but he had to go through with it as did everyone else the king wisely did not interfere with household matters and gave the queen considerable play on her tether with resignation bink entered the maze and began the laborious chore of threading his way through the network of false paths toward the castle most of the hedge was illusion but enough of it was anchored in reality to make it safest simply to honor the maze rather than barging through the queen would have her fun especially on this important first anniversary of the kings coronation she could get uglier than chameleon when not humored bink whipped around a cornerand almost collided with a zombie the things wormy face dripped earth and goo and the great square eyesockets were windows of putrefaction the smell was appalling morbidly fascinated bhik stared into those eyes far within their depths there seemed to be a faint illumination as of moonlight on a haunted plain or glowfungus feeding on the corpses rotting brain it was as if he could see through twin tunnels into the very source of its foul animation and perhaps to the root of all the magic of xanth yet it was nightmare for the zombie was one of the living dead a horror that should be quickly buried and forgotten why had this one ripped free of its unquiet grave the zombies normally roused themselves only in defense of castle roogna and they had been passive since king trent took over the zombie stepped toward him opening its fossil mouth vvooomm it said laboring to make the putrid gas that was its only breath form a word bink backed away sickened he feared little in the land of xanth for his physical prowess and magic talent made him one of the most subtly formidable people in the kingdom but the peculiar discomfort and disgust entailed by dealing with a zombie unnerved him he spun about and ran down a side avenue leaving the undead thing behind with its sf ijecayed articulation of bones and moldy flesh it could aot match his speed and did not even try suddenly a gleaming sword rose up before him bink halted amazed by this second apparition he saw no person no connections just the weapon what was the purpose of this illusion ohit must be another cute little trick of the queens she liked to make her parties exciting and challenging all he had to do was walk through the sword calling the bluff of this ad hoc interference yet he hesitated the blade looked terribly real bhik remembered his experience with jama as a youth jamas talent was the manifestation of flying swords solid and sharp and dangerous for the few seconds they existed and he tended to exert his talent arrogantly jama was no friend of binks and if he were in the area bink drew his own sword on guard he exdaimed and struck at the other weapon hah expecting his blade to pass through it without resistance the queen would be pleased her bluff had worked and this way he was taking no risk just hi case the other sword was solid steel clanged on steel then the other weapon twisted about to disengage from his and thrust swiftly at his chest bink parried and stepped aside this was no temporary blade and no mindlessly flying thing some invisible hand guided it and that meant an invisible man the sword struck again and again bink parried this thing was really trying to get him who are you bhik demanded but there was no answer bmk had been practicing with the sword for the past year and his tutor claimed that he was an apt student bhik had courage speed and ample physical power he knew he was hardly expert yet but he was no longer amateur he rather enjoyed the challenge even with an invisible opponent but a serious fight was something else why was being attacked on this festive occasion who was silent secretive enemy bink was lucky that that ns spell of invisibility had not affected the sword for then he would have had an awful time countering it but every item of magic in xanth was single a sword could not carry its necessary charms of sharpness and hardness and also be invisible well it was possible for anything was possible with magic but it was highly unlikely at any rate that weapon was all bink needed to see halt he cried desist or i must counter you again the enemy sword slashed at him ferociously bink was already aware that he faced no expert the swordsmans style was more bold than skilled bink blocked the weapon off then countered with a halfhearted thrust to his opponents exposed midsection there was only one place that midsection could be visible or not for a certain balance and position were essential in swordplay binks strike was not hard enough to maim but was sufficient to his blade passed right through the invisible torso without resistance there was nothing there bink startled lost his concentration and balance the enemy sword thrust at his face he ducked barely in time his instructor crombie the soldier had taught him such avoidance but this escape was at least partly luck without his talent he could have been dead bulk did not like to depend on his talent that was the point in learning swordsmanship to defend himself his own way openly with pride without suffering the private snickers of those who assumed naturally enough that mere chance had helped him his magic might stop or blunt an attack by having the attacker slip on a littered fruit rind it didnt care about his pride but when he won fairly with his sword no one laughed no one was laughing now but still he did not like being attacked by awhat it must be one of the magic weapons of the kings private arsenal and it was consciously directed no way this could be the action of the king however king trent never played practical jokes and permitted no tampering with his weapons someone had activated this sword and sent it out to do mischief and that person would shortly face the formidable wrath of the king that was little comfort to bink at the moment though he didnt want to seem to hide behind the protection of the king he wanted to fight his own battle and win except that he would have some problem getting at a person who wasnt there as he considered bink rejected the notion that a distant person could be wielding this weapon it was magically possible but as far as he knew he had no enemies no one would want to attack him by magical or natural means and no one would dare do it with one of the kings own swords in the garden of castle roogna bink fenced with the enemy sword again maneuvered it into a vulnerable position and sliced through the invisible arm no arm was there of course no doubt about it the sword was wielding itself he had never actually fought one of these before because the king didnt trust the judgment of mindless weapons go the experience was a novel one but of course there was nothing inherently odd about it why not do battle with a charmed sword yet why should such a sword seek his life assuming it was acting on its own sink had nothing but respect fcr bladed weapons he took good care of his own word making sure the sharpness charm was in good order and never abusing the instrument swords of toy type or creed should have no quarrel with him perhaps he had inadvertently affronted this particular word sword if i have caused you distress or wronged you i apologize and proffer amends he said i do not wish to fight you without reason the sword cut ferociously at his legs no quarter there at least tell me what your grievance isl bink exclaimed dancing away just in tune the sword continued its attack relentlessly then i must put you out of commission bink said with mixed regret ire and anticipation here was a real challenge for the first time he took a full jbsensive posture fencing the sword with skill he he was a better man than it he could not strike down the wielder of that ftpon because there was none nobody to pierce i hand to slice the sword showed no sign of tiring kc powered it how then could he overcome it this was more of a challenge than he had supposed bink was not worried because he found it hard to worry about a skill less than his own yet if the opposition were invulnerable still his talent would not allow the sword to hurt him a sword wielded by a man in ordinary fashion could damage him because that was mundane but when magic was involved he was safe in xanth hardly anything was completely unmagical so he was extremely well protected the question was was he going to prevail honestly by his own skill and courage or by some fantasticseeming coincidence if he didnt do it the first way his talent would do it the second way again he maneuvered the sword into a vulnerable position then struck it across the fiat of the blade hoping to snap it oft short this did not work the metal was too strong he had not really expected such a ploy to be effective strength was one of the basic charms built into modern swords well what next he heard the clopclop of someone approaching he had to wrap this up quickly or suffer the embarrassment of being rescued his talent didnt care about his pride just his body bink found himself backed up against a treea real one the hedgemaze had been superimposed on existing vegetation so that everything became part of that puzzle this was a gluebark tree anything that penetrated the bark was magically stuck to it then the tree slowly grew around the object absorbing it harmless so long as the bark was intact children could safely climb the trunk and play in its branches as long as they did not use cleats woodpeckers stayed well away from it so bulk could lean against it but had to be careful not to the enemy sword slashed at his face bink was never sure afterward whether his inspiration came before or after his action probably after which meant that his talent was hi operation again despite his effort to avoid that at any rate instead of parrying this time he ducked the sword passed over his head and smacked into the tree slicing deeply into the bark instantly the trees magic focused and the blade was sealed in place it wrenched and struggled but could not escape nothing could beat the specific magic of a thing in its own bailiwick bink was the victor bye sword he said sheathing his own weapon sorry we couldnt visit longer but behind his flippancy was a certain grim disquiet who or what had incited this magic sword to slay him he must after all have an enemy somewhere and he didnt like that it wasnt so much any fear of attack but a gut feeling of distress that he should be disliked to that extent by anyone when he tried so hard to get along he ducked around another cornerand smacked into a needlecactus not a real one or he would have become a human pincushion a mock one the cactus reached down with a prickly branch and gripped bink by the neck clumsy oaf it snorted do you wish me to prettify your ugly face in the mud binfc recognized that voice and that grip chester he rasped past the constriction in his neck chester centaur horseflies chester swore you tricked me into giving myself away he eased his terrible grip slightly but now youd better tell me who you are or i might squeeze you like this he squeezed and bulk thought his head was going to pop off his body where was his talent now fink fink bink squeaked trying to pronounce his name when his lips would not quite close hinkl i do not stinkl chester said becoming irritated that made his grip tighten not only are you homely as hell youre impertinent then he did a double take heyyoure wearing my face bink had forgotten he was in costume the centaurs surprise caused him to relax momentarily and bink snatched his opportunity im bink your friend in illusion guise chester pondered no centaur was stupid but this one tended to think with his muscles if youre trying to fool me remember herman the hermit how i met him in the wilderness and he saved xanth from the wiggle swarm with his willothewisp magic the finest centaur of them all chester finally put bink down uncle herman be agreed smiling the effect was horrendous on the cactusface i guess youre okay but what are you doing in my form the same thing youre doing in cactus form bink said massaging his throat attending the masquerade ball his neck did not seem to be damaged so bis talent must have let this encounter be oh yes chester agreed flexing his needles eloquently the mischief of good queen iris the bitchsorceress have you found a way into the palace yet no in fact i ran into a but bink wasnt sure he wanted to talk about the sword just yet a zombie a zombie chester laughed pity the poor oaf in that costume a costume of course the zombie had not been real it had merely been another of the queens illusioncostumes bink had reacted as shortsightedly as chester fleeing it before discovering its identity and thereby encountering the sword which certainly had not been either costume or illusion well i dont much like this game anyway he said i dont go for the game either chester agreed but the prizethat is worth a year of my life by definition bink agreed morosely one question answered by the good magician humfreyfree but everyones competing for it someone else will win not if we get hoofing chester said lets go unmask the zombie before it gets away yes bink agreed embarrassed by his previous reaction they passed the sword still stuck in the tree finders keepers chester exclaimed happily and put his hand to it thats a gluebark it wont let go but the centaur had already grasped the sword and yanked such was his strength there was a shower of bark and wood but the sword did not come free hm chester said look treewe have a gluebark in centaur village during the drought i watered it every day so it survived now all i ask in return is this sword that you have no use for the sword came free chester tucked it into his quiver of arrows fastening it in place with a loop of the coil of rope he also carried or so bink guessed observing the contortions of the cactus bink had put a hand to his own sword halffearing a renewal of hostilities but the other weapon was quiescent whatever had animated it was gone chester became aware of bulks stare you just have to understand trees he said moving on its true of course a centaur never lies i did water that tree it was more convenient than the privy so this gluebark had given up its prize well why not centaurs were indeed generally kind to trees though chester had no particular love for needlecactuses which was no doubt why the queen in her humor had imposed this costume on him they came to the place where bink had encountered the zombie but the awful thing was gone only a slimy chunk of dirt lay in the path chester nudged it with one forehoof real dirtfrom a fake zombie he inquired puzzled the queens illusions are getting better bhik nodded agreement it was a disquieting note obviously the queen had extended the illusion greatly but why should she bother her magic was strong far beyond the talents of ordinary people for she was one of the three magicianclass citizens of xanth but it had to be a strain on even her power to maintain every detail of every costume of every person attending the masquerade bulk and chesters costumes were visual only or it would have been difficult for them to converse here is a fresh pile of dirt chester remarked real dirt not zombie dirt he tapped at it with a cactus foot that nevertheless left a hoofprint could the thing have gone back into the ground here curious bhik scraped at the mound with his own loot there was nothing inside it except more dirt no zombie well we lost him bink said upset for a reason he could not quite fathom the zombie had seemed so real lets just find our way into the palace instead of making fools of ourselves out here chester nodded his cactushead wobbling ludicrously i wasnt guessing people very well anyway he admitted and the only question i could ask the good magician doesnt have any answer no answer bink asked as they turned into another channel since cherie had the coltmind you hes a fine little centaur bushytailedshe doesnt seem to have much tune for me anymore im like a fifth hoof around the stable so what can i you tool bink exclaimed recognizing the root of his own bad mood chameleon hasnt even had ours yet but he shrugged dont worryshe wont have a colt bink choked though it really wasnt funny filliescant run with them cant run without them chester said dolefully suddenly a harpy rounded a corner there was another scramble to avoid a collision you blind in the beak chester demanded flap off birdbrain you have a vegetable head the harpy retorted in a fluting tone clear out of my way before i sew you up in a stinking ball with your own dull needles dull needles chester somewhat belligerent even in the best of moods swelled up visibly at this affront had he actually been a cactus he would have fired off a volley of needles immediatelyand none of those darts looked dull you want your grimy feathers crammed up your snotty snoot it was the harpys turn to swell most of its breed were female but this one was male more of the queens rather cutting humor naturally the birdman fluted right after you have the juice squeezed out of your pulp greenface oh yeah chester demanded forgetting that centaurs were not common brawlers harpy and cactus squared off the harpy was evidently a considerably larger creature one that never had to take any guff off strangers that odd halfmusical mode of speech manticora bink exclaimed the harpy paused one point for you centaur your voice sounds familiar but startled bink reminded himself that he was in the guise of a centaur at the moment so that it was himself not chester the creature addressed im bink i met you when i visited the good magician way back when oh yes you broke his magic mirror fortunately he had another whatever became of you i fell upon evil times i got married the manticora laughed musically not to this cactus i trust listen thing chester said warningly this really is my friend chester centaur bink said quickly hes the nephew of herman the hermit who saved xanth from the i knew herman the manticora said greatest centaur there ever was even before he gave his noble life for his country only one i know who wasnt ashamed of his magic talent his willothewisps led me out of a dragon warren once when i learned of his death i was so sad i went out and stung a small tangle tree to death he was so much better than those hoofheaded equines of the common herd who exiled him he broke off no offense cactus you being his nephew and all i may have a target to sting with you but i would not affront the memory of that remarkable hermit there was no surer route to chesters favor than praise of his herouncle as perhaps the manticora knew no offense he said instantly everything you said is true my people exiled herman because they thought magic in a centaur was obscene most of them still do even my own filly as nice a piece of horseflesh as youd care to he shook his cactushead becoming aware of the impropriety they are hoofheads times are changing the manticora said one day all the centaurs will be flaunting their talents instead of flouting them he made a gesture with his harpy wings well i must go identify some more people not that i need the prize its merely a challenge he moved on bink marveled again at the humor of the queen to costume as a harpy such a formidable creature as a manticora who possessed the head of a man with triple jaws body of a lion wings of a dragon and tail of a monstrous scorpion certainly one of the most deadly monsters of the land of xanth rendered into the likeness of one of the most disgusting yet the manticora was bearing up with grace and playing the game of charades and costumes probably he felt secure in the knowledge that he had a soul and so he cared little for appearances i wonder if i have a magic talent chester mused sounding a trifle guilty the transition from obscenity to pride was indeed a difficult one if you won the prize you could find out bink pointed out the cactus brightened thats right this was evidently the unanswerable question chester had had in mind unvoiced then the cactus dulled but cherie would never let me have a talent not even a little one shes awfully prudish about that sort of thing bulk remembered the fillys prim attitude and nodded cherie centaur was one fine figure of a filly and well able to handle the general magic of xanth but she could not abide it in any centaur it reminded bink of his own mothers attitude about sex in young humans for animals it was natural but when something like a wildoats nymph was involvedwell chester did have a problem they turned another cornercorners abounded in this infernal mazeand there was the palace gate shining beyond the drawbridge over the moat lets get over there before the maze changes bink exclaimed they ran toward itbut even as they did the hedgepattern shimmered and fogged the awful thing about this puzzlepattern was its instability at irregular intervals it shifted into new configurations so that it was impossible to solve it methodically they were going to be too late to break out im not stopping now chester cried the sound of cactusgalloping became louder get on my back bink didnt argue he made a leap for the prickliest portion of the cactus grimacing in halfexpectation of a crotchful of needles he landed neatly on chesters back which felt quite equine phew at the feel of that impact chester accelerated bink had ridden a centaur before when cherie had kindly given him a liftbut never a powerhouse like this chester was husky even by centaur standards and now he was in a hurry the huge muscles pulsed along his body launching him forward with such ferocity that bink was afraid he would be hurled off as fast as he had landed but he clutched two handfuls of mane and hung on confident that his talent would protect him even from this few residents of xanth were aware of bulks talent and he himself had been ignorant of it the first twentyfive years of his life this was because of the way the talent clouded itself hiding from publicity it prevented him from being harmed by magicbut anyone who knew this could then harm him by mundane means so bulks talent shrouded itself in seeming coincidence only king trent besides bink himself knew the truth good magician humfrey probably suspected and chameleon had to have an idea a new hedge formed between them and the gate it was probably illusion since they had just seen the gate chester plunged through itand sent branches flying no illusion this time it must have been the gate that was the illusion the sorceress queen could make things disappear by creating the illusion of open space he should have remembered that before what drive this creature had invisible foliage tore at bink like the winds of a tempest but he clung tight another barrier appeared chester veered to follow a new channel that went his way then smashed past another crosshedge once this centaur got moving pity the man beast or plant that got in his wayl suddenly they were out of the maze and at the moat but chesters veer had brought him to it twenty paces to the side of the drawbridge and there was no room to make a course correction hang on chester cried and leaped this time the thrust was so great that bink ripped a double handful of mane out of the centaurs hide and still slid off the rear he tumbled end over end and splashed into the moat immediately the moatmonsters converged jaws gaping eagerly they were ever alert they would have been fired otherwise a huge serpent looped down each glistening tooth as long as one of binks fingers from the other side a purple croc opened its gnarly proboscis showing off teeth that were even longer and directly under bink rising from the swirling moatmud came a behemoth its back so broad it seemed to fill the entire moat bulk thrashed madly in the water trying to swim to safety knowing that no man could escape any one of these monsters let alone all three the behemoth came up lifting him half out of the water the croc came across its jaws parting cavernously the serpent struck with lightning velocity from above andcroc and serpent collided their teeth throwing of sparks as they clashed both monsters were shunted aside by the mass of the rising behemoth and bink slid down that lifting slope as on a greased skid away from the teeth and safely to the stonelined inner wall of the moat an amazing coincidence ha that was his talent operating saving him once again from his own folly trying to ride a galloping centaur that looked like a cactushe should have picked his way out of the maze the way the others were doing he was just lucky that both centaurs and moatmonsters were magical so that his talent could function chester had landed safely and was on hand to haul him out of the moat with one hand the centaur lifted bulk clear hardly seeming to exert himself but his voice shook i thoughtwhen you fell among those monstersi never saw anything like they werent really hungry bink said preferring to disparage the significance of the event they were just playing with then food and overdid it lets go on inside they must be serving the refreshments by now hey yes chester agreed like all powerful creatures he had a chronic appetite hay yes bink muttered but it was not a good t centaurs did not eat hay despite what detractors it imply ley moved to the castleand the illusions faded spell was off here they were themselves again and centaur you know i never realized how homely my face was until i saw it on you chester laid musingly t but you have an exceedingly handsome posterior bink pointed out true true the centaur agreed mollified i al ways said cherie didnt become my mate for my face bink started to laugh but realized his friend was se xious also they were at the entry now and others were within earshot the guard at the palace gate frowned how many you guess bmk he inquired pad poised for a a one crombie bink said indicating chester then be remembered the manticora two rather youre out of the running then crombie said the leading contestant has twelve he glanced at chester you i didnt want the prize anyway the centaur said you folk havent been trying crombie said if id been out there instead of stuck here running errands for the queen i thought you liked this palace job bink said he had first encountered crombie when the man soldiered for the prior king i like itbut i like adventure better the kings okay but crombie scowled well you know the queen all fillies are difficult chester said its their natare they cant help it even if they wanted to right you are crombie agreed heartily he was original womanhater and the ones with the igest magicwho else would have dreamed up idiocy of a masquerade she just wants to show off sorcery hasnt got much else to show off chester said king pays no attention to her the kings one smart magician crombie agreed when shes not making mischief like this this palace guard duty is dull as hell i wish i were out on a mans mission like the time when bink and i bink smiled reminiscently wasnt that technicolor hailstorm something we camped out under the quiescent tangle tree and the girl ran off crombie agreed those were the days surprised bink found himself agreeing the adventure had not seemed like fun at the time but in retrospect it had a certain twilight luster you told me she was a threat to me and she was crombie said she married you didnt she bink laughed but it was a trifle forced wed better get on in before the refreshments are gone he turnedand almost stumbled over another little mound of dirt you have moles around the palace he inquired with a certain edge crombie squinted at the dirt that wasnt there a moment ago maybe a magic mole was attracted by the party fu notify the head grounds keeper when i get off shift bink and chester moved on in the palace ballroom had been decorated by queen iris naturally it was an undersea setting with streamers of seaweed rising from the rocky deeps and brightly colored fish swimming through and barnacles on the walls here and there were subaqueous beaches of fine white sand which shifted location magically so that if a person stood still the scenery would come to him a large serpentine sea monster coiled around the entire area its pulsing convoluted coils showing here and there hi lieu of the walls chester glanced around shes a bitch and she shows off but i have to admit her magic is impressive but im worried about the quantity of food ft there isnt enough there turned out to be no danger of a shortage the refreshments were mountainous and under the personal guard of queen iris she had a picklepuss on a little leash whenever someone had the temerity to take a delicacy the picklepuss pickled it no one eats itntil the grand prize is awarded iris announced glaring about since she had garbed herself as a warriorqueenmermaid complete with spiked crown trident and powerful tail and the points of the trident glistened with a coating of slime that was probably illusion too but just might possibly be genuine poison this was an effective enough deterrent even without the picklepuss bink and chester separated mixing with the other guests just about every creature of note in xanth was present except for chesters filly cherie who was no doubt still wrapped up in the colt and binks chameleon wrapped up in her misery and the good magician hmnfrey who never socialized voluntarily bink spotted his father roland down from the north village roland was careful not to embarrass ilka by any overt show of affection they shook hands nice shoes son this was nevertheless a miscue after the scene with chameleon fresh from the tree bink said awkwardly what have you been doing these past few months bubbles rose from rolands mouth as he spoke quivering spherically as they sought the surface of the ocean when queen iris put on an illusion it was some illusion ordinary citizens with their motley individual magic talents could only look upon the works of the sorceress and despair which was of course why the queen was putting on this show oh practicing with the sword tilling the garden that sort of thing bink said i understand chameleon is expecting momentarily that too bink said again experiencing the frusttation of his situation a son will help fill the house provided it turned out to be a normal talented son bink changed the subject we have a delicate young slipper plant just blossoming i think it will bear first pair of slippers soon ladies will be pleased roland said gravely ly as if this were significant news suddenly bink realized that he had very little to show for his past year what had he accomplished virtually nothing no wonder he felt out of sorts the illumination dimmed it was as if dusk were falling causing the sea to darken too but the diffused daylight was replaced by nocturnal fluorescence the flotation sacs on the seaweed glowed like little lamps and the neoncoral was brightly outlined in assorted colors even the puffy sponges emitted wan beams the animal life had sharper light with electric eels flashing searchlight beams and assorted fish shone translucently the overall effect was bewilderingly beautiful if only her personality were as excellent as her taste roland murmured referring to the queen we shall now award the door prize queen iris announced she glowed most of all streams of light emanated from the points of her crown and trident and her beautifully bare mermaid torso was clearly outlined she was the mistress of illusion she could make herself as lovely as she chose and she chose well i understand it was a marriage of convenience roland continued though no magician himself roland was the kings regent north of the gap and did not hold royalty in awe it must be extremely convenient at tunes bink nodded slightly embarrassed by his fathers evident appreciation of the welldisplayed if illusory charms of the queen the man was bordering on fifty after all yet it had to be true the king professed no love for the queen and governed that temperamental woman with a subtly iron hand that amazed those who had known iris before her marriage yet she thrived under that discipline those who knew the king well understood that not only was he a more powerful magician than she he was also a stronger person in fact it looked as if the magic land of xanth had its most effective king since the fourth wave reign of roogna the builder of this castlepalace already formidable changes were occurring the magic shield that had protected xanth from intrusion had been removed and mundane creatures re allowed to cross the border the first to cross sad been the members of the kings former mundane rmy they had been settled in wilderness regions and were becoming productive citizens of xanth the requirement that each citizen demonstrate a magic talent bad been abolishedand to the amazement of some conservatives chaos had not resulted people were betioming known and respected for their total qualities not just the accident of their magic selected parties were exploring nearby mundania where no magic existed and outlying guard posts were being established so that no invasion could happen by surprise the king bad not destroyed the shieldstone he would restore the shield if it were ever needed at any rate bink was sure king trent had an eye for all things good and useful including the flesh of fair women and the queen was his to command she could and would be anything the king wished and he would not be human if he did not avail himself of this at least on occasion the question was what did he want this was common palace speculation and the prevailing opinion was that the king wanted variety the queen seldom appeared in the same guise twice talace guard your report the queen demanded peremptorily soldier crombie came forward slowly he was resplendent in his palace uniform every inch the soldier in a kingdom that hardly needed soldiers he could fight well and savagely with sword or bare hands and did not like serving as lackey to a womanand he showed it therefore she enjoyed ordering him about but she could not push him too far for his loyalty was to the king and the kings favor lay on faim the winner crombie began consulting his notes no not that way idiot she exclaimed blotting jlim out with a cloud of diffusing dye more illusion of se but quite effective first you give the runnerp then you give the winner do something right for change crombies scowling face emerged from the thinning women he muttered with caustic freighting the queen smiled enjoying his ire the runnerup with nine correct identifications is he scowled again a woman bianca of the north village mother bink breathed surprised she always did enjoy guessing games roland said with pride i think you inherit your intelligence as well as your looks from her and my courage and strength from you bulk said appreciating the compliment bianca walked sedately to the stage area she was a handsome woman who in youth had been beautiful and unlike the queen she was genuine her talent was the replay not illusion so the distaff proves itself again the queen said smirking at crombie the womanhater the prize is she paused doorman fetch the second prize you should have had it ready crombies scowl became truly ominous but he walked to a cabinet half concealed by seaweed and brought out a covered container the prize is the queen repeated then whipped off the cover a potted snapdragon there was a murmur of wellmeaning awe and envy from the ladies present as the plants several flowerheads flexed about on their stems snapping viciously snapdragons were very good for eliminating insect and animal pests and served as useful guards for houses woe to the intruder who stepped in or near such a plant but they did not take readily to potting so that a special and rather difficult spell was necessary to confine them thus wild snapdragons were common enough but potted ones rare and much prized bianca showed her pleasure as she accepted the plant turning her face away with a smile as a little dragonhead snapped at her nose part of the potting process included a spell to render the plant harmless to its owner but it took a while for it to get to know that owner its beautiful she said thank you queen iris then diplomatically youre beautiful toobut not the same way the queen snapped her teeth in mock imitation of the snapdragon then smiled graciously she craved the recognition and praise of such established and reputable citizens as bianca for iris had lived in semiexile for years before assuming the crown now the top winner servitor she said to crombie this time give it some flair if you have any the winner with thirteen correct identities crombie drawled without flair is millie the ghost and he shrugged as if to express bemusement at yet another female success he had made the count so he knew the contest wasnt rigged however it was generally understood that the men had not been trying very hard the pretty youngseeming ghost floated up she was in her fashion both the youngest and the oldest of castle roognas inhabitants she had been in her teens when she died over eight hundred years before when bhik first saw her she had been a formless blob of vapor but since the occupancy of the castle by mortals she had shaped up until her outline was as firm and sightly as that of any living woman she was a very sweet ghost well liked by all and there was applause at her victory and the grand prize is the queen spread her hands dramatically this certificate for one free answer by the good magician humfrey there was background fanfare punctuated by magically augmented applause as she handed the paper to the ghost millie hesitated having no physical substance she could not carry the certificate thats all right the queen said ill just write your name on it and magician humfrey will know its yours in fact hes probably watching us in his magic mirror at this moment why dont you ask your question now millies reply was inaudible for she could hardly speak above a ghostly whisper dont be concerned im sure everyone will be glad to help the queen said herewell write it down on the magic slate and magician humfrey can respond in the same way she gestured at crombie flunky the slate crombie paused but his curiosity made hi go along with it he fetched the slate the queen conscripted the nearest centaur who happened to be chester to transcribe the ghosts inaudible words centaurs were literate many of them were teachers so writing chores fell naturally to them chester did not like the queens attitude much better than crombie did but he also played along what possible question could a ghost have for the magician he wrote in flourishing capitals how can millie live again there was more applause the guests liked that question it was a challenging oneand the answer given publicly might provide insights for them all usually magician humfreys answers cost the asker a years service and were given only to the one who asked this party was getting interesting the words disappeared as if erased by an invisible sponge then the magicians answer showed the requirements are ree rstyou must have the true will to become mortal it was evident that millie did she gestured imploringly at the slate to continue so that she could know whether the other requirements were similarly easyor impossible technically as the common saying went nothing was impossible with magic but in practice some spells were prohibitively difficult bink yearned with her he had once longed as ardently for a magic talent upon which his citizenship welfare and selfrespect then depended to one who had died prematurely but not expired what a tremendous hope mortality might be of course if millie lived she would also die in due course but really she would be completing the life she had started so many centuries ago as a ghost she was hi hiatus unable to affect her destiny materially unable to love and fear and feel well no bink corrected himself obviously she did feelbut not in the fashion physical people did she could not experience bodily pleasure or pain cond the slate continued you must have a spell doctor restore your talent to optimum potency is there a spell doctor hi the house the queen inquired looking about her points flashing no very well errand boypoint out the nearest spell doctor crombie started a snarl but again was overcome by curiosity he closed his eyes spun about and extended his right arm it came to rest pointing northeast that would be the gap village the queen said there was a spell on the gap that rendered the giant crevice that separated xanth into the northern and southern sections unmemorable but a spot counterspell had been applied to the castle so that inhabitants and visitors could remember such things the king would have had trouble governing properly if he could not remember so critical a feature of the landscape as the gap where is our transporter on my way your highness a man said he sighted along the line crombie was pointing out concentratedand suddenly an old woman stood before them she looked about bewildered by the people and water for they were still in the undersea illusion you are a spell doctor the queen demanded yes the old woman agreed but i dont do no doctoring for foolish people sunk in the ocean especially when i get yanked from my laundry without a this is king trents coronation anniversary celebration ball the queen said haughtily now you have a choice old crone doctor one spell for us and have the run of the party and all the food and fun you want hi a costume like this the old woman was abruptly garbed like a matron of honor courtesy of the queens illusion magic or dont doctor the spell and this creature will pickle you she held up the picklepuss who hissed eagerly the old woman like crombie and chester looked rebellious but decided on the expedient course what spell millies spell the queen said indicating the ghost f ј the spell doctor studied millie then cackled it is done she said smiling broadly so that all four of her teeth showed i wonder what is so funny roland murmured do you know what millies talent is ghosts dont have talents bink said her spell in life it must be something special must be i guess we ll find out if she can fulfill the third requirement bird the slate continued immerse your skeleton in healing elixir we have plenty of that the queen said lackey the soldier was already on his way in a moment he returned with a bucket of elixir nowwhere is your skeleton the queen demanded but at this point millie balked she seemed to be trying to speak but was unable a silence spell the queen exclaimed you arent permitted to tell where it is thats why it has remained hidden all these centuries millie nodded sadly this is better yet the queen said we shall have a treasure hunt in which closet is millies skeleton a special prize to whoever finds it first she pondered fteetingly fm out of regular prizes i know the first date with millie the mortal but what if a woman finds it someone asked til have my husband the king change her into a man for the occasion the queen said there was an uneasy laugh was she jokingor serious as far as bulk knew the king could transform anything living into any other thing livingof the same sex but he never used his talent capriciously so it must be humor but what about the food chester demanded thats it she decided the women have already proved their superiority so theyll be barred from the treasure hunt theyll start in on the refreshments while the men go look for but she saw chester swelling up and realized she was going too far oh all right the men can eat too even those with appetites like horses but dont touch the anniversary cake the king will serve thatwhen the treasure hunt is over she looked momentarily pensive which was unusual for her was she sure the king would perform the cake was magnificent tier on tier of scintillating icing embroidered with a huge number crowned with a magically lifelike bust of king trent the queen always promoted the kings glory because her own glory was a reflection of it some poor chef had spent a lot of effort organizing the magic for this ornate pastry picklepuss stand guard over that cake and pickle anybody who durst touch it the queen said fastening the end of the pusss leash to the leg of the cakes table now menon with the treasure hunt roland shook his head skeletons hi closets are best left undisturbed he remarked i believe i will go congratulate your mother he glanced at bink you will have to represent our family hi the treasure hunt you dont have to search too hard he made a little gesture of parting and moved off through the glowing currents of the sea bink stood in place a moment reflecting it was evident his father knew there was something wrong but was not commenting directly and what was wrong bink knew he had a good life now with a fine if variable wife and the favor of the king why did he dream of adventures in far places of using the sword whose art he had been studying of danger and even death though he knew his talent would protect him from all genuine threats what was the matter with him it somehow seemed he had been happier when his future was in doubt and that was ridiculous why wasnt chameleon here she was near term but she could have attended the ball if she had wanted to there was a magic midwife on the palace staff he decided on with the treasure hunt maybe he could prove himself by locating that skeleton in the closet chapter treasure hunt n low he had a challenge however superficial he had to start with his brain millie was not necessarily in a closet per se her bones had to be somewhere in the palace demesnes because her ghost was herebut that could be anywhere within the moat or even the garden away from the regularly traveled sections unless the bones were buried under a floor or between walls that seemed unlikely the structure of the palace was quite solid buttressed by durability spells it would be a major undertaking to breach any floor or wall presuming that millie had died suddenly under suspicious circumstances the murderer would have had to hide her body quickly surreptitiously no rebuilding of walls to conceal it old king roogna would not have tolerated such a thing where could a body have been hidden in minutes so well as to withstand the scrutiny of centuries the kings renovations had covered every part of castle roogna converting it to the royal palace of the present kingdom the restorative artisans could not have missed anything like this so the feat seemed mechanically impossible there could be no skeletons hi these closets bink saw that other men were already busy rummaging in all the closets no use to compete directly with them even if the skeleton were there mechanically impossibleah there was the due not magically impossible the bones must have been transformed to something else something innocuous misleading the question was what there were a thousand artifacts in the palace and any one could be it yet transformation was major magic and what magician would be fooling around with a mere chambermaid so her bones might after all remain in their natural state or perhaps dissolved in solvent or ground up into powder regardless there should be some clue to their identity if only it could be correctly fathomed yes a most intriguing puzzle bink walked up to the refreshment table there were tarts and donuts and cookies and cakes and pies and assorted beverages chester was stuffing himself bink circled the table searching for something interesting as he neared the anniversary cake the picklepuss hissed at him waraingly it was catbodied with a snout that was green and prickly like a pickle and its eyes were moist with brine for a moment he was tempted to advance on it to try his magic against its magic he could not be harmed by magic yet surely the feline would try to pickle him what would happen nohe was not a juvenile daredevil compelled to prove himself by foolish exploits why force his talent to labor unnecessarily he spotted a smilingface cookie and picked it up as he brought it to his mouth the smile became an o of horror bink hesitated knowing this was merely another of the queens illusions but loath to bite anyway the cookie screwed its face hi anticipation of the awful end then when the bite did not come slowly reopened one icingdab eye here pussyou take it bink said extending the cookie to the leashed creature there was a faint zoop and the cookie was pickled one of its eyes opened the other closed now it reeked of brine he set it down on the floor and the picklepuss slunk forward and took the picklecookie in its mouth bink no longer felt hungry your spell is ailing said a woman beside nun it was the old spell doctor enjoying her unexpected participation in the proceedings the party was theoretically open to all but few gardenvariety citihad the nerve to attend but it is too potent for to fix are you a magician no just a strongly talented nonentity bink said wishing that were as facetious as it was intended to sound she concentrated no i am mistaken your spell is not sick just balked i think it suffers from lack of exercise have you used it in the last year some bink said thinking of his recent escape from the moatmonsters not much you have to use magic or you lose it she said wisely but what if there is no occasion to use it there is always an occasion for magicin xanth that hardly seemed true for him here in the palace his talent protected him from most harm but so did the favor of the king so his talent got little exercise and might indeed be getting flabby his fight with the animated sword had been the first real occasion for his talent to manifest in some time and he had sought to avoid invoking his magic there so his moat dunking was about it he remained a little wet but the undersea decor concealed that would he have to seek danger to keep his talent healthy that would be ironic the woman shrugged and moved on sampling other delicacies bink looked aboutand caught the ghostly eye of millie he went to her how is it proceeding he inquired politely at close range the ghost was audible perhaps the movement of her white lips helped it is so exciting she exclaimed faintly to be whole againl are you sure being mortal is worth it he asked sometimes when a person achieves his dream it sours was he really addressing heror himself she gazed at him with sympathy he could see the other guests milling about beyond her for she was translucent milling through millie it was slightly hard to focus on her yet she was beautiful in a special way not merely her face and figure but her sheer niceness and concern for others millie had helped chameleon a lot showing her where things were what fruits were edible and what were danger os explaining castle protocol it was millie who had inadvertently shown bink himself another facet of the magician trent back when bulk had believed the man to be evil it would be so nice if you found my bones millie said bulk laughed embarrassed millie im a married yes she agreed married men are best they are broken in experienced gentle durable and they do not talk gratuitously for my return to life for the first experience it would be so nice you dont understand bink said i love my wife chameleon yes of course you are loyal millie replied but right now she is hi her ugly phase and in her ninth month with child and her tongue is as sharp as the manticoras stinger right now is when you need relief and if i recover my life please no more bink exclaimed the ghost was striking right on target i love you too you know she continued you remind me of of the one i really loved when i lived but he is eight hundred years dead and gone she gazed pensively at her misty fingers i could not many you bink when i first met you i could only look and long do you know what it is like seeing everything and never participating i could have been so good for you if only she broke down hiding her face her whole head hazing before his eyes bink was embarrassed and touched im sorry millie i didnt know he put his hand on her shaking shoulder but of course passed right through it it never occurred to me that your life could be restored if i had yes of course she sobbed but you will be a very pretty girl im sure there are many other young men who true true she agreed shaking harder now her whole body was fogging out the other guests were beginning to stare this was about to get awkward if there is anything i can do bink said s millie brightened instantly and her image sharppned correspondingly find my bones fortunately that was not easily accomplished ill look bink agreed but i have no better chance than anyone else yes you do you know how to do it if only you put your marvelous mind to it i cant tell you where they are but if you really try she looked at him with ardent urgency its been so many centuries promise me youll try but iwhat would chameleon think if millie put her face in her hands the stares of the other guests hardened as the ghosts outline softened all right til try bink promised why hadnt his talent protected him from this but he knew the answer his magic protected him from physical magical harm millie was magical but not physicaland what she intended for hi when she became physical would not ordinarily be construed as harm his talent had never concerned itself with emotional complications bink would have to solve this triangle by himself the ghost smiled dont be long she said and drifted off her feet not touching the floor bink spotted crombie and joined him i begin to comprehend your view he said yes i noticed her working you over crombie agreed shes had her secret eye on you for some time a man hardly has a chance when one of those vixens starts in on him she believes i can locate her bones firstand now i have to try really try not just dawdle quids play crombie remarked theyre that way he closed his eyes and pointed upward at an angle i didnt ask for your help bink snapped oops sorry forget where i pointed i cant now ill have to look there and sure as hell her bones will be there millie must have known fd consult you maybe thats her talent knowing things ahead of time why didnt she skip out before she was murdered then good question maybe she was asleep whenm well youre not asleep you could skip out someone else will find her especially if i give him the hint why dont you find the bones bink demanded you could follow your finger and do it in an instant cant im on duty crombie smiled smugly i have woman problems enough already thanks to you oh bulk had introduced the womanhater to his former fiancee sabrina a talented and beautiful girl bink had discovered he didnt love apparently that introduction had led to an involvement now crombie was having his revenge bink set his shoulders and followed the direction indicated the bones had to be somewhere upstairs but maybe they still would not be obvious if he did his honest best but could not locate them yet would it be so bad that date with millie all that she had said was true this was a very bad time for chameleon and she seemed fit only to be left alone until she phased into her beautiful sweet aspect and had the baby no there lay ruin he had known what chameleon was when he married her and that there would be good times and bad he had only to tide through the bad time knowing it would pass he had done it before when there was some difficult chore or problem her smart phase was an invaluable asset sometimes they saved up problems for her to work on in that phase he could not afford to dally with millie or any other female he oriented on the room that lay on the line crombie had pointed it was the royal library where the lore of centuries was stored the ghostly skeleton was there bink enteredand there sat the king oh sorry your majesty i didnt realize come in bink king trent said fashioning a warm smile he looked every bit the monarch even when half slumped over the table as now i was meditating on a personal problem and perhaps you have been sent to provide the answer i lack the answer to my own dilemma bink said somewhat diffidently i am illequipped to comment on yours your problem chameleon is difficult and i am restless and some one is trying to kill me and millie the ghost wishes to make love to me king trent laughedthen stopped suddenly i perceive that was not a joke he said chameleon will improve and your restlessness should abate but the otherswho seeks your life i assure you there is no royal sanction for that bhik described the episode with the sword now the king was thoughtful you and i know that only a magician could actually harm you by such means binkand there are only three people of that class in xanth none of whom wishes you ill and none of whom possesses the talent of animating swords so you are not really in danger but i agree this could be very annoying i shall investigate since you made the sword captive we should be able to trace down the root of its imperative if someone has coopted one of the weapons of my arsenal uh i think that is where it came from bink said but chester centaur spotted it and took it oh well lets let that aspect drop then the alliance of the centaurs is important to me as it has been to every king of xanth throughout history chester can keep the sword though i believe we shall turn off its selfmotivating property but it occurs to me that there is a certain similarity here to your own magic whatever opposes you is hidden using other magic than its own to attack you the sword is not your enemy it was merely the instrument of the hostile power magic like my own bink repeated i suppose that could be it would not be identical since magic never repeats hi xanth but similar he looked at the king alarmed that means i can expect trouble anywhere from anything all seeming coincidental from a zombie or a sword or moatmonsters or a ghost the king agreed there may be a pattern here he paused considering yet how could a ghost she is to be restored once i find her skeletonand that may be hi this room what bothers me most is that i find myself tempted millie is a very fetching figure of a slip of a woman king trent said i can well understand the temptation i suffer temptation myself that is the subject of my present meditation surely the queen can fulfill any uh temptation bhik said cautiously unwilling to betray how freely palace speculation had dwelt on this very subject the kings private life should be private she can make herself resemble any precisely i have not touched the queen or any other woman since my wife died to king trent the word wife meant only the woman he had married in mundania yet there is pressure on me to provide an heir to the throne of xanth by birth or adoption in case there should be no suitable magician available when that time comes i sincerely hope there is a magicianl i feel obliged to make the attempt nevertheless since this was one of the implied stipulations i agreed to when assuming the crown ethically this must involve the queen so i shall do it though i do not love her and never shall the question is what form shall i have her assume for the occasion this was a more personal problem than bulk felt prepared to cope with any form that pleases you i should think one big advantage the queen had was the ability to assume a new form instantly if chameleon had been able to do that but i do not wish to be pleased i want to accomplish only what is necessary why not combine them let the queen assume her most provocative illusionform or transform her to it yourself when there is an hen change her back there is no wrong in enjoying your duty is there the king shook his head ordinarily this would be true but mine is a special case i am not sure i would be potent with a beautiful woman or any woman other than one who closely resembled my wife then let the queen resemble your wife bink said without thinking my concern is that this would degrade the memory i cherish oh i see you mean if she was too much like your wife she might seem to replace her and approximately that was an impasse if the king could only be potent with his dead wife and could not abide any other woman resembling her physically what could he do this was the hidden aspect of the king that millie had shown bink way back when his continuing devotion to his prior family it had been hard after that to think of such a man as evil and indeed king trent was not evil he was the finest magician and perhaps the finest man in xanth bink would be the last to wish to disrupt that aspect of king trents being yet the problem of an heir was a real one no one wanted a repetition of the shambles resulting from lack of a welldefined royal line there had to be an heir to serve until a suitable magician appeared lending continuity to the government we seem to have a similar dilemma your majesty bink said he tried to maintain the proper attitude of respect because of the way he had known trent before he was king he had to set a good example we each prefer to remain loyal to our original wives yet find it difficult my problem will pass but yours he paused struck by dubious inspiration millie is to be restored by having her skeleton dipped in healing water suppose you were to recover your wifes bones bring them to xanth if that worked i would be a bigamist king trent pointed out but he looked shaken still if my wife could live again you could check how well the procedure works as they try it on millie bink said millie is a ghostnot quite dead a special case like that of a shade it happens when there is pressing unfinished business for that spirit to attend to my wife is no ghost she never left anything unfinished except her life to reanimate her body without her soul bink was beginning to be sorry he had thought of the notion what horrors might be loosed on xanth if all bones were renovated hidiscriminately she might be a zombie he said there are serious risks the king decided still you have provided me food for thought perhaps there is hope for me yet meanwhile i certainly shall not have the queen assume the likeness of my wife perhaps i shall only embarrass myself by trying and failing but too bad you cant transform yourself bink said then you could test your potency without anyone knowing the queen would know and to fail with her would be to show weakness that i can hardly afford she would feel superior to me knowing that what she has taken to be iron control is in fact impotence there would be much mischief in that knowledge bink knowing the queen could well appreciate that only her respect for and fear of the kings personality and magic power held her in check his transforming talent would remainbut the respect she held for his personality would inevitably erode she could become extremely difficult to manage and that would not be good for the land of xanth could you er experiment with some other woman first that way if you failed no the king said firmly the queen is not my love but she is my legal spouse i will not cheat her or any other member of my kingdom in this or any other respect and there was the essence of his nobility yet the queen might cheat him if she saw her opportunity and knew him to be impotent bink didnt like that notion he had seen king trents reign as the onset of a golden age how fraught it was with liabilities from this vantage then bink had another inspiration your memory of your wifeit isnt just your memory of her you are preserving it is your memory of yourself yourself when you were happy you cant make love to another woman or let another woman look like her but if two other people made lovei mean the queen and a man who did not resemble youno memories would be defiled so if the queen changed your appearance ridiculous the king snapped i suppose so bink said i shouldnt have menrtioned it ill try it sorry i bothered you i bink broke off you will objectively i know that my continuing attachment to my dead wife and son is not reasonable the king said it is hampering me hi the performance of my office perhaps an unreasonable subterfuge will compensate i will have iris make me into the likeness of another man and herself another woman and as strangers we shall make the attempt do you just indulge in the courtesy of maintaining the secret bink yes of course by all means bink said feeling awkward he would have preferred to have the king devoid of human fallibilities while paradoxically respecting him for those weaknesses but he knew this was a side of the king no other person saw bink was a confidant uncomfortable as the position might be at times iuh im supposed to locate millies bones they should be somewhere in this library by all means continue your pursuit i shall seek out the queen and the king rose abruptly and departed just like thatl bink was amazed again at the alacrity with which the man acted once he had come to a decision but that was one of the qualities that made him fit to rule in contrast to bink himself bink looked at the books and suddenly realized millies skeleton could have been transformed into a book that would account for its neglect over the centuries and for millies frequent presence here she hovered often by the south wall the question was which book he walked along the packed shelves reading titles from the spines of the tomes this was an excellent library with hundreds of texts how could he choose among them and if he found the proper one somehow how could it be restored it would have to be transformed first back into the skeletonand that was magicianclass magic he kept running into this too much magic was involved here no inanimate transformer was alive today as far as he knew so millies quest looked hopeless after all yet why then had the good magician told her to use mere healing elixir it made no sense still he had promised to try though it complicated his personal situation first he had to find the book then he could worry about the next step the search took some time some texts he could eliminate immediately such as the anatomy of purple dragons or hailstones magic vs mundane but others were problematical like the status of spirits in royal abodes or tales for ghosts he had to take these out and turn over the pages looking for he knew not what more time passed he was not getting anywhere no one else came here apparently he was the only one following this particular lead his guess about the books must have been wrong there was another room above this one in a turret and crombies line intersected it too maybe there then he spotted it the skeleton in the closet that had to be it he took down the book it was strangely heavy the cover was of variegated leather subtly horrible he opened it and a strange unpleasant odor wafted up as of the flesh of a zombie too long in the sun tliere was no print on the first page only a melange of color and wash suggestive of the remains of a flattened bug quickly he closed the book he no longer had any doubt the bucket of elixir was downstairs in the ballroom bulk clasped the book hi both armsit was too heavy to hold in one arm for any length of timeand started down he met another zombie or perhaps the same one as before it was hard to tell them apart it was coming up the stairs this one he knew was real because the queen had not extended the masquerade illusion inside the palace and no illusion at all upstairs now bulk suspected the one in the garden had been real too what were the zombies doing out of their earthy resting places back off bink cried protecting the book get gmtt of the palace return to your grave he advanced menacingly on the zombie and it retreated a healthy man could readily dismember a zombie if he cared to make the attempt the zombie stumbled on the stair and fell toppling with grisly abandon down the flight bits of bone and goo were scattered on the steps and dark fluid soaked into the fine old wood the smell was such as to make bulks stomach struggle for sudden relief and his eyes smarted zombies did not have much cohesion bink followed it down pursing his lips with distaste a number of zombies were associated with castle roogna and they had been instrumental in making it the palace of the king but now they were supposed to lie safely hi then graves what ghastly urgency brought them into the party well he would notify die king in due course first he had to see to millies skeleton he entered the ballroomand found that the subaquatic motif was gone the normal pillars and walls had returned had the queen lost interest in her decorations ive got it he cried and the guests collected immediately what happened to the water the queen left suddenly and her illusion stopped chester said wiping crumbs of green cake from his face it seemed refreshments had been real enough anyway here let me help you with that book the centaur reached down with one hand and took it easily from binks tiring grasp oh for the power of a centaur i meant the healing water the elixir bink said he knew what had happened to the queen now that he thought about it the king had summoned her right here crombie said bringing it out from under a table didnt want crumbs to fall hi it the bucket was now on the floor beside the anniversary cake that doesnt look like a skeleton the manticora said transformedor something bink explained he opened the book while chester supported it there was a general murmur of awe some magic the spell doctor peered at it thats not a transfor mation thats topology magic i never saw such an extreme case before neither had the others what is topology magic crombie asked changing the form without changing it she said old crone youre talking nonsense crombie said with his customary diplomacy around the sex im talking magic young squirt she retorted take an object stretch it out squish it flat fold it you have changed its shape but not its nature it remains topologically similar this book is a person with the spirit squished out bink said wheres millie the ghost appeared silent she remained under the geas unable to comment on her body what a terrible fate she had suffered all these centuries flattened and folded into a book and prevented from telling anyone until the queens charadecontest prize had coincidentally opened the way coincidentally bulk suspected his talent was at work should the queen supervise the restoration the manticora asked the queen is otherwise occupied and must not be disturbed bink said actually it was the king he was protecting wed better proceed without her right chester said and dumped the book into the bucket wait bink cried knowing it was already too late he had contemplated a gentle immersion but perhaps this was best the dunked book shimmered millie the ghost made an almost soundless shriek as she was drawn toward the bucket then the book inflated absorbing elixir rapidly opening and unfolding as its tissues filled out the pages became human limbs and the heavy jacket a human head and torso flattened horrendously but already bulging into dolllike features grotesquely it convulsed into a misshapen mannikin figure swelling and finning into the semblance of a woman i millie the ghost still trying to scream floated into t ј mass her outline merging with that of the forming tedy suddenly the two phased completely she stood s knee deep in the bucket as lovely a nymph as could be desired and an astonishing contrast to what they had just seen im whole she exclaimed in wonder you certainly are chester agreed someone fetch her some clothing there was a scramble a form came forward bearing a decayed robe it was a zombie women shrieked everyone scrambled to avoid it crombie charged forward scowling you rotters cant come in herel out out the zombie retreated backing toward the anniversary cake not that way bink cried again too late the zombie came within range of the picklepuss who snarled there was a zoopf and the zombie was pickled squirting putrid juices it fell into the cake the picklepuss struck again pickling the entire cake as the zombie disappeared into it pickled icing flew outward explosively spattering the guests the picklepuss broke free of its leash and bounded onto the refreshment table pickling everything it passed women screamed again it was one of the foolish enchanting mannerisms they had what is going on here a strange young man demanded from the main doorway stand back bink snapped the damn queens damn pickler is on the loose now he saw a comely young woman behind the stranger they were evidently gatecrashers crombie was dashing up ill get those idiots out of the way he cried drawing his sword the picklepuss preferred to introduce itself and to clear its own way it bounded directly at the strangers there was a zapbut this time it was the puss who was pickled in a fashion it landed on the floor surprised then flapped its wings and took off it had become a deerfiy a delicately winged miniature deer my cake the strange young woman cried then bink caught on the queen and king crombie agreed appalled in illusioncostume what had bink called the queen in his distraction and crombie had drawn his sword against the king but queen iris was already at the cake pickled with a zombie in it who did this thing in her outrage she let her illusion slip she appeared before the crowd in her natural form and revealed the king in his both were in dishabille crombie the womanhater nevertheless suffered a seizure of gallantry he sheathed his sword whipped off his jacket and put it about the queens shoulders concealing her middleaged torso it is cool here highness bink hastily proffered his own jacket to the king who accepted as if this were a quite ordinary occasion thanks bink he muttered millie stepped out of the bucket gloriously naked and not cold at all i fear i did it your majesties the zombie came to help me and the picklepuss got loose the queen gazed for a long moment on millies splendor then she glanced down at herself abruptly king and queen were clothed royally again she rather resembling millie he in his natural likeness which was handsome enough bink knew as did everyone present that both were in borrowed jackets with embarrassing portions of their anatomy uncovered but now there was no sign of this and in another moment millie was also clothed in illusion garbed like the chambermaid she was yet still very pretty bulk nodded to himself it seemed his suggestion about the king changing his own image for lovemaking had been effective except that the commotion surrounding millies restoration had interrupted it the queen surveyed the ruin of the refreshments then she glanced obliquely at the king she decided to be gracious so it worked you are no longer a ghost she studied millie again appraisingly but you should be dressed for the occasion this is not a workday for you and millie appeared in a fetching fvening gown glassy slippers and a sparkling tiara l who found your skeleton millie smiled radiantly bink rescued me c the queen looked at bink your nose seems to be everything she murmured then more loudly icn bink gets the prize the first date with she broke ofi as well she might behind her the pickled zombie had risen out of the cake even pickling could not kill a zombie they were half pickled by nature clots of briny flesh dropped along with the pickled cake one amorphous glob had dropped on the queens shoulder passing right through the illusiondress and lodging whoknewwhere this was the cause of the interruption in her speech furious the queen whirled on the zombie get out of the palace you hunk of decay she shot a look at the king trent transform this monster it ruined my cake but king trent was thoughtful i think the zombie will depart of its own volition iris procure another date for millie i have need of bulks services in another capacity but your majesty millie protested make the substitute look like bink the king murmured to the queen bink come to the library in the library king trent spoke his mind here in xanth we have a hierarchy of magic as the most powerful magician i am king and the most powerful sorceress is my consort the good magician humfrey is our eldest statesman but you binkyou are anonymous you have equivalent magic but it is secret this means you dont have the status your talent deserves perhaps this constitutes a threat to your welfare but there is no danger not true bink whoever sent that sword constitutes a threat to you though probably not a great one however your talent is powerful not smart it protects you from hostile magic but has a problem with intangible menaces as we know your situation at home is not ideal at the moment and bink nodded but as we both also know that will pass your majesty agreed but your talent is not so rational perhaps so it procured for you what it deemed to be a better womanand i fault its ethics not its taste then it balked when you realized the mischief this would cause so it stopped you from having your date with millie the reanimation of the zombie was part of this probably the zombie was supposed to help you locate the skeleton but then it had to reverse its initiative there is no knowing what mischief might have resulted if millie and the queen had insisted on completing your date but we do know the havoc would have seemed to be coincidental because that is the way your talent operates we might have had the whole palace collapse on our heads or some unfortunate accident might have rendered millie into a ghost again no bink cried horrified i know you would not wish that on so nice a creature neither would i this is the reason i interceded we must simply accept the fact that you can not date millie though your talent brought her back to life i believe i have solved that problem for the nonce it is obvious that millies talent is sex appeal that accounts for her original untimely demise in ghostgenerating circumstances she shall not lack for male company other than yours sex appeal bulk exclaimed that was why the spell doctor was so amused she knew what sort of trouble there would be when she restored the spell and thats why i was so tempted by her offer despite precisely i felt it tooand i had just completed my liaison with the queen thanks to your suggestion here your jacket and the king gravely handed it back its my fault all the palace will know that i am virile as well as kingly trent finished this is no shame now iris will never know the weakness i might otherwise have shown obviously at such a moment i should not have felt any attraction to another woman i did feel it near millie so i knew magic was involved but you with a difficult home situation and millies evident desire for youbink i think we need to get you out of this region for the duication at least until we get millie settled but chameleoni cant leave her alone have no concern i shall invite her to the palace be attended by my own staff in fact i think millie self would be an excellent maid for her until we find a better situation all we need to do is remove you from the stress and temptation that necessarily attend your presence here because your talent is powerful but disruptive to palace life i am providing it guidance bink i am directing you to commence your royal mission to locate the source of the magic of xanth king trent paused and bink waited nothing happened i think my talent concurs bink said at last good the king said relaxing visibly only he knew the peril in trying to go against sinks talent i shall assign you any facilities you require someone to protect you since you may have to intrude on hazardous territory and face unmagical threats and someone to guide you he snapped his fingers chester the centaur his situation is very like yours and you are friends you can ride him and you could not have a finer ally in danger but the centaurs are not men he may not choose to go it is true that my power becomes nominal in the case of the centaurs i can not order him to accompany you but i think he will go as far as good magician humfreys castle why bink asked perplexed because only humfrey can tell him what his magic talent may be the king certainly kept up on things but that answer would cost him a years service the king shrugged no harm in talking with humfrey though chester may go along with you just to keep you company and incidentally chat with the good magician while you are there slowly bink smiled and cherie centaur would never need to know you might discuss that aspect with chester at any rate the king pondered momentarily and crombiehe can point the way for you i dont think crombie could keep up with chester bink said no man can match a centaurs steady speed over ground and chester would not want to cany two people easily solved i shall transform crombie into a form that can keep up a dragon that would frighten people and attract attention so it would very well a griffin there are a few tame ones so people would not be too curious that will deprive him of speech but give him the power of flight a fair exchange and there is hardly a better fighting animal than a griffin weight for weight with a centaur and a griffin accompanying you there should be no mundane threat you need fear he paused again even so i think you had better consult humfrey for specific advice there might be more here than we have bargained on bulk found himself filling with excitement adventure again your majesty ill find the source of magic for you when can i start tomorrow morning king trent said smiling now go home and tell your wife about your preemptive mission but dont mention millie the exghost i wont bulk agreed smiling too about to go he thought of something else do you know there is a magic mole hanging around the grounds the king accepted this communication gracefully i had not been made aware of that i have no objection so long as it does not disturb the zombies graves then he did a double take that zombie there was another in the gardens where the pile of dirt was maybe the same one i will institute an investigation in due course he fixed bink with a tolerant stare any other important intelligence to impart uh no bink said abruptly embarrassed what as he doing telling the king of such a minor matter he had lost all sense of proportionl chapter nickelpede chase n the morning they commenced the mission three males with womanproblems all professed to be glad to get away from their situations and into adventure crombie especially liked his new form he spread his wings frequently and took little practice nights indeed the soldier had much to be pleased about his lions legs were powerfully muscled and his eagles head was handsome with penetrating eyes and the feathers of his wings were glorious the plumage of his neck was blue and on his back it was black and on the front red and the wings were white a prettier monster could hardly be found in xanth but this was the wilderness no playground the moment they departed castle roogna the hostile magic closed in most of the paths in this vicinity had been charmed by order of the king so there was little danger to travelers who did not stray from them but good magician humfrey was never keen on company so there was no direct path to his castle all roads led away from it magically that meant no safe passage fortunately crombies talent of location could keep them going the right way periodically the soldiergriffin paused closed his eyes extended one wing or forepaw spun about and came to rest pointing crombies directional sense was never wrong unfortunately it did not take note of the inconveniences of straightline travel the first thing they ran into was a clump of hells bells the vines of the plants reared up their bells ringing stridently the tintinnabulation became deaf eningand disconcerting we have to get out of here bink cried but knew he couid not be heard above the noise chester had his hands to his ears and he bucked about kicking at individual bellsbut for every one he smashed a dozen clanged louder crombie spread his wings and flapped violently bink thought he was taking off but instead the griffin dug all four clawed feet into the massed vines and hauled them violently upward the vines stretched and the clangor of the bells became shrill then muted the tension prevented them from swinging properly so they could not ring bink and chester took the opportunity to scramble out of the clump then crombie let go and flew up out of range of the bells they were free of the hazard but it was a warning they could not simply barge ahead as if treading the kings highway they continued on carefully skirting the tangle trees and noose loops now crombie checked often for the nearest dangers as well as for the proper direction in some cases they had to turn aside from seemingly innocuous places ripping through itchweeds and sliding turf but they trusted crombies talent better itching and sliding than some ignominious death adventure did not seem quite as exciting now that mey were back in the thick of it or the thicket of it bink thought there were many grimy little details and inconveniences that one tended to forget in the comfort of home or palace sinks thighs were getting sore from bouncing on the centaurs back and he was uncomfortably sweaty when they got hungry crombie pointed out a soda tree growing in a patch of sugar sand chester took a sharp stone and poked a spigothole in the trees trunk so that they all could drink from the spouting soda it looked like blood a shock at first but it was actually strawberryflavored the sugar sand was too sweet so it was possible to eat only a little crombie pointed out a breadfruit tree and that was much better the loaves were just ripe so that they steamed warmly when opened and were delicious j just when the three were feeling confident again danger came questing for them crombies talent operated only when invoked it was not an automatic alert in this case the threat was a hungry dragon of medium size landbound and firebreathing about the worst enemy in xanth except for a large dragon such monsters were the lords of the wilderness and were the standard against which all other viciousness was measured had this been the largest variety they would have been lost as it was against this middle range a man and a griffin and a centaur had a fighting chance still why had the dragon come after them normally dragons did not attack men or centaurs dragons fought them but only when they had to because though the dragon was lord of the wilderness the numbers and organization and weapons of men and centaurs made them more formidable than most dragons preferred some men like the king had magic that could finish any dragon normally people and dragons left each other alone that anonymous enemycould he have sent the dragon just a little nudge in the dragons small hot brainand the result would seem like a normal wilderness accident bink remembered the kings analysis that his enemys magic was very like his own not identical of course but similar therefore insidious then his eyes spotted a little mound of dirt seemingly freshly deposited the magic mole here all xanth must be infested with the creatures both crombie and chester had fighting hearts but bmk ultimately depended on his secret talent the trouble was that protection did not necessarily extend to his two friends only by joining the fray directly could bink hope to help them for then his talent might have to save them all to save him he felt guilty about this knowing that his courage was false they could die while he was charmed yet he could not even tell them about this there was a lot of this kind of magic in xanth it was as if magic liked to clothe itself in superfluous mystery by that means enhancing itself in the manner of a pretty woman at any rate they were caught in a level clearing the dragons ideal hunting ground there were no large trees to provide either shelter or escape and no local magic they could draw on fast enough the dragon was charging a shaft of fire jetting from its mouth one good scorch from that flame would be enough to roast a man entire dragons found roasted man very tasty it was widely rumored chesters bow was in his hands an arrow nocked he was well provisioned with bow arrows sword and a length of pliant rope and knew how to use them all keep clear of the flame he yelled hes got to build up a bellyful between shots when you see him start to heave dodge sidewise good advice any creature the size of a dragon was likely to be a trifle slow maneuvering and that jet of fire needed careful aiming in fact they might be safest close to the monster so that they could dodge around it too quickly for it to orient not too close for the dragons teeth and claws were devastating crombie however also possessed claws and his beak was as good hi its fashion as teeth he had the advantage of flight he could maneuver faster than the dragon despite his mass though of course his weight was only a fraction of that of the dragon but he was not a natural griffin so would not be able to react with the same speed and precision as a true one bink himself was the weak link in the defenseor so it would naturally seem to the others bink stand backl chester cried as bmk charged forward bink had no way to explain to the centaur his seeming foolishness the dragon slowed as it came within a dragonslength its eye on its most formidable opponent the griffin crombie emitted a shriek of challenge and looped toward the dragons tail as the monsters head turned to follow him chester fired an arrow into its neck the shaft was driven with the power only a centaur could muster but it merely bounced off the dragons metallic scales have to get a shot into its mouthwhen theres no fire chester muttered bink knew how dangerous that was a clear shot into the mouth could be had only by standing more or less in front of the dragon while it opened its orifice and normally it only did that to bite or fire dont risk it he cried let combie find us an escape but crombie was out of hearing and busy and in any event the ornery centaur was not in a mood to retreat if they did not attack the dragon at their convenience the dragon would demolish them at its convenience sink moved in with his sword seeking a vulnerable spot the closer he got the larger the dragon seemed its scales overlapped they might be proof against most arrows but maybe not against a blade angled up between them if he could penetrate the armor in the vicinity of a vital organ crombie dived at the dragon screaming shrilly the divebombing of a griffin was a thing not even a dragon could afford to ignore the dragon whipped about its whole body coiling smoothly its head striking upward in a circle to intercept the griffin the huge jaws gaped but it was not quite set for fire it intended to bite off a whig or head if it could its neck was bowed toward bink who was not regarded as a threat chester shot an arrow into that mouth but his angle was bad and the missile ricocheted from a tooth crombie came close talons extended banking to avoid those gaping jaws and score on an eye bink ran in close and rammed his charmed point into the splayed scales beneath the neck the dragons body was about as thick as bink was tall and each scale was the diameter of a spreadfingered hand glossy blue and fringed with iridescence each edge was sharp as a knife as binks blade sank in those beautiful deadly scales slid closer to his hand abruptly he realized that his hand could be sliced apart before his sword did critical damage to the monster it was indeed a futile thing for a man to attempt to slay a dragon bulks thrust however hurt as the prick of a thorn could hurt a man the dragon whipped about to focus on the annoyance its neck bent in an scurve to bring the snout to bear on bink that snout seemed twice as large from this vantage it was the height of his waist and coppery with two nostrilvalves that hinged inward to prevent air from being expelled the dragon breathed in through its nose and out through its mouth probably a snootful of flames would destroy the delicate nasal passages so the system had to be failsafe below the lips were burnished and lighter in color as if alloyed with some sterner metal able to tolerate the furnace heat of the dragons breath the teeth were stained scorchbrown with black soot in the crevices the eyes were situated on the sides of the dragons cranium but the muzzle was channeled so that the creature could look directly forward to see where its fire struck at the moment those eyes were on bink who stood there with one hand on the hilt of his sword embedded in the lower curve of the sbend of flie neck dragons varied in intelligence like all creatures but even a stupid dragon would be quick enough to connect bulk with the injury in such a circumstance the nostrilvalves closed with little pings the mouth cracked open bink was about to be thoroughly scorched he froze all he could think of was his sword it was a good weapon charmed to be always sharp and tight in his hand a gift from the kings arsenal if he dodged out of the way he would have to leave that faithful blade embedded in the dragons neck for there was not tune to lever it loose he did not want to lose it so he hung onand was unable to move out of the projected path of flame a roaring developed in the belly of the dragon the throat opened into a round tube ready to eject the column of fire bink was a standing target then an arrow swished over binks still shoulder and down that open throat a perfect shot by the centaur too perfect instead of penetrating the softer lining of the deep gullet and punctuating a vital organ the arrow disappeared into the stirring flame now that flame came out a deadly shaft of golden light destroying the arrow hurtling toward bulks head and the griffin crashed into the dragons snout bearing it down just as the fire emerged the snout met the ground at binks feet there was something like explosion the dragons head was bathed in the tblast and a small crater was gouged out of the earth the griffin just missed having a wing scorched bink was left standing there sword in hand at the smoking rim unscathed the griffin snatched bink hi his claws as the dragon reoriented they were momentarily airborne as a second blast of fire passed beneath sinks dangling feet crombie could not support binks weight long on the ground let alone airborne find an escape bink cried use your talent surprised the griffin dropped bink in a pillow bush and performed his directionpointing routine in midair meanwhile the dragon coughed out several dusty fireballs sprayed particles of soot cleared its pipe and charged after them chester galloped beside it trying to get in another good shot it was evident that this dragon was too tough for the three of them together crombies right wing pointed to the side squawkl he cried chester looped back and cruised by on my back he cried buik leaped and sprawled across the centaurs rump he started to slide off grabbed wildly caught a handful of mane and righted himself while the centaur galloped on head held low bink almost tumbled forward but clasped his knees tightly and held on he looked upand saw the dragon charging headlong at them the monster must have looped back tool chesterl bink screamed in panic its in front of us front hell the centaur yelled from behind him youre facing backward dodo oops so he was the dragon was following them trying to catch up bink was holding onto chesters handsome tail no wonder the head had seemed low well it was a good way to watch the dragon the monsters gaining bulk reported wheres crombie pointing thats where im going chester called back but i dont know how far it isl his evident ire was understandable he did not like fleeing an enemy even so formidable a one as a dragon if it werent for bink the centaur would not have retreated at all crombie had indicated the direction but could not know whether they would be able to reach the place of safety in time suppose the dragon caught them first bink feared his talent would have to come into operation again that was the bravest thing i ever saw in a man chester called obviously he felt centaurs had elevated standards of bravery you stood right in front of the dragons mouth attracting his attention and you kept absolutely still so i could get a clear shot around you you could have been fried or skewered by the centaurs arrow but centaurs seldom missed their targets that wasnt bravery bmk replied i was too terrified to move a muscle so and what about when you spiked your sword into old firesnoots neck that had resembled bravery how could bink explain that the protection provided by his devious talent made such acts easier had he really believed he might get killed he might never have had the nerve i only did what you two were doing attacking to save my hide chester snorted derisively and charged on the dragon continued to gain had it been a flying one they would have been lostexcept that the flying dragons were smaller and consequently less powerful but any dragon was real trouble unless the one being attacked had nullifying magic now the dragon was coming within torching range there was dirt on its nose but its fires remained stoked it opened its mouth chester dropped into a hole hang on the centaur cried belatedly its a crevice too broad to leap evidently so bink narrowly avoided doing a somersault over chesters tail hung on and landed with gutjarringimpact the walls rose up rapidly on either side they must have approached this chasm obliquely so that it was easy to rush down inside it this must be the escape crombie had indicated indeed the griffin jas angling down to join them but the dragon followed them into the crack its long sinuous body was well adapted to this type of srture there was no crevice a centaur could hide in it would be too narrow for the dragon that made bink uncertain could this be a diversion and not the escape route suddenly chester skidded to a halt dont stop bink cried the monsters right behind us some escape route that featherbrain picked for us chester muttered with disgust wed better fight the dragon well have to bink said turning around to face the centaurs head we cant outrun it then he saw what had stopped chester nickelpedes he cried with new horror the dragon saw the nickelpedes too it skidded to a halt and tried to turn aboutbut the crevice was too narrow for effective circling it might have looped up and over its own body but that would have meant exposing its neck again where it had already been stung crombie came to land between them this was your way out birdbrain chester demanded as the nickelpedes scuttled close forming living barricades wherever there were shadows cutting off any likely escape squawk the griffin replied angrily he understood both the language and the insult perfectly though he could not reply in kind he stood up wings furled so they would not bang against the close walls and get smudged he closed his eyes whirled awkwardly and pointed with a forepaw but the paw was not firm it wavered across half a circle a few bold nickelpedes attacked each was girt with about five hundred legs and a single set of pincers and each had a taste for fresh meat a single nickelpede could be killed with a certain amount of effort and unpleasantness a hundred were insurmountable without extraordinary armor or magic but the attempt had to be made for if there was one thing worse than being roasted by a dragon it was being gouged by nickelpedes the dragon youped a nickelpede had clamped on its smallest front claw and was gouging out a disk of substance nearly an inch across the dragons claws were iron but the nickelpedes pincers were nickel hardened by magic they could gouge from almost anything chester chuckled grimly then the centaur leaped high emitting a cry like a neigh another nickelpede had scooped out a piece of one hoof chester came down stomping the little monster hard but the nickelpede scuttled to the side avoiding the blowwhile others attacked chesters remaining hooves and the dragon chuckled but their predicament was not funny the crevice was deep with a level footing below sheer vertical stone walls it was too deep for bink to jump out of he might have made it by standing on chesters back but how would the centaur himself get out the dragon could lift its head that highbut not its forefeet only the griffin might escapeexcept that the narrowness of the cleft prevented him from spreading bis wings far enough he had glided into a landing but taking off required more vigorous action and lift with chesters help he might get high enoughbut again what about chester they were trapped as much by the situation as by the walls very soon they would all be food for the swarm if they didnt get out of here yet the bulk of the dragon blocked the exit at this stage the dragon was fidgeting about trying to hoist its body off the ground so that it would not get gouged in a tender place while the nickelpedes went gleefully for its feet chester was performing similarly so was crombie who could not fly at the moment and bink himself whose extremities were the most tender of all where was his talent now its only the sunlight that holds them back chester said when the sun moves over theyll all be on us bink looked at the line of shadow at the moment the sun was high and there was only a small shadowed area but that area was packed with the pinching monsters only one nickelpede in a hundred ventured forth into the light scuttling across to theshadow of someones bodybut even so there were a dozen or more coming then bink had an inspiration we must cooperate he cried all togetherbefore we all get eaten together of course chester said but how do we get rid the dragon i mean cooperate with the dragon chester crombie and the dragon looked at him mutually startled all of them were still dancing in place a dragons too dumb to cooperate even if it wanted to chester objected even if there were any point theres just a pilot light in the monsters brain why help it eat us there would have to be a truce bink said we help it it doesnt eat us the dragon cant turn about it cant lift its body off the ground for any length of tune so it is vulnerable just as we are but it can fight the nickelpedes much better than we can so if we protect its flank flame chester exclaimed nickelpedes hate lightand flame has lots of light right bink said so if we protect its dark side and its feet and its back chester added glancing at crombie if it will trust us it has no choice bink said moving toward the dragon it doesnt know thatl watch outitll scorch you but bink protected by his magic knew he would not get scorched he walked up to the nose of the dragon and stood before the copper nostrils wisps of smoke drifted up from them there was a little leakage when the system was idle dragon he said you understand me dont you you cant talk but you know were all in trouble now and well all get gouged to pieces and consumed by the nickelpedes unless we help each other fight them off and he jumped to avoid the onslaught of another nickelpede the dragon did not respond it just looked at him bink hoped that was a good sign he drew his sword sighted at the nickelpede between his feet and impaled it neatly on the point the thing clicked its pincers as bulk lifted it undead and it strove to get at anything gougeable from this vantage the pincers were circular a nickelpede normally clamped onto its target with a few hundred legs and scooped inward to cut away a shallow disk of flesh horrible i can nullify one nickelpede at a time bink continued showing his captive to the dragons right eye i could sit on one of your feet and protect it my friend the centaur could defend your tail the griffin is actually a transformed soldier another friend he could watch for enemies dropping on your back and crunch them in his beak we can help youif you trust us how can we trust it chester demanded still the dragon did not react was it stupid or comprehending as long as it listened bink had to assume that all was reasonably well heres what we have to do he continued hurriedly as the shadow advanced and the nickelpedes grew bolder three were coming at binks own feet now it would be hard to spear them all in time the three of us must climb over you to get to your tail and back feet crombie will perch on your back so you will have to let us pass and tolerate our weight on your body well do what we can to keep your scales intact but the main job is yours once we get clear you scorch the whole mass of nickelpedes in the crevice before you fry them all they dont like light and will clear out then we can all back out of here agreed the dragon merely stared at him had it really comprehended chester took a hand dragon you know centaurs are creatures of honor everyone knows that i give my word i will not attack you if you let me past i know bink even though he is a man he is also a creature of honor and the griffin he hesitated squawk crombie said angrily crombie is also a creature of honor bink said quickly and we assume you are too dragon yet the dragon still stared at him bink realized he would have to gamble the dragon might be too stupid to comprehend the nature of their offer or it still might not trust them it was possible it had no way to respond they would have to gamble on the last alternative i am going to climb over your back bink said my friends will follow me the truce will hold until we all get out of this crevice truce he had learned to appreciate this mode of isbmpromise over a year ago when he and chameleon pad made truce with the evu magician that arrange ment had saved them all from disaster hi the wilderness it seemed no enemy was too awful to deal with in tune of sufficient peril he addressed the silent dragon again if you dont believe me scorch us now and face the nickelpedes alone bink walked boldly around the dragons head to the base of the neck where the front legs projected the dragon did not scorch him he saw the wound he had made in the neck dripping ichor that a nickelpede was greedily eating as it landed the little monster was gouging disks out of the stone floor to get every last bit of the delicacy puddling there the nickelpedes had to be the most rapacious monsters for their size in all the land of xantht bink sheathed his sword after wiping off the impaled nickelpede then stretched up his hands and jumped his head and chest cleared die top of the leg and he was able to scramble over the scales because they were lying flat they did not cut himso long as he did not rub them the wrong way the dragon did not move come on chester crombiel he called back prompted by his call and the encroaching nickelpedes the two creatures followed the dragon eyed them warily but held its flame soon the three assumed their battle stations just in time the nickelpedes had massed so thickly that the shadowed walls were bright with their highlights the shadow was advancing inexorably blast out the passage aheadl bulk yelled to the dragon were protecting your flankl and he drew his sword and speared another nickelpede on the point the dragon responded by belching out a tremendous wash of fire it scorched the whole crevice obscuring everything in flame and smoke it was as if a bolt of lightning had struck nickelpedes screeched thinly as they fell from the walls burning some even exploding success i very good bink said to the dragon wiping his tearing eyes there had been a fair backlash of hot gas now back out but the creature did not move it cant back chester said catching on its legs dont work that way a dragon never retreats buik realized it was true the dragon was limber and normally it twined about to reverse course its legs and feet were structured for forward only no wonder it had not expressed agreement to bulks proposal it could not perform without words it could not explain any negation would have seemed to be a refusal of the truce even a really intelligent creature would have been hi a dilemma there and the dragon was less than that so it had shut up but that means we can only advance deeper into the crevice bulk said appalled or wait until dark hither course was disaster hi complete darkness the nickelpedes would be upon them in a mass and gobble every part of then bodies in diskchunks called nickels what a horrible fate to be nickeled to deathl the dragons flame would not last forever the creature had to refuel which was what it had been trying to do at the outset chasing them the moment its fires gave out the nickelpedes would swarm back in the dragon cant be saved chester said get on my back bink ill gallop out of here now that were past the obstruction crombie can leap from its back and fly no buik said firmly that would violate our trace we agreed to see the whole party safe outside we did not the centaur said nettled we agreed not to attack it we stall not attack it we shall merely leave it and let the nickelpedes attack it instead bink finished that was not my understanding you go if you choose im finishing my commitment implied as well as literal chester shook his head you re not only the bravest man ive seen youre the manheadedest ie brave and stubborn bink wished it were true buoyed by his talent he could take risks and honor pledges he might otherwise have reneged on crombie and chester had genuine courage they knew they could die he felt guilty again knowing that he would get out of this somehow while his friends had no such assurance yet he knew they would not desert him so hp was stuck he had to place them in terrible peril to honor his truce with an enemy who had tried to kill them all where was the ethical course k we cant go back well just have to go forward chester decided tell your friend to get up steam the irony was unsubtlebut chester was not a subtle centaur in fact he was an argumentative brawler but a loyal friend binks guilt remained his only hope was that as long as they were all in this fix together his talent might extricate them together might dragon if you would bink called maybe theres an exit ahead maybe the moon isnt made of green cheese chester murmured it was sarcasm but it reminded bink poignantly of the time in his childhood when there had been what the centaurs called an eclipse the sun had banged into the moon and knocked a big chunk out of it and a great wad of the cheese had fallen to the ground the whole north village had gorged on it before it spoiled green cheese was the bestbut it only grew well in the sky the best pies were in the sky too the dragon lurched forward bink threw his arms about its ankle to keep from being dislodged this was worse than riding a centaur crombie spread his wings partially for balance and chester facing the rear trotted backward startled what was a cautious pace for the dragon was a healthy clip for the others bink was afraid the crevice would narrow making progress impossible then he would really have a crisis of conscience but it stabilized extending interminably forward curving back and forth so that no exit was visible periodically the dragon blasted out the path with a snort of flame but bink noticed the blasts were getting weaker it took a lot of energy to shoot out fire and the dragon was hungry and tiring before long it would no longer be able to brush back the nickelpedes did dragons like green cheese irrelevant thought even if cheese would restore the fire there was no moon available right now and if the moon were in the sky bow could they reach it then the crevice branched the dragon paused perplexed which was the most promising route crombie closed his griffin eyes and spun as well as he could on the dragons back but again his whig pointed erratically sweeping past both choices and finally falling defeated crombies spell was evidently in need of the spell doctorat a most inopportune time trust the birdhead to foul it up chester muttered crombie whose bird hearing evidently remained in good order reacted angrily he squawked and walked along the dragon toward the centaur the feathers of his neck lifting like the hackles of a werewolf rdaxlm bink cried well never get out if we quarrel among ourselvesl reluctantly crombie moved back to his station it seemed to be up to bink to decide on the route was there a chance the two branches looped around and met each other if so this was a handy way to get the dragon turned about so they all could get out of here but that seemed unlikely at any rate if it were this way either path would do bear left the dragon marched into the left one the nickelpedes followed it was getting harder to drive them off not only was the shadow advancing the oblique angle of the new passage made a narrower shaft for the sunlight bink looked up into the skyand discovered that things were even worse than they had seemed clouds were forming soon there would be no sunlight at all then the nickelpedes would be bold indeed the passage divided again oh no this was becoming a mazea deadly serious one if they got lost in it left again bink said this was awful he was guessing and it was getting them all deeper into trouble if only crombies talent were operative here strange how it had failed it had seemed to be in good order until they entered the crevice in fact it had pointed them here why had it sent them into a region that blanked it out and why had binks own talent permitted this had it failed too suddenly he was afraid he had not realized how much he had come to depend on his talent without it i he was vulnerable he could be hurt or killed by magic no i he could not believe that his magic had to remainand crombies too he just had to figure out why they were malfunctioning at the moment malfunctioning how did he know they were maybe those talents were trying to do their jobs but werent being interpreted correctly like the dragon they were powerful but silent crombie merely had to ask the right question if he asked which road leads out of the maze it was possible that any of them did or none what would his talent do then if he demanded the specific direction of out and the escape route curved wouldnt his pointing appendage have to curve about too there was no single direction no single choice escape was a labyrinth so crombie was baffled thinking his talent had failed when perhaps it had only quit in disgust suppose bulks talent was aware of this it would not worry it would show him a way to make crombies talent operate in due course but it would be better if bink figured that way out himself because then he could be sure that all of them escaped that way both friendship and honor would be preserved so now the test of his mettle was upon him how could he solve the riddle of the balked talent obviously straight direction was not the answer to the question of out yet crombies talent was directional he asked where something was and it snowed the direction if direction were not the answer in this case what wasand how could crombie identify it maybe he could use crombies talent to find out crombie he called around the dragons body where is something that will get us out of here the griffin obligingly went through his routine to no avail its no good chester grumbled his talents soured not that it ever was much good now if had a talent crombie squawked and the tone was such that it was obvious that the centaur had been treated to a rich discourse on prospective orifices available for shoving such a talent chesters ears reddened thats what youre along to find out bink reminded him right now crombies all we have i think theres a key if i can only find it hi time he paused to skewer another nickelpede the things died slowly but they didnt attack after skewering they couldnt their companions gobbled them up immediately soon it would not be possible to concentrate on anything but nickelpedes crombie where is something that will show us how to get out of here you just asked that chester grumbled no i modified the language slightly showing is not the same as he stopped to watch the griffin for a moment it seemed crombies talent was working but then his wing wavered back and forth and gave up still we must be getting warm bink said with false hope crombie where is there something that will stop the nickelpedes crombies wing pointed straight up sure chester said disgusted the sun but its going behind a cloud at least it proves his talent is working they came to another fork crombie which fork will bring us fastest to something that will help us bink asked the wing pointed firmly to the right hey it actually worked chester exclaimed mockingly unless hes faking it crombie let out another vilesounding squawk almost enough in itself to scorch a few nickelpedes but now the cloud covered the sun sinking the entire cleft in awful shadow the nickelpedes moved in with a multiple clicking of satisfaction and anticipation and gardenvariety greed dragon take the right fork bink cried blast it out ahead of you and run use up your last reserves of fire if you have to were on to something good he hoped the dragon responded by shooting out a searing bolt of flame that illuminated the passage far ahead again the nickelpedes squeeked as they died the dragon galloped over their smoking corpses carrying bink and chester and crombie along but it was tiring something sparkled in the dim passage ahead bink inhaled hopebut quickly realized it was only a willothewisp no help there no help suddenly bink remembered something thats it he cried dragon follow that wisp the dragon obeyed despite chesters incredulous neigh it snorted no more flame for its furnace was almost exhausted but it could still run at a respectable pace the wisp dodged about as wisps had always done always just at the verge of perception wisps were born teases the dragon lumbered through fork after fork quite lostand suddenly emerged into a dry riverbed were out bink cried hardly believing it himself but not yet safe the nickelpedes were boiling out of the chasm bulk and chester scrambled away from the dragon and up and out of the gully and found themselves hi the ashes of an old burn crombie spread his wings and launched into the sky with a squawk of pure relief the nickelpedes did not follow even the dragon they could not scuttle well through ashes and might get caught by returning sunlight the party was safe the dragon collapsed panting in a cloud of ashes bink walked around to its snout dragon we had a good fight and you were winning we fled and you pursued and we all got caught in the cleft we made a truce to escape and you honored it well and so did we by working together we saved all our lives now i would rather have you as a friend than an enemy will you accept friendship with the three of us before we part the dragon looked at him finally slowly it inclined its nose slightly forward in an affirmative nod until we meet againgood hunting bink said here we can help you a little crombie where is the nearest good dragonpreysomething even a tired dragon can nab crombie spun in the air and flung out a whig as he fell it pointed northand now they heard the thrashing of something large probably caught in a nooseloop bush something fat and foolish who would die a slow death in the loops if not dispatched more mercifully by the scorch of a dragon good hunting bink repeated patting the dragon on its lukewarm copper nose and turning away the dragon started north what was the point in that chester asked hi a low tone we have no need of a dragons friendship i wanted it amicable here bink said this is a very special place where peace should exist among all creatures of xanth are you crazy this is a burnout ill show you bink said well follow that wisp the willothe wisp was still present hovering not quite close enough to overtake look bink chester protested we lucked out on that wispbat we dare not follow it any farther itll lead us into destruction not this one bink said following it after a moment chester shrugged gave a whatcanyoudo kick with his hind hooves and followed crombie glided down to join them soon the wisp stopped at a glowstone marking a grave as they approached the stone lit up with the words herman the hermit uncle herman chester exclaimed you mean this is the place he the place he saved xanth from the wiggles bink said by summoning many creatures with his wisps then setting a salamanderfire to burn the wiggles out he gave his noble life in that effort and died a hero i knew the wisp would lead us here once i recognized the burnout because you are his kind and kin and the wisps honor his memory crombies talent located the wisp and the wisp uncle herman hero chester said his face twisting into an unfamiliar expression the belligerent centaur was unused to the gentle emotions of reverence and respect almost it seemed there was a forlorn melody played by a flute enhancing the mood bmk and crombie withdrew leaving chester to his contemplation hi privacy bink tripped over a pile of dirt that hadnt been there a moment ago and almost fell headlong that was the only sour note chapter magicians castle magician humfreys castle was the same as ever it stood tall and slender with stout outer ramparts and a high inner tower topped by embrasures and parapets and similar accouterments normal to castles it was smaller than bink remembered but he knew it had not changed perhaps the problem was that his memory of the ulterior made it larger than his memory of the exterior with magic it was possible that the inside really was larger than the outside the magic access routes had been changed however and the hippocampus or waterhorse was gone from the moat its time of service expired there was surely another creature standing guard inside hi lieu of the manticora bink had known the one at the anniversary party even monsters had to give a year of their lives as fee for the good magicians answers and they normally performed as guardians of the castle humfrey did not appreciate casual intrusions as they came to the moat the nature of the new guardian became apparent monster monsters the water teemed with serpentine loops some white some black sliding past each other interminably but where are the heads the tails chester inquired perplexed all i see are coils the three of them stood by the moat pondering what could a whole fleet of sea serpents have wanted to ask the good magician needing his answer so badly that all were willing to pay the fee how had they gotten here it seemed it was not for bink and his friends to know fortunately this was not a hazard he had to brave bink was on the kings business and would be admitted to the castle as soon as he made his presence known magician humfrey he called there was no response from the castle doubtless the good magician was buried in a good book of magic oblivious to outside proceedings magician it is bink on a mission for the king i he called again still no response the old gnome must be hard of hearing chester muttered let me try he cupped his hands before his mouth and bellowed magician company the bellow echoed and reechoed from the battlements but the castle was silent he should be at home bink said he never goes anywhere still we can check crombie where is the good magician the griffin went through his act and pointeddirectly toward the castle must be beyond it chester said if your talents not on the blink again crombie squawked his bine hacklefeathers rising again he stood on his hind feet and made boxing motions with his front feet challenging the centaur to fight chester seemed quite ready to oblige no no bink cried diving between them we dont want to make a bad impression hell i wanted to make a good impressionon his feathery face chester grumbled bink knew he had to separate the two combative creatures go around to the other side of the castle and get another fix on the magician he told crombie triangulate chester said triangulate bink accustomed to his friends surly manner had forgotten how educated centaurs were triangulation was a magical means of locating something without going there directly chester had a good mind and a lot of background information when he cared to let it show the griffin decided that the word was not after all a scatological insult and flew to one side of the castle and pointed again toward the castle no question about it the magician was home better fly in and notify him were here bink said we dont want to mess with those moatmonsters crombie took off again there was a small landing area between the moat and the castle but no opening in the wall so the griffin mounted to the high turrets but there seemed to be no entry there for a creature of that size so after circling the tower twice the griffin flew back i remember now bink said the windows are barred a small bird can get through but not a griffin well just have to brave the moat after all were here on the kings business chester exclaimed angrily his unhandsome face was excellent for scowling we dont have to run the gauntlet bink was piqued himself but he knew he could make it through because of his talent it is my responsibility ill see if i can navigate the castle obstacles and get his attention then hell let you in we wont let you brave that moat alone chester protested and crombie squawked agreement these two might have their rivalry but they knew their ultimate loyalty this was awkward they had no magical protection id really rather do it alone bink said i am smaller than you and more likely to slip through if i fall hi the moat you can lasso me and haul me out quickly but i could never haul you out if got a point chester admitted grudgingly crombie can fly across the water but we already know he cant get in too bad hes not strong enough to fly with you crombie started to bridle again but bulk cut in quickly he could carry your rope to me in an emergency i really think it is best this way you can help me most by figuring out what type of monsters are in that moat is there anything in the centaurs lexicon about headless serpents somebut the coils dont match the pattern they look more like pieces of a chester broke off staring it is its an ouroboros an ouroboros bink repeated blankly whats thata fleet of sea monsters it is all one monster a water dragon clutching its own tail between its teeth half of it white half black the symbolism is but there are a score or more segments all over the moat some are in toward the castle and some out near the edge looktheres three lined up parallel they cant be pieces of the same monster yes they can chester said wisely the ouroboros loops entirely around the castle but that would account for only a singlefile line of loops several tunes and its head plunges below its own coils to catch the tail a little like a mobius strip so a what never mind thafs specialized magic take my word that thing hi the moat is all one monsterand it cant bite because it wont let go of its tail so if youre good at balancing yon can walk along it to the castle but no segment shows above the water more than five feet td fall in if i tried to jump from segment to segment dont jump chester said with unusual patience for him walk even coiled several tunes around the loop the thing is too long for the moat so it has to make vertical convolutions these can never straighten out as soon as one subsides another must rise and this happens in a progressive undulation thats how the ouroboros moves in this restricted locale so you need never get wet just follow one stage of the thing to the end this makes no sense to me bink said youre speaking in centaurese cant you simplify just jump aboard the nearest loop and stay there chester advised youll understand it once you do it you have more confidence in me than i do bulk said dubiously i hope you know what im doing i trusted you to get us out of the nickelpede crevice crombie got us into chester said now you trust me to get you across that moat it isnt as if youve never ridden a monster before squawk crombie cried pointing a wing at the centaur bink smiled he had been riding the centaur score one for the soldier just dont fall off chester continued evenly youd get crushed by the coils um sink agreed sobering even with his talent backing him up he didnt like this walking the back of a moving sea monster why not walk the wings of a flying roc while he was at it he cast his gaze about as he tended to do when he sought some escape from what he knew he could not escapeand spotted another mound of earth angrily he marched a few paces and stepped on it pressing it down but when a convenient loop offered bink jumped across to it windmilling his arms in the fashion of a milltree to regain his balance the segment of monster sank somewhat beneath his weight then stabilized pneumatically though glistening with moisture the white skin was not slippery good maybe this walk was possible after all the flesh rippled the section hi front of him subsided into the water turn aboutl chester called from the bank stay with it bink turned wmdmilling again there behindbefore him the loop was extending he stepped along it hurrying as the water lapped at his heels this was like a magic highway opening out ahead of him closing behind him maybe mat was the basic principle of such oneway paths they were really the backs of monsters yet though the serpent seemed to be moving toward binks rear the loop stayed in place or drifted slightly forward so he was walking fairly swiftly to make rather slow progress ill never get across this way he complained im not even walking toward the castle youll get there chester called keep your feet going bink kept walking and the centaur and griffin moved slowly around the moat to keep pace suddenly a loop developed between him and his friends hey fve crossed to an inner loopand i never left this one bink exclaimed you are spiraling inward chester explained there is no other way to go when you get to the inner bank jump off bink continued rather enjoying it now that he had his sea legs and understood the mechanism there was no way he could avoid reaching the other shore so long as he kept his place here yet what an ingenious puzzle it was could he have solved it without chesters help abruptly the segment narrowed he was coming to the end of the tail then the head of the ouroboros came in sight its teeth firmly clamped to the tail suddenly nervous again bink had no alternative but to tread on that head suppose it decided to let go the tail just this once and take him in instead the big dragon eyes stared briefly at nun sending a chill through his body then the head was past continuing its undulation into the water and bink was treading the massive neck broad as a highway after the slender tail apparently this dragon serpent or whatever was independent of air it could keep its head submerged indefinitely yet how did it eat if it never let go of its tail it couldnt be eating itself could it maybe that had been its question for the magician how could it let go of its tail so it could consume the idiots who walked along its length no if it had the answer to that it would have gobbled up bink as he passed jump bmk chester called oopshad the serpent changed its mind let go and come to gobble bink looked back but saw nothing special then he looked aheadand discovered that the body was twisting down and under the adjacent leg of the spiral no more highway he leaped to shore as his footing ended now he was at the outer rampart of the castle he looked for the great doorway he had encountered on his first approach to this castle back before trent was kingand found a waterfall a waterfall how had that gotten here he traced it upward and saw a ledge the water issued from omewhere out of sight to course down over the frame lof the door was there an aperture behind the sheet of water jbink did not relish getting wet here after traversing ithe whole moat dry but he would have to look he fremoved his clothing and set it aside so that it would not get soaked then nudged cautiously into the waterfall the water was cool but not chill there was a small air space behind it then the wood facing of the door he explored the surface with his hands pushing here and there but found no looseness anywhere there was no entrance here he backed out of the fall shaking his head to clear it of drip where could he go from here the ledge circled the castle but he knew the wall was solid stone throughout there would be no access to the interior nevertheless bink made the circuit verifying his suspicion no access what now he suffered a surge of anger here he was on the kings business why should he have to go through all this nonsense the old gnomemagician thought he was so clever putting a maze around himself bink had just about had it with mazes first the queens then the nickelpede crevice now this but at heart bink was a practical man in due course the pressure of his anger ceased like the steam of a relaxing dragon he came to look at the waterfall again this was no mountain with natural drainage the water had to be raised by mundane or magical means to an upper level then poured out surely it was a circulatory system drawn from the moat and returning to it could he swim in where the water was sucked up no water could go where he could not such as through a sieve he could drown if his body got stuck in the water channel not worth the risk the only other direction was up could he climb yes he could he now noted little handholds hi the wood at the edge of the waterfall here i come he muttered he climbed as his head poked over the sill he froze there on the roof squatted a gargoyle the water issued from its grotesque mouth then he realized that this monster like the ouroboros should not be dangerous if he handled it properly the gargoyle assigned to waterspouting duty would be unlikely to chase him bink clambered to the surface of the small roof he surveyed the situation from this firmer footing the gargoyle was about his own height but it was mostly face the body was so foreshortened as to represent no more than a pedestal the head was so distorted that bink could not tell whether it was man animal or other huge eyes bulged the nose was like that of a horse the ears flared out enormously and the mouth took up fully a third of the face with the water pouring out like a prolonged regurgitation behind the monster the wall of the castle resumed there were no handholds and even if he could scale it he saw only barred apertures above no particular hope there bulk contemplated the gargoyle how had it gotten up here it had no real hands or feet to use to climb the way bink had was there a door behind it that seemed reasonable he would have to move the monster away from that door but how the thing had not attacked him but its attitude might change if he molested it the gargoyle was more massive than he it might shove him right ofi the roof too bad he didnt have his sword to defend himself that was with his clothing back beside the moat should he climb back down to get it no he was sure that would not be wise it would give away his intent the gargoyle could move over and crunch his fingers as he ascended with the weapon maybe he could bluff it move over foulface i am on a mission for the king the gargoyle ignored him that was another thing that was getting to bink being ignored move or ill move you myselfl he stepped toward the monster no reaction how could he back down now trusting his talent to protect him bink moved in beside the gargoyle staying clear of the river of water spouting from its mouth and applied his hands to its surface the grotesque face felt like stone completely hard it was heavy too shove as he might he could not budge it this monster was defeating himand it hadnt even noticed him then bink had a bright idea sometimes creatures i were vulnerable to their own specialties the gargoyles specialty was ugliness bink stood before it straddling the river hey homelyheres what you look like he put his fingers hi the comers of his mouth to stretch it wide while he bugged his eyes the gargoyle reacted it pursed its lips to funnel the water toward bink bink jumped nimbly aside nyaat he yelled puffing out his cheeks to make another ludicrous face the monster shuddered with rage it shot another blast of water at him bulk was tagged by the fringe of it and almost washed off the ledge this was after all a chancy business he opened his mouth and stuck out his tongue haa he cried unable to form anything much better while holding the expression the gargoyle was infuriated its mouth opened until it took up half the face but with the opening that large the water emerged at low pressure dribbling down the ugly chin bulk dived forwarddirectly into that mouth he scrambled upstream against the slowly moving water and emerged into a reservoir tank within the castle in a moment he had stroked to the surface and climbed out he was inside but not yet safe a cactus cat perched at the edge of the reservoir it was about half binks height with a normal feline face but its fur was composed of thorns on the ears the thorns were very large and stiff like slender spikes but the cats real weapons were on its front legs knifelike blades of bone projecting from the front scintillatingly sharp these obviously could not be wielded endwise like daggers but would be devastating as slicers the thornfur was horizontally striped green and brown and this pattern carried over into the three tails a pretty but dangerous creature one that no cognizant person would pat casually on the head saying nice kitty was this another guardian of the castle or merely a houseguest cactus cats normally ran wild slicing up cactus with their blades and feeding on the fermenting sap needle cactuses fought back however shooting their needles into anything that annoyed them so they were natural enemies to the cactus cats encounters between the two were said to be quite something but there was no cactus of any land here maybe this was an animal soliciting an answer from the good magician buik tried to skirt it but the cat moved lithely to the only apparent exit and settled there so it seemed he would have to force the issue regardless suddenly bink got mad he had had enough of these obstructions he was no mere supplicant he was here on the kings business cat get out of my way he said loudly the animal began to snore but bink knew it would come awake instantly and violently if he tried to sneak past it cats were ornery that way this creature was playing cat and mouse with himand that made him madder yet but what could he do he was no needle cactus with hundreds of sliverthorns to launch how could he strike at this insufferable cat needles there were other missiles than needles then pay the consequencel bink snapped he leaned over the reservoir and sliced his hand across its surface scooping out a fierce splash of water the droplets arched across the room and splatted against the wall beside the sleeping cat the creature rose up with a screech of sheerest feline fury sparks radiated from its ears most cats hated water other than small tame amounts for drinking and desert cats were enraged by it the thing charged bink its forelimb blades gleaming bink scooped another volley of liquid at it the cat leaped straight up in horror letting the splash pass under oh it was ecstatically angry now we can handle this two ways cactus bink said calmly his hand ready by the water either i can soak you down thoroughlyor you can stand and let me pass or any combination of the two the cat snarled it looked at bink then at the water finally it affected loss of interest hi the manner of balked felines and stalked to the side all three tails standing stiffly very good cactus sink said but a word to the cunning if i were to be attacked on the way i should simply have to grab my antagonist and plunge into the pool and drown him whatever the mutual cost that would be inconvenient and i hope it does not become necessary the cat pretended not to hear it settled down again to sleep bulk walked toward the door affecting a nonchalance similar to that of the cactus cat but was wary fortunately he had bluffed it out the cat did not move now he was past the hurdles he explored the castle until he located the good magician humfrey the man was gnomelike perched on top of three huge tomes so as to gain the elevation he needed to pore over a fourth he was old perhaps the oldest man in the land of xanth with skin wrinkled and mottled but he was a fine and honest magician and bulk knew him to be a kindly individual under all his gruffness magician bink exclaimed still irked by the challenge of entry why dont you pay attention to whos visiting i had to run your infernal gauntletand im not even coming as a supplicant fm on the kings business humfrey looked up rubbing one reddish eye with a gnarled little hand oh hello bink why havent you visited me before this we were yelling across the moat you never answeredl humfrey frowned why should i answer a transformed griffin who squawks in a manner that would make a real griffin blush why should i acknowledge the bellow of an ornery centaur the one has no question and the other doesnt want to pay for his both are wasting my time so you were aware of us all the time bink exclaimed halfangry halfadmiring with a little indefinable emotion left over what a personality this was rout you let me struggle through the whole needless needless bink you come on a mission that will cost me an inordinate amount of time and will threaten the welfare of xanth itself why should i encourage you hi such folly i dont need encouragement bink cried hotly all i need is advice because the king thought that was best the good magician shook his head the king is a remarkably savvy customer you need more than advice bulk well all i need from you is advice you shall have it and without charge forget this mission i cant forget this mission im on assignment for the so you said i did tell you that you needed more than advice youre as ornery as your friends why didnt you leave that poor dragon alone leave the poor bink started indignantly then he laughed youre some character magician now stop teasing me and tell me why since you obviously have been well aware of my progress you did not let us into the castle the easy way because i hate to be disturbed for minor matters had you been balked by my routine defenses you could hardly have possessed the will to pursue your mission properly but as i feared you persevered what started as a minor diversion with a shapely ghost has become a serious quest and the result is opaque even to my magic i queried beauregard on the matter and he got so upset i had to rebottie him before he had a nervous breakdown beauregard that was the bespectacled demon corked in a container highly educated bink began to feel uncomfortable what could so shake up a demon the end of xanth humfrey said simply but all im looking for is the source of magic bulk protested im not going to do anything to harm xanth i love xanth you werent going to install the evil magician as king last time you were here humfrey reminded him your minor personal quests have a way of getting out of hand you mean this present mission is going to be worse than the last one bink asked feeling both excited and appalled he had only wanted to find his own talent before the magician nodded soberly so it would seem i can not fathom hi what precise manner your quest will threaten xanth but am certain the risks are extraordinary bink thought of giving up the quest and returning to chameleon ugly and sharp of tongue as she was at the moment with millie the nonghost hovering near suddenly he became much more interested hi the source of the magic of xanth thanks for your advice im going on less hasty binki that was not my magic advice that was just common sense for which i make no charge i knew you would ignore it bink found it hard at times not to get impatient with the good magician lets have your magic answer then and what do you proffer for payment payment bink expostulated this is the kings business the magician finished be realistic bink the king is merely getting you out of his hair for a while until your home life sweetens up he cant have you tearing up his palace every time he tries to make out with the queen that hardly warrants my waiver of fee only a foolish man tried to argue with a magician whose talent was information bink argued the king merely timed the mission conveniently my job always has been to seek out the source of magic it just took me a while to get around to it it is important for the king to have this knowledge now that im actually on the quest the authority of tiie king is behind it and he can call on your resources if he chooses you knew that when you helped make him king humfrey shook his head trent has become arrogant in his power he draws ruthlessly on the talents of others to forward his purposes then he smiled in other words he is exactly the kind of monarch xanth needs he does not plead or petition he commands i as a loyal citizen must support that exercise of power he glanced at bink however capriciously it happens to be exercised thus my fee becomes forfeit to the good of xanth though hi this case i fear it is the bad of xanth this capitulation was too sudden and too amiable there had to be a catch what is your answer then what is your question bink choked on a mouthful of air what do i need for this quest he spluttered your quest can not be successful unless you take a magician along take a magician bink exclaimed there are only three magicianclass people in xanth and two of them are the king and queen i cant he broke ofl realizing you i told you this was going to cost me time humfrey grumbled all my arcane researches interrupted my castle mothballedbecause you cant wait a few days for your wife to finish her pregnancy and get sweet and pretty again you old rogue bink cried you want to come i hardly made that claim the magician said sourly the fact is this quest is too important to allow it to be bungled by an amateur as well the king understood when he sent you here since there is no one else of suitable expertise available i am forced to make the sacrifice there is no necessity however that i be gracious about it but you could have sought the source of magic anytime you didnt have to coopt the quest right when i i coopt nothing it is your quest i merely accompany you as an emergency resource you mean youre not taking over what do i want with leadership i shall stick to my own business leaving the pesky details of management and routing to you until my resources are neededwhich i trust wul not be soon or often now bink was uncertain how serious humfrey was surely a man who specialized in magical information would be seriously interested in the source of magic but certainly the good magician liked his convenience and privacy as his castle and mode of operation testified probably humfrey was torn between desires for isolation and knowledge so reacted negatively while doing what he deemed to be the right thing no sense in aggravating the situation the man would certainly be an incalculable asset on a quest of this nature i am sorry to be the agent of such inconvenience to you but glad to have your help your expertise is vastly greater than mine umph humfrey agreed trying not to seem mollified lets get on with it go tell the troll to let down the drawbridge for your companions uh there is one other thing bink said someone may be trying to kill me and you want to know who yes and why i dont like that is not the kings business it will have to be covered by a separate fee oh just when bink had begun to suspect there was a decent streak in the good magician he had this confirmation of the mans mercenary nature one year of service for the answer bink preferred to locate and deal with his enemy himself forget it he said it is already forgotten humfrey said graciously milled bink trekked downstairs found the troll and gave it the instruction the brute winched down the bridge where the drawbridge mechanism was bink did not know as it had not been apparent from the outside and the troll stood hi a chamber near the center of the castle there had to be magical augmentation to connect what the troll did to what the bridge did but it worked and chester and crombie entered at last emerging from a gate that opened from the center of the castle how could there be an opening here with no hole through the wall the magician was evidently squandering a lot of magic here maybe some clever technician had brought a question and constructed this mechanism in fee i knew youd come through bink the centaur said what did the old gnome say about your quest hes coming with me chester shook his head youre in trouble the magician came downstairs to meet them so you want to know your obscene talent he said to the centaur what fee do you offer the old gnome chester was for once abashed im not sure i centaurs arent supposed to arent supposed to be wishywashy humfrey asked cuttingly chester just came along to give me a ride bink said and fight dragons bink will still need a ride humfrey said since i am now associated with this quest it behooves me to arrange for it i proffer you this deal in lieu of the customary years service for the answer i will accept service for the duration of this quest chester was startled you mean i do have a talent a magic one indubitably and you know it already what it is i do then but the centaur paused i might figure it out for myself if it was so easy for you to do why should i pay you for it f why indeed the magician agreed but if i dont figure it out and if bink gets in trouble because he meets a dragon when im not there i would love to let you stew indefinitely in your dilemma humfrey said but i am in a hurry and bulk needs a ride so ill cut it short undertake the service i require in advance of my answer if you fail to solve your talent yourself i will tell you at the termination of the questor any prior time you so request if you do solve it yourself i will provide a second answer to whatever other question you may ask thus you will in effect have two answers for the price of one chester considered momentarily done he agreed i like adventure anyway the magician turned to crombie now you are directly in the kings service so are committed for the duration he has given you a fine form but it lacks intelligible speech i believe it would be better for you to be more communicative accordingly meet another of my feeservitors grundy the golem a miniature manfigure appeared his whole height hardly the span of an ordinary mans hand he seemed to have been formed from bits of string and clay and wood and other refuse but he was animate the griffin looked at the golem with a certain surprised contempt one bite of that eagles beak could sever all four appendages from the figure squawk crombie remarked same to you birdbeak the golem said without special emphasis as if he didnt really care grundys talent is translation the magician explained i shall assign nun to render the soldiers griffinspeech into human speech so we can better understand him he already understands us as so many animals do so no reverse translation is required the golem is small enough for any of us to carry without strain so his transportation will be no problem bink will ride the centaur and i will ride the griffin that way we shall make expeditious progress and so efficiently it was arranged the quest for the source of the magic of xanth had begun chapter golem heights i hey stood outside the castle across the moat watching while the magician mothballed his residence the ouroboros and other creatures under fee had been granted leaves of absence and were already gone humfrey fumbled in his clothing showing a large heavy belt containing many pockets and drew from this belt a closed vial or narrow bottle he applied his thumbs to its cork until it popped free smoke swirled out looming high into the sky then it coalesced into the largest moth bink had ever imagined with a wingspan that cast the entire castle into shadow the creature flew up over the castle and dropped a ball as the ball fell near the highest turret it exploded graywhite streamers shot out in a huge sphere drifting down to touch every part of the castle then they drew in tight and suddenly the whole edifice was sheathed in a silky net and looked like a giant tent a cold bitter odor emanated from it smelling vaguely disinfectant there humfrey said with grudging satisfaction thatll keep a hundred years if it has to a hundred years chester exclaimed is that how long you figure this mission will take come on come on were wasting time the good magician grumped bulk astride the centaur looked across at the griffin what he means crombie is that we need to know the direction of the source of magic the mission should be accomplished in a few days with your help the griffin squawked irately well why didnt the old fool say so the golem translated promptly he shared the griffins back with the magician as the two together massed barely half what bink did well spoken soldier chester muttered low crombie whirled almost throwing off his riders that way grundy said pointingaround in a continuing circle his tiny arm settling nowhere oh no chester muttered his talents on the blink again it is not malfunctioning humfrey snapped you asked the wrong question bints brow furrowed we had some trouble that way before what is the right question its your job to pursue this quest humfrey said i must conserve my information for emergencies and he settled down comfortably amid the feathers of the griffins back and closed his eyes the good magician remained his taciturn self he was out of the habit of helping anyone without his fee even when he himself might benefit from such help now bink was on the spot again he had to figure out how to make crombies talent workwhile the magician snoozed before in the nickelpede cleft crombie had fouled up because there had been no single direction for escape was that the case nowno single source for magic if so that would be very hard to locate but the cynosure of this group was on him he had to perform and in a hurry it was evident that the good magician had done him no particular favor by leaving the leadership of the quest to bink where is the most direct route to the source of magic this time the griffins wing pointed down at an angle so that was why there was no horizontal direction the source was not across but down yet that was not much help they couldnt dig down very far very fast they would have to get a person whose talent was magictunneling and that would mean delay and awkwardness this group was already larger than bink had anticipated better to find a natural route where is there an access to this source from the surface bmk asked the wing began to vibrate back and forth the nearest one bulk amended hastily the wing stabilized pointing roughly south the heart of the unexplored wilderness chester said i should have known maybe i should take my answer now and quit crombie squawked birdbeak says if you take your stupid answer now you cant quit horserear chester swelled up angrily birdbeak said that you tell him for me he has bird droppings for brains and easy bink cautioned the centaur crombie needs no translation for your words actually he called you an ass grundy said helpfully i assume he meant your rear end which is about as asinine as the griffin squawked again oops my error the golem said he referred to your front end listen birdbrainl chester shouted i dont need your ignorant opinion why dont you take it and stuff it but crombie was squawking at the same time the two faced off aggressively the centaur was bigger and more muscular than the griffin but the griffin was probably the more deadly fighter for he had the mind of a trained human soldier in the body of a natural combat creature squawk bmk screamed i mean stop the golem is just making trouble obviously the word crombie used was centaur isnt that so crombie crombie squawked affirmatively spoilsport grundy muttered speaking for himself just when it was getting interesting never mind that bink said do you admit i was correct golem ma centaur is an assfront and rear grundy said sullenly it depends on whether you are defining it intellectually or physically i think i will squeeze your big loud mouth into a small silent ball chester said reaching for the golem you cant do that muleface grundy protested tin on the dwarfs business chester paused seeing the good magician stir whose business this midgets business grundy said gesturing back at humfrey with a single stiffened finger chester looked at humfrey feigning perplexity sir how is it you accept such insults from a creature who works for you oops the golem muttered discovering the trap i thought he was asleep the golem has no personal reality humfrey said therefore his words carry no personal onus one might as well get angry at a lump of clay thats telling him imp grundy agreed but he seemed chastened lets get on with our quest bink suggested as the good magician closed his eyes again privately he wondered how it was that an unreal construct the golem could be hi fee to the magician grundy must have asked a question and had an answerbut what could have motivated this magical entity to seek such information then bink had a minor inspiration as they trekked south crombie someone or something has been trying to eliminate me i think thats why the dragon came after us can you point out where that enemy is squawk crombie agreed he whirled and the good magician wobbled on his back but did not wake up when the wing stabilized it pointedthe same direction as it had for the source of magic it seems chester said gravely that it is your mission your enemy opposes does that affect your attitude yes bink said it makes me twice as determined as before though he remembered that the sword had attacked him before he set out on this quest had his enemy anticipated him that would be grim news indeed implying more than ordinary strategy or magic lets get on with it near the magicians castle the terrain was fairly quiet but as they penetrated the wilderness it changed high brush grew up obscuring the view and as they passed it there was a static discharge from the foliage that made hair and fur and feathers and string stand out eerily from then bodies overlooking this brush was an antenna orienting unerringly on the party bink had never gotten close enough to one of these things to discover exactly what it was and did not propose to start now why did these antennae watch so closely yet take no action sweat gnats came making them all miserable until humfrey woke brought out a tiny vial and opened it vapor emerged and spread engulfing the gnats then it suddenly sucked back into its bottle carrying the gnats with it misty was due for feeding anyway the good magician explained putting away the vial he offered no further explanation and no one had the nerve to inquire again humfrey slept must be nice being a magician chester said hes got the answer to all his problems in one bottle or another must be acquisitions from prior fees bink agreed then they blundered into a patch of curseburrs the things were all over their legs itching incessantly there was only one way to get rid of such a burr it had to be banished by a curse the problem was no particular curse could be used twice hi a day each had to be different humfrey was not pleased to be awakened yet again this tune it seemed he had no solution in a vial by flie beard of my greatuncle humbug begone the good magician said and the burr he addressed fell off stunned by the snout of a sick sea serpent begone and another dropped chester was more direct for several burrs were tangled in his beautiful tail to the grave with you prickleface ill stomp you flat as a nickelpedes nickel out out damned burr and three burrs fell overwhelmed leave me binfc said envying the imagination of the others go itch a dragon and his burrs too started falling though not so readily as those conked by the harderhitting curses of the others bink just didnt have the touch crombie however was in trouble griffins were not native to this particular region of xanth and the burrs evidently did not comprehend his squawks then the golem started translating and they fell in droves by the bloody mouths of a field of wild snapdragons drop your ugly purple posteriors into the nearest stinking privy sidewise if your faces were flowers youd poison the whole garden jam your peppery pink rootlets up your the golem paused amazed is that possible i dont think i can translate it but the curse burrs comprehended and suddenly the griflbns bright feathers were free of them no one could curse like a soldier still it was impossible to avoid all the burrs in this area and by the time they escaped it their curses had become extremely farfetched sometimes two or even three curses had to be expended to make a single burr let go by this time they were hungry there was nothing like a good bout of cursing to work up an appetite you know this area chester said to the magician before he could fall asleep again where is there something to eat dont bother me with details humfrey snapped i brought my own foodas you would have done too had you had proper foresight he opened another vial this time the vapor emerged to coalesce into a layered cake complete with icing the magician took this from the air broke out a perfect wedgeshaped slice and ate that while the remainder of the cake dissolved misted and flowed back into its bottle i realize we were remiss in not packing food for the journey bink said you dont suppose you might share some of that this one time why should i suppose anything like that humfrey inquired curiously well we are hungry and it would facilitatem the magician burped go find your own slop freeloader the golem translated it occurred to bink that the good magician was not as congenial a companion as the evil magician had been the last time he had braved the wilderness of xanth but he well knew that appearances could be deceptive crombie squawked birdbeak says there should be some fruit trees around hell point them out and the griffin did his thing pointing the direction in a moment they spied a giant fruit cup the plant was the shape of an open bowl filled to overflowing with assorted fruits the party ran joyfully up to it and startled the fruits erupted upward filling the air with color oh notheyre winged fruits bink exclaimed we should have sneaked up on them why didnt you warn us crombie you didnt ask fathead the golem retorted catch them chester cried jumping and reaching high to snatch an apple out of the air bink halfdislodged hastily dismounted a ripe peach hovered for a moment getting its bearings bink leaped at it catching it in one hand the wings fluttered frantically as it tried to escape then gave up they were leaves green and ordinary adapted to this special purpose he stripped them off ruthlessly so his food could not escape and went after the next he tripped over something and fell flat missing a bobbing pomegranate angrily be looked at the obstacle that had thwarted him it was another of the ubiquitous mounds of fresh earth this time he got up and stomped it absolutely flat then he dashed on after more fruit soon he had a small collection of fruits apple peach plum two pears several grapes and one banana the last flying on monstrous vulturelike wingleaves had given him a terrible struggle but it was delicious bink did not feel entirely easy aout consuming such fruit because it seemed too much like living creatures but he knew the wings were fflerely a magic adaptation to enable the plants to spread their seeds more widely fruit was supposed to lie eaten it wasnt really conscious or feeling or was ft bink put that thought from his mind and looked about they were on the verge of a forest of standing deadwood humfrey came awake i suffer misgivings lie volunteered i dont want to have to waste my magic ferreting out what killed those trees wed better go around whats the good of being a magician if you dont use your magic chester demanded testily i must conserve my magic rigorously for emergency use humfrey said these are mere nuisances we have faced so far not worthy of my talent you tell em twerp the golem agreed chester looked unconvinced but retained too much respect for the magician to make further issue of it its getting on in the afternoon he remarked wheres a good place to spend the night crombie stopped and whirled so vigorously he almost dislodged his riders hmphl humfrey exclaimed and the golem dutifully translated you blundering aviary feline get your catty feet on the ground the griffins head rotated entirely around until the deadly eyes and beak pointed back squawkl crombie said with authority the golem did not translate but seemed cowed crombie completed his maneuver and pointed a slightly new direction thats not far off the track well go there chester decided and no one contradicted him their route skirted the dead forest and this was fortuitous because there were few other hazards here whatever had killed the forest had also wiped out most of the magic associated with it good and evil yet buik developed a mounting curiosity about the huge trees they spied to the side there were no marks upon them and the grass beneath was luxuriant because of the new light let down this suggested that the soil had not been poisoned by any monster indeed a few new young shoots were rising beginning the long task of restoring the forest something had struck and killed and departed without other trace of its presence to distract himself from the annoyance of the unanswerable riddle bmk addressed the golem grundy if you care to relate itwhat was your question to the magician me the golem asked amazed you have in terest hi me of course i do bink said youre a he had been about to say person but remembered that the golem was technically not a person an entity he finished somewhat lamely you have consciousness feelings no no feelings grundy said i am just a construct of string and clay and wood animated by magic i perform as directed without interest or emotion without interest or emotion that hardly seemed true you seemed to experience a personal involvement just now when i expressed interest in you did i it must have been a routine emulation of human reaction i have to perform such emulations in the course of my translation service bink was not convinced but did not challenge this if you have no personal interest in human affairs why did you come to the good magician what did you ask him i asked him how i could become real the golem said but you are real youre here arent you take away the spell that made me and id be nothing but a minor pile of junk i want to be real the way you are real real without magic real without magic it made sense after all bink remembered how he himself had suffered as a youth thinking he had no magic talent this was the other face of the problem the creature who had no reality apart from magic and what was the answer care what care dumbbell care care thats all all all the answer i ah the answer stupid and for that you serve a years labor you think you have a monopoly on stupidity bink turned to the good magician who seemed to ive caught up on his sleep but remained blithely silent how can you justify charging such a fee for such an answer i dont have to humfrey said no one is required to come to the grasping old gnome for information but anyone who pays a fee is entitled to a decent answer bink said troubled the golem has a decent answer he doesnt have a decent comprehension well neither do i bink said nobody could make sense of that answer the magician shrugged maybe he asked the wrong question bink turned to chesters human portion do you call that a fair answer yes the centaur said i mean that one word care nothing else for a whole years service yes you think its worth it bink was having trouble getting through yes youd be satisfied with that answer for your question chester considered i dont think that answer relates so you wouldnt be satisfied no fd be satisfied if that were my answer i just dont believe it is i am not a golem you see bink shook his head in wonder i guess im part golem then i dont think its enough youre no golem grundy said you arent smart enough some diplomacy but bink tried again chester can you explain that answer to us no i dont understand it either but you said i said i thought it was a fair answer were i a golem i would surely appreciate its reference its relevance this is certainly more likely than the notion that the good magician would fail to deliver in full measure bink remembered how humfrey had told the manticora that he had a soulin such a manner that the creature was satisfied emotionally as well as intellectually it was a convincing argument there must be some reason for the obscurity of the answer for the golem but oh what frustration until that reason became clear near dusk they spied a house crombies talent indicated that this was their residence for the night the only problem was the size of it the door was ten feet tall that is the domicile of a giantor an ogre humfrey said frowning an ogre bink repeated we cant stay there hed have us all in his pot in a moment and the fire high chester agreed ogres consider human flesh a delicacy crombie squawked the idiot claims his fool talent is never mistaken grundy reported yes but remember what his talent doesnt cover bmk said we asked for a good place to spend the night we didnt specify that it had to be safe i daresay a big pot of hot water is as comfortable a place to relax as any chester agreed until it becomes too hot then the bath becomes i suppose ill have to expend some of my valuable magic humfrey complained its too late to go wandering through the woods in search of alternate lodging he brought out yet another little stoppered bottle and pulled out the cork it was an ornery cork as corks tended to be and gave way only grudgingly so that the process took some time uh isnt that a demon container bink asked thinking he recognized the style some bottles were solider than others and more carefully crafted with magical symbols inscribed shouldnt you the magician paused umph he says he was just about to nitwit the golem said believe it if you will the magician scraped a pentacle hi the dirt sat the bottle in it and uttered an indecipherable incantation ie cork popped out and the smoky demon issued ssi coalescing into the bespectacled entity bink recognized as beauregard the educated demon didnt even wait for the question you routed me out for this old man of course its safe that ogres a vegetarian its your mission thats unsafe i didnt ask you about the mission humfrey snapped i know its unsafe thats why im along it is not like you to indulge in such foolishness especially at the expense of your personal comfort beauregard continued pushing his spectacles back along his nose with one finger are you losing your marbles at last getting senile or merely attempting to go out in a blaze of ignominy begone infernal spirit i wul summon you when i need your useless conjectures beauregard shook his head sadly then dissipated back into the bottle thats another feeling spirit bink said uneasy do you have to coop him up like that in such a little bottle no one can coop a demon the magician said shortly besides his term of service is not yet up at times it was hard to follow the mans logic but you had him when i first met you more than a year ago he had a complex question a demon of information who answers the questions you get paid fees for has to pay you for answers humfrey did not respond bink heard a faint booming laughter and realized after a moment that it was coming from the demons bottle something was certainly funny here but not humorous wed better move hi before it gets dark chester said eyeing the ogres door somewhat dubiously bmk would have liked to explore the matter of the demon further but the centaur had a point they stepped up to the door it was a massive portal formed of whole tree trunks of hewn ironwood scraped clean of bark and bound together by several severed predator vines bmk marveled at this unrusted ironwood could be harvested only from freshly felled trees and not even a magic axe could cut those very well and what monster could blithely appropriate the deadly vines for this purpose the vines normally used their constrictive power to crush their prey and they were killingly strong chester knocked resoundingly there was a pause while the metallic echoes faded then slow thuds approached from inside the door wrenched open with such violence that the ironwood hinges grew hot and the suction of air drew the centaur forward a pace light burst out bundingly and the ogre stood there in terrible silhouette it stood twice binks height dwarfing even the monstrous door and its body was thick in proportion the limbs carried knots of muscles like the gnarly boles of trees ungh it boomed he says what the hell is this bad smell the golem translated bad smell chester cried hes the one who smells it was true the ogre seemed not to believe in washing or in cleansing magic dirt was caked on his flesh and he reeked of rotting vegetation but we dont want to spend the night outside bink cautioned crombie squawked birdbeak says lets get on with it slowpokes birdbeak would chester grumbled the ogre grunted stoneface says thats what hes sniffin a putrid griffin the griffin stood tall and angry halfspreading his brilliant wings as he squawked howd you like that problem corrected by amputation of your schnozzle grundy translated the ogre swelled up even more massively than before he growled me grind you head to make me bread the golem said then there was a medley of squawks and growls with the golem happily carrying both parts of the dialogue come outside and repeat that numbskull come into me house you beaked mouse me break you bone upon me dome youd break your dome just trying to think crombie squawked do all ogres speak in rhyming couplets bink asked when there was a pause to replenish the reservoirs of invective or is that just the golems invention that little twit not have wit the golem said then reacted angrily whos a twit you frogfaced sh ogres vary as do other creatures humfrey cut in smoothly this one does seem friendly friendly bink exclaimed for an ogre wed better go on in me test you mettle in me kettlel the ogre growled via the golem but the griffin nudged on in and the ogre gave grudging way the interior was close and gloomy as befitted the abode of a monster the blinding light that had manifested when the door first opened was gone evidently the proprietor had charged up a new torch for the occasion and it had already burned out dank straw was matted on the floor stocked cordwood lined the walls and a cauldron bubbled like volcanic mud over a fire blazing in a pit in the center of the room there seemed to be however no piles of bones that at least was encouraging bink had never before heard of a vegetarian ogre but the demon beauregard surely knew his business bink realizing that the constant threats were mostly bluffs found himself embarrassed to be imposing on the goodnatured monster what is your name he inquired you lunch me crunch apparently the brute had not understood my names bink what s your name me have hunch you not know crunch the ogre dipped a hairy grimy mitt into the boiling cauldron fished about grabbed withdrew a gooey fistful plunked it into a gnarly wooden bowl which he shoved at bink drink bink he means his name is crunch chester said catching on hes offering you something to eat he doesnt distinguish between meals all food is lunch oh uhthank you crunch bink said awkwardly you lunch me crunchnow it made sense an offer of food an answer to a question rather than a threat he accepted the glop the ogre served the others similarly his huge paw seemed immune to the heat bink looked at his portion dubiously the stuff was too thick to pool too thin to pick up and despite its bubbling heat it hardly seemed dead yet it was a deeppurple hue with green excrescences it smelled rather good actually though there was a scalded fly floating in it chester sniffed his serving appreciatively why this is purple bouillon with green nutwooda phenomenal delicacy but it requires a magic process to extract the bouillon juice and only a nutty green elf can procure nutwood how did you come by this the ogre smiled the effect was horrendous even in the gloom me have elf work for pelf the golem translated then crunch lifted a log from his stack and held it over the cauldron he twisted one hand on each endand the wood screwed up like a wet towel a thin stream of purple liquid fell from it into the cauldron when the log was dry the ogre casually ripped it into its component cords and tossed it into the fire where it flared up eagerly well that was one way to burn cordwood bhik had never before witnessed such a feat of brute strength rather than comment he fished out the fly dipped a finger into his cooling pudding brought out a creamy glob and put it gingerly to his mouth it was delicious this is the best food i ever ate he exclaimed amazed you say that bink you think it stink crunch growled flattered crombie squawked as he sampled his bowl you may stink this is great the golem translated crunch highly pleased by the double compliment served himself a glob by dumping a bubbling fistful directly into his gaping maw he licked off his fingers then took another glob as the others finished their helpings the ogre served them more with the same hand no one saw fit to protest after all what magic germs could survive that heat after the repast they settled on the straw for the evening the others seemed satisfied to sleep but bink was bothered by something in a moment he identified it crunch among our kind we offer some return service for hospitality what can we do for you to repay this fine meal and lodging say thats right chester agreed you need some wood chopped or something that no good have plenty wood the ogre grunted he smashed one fist down on a log and it splintered into quivering fragments he obviously needed no help there crombie squawked birdbeak says he can point out where anything is what do you want stoneface want sleep you creep crunch mumbled not until we do you some service bink insisted take heed no need crunch closed one fist on a handful of straw squeezed and when he let go the straw had fused into one spindly stick the ogre used this to pick at his gross teeth chester argued caution for once we cant force a service on him he doesnt want maybe he doesnt know he wants it bink said we must honor the code you sure are a stubborn lout grundy said for once speaking for himself why stir up trouble its a matter of principle bink said uncertainly crombie can you point out where the thing crunch desires is the griffin squawked affirmatively spun about stirred up the straw and pointed at the good magician humfrey nodding in the corner one piece of straw straddling his head forget it humfrey snapped sleepily i am not available for consumption but hes a vegetarian bink reminded him it cant be that he wants to eat you maybe he wants to ask you a question not for one measly nights lodging hed have to serve me for a year me have no question no suggestion the ogre grunted it does seem were forcing something unwanted on our host chester said surprisingly diplomatic that logtwisting and strawsqueezing and woodsplintering had evidently impressed the centaur profoundly the ogre was clearly the strongest creature this party had encountered there is something crunch wants even if he doesnt know it himself bink said it is our duty to locate it for him no one argued though he was sure they all wished he would drop the subject crombie maybe it isnt the magician he wants but something on the magician exactly where did you point crombie squawked with tired resignation he pointed again bink lined up his own finger tracing the point there he said something in his crotch then he paused abashed uh his jacket maybe but the magician tired had fallen asleep his only answer was a snore oh come on grundy said ill check it out and he scrambled up on the magician climbing inside his jacket i dont thmk bink began startled by this audacity thats your problem the golem said from inside the jacket it must bethis he emerged clasping a vial in both arms for him it was a heavy weight thats the demonbottle chester said dont fool with but grundy was already prying out the cork bink dived for him but as usual was too late the cork was not ornery this time it popped off cleanly as bink grabbed the bottle now youve done it chester exclaimed if humfrey wakes bink was left holding the bottle as the demon coalesced unbound by any magic inscription or incantation somesomesomebody make aa bink stammered beauregard firmed standing with a huge tome tucked under one arm he peered at bink beneath his spectacles a pentacle the demon finished i think not what have i done bink moaned beauregard waved negligently with his free hand you have done nothing bink it was the foolish golem but i set him in motion perhaps but do not be concerned rather consider yourself as the instrument of fate know that neither the bottle nor the pentacle constrained me i but honored these conventions to please the magician to whom i owed professional courtesy the agreement was that i should serve in this capacity of reserveinformant until circumstances should free me by the ordinary rules of demon control that chance has now occurred as it was fated a genuinely bound demon would have escaped so i am free to go i thank you for that accident and now i depart he began to fade wait bink cried at least answer this nice ogres question beauregard firmed again he has no question he only wants to sleep ogres need plenty of rest or they lose their meanness but crombies talent indicated oh that technically there is something but it is not a conscious desire it will do bink said he had not realized that ogres could have unconscious desires tell us what it is before you go he wants to know whether he should take a wife the demon said the ogre growled what kind of life if me have wife the golem said now thats interesting beauregard said a golem serving fee for an answer he can not comprehend who could make sense of a oneword answer grundy demanded only a real creature beauregard replied thats the pointhes not real bink said he wants to know how to become real beauregard turned to the centaur and you want to know your talent i could tell you of course but you would then be in fee to me and neither of us would want that why dont you just answer the ogres question and go bink asked not quite trusting this tooknowledgeable freed demon i can not do that directly bink i am a demon he would not accept my answer rational though it would be he is of an irrational species like yourself you must answer him me i bulk broke off not wanting to comment on his present problem with chameleon i spoke in the plural beauregard said a bit condescendingly you and chester and crombie should discuss your relations with your respective females and the consensus will provide the ogre with the perspective he needs he considered in fact hi that context my own comment might become relevant and he settled down on the straw with them there was a silence uh how did youthat is there is a lady ogreuh ogress in mind bink asked crunch the ogre responded with a volley of growls snorts and gnashings of yellow teeth it was all the golem could do to keep up the translation but grundy rose to the occasion and spouted at the height of his form one lovely bleak morning during thunderstorm warning me wandered far out beyond hail of a shout me was hi a good mood just looking for food no creature stirred this far from home no dragon no monster not even a gnome me entered a forest huge and tall the trees were so big me seemed small the way was so tangled no walker could pass but it opened like magic a lovely crevasse with nickelpedes and more delights and stagnant water rich with blights and me tramped up to a hidden castle with shroud for flag and scalp for tassel the wind blew by it with lovely moans and all the timbers were giant bones at entrance slept little dragon called puk guarding what left meself awestruck a fountain packed with purple mud spouting gouts of brightred blood me stared so long me stood in doze and me mouth watered so hard it drooled on me toes but me knew such enchantment would be complete the moment me yielded and started to eat me wanted to see what further treasure offered itself for the heros pleasure and hi the center hi a grimy sack lay a wonderful ogress stretched on a rack she had hair like nettles skin like mush and she face would make a zombie blush she breath reeked of carrion wonderfully foul and she stench was so strong me wanted to howl me thought me sick with worm in gut but knew it was love for that splendid slut me smashed she in face with hairy fist which is ogre way of making tryst then me picked she up by she left leg and dragged she away me golden egg then whole castle come awake goblin and troll and green mandrake they celebrated the union of hero and cute by pelting we with rotten fruit but on way out we tripped a spell that sounded alarm where evil fiends dwell they had put castle to sleep for a hundred years those fiends who hated ogres rears they fired a spell of such terrible might we had to flee it in a fright me dodged it every way me could but it caught we good in midst of wood as it struck me cried me crunch no bone and it thought we ogres both had flown it dissipated in such mighty flash the whole near forest was rendered trash now me crunch no bones lest fiends of lake learn they curse have make mistake me not want them throw another curse maybe like first and maybe worse me love lies stunned within the wood sleeping away she maidenhood but one thing now gives me pause she never did make much applause all me want to know is this should me leave or fetch the miss the others sat in silence for a time following this remarkable recital at last crombie squawked that was a considerable adventure and romance grundy said for him while i can appreciate the fetching qualities of your lady friend i must say from my own experience that all females are infernal creatures whose primary purpose in life is to deceive entrap and make miserable the males therefore the ogres grunt interrupted the griifin hi midsquawk hee hee hee hee hee hee grundy translated interrupting himself me fetch she instantly chester smiled despite my friends recommendation i must offer a note of caution no matter how badly the filly nags the stallion and how unreasonable she normally seems there comes a time when she births her first foal then the dam no longer has much interest in she no nag that is snag crunch growled disappointed but in due course bink said she is bound to return to normal often with extremely cutting wit in any event i should think some nagging is better than no nagging so why not rouse your beauty and give her a proper chance she may make your life completely miserable the ogres eyes lighted like torches i must concur beauregard said this conversation has been a most intriguing insight into the condition of human animal and ogre emotions what is nagging to humans is applause to ogres this will do nicely to conclude my dissertation your what bink asked my doctoral thesis on the fallibilities of intelligent life on the surface of xanth beauregard explained i sought information from the human magician humfrey and he assured me that a term of service in his bottle would provide me the insights i required since a persons nature may best be gauged through the questions he considers most vital this has indeed been the case and i am now virtually assured of my degree that will qualify me to form permanent liaison with my chosen demoness who would seem to be i worth the effort this causes me to experience a certain demoniac exhilaration therefore i present you each with a small token gleaned from my researches the demon turned to chester i prefer not to inform you of your magic talent directly for the reason given above but will provide a hint it reflects the suppressed aspect of your character because you like most centaurs have disbelieved in magic among your kind whole aspects of your personality have been driven as it were underground when you are able to expiate this conditioning your talent will manifest naturally do not waste a year of your life for the answer of the good magician just allow yourself more selfexpression he turned to crombie you can not escape your te in this manner when you return from this quest if you returnsabrina will trap you into an unhappy marriage unless you arrange for a more suitable commitment elsewhere before you see her therefore enjoy yourself now have your last fling and do not be concerned for the morrow for it will be worse than today yet marriage is not after all for you a fate worse than death you will know that when you do face death he left the crestfallen griffin and oriented on the golem the meaning of the magicians answer to you is this people care inanimate objects do not only when you experience genuine feelings that preempt your logic will you be real you can achieve this height only if you work at itbut beware for the emotions of living things are in many cases extremely uncomfortable he turned to crunch i say to you ogre go fetch your lady she sounds like a worthy companion for you in every respect a truly horrendous bitch and crunch was so moved he almost blushed beauregard turned to bink i have never been able to fathom your magic but i feel its operation now it is extremely strongbut that which you seek is infinitely stronger if you persist you run the risk of being destroyed and of destroying those things you hold most dear yet you will persist and so i extend my condolence until we meet again he faded out the members of the remaining circle exchanged glances lets go to sleep chester said that seemed like the best idea of the evening chapter magic dust in the morning they thanked the ogre and continued on their quest while crunch tramped eagerly into the dead forest to rouse his beautiful bride her with the hair like nettles and skin like mush they had new material for thought now they knew the cause of the death of the treesbut what of the evil fiends who dwelt in the lake and possessed such devastating curses were there magicians among them and was the source of magic near them magician humfrey was particularly thoughtful ether he had not been entirely asleep during the evening session or he had drawn on his informational magic to ascertain the situation he had to know that the demon beauregard was gone what magic he murmured could devastate an entire living forest by the dissipation of a single curse why have i not known of this before you never thought to look chester said undiplomatically were looking now bink pointed out magic should be stronger near the source crombie squawked strong magic is one thing magicianclass curses are another let me get another line on it and he did his act once more they were headed in the right direction the terrain seemed ordinary large trees glowered at the trespassers while small ones shied away as well as they were able fruit flies buzzed about berries cherries and grapefruits hovered as if in search of another salad bowl tempting paths appeared through tangled reaches which the party avoided as a matter of course in xanth the easy course was seldom best there was a dragon run with scorch marks on the trees to show the dragons territorial limits the safest place to be when pursued by a dragon was a few paces within another dragons marked demesnes any poaching would lead to a settlement between dragons but soon the way became more difficult brambles with glistening points and ugly dispositions closed off large sections and a pride of ant lions patrolled others a copse of stinkweeds surrounded the most direct remaining route and they were of a particularly large and potent breed the party tried to pass through them but the stench became so intense that even the ogre might have hesitated they retreated gasping they contemplated the alternatives brambles and ant lions bink tried to clear a path through the plants with his sword but every time he made a cut several more branches closed in threatening his body these were exceptionally alert brambles and the sheen on then poults suggested poison bink backed off once again he was up against the possibility that his talent might protect him while letting his friends die he approached the antlion section the lionheaded ants had beaten out good highways throughout and ruthlessly eliminated all hazards in their way all hazards except the ant lions themselves sinks sword might dispatch one lion and chesters arrows and hooves could handle two or three more and as a griffin crombie could take on as many as fourbut the creatures would attack a dozen at a time without fear or mercy again bink himself would probably emerge intact by some incredible flukebut what of the others he turned backand his eyes wandered skyward he saw a path through the trees the tops of the trees he rubbed his eyes a path in air yet why not with magic he reminded himself for the umpteenth time all things were possible the question was could men and halfmen walk on it and if they could where did it lead still it seemed to be the most promising route if he rode chester his talent would not let them get on the airy path unless it would support them both the griffin magician and golem weighed much less so they would be safe if they followed i think i see a way bink said they tried it they located a place where the magic path looped down within reach of the ground and crombie whirled and pointed to discover whether v there was any danger along this limitedaccess highway there was not they climbed aboard and followed it up high into the trees the strange thing about it was that the path was always level no matter how it looped the forest turned crazy circles about it however at times the sun was underfoot and at times to one side while the trees assumed varying angles bink curious reached out to touch the foliage of one tree whose trunk reached up into the ground above it was solid of course he knew that he was the one who was upside down the path established its own orientation looking back he could see the griffin marching at a different tilt and knew that to griffin magician and golem the centaur was the tilted one intriguing magic but harmless so far meanwhile he enjoyed the convenience and the view the path led through the forest generally high above the ground and this new view of things was refreshing slants of sunlight crossed it and gently hued columns of mist it was neither manseye nor birdseye but an intermediate and unique perspective the path passed safely above the antlion range yet below the flyingpredator range bink observed several small flying dragons a harpy and a distant roc but none flew near the path the plants too were unusually passive constrictor tentacles dangled in the vicinity of the path but never on it and no branches reached across to block it obviously this path was charmed and that was suspicious the best paths were almost by definition the worst ones bink remembered how easy it had been to penetrate the forest around castle roogna back when it had been derelict and how hard it had been to escape it what were they walking into now crombies talent said there was no danger in the direction the path wentbut crombies talent could be too literal to bink anything that might delay the completion of his quest was a threat onesimply could not aflord to trust strange magic hed better ask the good magician of course its safe bulk humfrey said with irritation do you suppose i would be riding it otherwise bulk hadnt even asked the question yet the magician retained his special talent though his grumpy refusal to use it for the convenience of the party made his company seem at times to be worth little more than that of a harpy what point was there in having a magician along if he never used his magic to facilitate things even the evil magician had freely pitched in when danger threatened to that is the point sink humfrey said there is no present danger when the situation changes i will expend my carefully hoarded magic you are young yet you dissipate your resources heedlessly and get into scrapes you should have avoided served him right for letting his thoughts flow carelessly bulk shut up mentally and rode on in due course the path wound down to a pleasant little village with houses thatched with hay and daubed with colored muds and neat walkways connecting places of fault interest do you notice chester said there is no magic in the local construction only mundane materials thats right bink said surprised if were approaching the source of magic on a magic path shouldnt there be more magic rather than less he turned to the griffin crombie are you sure this is crombie squawked birdbeak is sure this is the right direction the golem said but the village may be a mere item on the way not the destination itself a grizzled old harpy flapped out to meet the party as it reached the foot of the path all of them braced for trouble for harpies were notorious but this one though suitably hideous was clean and unaggressive welcome travelers she said without even bothering to insult them a most restrained harpy uh thanks bulk said were looking fora x place to spend the night we dont mean any mischief he had never heard of a harpy acting polite so remained on guard hand over sword you shall have it she agreed you are all males yes bink said uneasily we are on a quest for the source of magic your village appears to lie near this we five males the harpy said what a bonanza were not interested in your females chester said with some of his normal belligerence crombie squawked not their minds anyway the golem translated chesters lip curled with almost equine facility bink had to speak at once before another quarrel brewed we shall be happy to do some chore for you hi return for food and safe lodging overnight then tomorrow if you have information about magic you will have to discuss that with trolla the harpy said this way please and she flapped off muttering once more men with hideous excitement then again you may have a point chester murmured to crombie if we have fallen into a nest of harpies we may be best advised to get on that aerial path and go back the way we came bink finished glancing back but the path was gone they could not escape that way trolla turned out to bea female troll she was almost as ugly as the harpy but she too was amazingly polite i realize you are uneasy you handsome male visitors trolla said and you have reason to be but not because of any of the residents of this village allow me to serve you supper while i explain our situation bink exchanged glances with the others both centaur and griffin looked distinctly uncomfortable but the good magician seemed to have no concern trolla clapped her horny hands and several woodnymphs came in bearing platters their hair was green their skin brown their lips and fingernails red like flowering trees but their outlines were human each was a pert lithe fullbreasted bare beauty each eyed bink and humfrey with more than casual interest hunger might be a better term the food was virtually mundane vegetables and fruits harvested locally and small dragon steaks milkweed pods provided the liquid it was good milk but in no way special you may have noted we have used no magic in the preparation of this meal trolla said we use as little magic as possible here because there is more magic here than anywhere else on the surface of xanth i realize that may not make much sense to you quite sensible humfrey said chomping into another steak trolla focused on him you must be a magician sir umph he seemed to be more interested in his food than in her discussion bink knew that was deceptive humfrey paid close attention to all things magic if you areif any of you have strong magici must caution you to be extremely careful in exerting it she said please do not misunderstand this is no threat we do not want you to feel at all uncomfortable here it is simply that all magicwell permit me to make a small demonstration she clapped her hands and a nymph entered as buxom and bare as the others bring a small firefly trolla said in a moment the nymph returned with the firefly it was very smallthe kind that generated hardly more than a spark harmless it squatted on the table rather pretty with its folded flamehued wings and insulated legs now observe what happens when i frighten it trolla said she rapped the table with a hooflike knuckle the firefly jumped up startled and generated its momentary fire a burst of light and heat emanated from it and a ball of smoke roiled up toward the ceiling a spot on the table a handsbreadth in diameter was charred the firefly itself had disappeared it burned itself up chester exclaimed it did not mean to trolla said this was a nor mal xanth firefly not acclimatized to this region here near the source its magic is multiplied a hundredfold thus its little spark became a selfimmolating fireball until you males become acclimatized i urge you not to practice your magic in this village we value your presence and do not wish you to suffer any mishaps bulk looked to humfrey but the good magician continued eating uh none of us have inflammatory magic bink said realizing that it was up to him to respond for their party yet he wondered what would his talent do if anything threatened what it might intend to be a mere coincidental amelioration might become much worse but it would be best ifif nothing seemed to threaten our welfare there is unfortunately a most extreme threat to your welfare trolla said gravely because you are males you must have noticed we have no males in this village we noticed bink agreed your nymphs seem quite intrigued by us indeed the nymphs were hovering so close that sinks elbows tended to bump their soft midriffs as he ate our problem is this trolla continued a siren has been luring away our males originally we were a normal human village except for our unique and critical task then the siren came and deprived us of our men because our job could not be neglected we undertook at great personal risk the construction of the charmed access route you arrived on so as to encourage immigration but the new men too were soon taken away from us we extended our search to nonhuman people this was how i myself came here with my husband the troll but the awful drain continued i was soon a widowand not by the proper route bink felt sudden alarm some female trolls ate their husbands it was said that the only thing a troll was afraid of was his wifewith excellent reason was this predaceous female looking for another husband our village now is composed of every type of intelligent female trolla continued and a number of supporting animals the magic access route transports only intelligent creatures but some animals drift in through the jungle but the sirenthis is what i meant by the danger to you once you hear her call you will disappear into the forest and never return we would spare you this if we could but we are helpless unless we resort to unconscionable measures what would those be bink asked nervously we might deafen you so you could not hear her trolla explained or geld you so that you would not react to why dont some of you females go out and slay the siren chester asked meaning no ofiense madam but you could probably handle it the siren i would gladly tear apart and consume in bleeding chunks trolla said but i can not pass the tangle tree the siren has made a deal with the tangler the tree lets the males through to her but grabs the females then you need to eliminate the tangle tree bink said with magic as strong here as youve shown it should be a fairly simple chore a few fireflies or some pineapple bombs this is no ordinary tangle tree trolla said we have tried to destroy it but though it is outside our village it has absorbed enough extra magic to foil our efforts we are after all only femalesand the men will not fight it when they are in thrall to the siren bink took a deep breath i believe this is the service we can render hi return for your hospitality tomorrow we shall slay the tangler trolla merely shook her head sadly it is kind of you to think so she said but the siren will not permit it the siren did not know about binks talent since both siren and tangle tree were magical entities his magic would protect him against them somehow but considering the possible complications of the enhanced potency of magic here he would do best to tackle the tree alone he didnt want his friends being hurt by the backlash maybe he could sneak out at night and do it while the others slept crombie squawked what is the village employment crone the golem translated we are situated atop the sourcelode of magic trolla said this is the origin of the magic of xanth the dust is highly charged with magic and were it allowed to accumulate most of the rest of xanth would slowly become mundane while the village would develop a fatal concentration thus we must spread the dust about maintaining a reasonable equilibrium she looked about we seem to have completed our repast allow me to show you our operations umph humfrey agreed now bink was sure the magician was only feigning disinterest as was his fashion the conclusion of their quest was at hand yet bink found himself disappointed he had expected more challenge to the acquisition of this knowledge than this trolla showed them to a large central building fashioned of mundane stone inside it was one huge gravel pit where small female elves gnomes and fairies dug and scraped out sand with their little picks and scoops they loaded it into wheeled wagons drawn by female centaurs a manticora and a small sphinx binks skin prickled when he approached the sand strong magic was associated with it no doubt of that yet this was the first tune he had encountered indeterminate magic that sand performed no magic of its own and cast no spells it merely was magic waiting for direction bink was not quite sure he could believe that the sand was hauled to another structure where three huge hephalumphs tramped it constantly into dust the hephalumphs were animals normally wild creatures of the wilderness but these were evidently tame and well cared for and seemed happy then a captive rocbird blew the dust into the air employing great sweeps of her monstrous wings so powerful was this forced draft that small tornadoes formed hi the turbulence the technicolor hailstorms bink exclaimed fallout from this operation exactly trolla agreed we try to feed the dust high into the sky so that it will ride the upper currents all over xauth before it falls but localized storms bring it down prematurely the region immediately downwind of us is untenable for intelligent life the concentration of airborne dust disrupts the local ecology and leads to madness thus there are risks associated with our operationbut we must continue we should be pleased if you males would remain here encouraging our femalesbut we know you must flee before the siren calls unfortunately our access route is oneway we have been too busy recently to construct a departure ramp you can escape only through the region of madness yet this is preferable to the siren we shall help you all we can but not until we render our service bink said we have assorted talents and should be able to handle this but privately he was uneasy he found it hard to believe that they should prevail where all other men had failed and he wondered again why the source of the magic of xanth had remained unknown all these centuries if the people of this village had known about it all along maybe the fact that no one ever seemed to leave this village and liveor maybe the magic dust fogged up other magic so that things like magic mirrors could not focus on this area there were probably a lot of secrets in the land of xanth that remained to be discovered we shall have a gathering this evening trolla said some of our younger girls have never seen a male and deserve this chance you will meet everyone and we shall plan how we can best help you to escape the siren so far no way has been found to block off her sound from the males though we females can not hear it we can with your permission confine you in cages so that you can not respond to no bink and chester said together and crombie squawked you are true males always ready for a challenge trolla said with sad approval in any event we would have to let you out sometime and then the siren would get you so cages are no solution we need to be rid of the sirenl her face for a moment assumed the aspect of savage hate that was normal to trolls but then she softened i will show you to youi lodging and call for you again at dusk please be courteous to our villagers your presence here is a considerable event and the girls are untrained in social decorum when they were alone bink addressed the magij cian something is funny here will you use your magic to fathom the true situation do i have to do everything humfrey grumped listen you dwarfish gnome chester snapped weve been working our tails off while you just loaf along humfrey was unruffled anytime you wish to have your payment for your effortsw bink decided he had better intercede though he had considerable sympathy for the centaurs position he had not realized there would be so many problems in leadership we seem to be at our objective the source of magic but it has been too easy and i the villagers are too accommodating only you can tell us whether we have in fact completed our quest or whether we have walked into a manconsuming trap surely this is the occasion to employ your magic if you would be so generous moh all right humfrey said ungraciously you dont deserve it after the way you loosed beauregard i but til take a look the magician drew out a mirror mirror mirror in my hand are you the finest in the land the mirror clouded turning deep red oh stop blushing humfrey snapped i was only testing bink remembered a mirror like this it answered only in pictures and somewhat circuitously a toodirect question about a toodelicate matter could crack it up are you aware of the source of the magic of xanth the magician asked a picture of a baby appeared smiling that evidently meant yes i can you tell me the location of that source aside to the others he murmured this is the crucial point at home the mirror never could reveal this information but here with stronger magic the baby smiled again humfrey echoed that smile anticipating victory will you tell me that location again the cherubic smile bink felt his pulse pounding he realized the magician was approaching the subject with extreme caution the mirror took each question literally and did not volunteer anything this circuitous approach insured that the mirror would not be overwhelmed by too abrupt a challenge please show that location on your screen the mirror went dark oops bink murmured is it broken the mirror brightened a crying baby appeared it tells you no humfrey snapped kindly allow me to continue my investigation he returned to the mirror are you showing me a scene of underground the baby smiled in short you verify that the source of magic is not in this village we are presently sitting in a big question mark appeared you are saying the source of magic is in this village the good magician asked sharply the question mark returned hm a problem of resolution here humfrey muttered the mirror cant choose between truths anybody have another approach its a matter of perspective chester said if the magic dust is the source there may be more than one cache of it more likely a channel of it welling up from the depths thus the source has a multiple definition depending on whether you are thinking of the source on the surface or the source of the source now there is a creature with a disciplined mind humfrey said approvingly if only he would discipline it more often instead of quarreling with the soldier he faced the mirror is the centaurs analysis correct the baby smiled now the magician continued are you aware of the motivation of these villagers when he received the smile he asked do they mean well by us the smile confirmed it bink felt relief and trolla spoke the truth about the curse of the siren another smile humfrey looked up now it gets difficult he said seeming pleased bink realized that this man too enjoyed a challenge the magic ability the good magician had held in reserve was now being used and it was good magic so far we have merely been confinning what we already knew now we must venture into the unknown he returned to the mirror are you able to tell us how to deal with the villagers problem the cherub smiled unusually responsive humfrey remarked aside the local magicenhancement is indeed multiplying the mirrors power we have a major research tool now rather than a minor one he returned once more to the mirror how are you males ready trolla inquired from the door they jumped bink was about to explain then saw humfreys quick negative nod the mirror had disappeared the good magician did not want to reveal the secret of his magic to these villagers not just yet well they had gleaned a lot already and could resume the use of the mirror when convenient thats a pretty dress bink said to trolla this was no lie the dress was very pretty though she remained a female troll evidently a festive occasion was in the making they followed her out the center circle of the village had been transformed nonmagically a genuine wood bonfire blazed sending sparks and smoke up to the sky it was dusk and the stars were beginning to show it was as if the sparks went up into the sky to become those stars and perhaps bink thought the potent magic of this region made that so the stars had to get up there somehow didnt they the females of the village were lovely in their party apparel there were many more young ones than had been evident before and now that their work shift was over they were eager and more than eager to mingle with the strange guests bink was surrounded by nymphs sprites and human maids while humfrey was mobbed by fairies lady elves and minionettes three fetching centaur fillies attended chester a pair of griffin cows eyed crombie but they hardly had a chance with this transformed woman hater they were after all animals there was even female golem for grundy yet how sad the remaining females lookedthe manticora the sphinx and the harpies they had no males to cater to uh girlsim a married man bink protested as his covey pressed in she will never know a buxom bluemaned lass informed him we need you more than she does and she planted a firm kiss on his left eyethe only part of him she could reach because of the density of other girls j yes no man leaves this village except at the call of the singing bitch a furry beauty added it is our duty to hold you here to save your life wouldnt your wife rather have you used than dead awkward question how would chameleon feel about that in her lovely stupid phase she would be hurt confused and forgiving hi her ugly smart phase she would comprehend the situation and be realistic so she would accept what had to be accepted and certainly not want him to die still he had no wish or intent to indulge himself with any of these something distracted him it was a faint eerie but somehow most mtriguing sound he tried to listen but the clamor of the girls almost drowned it out please i want to hearthere is a melody it is the siren a fairy screamed sing girls sing drown out the bitch they sang loudly passionately and tunelessly i still that insidious melody penetrated the single clear theme cutting through the nearby cacophony compelling bulk to respond he started toward it immediately the girls restrained him they flung their arms about him dragging him back and down burying him in their exposed softness bink collapsed hi a tangle of arms legs breasts and assorted other aspects of distaff anatomy he didnt bother to define the girls meant wellbut the sirens call was not to be denied bink fought and caught glimpses of other thrashing mounds where his male companions fought similarly bink was stronger than any of the nymphs for they were delicate shapely things he did not want to hurt any of them yet he had to free himself of their nearsuffocating embrace he heaved them off his body cuffing their hands loose shoving wherever his hands made contact there were eeeks and cries and giggles depending on the type of contact he made then he was on his feet charging forward chester and crombie and the magician closed hi about him all riveted to that compelling sound no no trolla cried despairingly behind them it is death you seek are you civilized males or are you mindless things that bothered bink what did he want with a magical temptress yet still he could not resist the siren her lure had an unearthly quality that caught at the very root of his masculinity beneath the center of his intelligence he was male therefore he responded let them go they are lost trolla said despairingly we tried as we have always triedand failed though he was in thrall to the siren bink felt simultaneous sympathy for trolla and the girls they offered life and love yet were doomed to be rejected their positive orientation could not compete with the negative compulsion of the siren the villagers suffered as horrible a damnation as the men was it because they were nice girls making only promises they could keep while the siren had no such limit crombie squawked as all females always fail grundy translated responding to trollas despair though why any of us should bother with this bitchfemale call the griffin shrugged his wings and charged on did even the golem feel it he must for he was not protesting they ran down a path that opened magically before them it was a perfect path exactly the kind that usually led to something huge predatory and stationary like a tangle tree but of course this particular tangler would not attack them because they were males in thrall to the siren she would dispatch them in her own fashion and what might that fashion be bink wondered he could not quite imagine it but the prospect was wrenchingly exciting what a way to gol he breathed the tree came into sight it was monstrous even for its land its dangling tentacles were as thick as the legs of a man and extremely long and umber its tempting fragrance surrounded it like an evening gown making it seem thoroughly desirable gentle music emanated from its foliage no siren call but nice the kind of music that made a person want to lie down and listen and relax but no veteran of the wilderness of xanth could be fooled for an instant this was one of the most deadly life forms available even a dragon would not venture near a tangle tree the path passed right under it where the curtain of tentacles parted neatly and the soft sward grew but elsewhere around the fringe was a developing cone of bleaching bones the remainders of the trees past victims shapely female bones bink suspected and felt another twinge of guilt yet the siren still called and they followed they tunneled down to single file for the path beneath the tree was narrow chester galloped first then crombie for their forms were fastest bink and the magician followed as well as they could there had not been occasion to mount the steeds for faster travel chester paused under the awful tree and the tentacles quivered with suppressed eagerness but did not grab so it was true the sirens song nullified the tangle reflex the distant music was stronger now and more compelling the very essence of female allure the nymphs of the village had been pretty and sweet but the sirens promise was vital it was as if the sex appeal of all womankind had been distilled and concentrated and ahead of bink the griffin suddenly halted squawk crombie exclaimed what am i doing here the golem translated coming up behind surprisingly fleet on his feet considering his size the siren is nothing but a damned conniving female out for my blood literally true but the others ignored him of course the siren was a conniving female the ultimate one what difference did that make the call had to be honored the womanhater however decided to be difficult shes trying to trap me he squawked all women are traps death to them all and he pecked viciously at the nearest thing availablewhich happened to be the slender extremity of a tentacle in a small bird such a peck would have been a nuisance crombie however was a griffin his beak was swordsharp powerful as a vise a weapon capable of severing a mans leg at the ankle with a single bite the tentacle in this case was the diameter of an ankle and the chomp severed it cleanly the separated end dropped to the ground twitching and writhing like a headless green snake for a moment the whole tree froze hi shock no one took a bite out of a tangler the truncated upper section of the tentacle welled dark ooze as it thrashed about as if looking for its extremity the gentle background music soured i think the truce has been broken bink said but he didnt really care for the song of the siren continued drawing him on to better things move on crombie youre blocking my way but the soldier remained unreasonable squawk squawk squawk he exclaimed and before grundy could translate he nipped off another tentacle then a third the tangle tree shuddered then furious it reacted its music became a deafening blare of outrage and its tentacles grabbed for the griffinand the centaur man and magician now youve done it birdbram chester screamed over the noise he grabbed the first tentacle that touched him and wrung it between his two hands the way the ogre had wrung out the log tough as the tentacles were when grabbing they had little resistance to cutting or compression and this one was squished into uselessness in a moment suddenly the lure of the siren was drowned out by the rage of the tree and they were in a fight for their lives bink drew his sword and slashed at the tentacles that swept toward him cutting them off beside him crombie pecked and scratched viciously all four feet operating long cuts appeared in the tentacles he touched and green goo welled out but more tentacles kept coming in from all sides for this was the very center of the trees power chester backed up to the trunk and operated his bow he fired arrow after arrow through the thick upper reaches of the tentacles paralyzing them but no chester bink cried get away from too late the trees huge maw opened in the trunk the barklips lapping forward to engulf the centaurs handsome posterior bink leaped to help his friend but a tentacle caught his ankle tripping him all he could do was yell kick chester kickl then he was buried in tentacles as firm and rounded and pneumatic as the limbs of the village girls but not nearly as nice his sword arm was immobilized all he could do was bite ineffectively that green goo tasted awful chester kicked the kick of a centaur was a potent thing his head and shoulders went down counterbalancing his rear and all the power of his extraordinary body thrust through his two hind hooves they connected inside the maw of the tree against the wooden throat and the ground shook with the double impact a few old bones were dislodged from the upper foliage to rattle down to the ground but the wooden mouth held sap juices flowed commencing the digestion of the centaurs excellent flesh chesters instinct would have been sound for any ordinary tree using the inert trunk as protection for his valuable but vulnerable rear but it was disaster here chester kicked again and again violently even this predatortree could not withstand much of this punishment normally its prey was unconscious or helpless by the time it reached the consumption stage not awake and kicking slowly reluctantly the bark gave way and the centaur dragged free his oncebeautiful flank was discolored by the saliva sap and one hoof had been chipped by the force of its contact with the wood but at least he was alive now he drew his sword and strode forward to help bink who was notsoslowly suffocating in the embrace of the tentacles meanwhile magician humfrey had problems of his own he was trying to unstopper one of his little vials but the tentacles were wrapping about him faster than the stopper was coming loose the tree was overwhelming them all crombie had clawed and bit his way to the fringe suddenly he broke out im free you vegetable monster he squawked exultantly ill bet youre another female too he was really uncorking his worst insult the golem had gotten aboard again so was available for instant translation you cant catch me indeed the tree could not for it was rooted crombie spread his wings and flew up and away escaping it yet what of the others as if enraged even further at the loss the tree concentrated savagely on the remaining prey pythons of tentacles whipped about limbs and bodies squeezing tight chester was trying to help bink but dared not slash too closely with his sword lest he slice some of bink along with a tentacle bink now closest to the trunk found himself being dragged headfirst toward the dread orifice humfrey finally got his bottle open smoke issued forth expanding and coalescing intoa spiced cheesecake curses the magician cried wrong vial chester kicked at the cheesecake it slid across the turf and into the slavering maw of the tree the barklips closed about it he could hardly have made a nicer shot had he been trying for it the tree choked there was a paroxysm of wooden coughing followed by a sylvan sneeze gross hunks of cheese flew out of the orifice the spice on that one is a bit strong humfrey muttered as he scrambled for another vial now sinks head was at the maw the bark was writhing trying to get the taste of spiced cheese out this monster liked fresh meat not processed dairy products sap coursed down and dripped from toothlike knots cleaning out the maw in a moment it would be ready for bink chester was still trying to help but three tentacles had wrapped around his sword arm and more looped his other extremities even his great strength could not avail against the massed might of the tree and the cowardly soldier ran out on us he grunted as he fought if i ever get my hands on him he wrung out another tentacle before his free arm was pinioned humfrey got another vial open the vapor emerged and formed into a flying vampire bat the creature took one look at its environs squeaked in terror swore off blood and flapped away a single tentacle took one casual swing at it and knocked it out of the air the tree was really getting on top of the situation the last of the cheese cleared the orifice reopened for business and bink was the client he saw the rows of ingrown knots that served as the monsters teeth and the flowing saliva sap fibers like miniature tentacles extended inward from the mouthwalls ready to absorb the juices of the prey suddenly he realized the tangler was related to the carnivorous grass that grew in patches in the wilderness add a trunk and tentacles to such a patch humfrey got another vial open this time a basilisk formed flapping its little wings as it glared balefully about bink closed his eyes to avoid its direct gaze and chester did the same the tree shivered and tried to draw away there was no creature in all the land of xanth who cared to meet the gaze of this little lizardcock bulk heard the flapping as the basilisk flew right into the tanglers mouthand stopped but nothing happened cautiously bink opened one eye the tree was still alive the basilisk had not destroyed it at a glance oha mock basilisk bink said disappointed i have a good remedy for tanglers somewhere humfrey insisted still sifting through his vials whenever a tentacle encroached too closely he stunned it with a magic gesture bink had not known such ges tares existedbut of course he was not a magician of information theyre all mixed up the tentacles shoved bink into the mouth the odor of carrion became strong helpless he stared into his doom squawk sounded from beyond the tree charge crombie had returned but what could he do alone now there was a sound as of the rush of many feet the tangle tree shuddered the odor of smoke and scorching vegetation drifted in bink saw from the corner of his eye orange light flaring up as if a forest fire raged torches crombie had marshaled the females of the magicdust village and they were attacking the tree with blazing brands singeing the tentacles what a brave effort now the tangler had to defend itself from attack by a superior force it dropped bink freeing its tentacles for other action bink saw a pretty nymph get grabbed and heard her scream as she was hauled into the air her torch dropping squawk squawk crombie directed and other females rushed to the captives rescue forming a screen of same more tentacles got scorched and the nymph dropped bmk recovered his sword and resumed hacking from inside the curtain of tentacles now that the tree was concentrating on the outside menace it was vulnerable to the inside one with every stroke bink lopped off another green branch gradually denuding the tree of its deadly limbs squawk crombie cried get outside the golem translated that made sense if the tree should refocus on the interior bink chester and humfrey would be in trouble again better to get out while they could in a moment they stood beside the griffin squawk crombie exclaimed lets finish off this monster grundy cried for him the ladies went to it with a will there were about fifty of them ringing the tree pushing in with their fires scorching back every tentacle that attacked they could have conquered the tree anytime instead of letting it balk them all these yearshad they had the masculine drive and command ironic that crombie the womanhater should be the organizing catalyst yet perhaps this was fitting crombies paranoia about the motives of women had caused him to resist the siren finally breaking her spell now he was using these females in the manner a soldier understood as fodder for a battle they might not have responded as well to a nicer man maybe they needed one who held them in contempt who was willing to brutalize them for his purpose the tree was shriveling half its awful limbs amputated or paralyzed it would take time to kill it but the victory now seemed certain thanks to crombie and the brave selfsacrificing villagers you know i could get to respect women like these crombie murmured as he paused from his exertions to watch the wrapup proceed actually it was squawkandtranslation but bink was so used to it now that it made little difference they obey orders well and fight damn near as well as a man allowing for he paused in midsquawk listening then bink heard the sirens call again no longer drowned out by the battle oh no he tried to resist it and could not the siren had recovered her thrall bink started walking toward that sound his companions joined him silently the villagers intent on their successful campaign did not see them depart chapter deadly distaffs i he sound of the battle faded behind the males crombie included moved on down the path lured by the sirens song the unearthly quality was stronger now thrilling binks inner fiber he knew the siren meant death more certainly than the tangle tree but what a satisfying death it would be it was a good path nothing interfered with thenprogress scon they arrived at the shore of a small lake in that lake were two tiny islands like the tips of mountains mostly hidden beneath the surface the path led over the water to one of these islands this was the source of the music of the siren they started on the path bink thought crombie might balk again and in his heart hoped he would while fearing that that hope would be fulfilled but the griffin did not apparently his resistance to females had been compromised by the spirit and sacrifice of the village women and he could no longer master sufficient suspicion indeed he was the first on the waterpath the water depressing slightly under his claws but supporting his weight the magician was second bink third and there was an angry bleat from the side a small creature came charging along the small beach it was fourlegged and woolly like a sheep with broad curly horns that circled entirely around its head evidently the path crossed this creatures territory and the animal was taking action chester in the things path paused a battering ram he remarked recognizing the species not subject to the sirens call because it is a mere animal no use to reason with it a battering ram bink paused his curiosity momentarily overriding the lure of the siren he had heard of such creatures and of their relatives the hydraulic rams but never encountered one before as he understood it they existed only to batter and they loved it if there were a door to be broken down or a castle to be breached such a ram was invaluable at other times they were a nuisance because they never stopped beating their heads against obstacles chester was far larger than the rambut it had cut him off from the sirens path chester dodged it once nimbly but the ram screeched to a halta neat trick in sand even with magicand whirled to recharge chester would have been battered hi the rear had he tried to ignore itand his rear was his proudest feature despite the recent staining from the tanglers sap much handsomer than his face so he whirled to face the ram and dodged its charge again but there was no end to this the ram would happily go on forever screeching up more mounds of sand with each miss but chester had a siren call to answer the ram had to be stopped somehow bink wondered his talent could have had a part in saving him from the tangler as it had used the motives and magic of others freely was the ram another device to stop him from reaching the siren in that case he should be rooting for the ram not chester chester no dummy maneuvered between charges until he was directly in front of a large tree he never took his eye of the ram lest it catch him by surprise next charge would fire the ram right into the trunk that chester had oriented on peripherally with luck knocking the animal silly or at least starting the process because it took a lot of knocking to knock a battering ram silly these creatures were pretty silly to begin with then bink recognized the variety of tree not that one chester he cried thats a too late why was he always too late it was getting quite annoying the ram charged chester danced aside there was a flutelike trill of music and the ram plowed headfirst into the tree such was the force of impact all out of proportion to the animals size that the entire tree vibrated violently pineapple tree bink finished belatedly now the fruits were falling huge golden pineapples quite ripe as each hit the ground it exploded savagely that was how this tree reproduced the detonating fruit sent shrapnelseeds far across the landscape where each could generate with luck and magic a new pineapple tree but it was hardly safe to stand too near this process one pineapple struck the battering ram on the rump the ram bleated and spun to face it rearscorched and bruised but of course that was futile other fruits were exploding all around one dropped just before the ram with a snort of challenge the animal leaped boldly forth to intercept it catching it squarely on the horns the resulting concussion really did knock the ram silly it staggered ofe bleating happily meanwhile chester was doing a truly intricate dance of avoidance trying to keep his flowing tail and sleek equine haunches out of mischief he could avoid the pineapples falling to left right and front but those behind were problematical one dropped almost on his tail in fact it brushed the elevated top chester in a remarkable maneuver whipped his entire hindsection out of the waybut in the process brought his head into the location vacated by the tail the pineapple exploded chester caught the blast right under his chin his head was engulfed in flame and smoke then the refuse cleared and he stood there dazed bink found himself unable to run back along the path despite his concern for his friend this was partly because the continuing summons of the siren allowed him to pause but not to withdraw and partly because the path over the water was oneway it was firm while he proceeded forward but was mere water when he tried to go back the lake was small but seemed very deep and he hesitated to trust himself to its reaches bad magic tended to lurk in the depths so he could only watch and call chester are you all right the centaur stood there slowly shaking his head the explosion had not done much harm to chesters facial appearance since that had always been homely but bink was concerned about the centaurs fine mind had the pineapple damaged his brain chester can you hear me then as chester ignored him bink understood the problem the blast had deafened him bink waved his hands violently and finally chester took note speak louderi cant hear youl then the centaur realized it himself im deaf i cant hear anything at least he seemed to be all right otherwise bink relieved of much of his anxiety felt himself again overwhelmed by the continuing call of the siren he beckoned the hell with the sirenl chester called i cant hear her now its stupid to go to her she means death crombie had been briefly freed of the compulsion back at the tangle tree but had been recaptured by the siren now chester had been freed by the intercession of the battering ram it must be the operation of binks talent but bink himself was still hooked he turned about and proceeded toward the island crombie and the good magician were almost there now as they had not paused as long as bink chester galloped along the path catching up to bink his powerful hands picked bink up by the elbows dont go bink its nonsense but bink would not be denied put me down horserear i have to go and his feet kept walking in midair i cant hear you but i know what youre saying and its not worth listening to chester said only one way to stop this before the others are lost he set bink down then unslung his great bow the siren was still far away but there was no archery like that of a centaur chesters bowstring twanged and the deadly shaft arced across the water toward the island and the female figure there there was a scream of anguish and the melody halted abruptly chesters arrow had scored suddenly they all were freed the compulsion was gone binks talent had prevailed at last saving him from harm without revealing itself they ran to the island there lay the sirenthe i loveliest mermaid bink had ever seen with hair like flowing sunshine and tail like flowing water the cruel arrow had passed entirely through her torso between and slightly below her spectacular bare breasts and she was bleeding from front and back her torso had collapsed across her dulcimer yet she was not dead though the arrow with that uncanny marksmanship of the centaur must have pierced her heart she still breathed in fact she was conscious she tilted her beautiful face weakly to look up at chester why did you shoot me handsome male she whispered he cant hear you hes deaf bink said i meant no harmonly love she continued love to all men youwhy should you oppose that what joy is there in death bink demanded we have brought to you what you have brought to a hundred other men he spoke gruffly yet his heart ached to see the agony of this lovely creature he remembered when chameleon had been similarly wounded i brought no death she protested as vehemently as she was able and gasped as the effort pushed a gout of blood from her chest her whole body below the shoulders was soaked in bright blood and she was weakening visibly onlyonly love then at last she subsided losing consciousness bmk moved despite what he knew turned to the magician isis it possible she speaks the truth humfrey brought out his magic mirror it showed the smiling baby face it is possible he said wise to the ways of the mirror then he addressed it directly did the siren speak the truth the baby smiled again she meant no harm the magician said she is not the killer though she lured men here the men exchanged glances then humfrey brought out his bottle of healing elixir and sprinkled a drop on the sirens terrible wound instantly it healed and she was sound again the magician offered chester a drop of elixir for his ears but the centaur disdained it so humfrey sprinkled it on the centaurs rear and suddenly it was as beautiful as ever you healed me the siren exclaimed passing her hands wonderingly over her front there is not even blood no pain then startled i must sing she reached for her dulcimer chester kicked it out of her reach the musical instrument flew through the air smashed and plunked into the water there is the source of her magic he cried i have destroyed it the source of magic destroyed was that an omen experimentally the siren sang her upper torso expanded marvelously as she took her breath and her voice was excellentbut now there was no compulsion in it the centaur had indeed deprived her of her devastating magic she broke off you mean that was what summoned all the men i thought they liked my singing she looked unhappy apparently she really was the lovely innocent like chameleon in her beautyphase what happened to all the men bink asked they went across to see my sister she said gesturing toward the other island she pouted i offer them all my lovebut they always go to her curious who could lure victims away from the siren herself who is your sister bink asked i mean what is her magic is she another siren oh no she is a gorgon very pretty a gorgon bink exclaimed but that is death no she would not harm anyone no more than i would the siren protested she cherishes men i only wish she would send some back to me dont you know what the gaze of a gorgon does bulk demanded what happens to someone who looks upon the face of i have looked into my sisters face many times there is no harm in her humfrey lifted his mirror again it affects men only he asked and the smiling baby agreed it seemed the siren really did not know the devastating effect her sisters face had on men so for years she had innocently lured in malesfor the gorgon to turn to stone we shall have to talk with your sister humfrey said the path continues to her island the siren informed him what will i do without my dulcimer your voice is pretty enough without any accompaniment and so are you bink said diplomatically it was true as far as it went had she a lower portion to match her upper portion it would have been true all the way you can sing a capella without accompaniment i can she inquired brightening will it bring nice men like you no but perhaps a nice man will find you regardless bink turned to the magician how can we approach the gorgon one glance we shall have to deal with her in the morning humfrey decided bink had lost track of time the stars had been emerging at the village then they had charged into the night of the jungle to battle the tangle tree thence to this islandwhere it seemed dusk was only now falling did that make sense bink had somehow assumed that the sun set all over xanth at the same instant but realized that this was not necessarily so but he had other things to worry about at the moment and listened to the rest of humfreys speech siren if you have food and bed fm not really that kind of female she demurred bink looked at her sleek fishtail obviously not we only want a place to sleep oh she sounded disappointed actually i could become that kind if she shimmered and her tail transposed into two fetching legs just sleep chester said it seemed his hearing was returning naturally and food but her indignation had not yet run its course after you impaled me with your old messy arrow and broke my dulcimer im sorry chester said shortly i have a headache as well he might bink thought why hadnt the ornery creature accepted a drop of elixir for his head as well as for his tail if you were really sorry youd show it she said crombie squawked shes setting her hooks into you already ass the golem said doubly annoyed chester glowered at the siren how by giving me a ride on your back bulk almost laughed nymphs of any type loved to ridel ride then chester said disconcerted she walked to his side but was unable to mount you re too tall she complained chester turned his front portion wrapped one arm about her slender waist and hauled her up easily eeekl she screamed delighted as her feet swished through the air youre so strongl crombie squawked again and his remark needed no interpretation she was indeed working her wiles on the centaur needing no siren song chester not in the best of moods after his encounter with the pineapple was visibly mollified all centaurs are strong he set her neatly on his back and walked forward the siren grabbed two handfuls of his mane my your shoulders are so broadt and what sleek fur you have you must be the handsomest centaur of alll from the rear maybe he agreed he began to trot oooh thats fun she cried letting go just long enough to clap her hands together girlishly you must be the smartest centaur and the fastest she paused could you maybe make a little jump chester now quite puffed up by her praise made a tremendous leap the siren screamed and flew off his back they were at the edge of the water since this was a small island and she plunked into the lake uh sorry chester said mortified guess i overdid it he reached down to fish her out fish her out he did her legs had changed back into a tail no harm done the mermaid said i am quite at home in the water and she wriggled within his grasp bringing her face to his and planting a wet kiss on him crombie squawked theres no fool like a horsereared fool the golem said thats for sure chester agreed now in a good mood just dont tell cherie cherie the siren asked frowning my filly the prettiest thing in xanth shes back home tending our foal his name is chet she assimilated that how nice she said disgruntled id better see to your fodder now and stall space bink smiled privately chester wasnt such a fool after all they had a modest repast of fish and sea cucumber and bedded down in a pile of soft dry sponges bink stretched out his feetand banged into another pile of dirt this time he was too tired to stomp it flat so he ignored it the siren having given up on the centaur nestled down in the dark beside bink say he said remembering we have to give service for hospitality crombie squawked you give service noodlebrain grundy said youre closest to her service the siren inquired nudging him bink found himself blushing furiously in the dark damn crombies innuendo uh nothing he said and pretended to fall suddenly asleep very soon it was no pretense in the morning they bade farewell to the siren after taking the time to break up some wood for her cooking firea service she appreciated as she was not much for that sort of thing they set about braving her sister the rest of you must be blindfolded humfrey decided i will use the mirror so he could view the gorgon indirectly of course that was the only way to look at such creatures everyone knew that yet why did a mirror work the image hi the glass should be as horrendous as the original polarization the magician explained without being asked the magic of partial images that didnt clarify things much but a more important question remained what do we do to stop the bink did not want to use the word kill in the presence of the innocent siren getting close to the gorgon was one thing dispatching her while blindfolded was another we shall see humfrey said they submitted to blindfolding including the golem then they formed a chain to follow the good magician who walked backward on the path between the islands using the mirror to see ahead in this case he was not utilizing its magic but merely the ordinary reflection the natural magic all mirrors possessed it was strange and uncomfortable crossing the water sightlessly how awful it would be to lose forever the power of seeingl what magic was better than the natural senses of life binks feet felt hard land you stand here facing out humfrey told them just hi case i will deal with the gorgon still nervous bink obeyed he felt tempted to rip off the blindfold turn about and look at the gorgon but not strongly tempted once he had stood atop a tall mountain and suffered an urge to throw himself off it similarly it was as if there were a death urge in him along with the life urge perhaps the urge to adventure was drawn from the same wellspring gorgon humfrey said right behind bink she answered i am she welcome to my isle her voice was dulcet she sounded even more attractive than her sister why do you not look at me your glance would turn me into stone humfrey said bluntly am i not beautiful who else has locks as serpentine as mine she asked plaintively and bink heard the faint hissing of the snakes he wondered what it would be like to kiss the gorgon with those snakehairs twining around their two faces the notion was both alarming and tempting yet what was the gorgon except the literal personification of the promise and threat embodied in every woman you are beautiful humfrey agreed gravely she must be beautiful indeed bink thought for the good magician did not waste compliments oh for a single look where are the other men who came to you they went away she said sadly where did they go there she said and bulk assumed she was pointing beyond those rocks humfrey moved over to investigate these are statues he said unsurprised statues of men exquisitely realistic carved as it were from life from life yes she agreed brightly they look just like the men who came to me does that not suggest anything to you the men left the gifts behind pictures of themselves sculptures but i would rather have had the men stay with me i have no use for stones she didnt realize what she had done she thought these were mere images offered as remembrances maybe she refused to realize the truth blocking it out from her consciousness pretending she was an ordinary girl she refused to believe in her own magic what a fateful delusion yet bmk thought wasnt this too typical of the thought processes of females what one among them chose to recognize the mischief her sex worked among men but that was crombies contention therefore probably an exaggeration there might be a little siren and a little gorgon in every girl but not a lot there was hardly any in chameleon if more men come humfrey continued with unusual gentleness they will only leave more statues this is not good yes there are already too many statues she agreed naively my island is getting crowded the men must not come any more humfrey said they must stay at their homes with their families couldnt just one man comeand stay a while she asked plaintively fm afraid not men just arent er right for you but i have so much love to giveif only a man would stay even a little one i would cherish him forever and ever and make him so happy bink listening was beginning to appreciate the depth of the gorgons tragedy all she wanted was to love and be loved and instead she sowed a harvest of horrible mischief how many families had been destroyed by her magic what could be done with her except execution you must go into exile humfrey said the magic shield has been lowered by order of the king you can pass freely out of xanth in mundania your magic will dissipate and you will be able to interact freely with the man or men of your choice leave xanth she cried alarmed oh no i would rather die i can not leave my home bink experienced a pang of sympathy once he himself had faced exile but in mundania you would be an ordinary girl under no curse you are extremely lovely and your personality is sweet you could have your pick of men there i love men she said slowly but i love my home more i can not depart if this is my only choice i beg of you to slay me now and end my misery for once the good magician seemed shaken slay you i would not do that you are the most attractive creature i have ever seen even through a mirror in my youth i would have now a little ordinary feminine artifice manifested why you are not old sir you are a handsome man crombie stifled a squawk chester coughed and bink choked she had made a gross exaggeration if not an outright distortion humfrey was a good man and a talented one but hardly a handsome one you flatter me the magician said seriously but i have other business of all the men who have come here you alone have stayed to talk with me the gorgon continued i am so lonely i beg of you stay with me and let me serve you always now crombie squawked aloud dont turn about fool the golem cried keep using the mirror um yes humfrey agreed the griffins hearing must be acute bink thought to detect the sound of the magicians incipient turning gorgon if i were to look at you directly you would feel obliged to go away leaving only a stone memento hi your likeness she finished i do not understand why men are like this but come close your eyes if you must kiss me let me show you how much love i have for you your least word is my command if you will only stay the magician sighed was the old gnome tempted it occurred to bink that it might not have been disinterest in women that kept humfrey single but lack of a suitable partner the average woman was not interested in a wizened dwarfish old manor if she expressed interest it was likely to be only because she wanted a piece of his formidable magic here was a woman who knew nothing of him but his appearance and was eager to love him asking only his presence my dear i think not humfrey said at last such a course would have its rewardsi hardly deny itl and i would normally be inclined to dally with you a day or three though love be blindfolded but it would require the resources of a magician to associate safely with you and i am on a quest that takes precedence and may not then dally a day or three she exclaimed be blindfolded i know no magician would have interest in me but even a magician could not be more wonderful than you sir did she suspect the magnitude of humfreys talent did it matter the magician sighed again perhaps after my present quest is over if you would care to visit at ray castle yes yes she cried where is your castle just ask for humfrey someone will direct you even so you can not show your face to man you would have to wear a veilno even that would not suffice for it is your eyes that do riot cover my eyes i must see bink felt another surge of sympathy for at the moment he could not see let me consult humfrey said there was a rustle as he rummaged through his magic props then this is not ideal but it will do hold this vial before your face and open it more rustling as she accepted the vial that he held out over his shoulder there was a pop as the cork came out the hiss of escaping vapor a gasp then silence had the magician executed her after all giving her poison vapor to sniff companions you may now remove your bundfolds and turn about humfrey said the gorgon has been nullified bink ripped ofl the cloth magician you didnt no i did her no harm observe bulk observed as did the others before them stood a breathtakingly lovely young woman with hair formed of many small thin snakes but her face was absent there simply wasnt anything there i applied a spell of invisibility to her face humfrey explained she can see out well enough but i regret that no man can look upon her face since it is the loveliest part of her but this way it is impossible to meet her gaze she is safeas are we it was too bad really bink had to agree she seemed like such a nice girl burdened with such a terrible curse magic was not always kind the magician had nullified the curse but it was disconcerting to look into that vacuum hi lieu of her face crombie walked around the island studying the statues some were of centaurs and some of griffins squawk look at the damage the bitch has done she must have petrified hundreds of innocent males what good is it to nullify her now it is like closing the house door after the man has escaped he was evidently thinking more like a griffin now that was a danger of prolonged transformation yes we shall have to do something about the statues humfrey agreed but i have expended enough of my valuable magic too much in fact crombie point out where the solution to this problem lies the griffin whirled and pointed down hm now point out the source of magic again crombie did the result was the same so i sup posed humfrey said our quest has more than informational significance another factor fell into place for bink this whole escapade with the tangle tree and the devastating sisters had seemed like a diversion from the quest and a serious threat to bulks welfare yet his talent had permitted it now he saw that his experience related to the quest still it should not have been necessary to expose himself to these dangers in order to reach the source of magic something other than his talent must be operating he remembered the mound of earth last night did that relate he really could not fathom how yet he distrusted coincidental occurrences unless they derived from his talent if an enemy werethe good magician brought out his mirror again get me the queen he said into it the queen bink asked surprised the mirror fogged then showed the face of queen iris about time you called in humfrey she said how come you re dawdling there on the gorgons isle instead of pursuing your fool quest crombie squawked angrily dont translate that humfrey snapped at the golem then to the sorceress it is binks quest not mine we have nullified siren and gorgon and are proceeding toward the source of magic notify the king iris made a minor gesture of unconcern when i get around to it midget she said hie visage of king trent appeared hi the mirror behind her abruptly she assumed the aspect of a sweet young thing complete with long braids which will be very soon good magician she amended hastily trent waved jovially and tugged on a braid as the mirror went blank how can she talk on the mirror bink inquired it shows silent pictures for everyone else she is mistress of illusion humfrey explained mistress of the king you mean crombie squawked we only think were hearing her humfrey continued he put away the mirror and the king only thinks he can yank at an illusory braid but illusion has its uses hi whatever capacity id like the illusion of reality the golem said wistfully humfrey returned his attention to the gorgon we shall return hi due course i suggest you go comfort your sister meanwhile she has lost her dulcimer i will i will the gorgon cried farewell handsome sorcererl she flung her arms around humfrey and planted au invisible kiss on his mouth while the snakes snapped at his ears and hissed up a storm hurry back i have so much love stored up um just so the magician agreed embarrassed he brought up a finger to snap away one serpenthair that was gnawing too vigorously on his earlobe the magic path ended at the gorgons isle so it was necessary to swim back they used crombies talent to locate a safe route across avoiding lake monsters then bink mounted chester and humfrey rode the griffin it was now midmorning and the return to the magicdust village was easy and swift hostile magic had not yet had time to move in to replace the prior charm of the path the tangle tree was a charred stump the villagers had really done the job destroying a longterm enemy but the village itself was now quiet with black drapes hi the windows it was hi mourning for the last party of males to be lost to the siren how suddenly that changed as those males marched hi you survived trolla cried tears of untrollish joy streaming down her horrible face we tried to follow you but could not hear the siren and could not trace the path hi the dark in the morning we knew it was too late and we had wounded to attend to we have nullified the sirenand her sister the gorgon buik said no more men will go that way but the men who went before they are all dead we know no they are stone there may be a way to reverse the spell and restore them if we are successful in our quest come we must celebrate trolla cried we shall give you such a party bink knew the answer to that uh no thanks you are very kind but all we want to do now is get on with our quest we seek the ultimate source of magic the source of your magic dust underground there is no way down there trolla said it wells up in a solid shaft yes so we will seek elsewhere if any avenue of access exists from another direction disappointed trolla accepted the situation with grace which way do you go that way bink said indicating the direction crombie had pointed for the resumption of their quest but thats into the heart of the region of madness bink smiled perhaps our access is through madness then the route past the tangle tree is open now you could go out that way and loop about to avoid the madness buik shook his head in negation knowing that had that been the best way crombie would have indicated it you males are so unreasonable at least wait a few days we will stop lofting the magic dust into the ah and the effect will diminish then you may traverse the region less hazardously no we have decided to push on bink feared that a few days relaxation hi this village of eager females would be as ruinous as continued dalliance with the siren and gorgon they had to move on then we shall provide a guide she can warn you of the immediate traps and it is barely possible you will survive until clear of the worst of it you are already half mad after all yes bink agreed with a wry smile we are males neither sex understood the other that was yet another aspect of the magic of xanth he rather liked this tame female troll apparently almost any monster could be worthwhile once it was possible to know it personally the guide turned out to be a very pretty female griffin squawk crombie protested awk awk she replied archly dont saddle us with a chick like that grundy translated happily who are you calling a chick im a lioness youre a nuisancel and youre a bore female male uh thats enough translation grundy bink said theyre down to ultimate insults he turned to trolla thank you for the guide well be on our way now all the females of the village lined up to wave goodbye it was a sad but necessary parting the wilderness of xanth soon abolished sentimentality the trees were extremely large here closing in to form a dense jungle this was the downwind region of the magic dust as trolla had warned magic flourished here monstrous pincushions grew at the lowest level stabbing anyone who passed too near living stalagmites projected between the cushions their stony points glistening with moisture that fell on them from above oil slicks twined wherever suitable depressions were available the oil was more slippery than anything else and at the same time more tenacious those tanker trees shouldnt flush their wastes on the surface chester muttered they should bury it the way civilized creatures do yet the higher growths were no more promising the huge metal trunks of ironwood trees crowded against the burnedout boles of ash rust and ashes coated the ground around them here and there bull spruces snorted and flexed their branchhorns menacingly above it was worse yet caterpillar nettles crawled along peering down with prickly anticipation and vomitfungus dangled in greasy festoons where was there safe passage awkl the guide said showing the way she glided past an outcropping of hissing serpentine between two sharp blades of slash pine and on over the rungs of a fallen ladderbush the others followed wary but swift it was gloomy here almost dark though the day was rising onto noon the canopy overhead not satisfied with shutting out the sun now constricted like an elastic band until it seemed to enclose them in one tight bubble like elastic now bink saw it was elastic from a huge elastic vine that stretched between and around the other foliage elastic was not a serious threat to people carrying swords or knives but it could be a considerable inconvenience there seemed to be few large creatures here but many small ones bugs were all over some bink recognized lightning bugs zapping their charges soldier beetles marching hi precise formations to their bivouac ladybugs and damselflies hovering near hi the immemorial fashion of easyvirtue females near armies almost under chesters hooves a tiger beetle pounced on a stag beetle making its kill with merciless efficiency bink averted his gaze knowing that such activity was natural but still not liking it then he noticed humfrey the man was staring as if enchanted a worrisome sign here are you all right magician bink asked marvelous the man murmured raptly a treasure trove of nature you mean the bugs theres a featherwinged beetle humfrey said sure enough a bug with two bright feathers for wings flew by and an owlfly and two netwings bulk saw the largeeyed tufted bug sitting on a branch watching the two nets hover how a netwing flew was unclear as the nets obviously could not hold air but with magic what did it matter and a picturewinged fly the magician exclaimed really excited thats a new species i believe it must have mutated let me get my text he eagerly fumbled open a vial the vapor came forth and formed a huge tome that the magician balanced precariously on the back of the griffin between the folded wings as he turned over the pages picturewing he read pastoral stilllife naturalistic surrealistic cubist watercolor oil pastel chalk penandink charcoali was right this is a crayondrawing species unlisted bink verify this for the record bink leaned over to look the bug was sitting on the griffins right ear its wings outspread covered by waxy illustrations looks like crayon to me he agreed yes humfrey cried i must record it what a fantastic discovery bink had never seen the man so excited suddenly he realized something important this was what the good magician lived for humfreys talent was information and the discovery and classification of living things was right in line with this to him there was nothing more important than the acquisition of facts and he had naturally been resentful about being distracted from this now chance had returned him to his type of discovery for the first tune bink was seeing the magician in his animation humfrey was not a cold or grasping individual he was as dynamic and feeling as anyonewhen it showed bulk felt a tug at his sword he clapped his hand to the hiltand two robber flies buzzed up they had been trying to steal his sword then chester jumped almost dislodging nun almost stepped on a blister beetle the centaur explained i wouldnt want to pull up with a blistered hoof at this stage the lady griffin glanced back rotating her head without turning her body in the way griffins had awk she exclaimed impatiently hurry up shrimp the golem translated were getting near the madness zone squawk crombie replied irritably were doing the best we can why dont you show us a better path birdbrain listen cattail she awked back im only doing this as a favor to you if you numbskulls had stayed at the village where you belonged stay hi a village of females youre mad already then they had to stop squawking and awking to dodge a snakefly that wriggled through fangs gaping this time chester did step on a buga stink bug a horrible odor wafted up sending them all leaping forward to escape it the lady griffins passage stirred up a motley swarm of deerflies tree hoppers tiger moths and a fat butterfly that splattered the magician with butter one lovely gold bug fluttered up under binks nose maybe this is another new one he cried getting caught up in the magicians enthusiasm he grabbed for it but chester stumbled just then so that bulk missed it its headed toward you magician he cried catch itl but humfrey shied away thats a midas fly he exclaimed in horror dont touch it a midas fly everything it touches turns to gold the fly was now circling the magician looking for a place to land but thats wonderful bink said we must capture it we can use gold not if we become gold ourselves humfrey snapped he ducked so low that he fell of the griffin the midas fly settled down to land hi his place crombie bink screamed watch out then the lady griffin crashed into crombie knocking him out of the way with her leonine shoulder he escapedbut the midas fly landed instead on her just like that she was a gold statue the fly buzzed up and away no longer a threatbut its damage had been done theyre extremely rare and they dont land often humfrey said from the bush he had landed in im amazed we encountered one perhaps it was maddened by the dust he picked himself up it may have been sent bink said it appeared near me first crombie rolled to his feet with the litheness of his kind squawk she did it for meto save my life grundy translated why it must indeed be madness chester said drily bink contemplated the statue like the handiwork of the gorgon he murmured gold instead of stone is it possible she can be restored crombie whirled and pointed squawk the answer lies in the same direction as the quest grundy said now birdbeak has personal reason to complete it first we must pass through the madnesswithout a guide chester pointed out bink looked ahead dismayed things had abruptly taken a more serious turnand they had not been unserious before how can we find our way safely through this jungle even without madness crombie will have to point out our best route one step at a time humfrey said lookthere is a walking stick he indicated the stick ambling along on two tiny feet at the base its hooked top wobbling erratically the huge text was gone he must have conjured it back into its bottle while bink had been distracted he hardly needed it mahoganyhandled a very fine specimen crombie pointed the way and they went slowly on leaving the gold lady griffin where she stood there was nothing they could do for herexcept complete their quest hoping to find the magic that would restore her crombie looked back twice not squawking he seemed to be having serious private thoughts for him the womanhater the females sacrifice had to be an awful enigma of more significance than his own nearmiss with the golden doom as a soldier he was used to danger but not to selfsacrifice all too soon dusk loomed glowworms appeared from their tunnels in the ground and bedbugs were already snoring in their bunks a confused cockroach crowed mistaking dusk for dawn swallowtails consumed their hind parts and disappeared for the night a group of sawflies sawed boards for their own nocturnal roosts bink looked about right now i wouldnt mind being a bug he said theyre at home here chester agreed soberly i have spent the evening in the open before but never in the deep wilderness we will not enjoy this night bink looked at humfrey the magician was still absorbed in his taxonomy theres a rhinoceros beetle trying to bulldoze down houses humfrey said those houseflies aren t going to like that sir it will be dangerous to sleep out here if your magic can help us pick the best spot now theyre bringing in carpenter ants to shore up the timbers maybe something from one of your bottles some temporary shelter for the night bink continued but that rhino is too stupid to quit he magician bink snapped losing patience humfrey glanced up oh hello bink havent you set up for the night yet he glanced down again look theyve hired an assassin bug theyre going to get rid of that it was useless the magician cared more for information than for safety humfrey was no leader which explained why he had been so ready to leave that chore to bink so it was up to bink again well have to make some sort of shelter he decided and keep watch in turns he paused considering the problems how could they make shelter when every piece of wood stone or foliage would be fiercely protective of its rights this was the untamed wilderness then his roving gaze spied a prospect the great curving bones of a defunct monster he couldnt tell what kind of animal it had been in life but it must have been larger than a dragon the bones seemed too solid for a roc and there was no sign of wings so probably it had been a grown groundborne sphinx ten times the height of a man the only reason sphinxes did not rule the jungle was their rarity and disinterest in ordinary matters dragons were common while sphinxes were hardly ever encountered bink wondered why that was so and what could kill a sphinx in its prime boredom perhaps crombie point out the direction of the closest suitable or adaptable site for our overnight camp he said wishing to verify his notion crombie obliged he pointed toward the bones sinks hunch had been right he was gratified well gather some blanket leaves and spread them over those bones he said that will make us a decent shelter and it can serve as a fort in case of attack crombie point us out the nearest blankets the griffin pointedright into the quivering ropes of a predator tree it was not a tangler but seemed related it would hardly be safe to go there well maybe we can stay on guard better if we can see out bulk decided chester why dont you stand the first watch wake me up the moment you find yourself getting sleepy then wake crombie the centaur nodded agreement he did not inquire about humfreys share of the work obviously the magician would not be reliable for this chapter mad constellations by ink paused for a call of nature not of magicand spied a chunk of wood so dark and mossgrown that it resembled a rock something like that could be useful in case a monster attacked in the night the wood seemed to have a nice heft good for throwing he squatted to pick it upand paused in case it should be enchanted but his talent would protect him if the piece were dangerous he would be unable to touch it he picked it up observing the etched grain of it brown and green and white and altogether intriguing it was surprisingly hard and heavy for wood he wondered whether it would oat or sink hi water he felt a tingle hi his hand as he held the chunk there was some quality about it something magic strange and potent he felt his talent responding taking nebulous hold sizing up this thing as it had once before when he drank from the spring of life as before his magic encompassed that of the other thing and accepted it without penalty bints talent was of magician stature he seldom felt its action directly except when it encountered strong or complex opposing magic yeta chunk of wood he carried the chunk back to their temporary camp i dont know what this is but it seems to be strongly magical it may be useful chester took it wood unusual durable this might have come from a very large old tree i dont recognize the species which makes it remarkable maybe you could find some of the bark crombie squawked give it here horseface ive seen a lot of wood in my day chester stiffened only slightly by all means birdbeak crombie held the chunk hi one foreclaw and inspected it closely squawk something odd about this yes bink agreed before you get too involved will you point out the nearest food for us we can eat while considering crombie obligingly whirled and pointed bink looked and saw a large glowing fungus that must be it i never ate glow before but your talents never wrong he walked over and reached down to break off a section the fungus was firm and dry pale inside and emitted a pleasant odor squawk crombie protested to the centaur im not through with it youve had it long enough buzzardbrain chester said my turn now buik had to run to break up yet another quarrel the trouble with fighting creatures was that they tended to fight he couldnt turn his back on them even to fetch food its the magicians turn he cried maybe he can identify it he took back the wood and carried it to humfrey sir if you care to classify this rare specimen he had said the magic words the magicians attention was attracted he looked he blinked thats blue agony fungus get rid of it oops bink had put the wrong hand down and shoved the fungus under humfreys nose sorry i meant to show you this wood not the he paused the fungus is poisonous its magic will turn your whole body blue just before you melt into a blue puddle that kills all the vegetation in the ground where it soaks in humfrey assured him but crombie pointed it out as safe to eat ridiculous its safe to touch but the unsafest thing anyone could eat they used to use it for executions back in the bad old early waves bink dropped the fungus crombie didnt you he broke off reconsidering crombie would you point out the worst thing we could eat the griffin shrugged and pointed right toward the fungus you absolute idiot chester exclaimed to the griffin have the feathers in your brains rotted you just a moment ago pointed it out as safe crombie squawked angrily bink must have picked up the wrong item my talent is never wrong humfrey was now examining the piece of wood crombies talent is always wrong he remarked absently thats why i never rely on it even chester was surprised at this magician the soldier is no prizeeven i am willing to concede thatbut usually his talent is sound crombie squawked outraged at this qualified endorsement maybe so i wouldnt know the magician squinted at a passing sweat gnat what is that creature you don t recognize a common sweat gnat bink asked amazed a moment ago you were classifying the most obscure bugs discovering new species humfreys brow furrowed why should i do that i know nothing about bugs man griffin and centaur exchanged glances first crombie then the magician chester murmured it must be the madness but wouldnt that affect all of us bink asked worried this is more like a misfire of talents crombie pointed out the worst food instead of the best and humfrey switched from knowledge to ignorance right when the chunk of wood switched hands chester finished wed better get him away from that wood yes chester agreed and stepped toward humfrey no pleaselet me do it bink said quickly confident that his talent could handle the situation best he approached humfrey excuse me sir he lifted the chunk gently from the magicians grasp why doesnt it affect you chester asked or me it affects you centaur humfrey said but since you dont know your talent you dont see how it is reversed as for binkhe is a special case so the good magician was back in form then this wood reverses spells bink asked more or less at least it changes the thrust of active magic i doubt it would restore the griffin cow or the stone men if thats what youre contemplating those spells are now passive only a complete interruption of magic itself would nullify them uh yes bink said uncertainly what kind of a special case are you chester demanded of bink you dont do any magic you might say im immune bink said cautiously wondering why his talent was no longer protecting itself from discovery then he looked down at the wood in his hand was he immune he dropped the wood squawk crombie said so thats why my talent missed that wood made me pumf squawk screech the golem had wandered near the wood and his translation had disintegrated bulk gently lifted grundy away from it of what i meant to the golem continued blithely unaware of the change its dangerous it certainly is bink agreed he kicked the wood away chester was not reassured that means this was an incidental foulup we have yet to face the madness crombie located the nearest safe food successfully this tune it was a lovely cookie bush growing from the rich soil beside the bones they feasted on chocolatechip cookies a handy waterchestnut tree provided ample drink all they had to do was pluck the fresh chestnuts and puncture them to extract the water as bmk chewed and drank his eye fell on another earth mound this tune he scraped it away carefully with a stick but could find nothing except loose earth wi think these things are following me he said but what is the point they dont do anything they just sit there ill take a look at one in the morning the magician said his curiosity moderately aroused they set up house within the gaunt cage of bones as darkness closed in bink lay back on the cushion of sponge moss beneath the skeletonhe had checked this out carefully to make sure it was harmlessand watched the stars emerge camping out was not so terrible at first the stars were mere points of light peeking between the bars of the boneenclosure but soon bink perceived patterns hi them the constellations he was not conversant with the stars because xanth was not safe at night he had stayed inside and when caught outside had hurried to shelter thus he found the landscape of the night sky intriguing he had somehow thought for no good reason that the stars were of equivalent brightness evenly dispersed instead they were highly varied in both respects ranging from piercingbright to lookagain dim and from solitary splendor to clustered confusion in fact they seemed to form patterns in his mind he could draw lines between them fashioning pictures there was the head of a man and a curving line like a snake and a blob with tentacles like a tangle tree as he concentrated these things became more definite the figures assumed greater definition and conviction seeming almost real say theres a centaur bink exclaimed naturally chester said thats one of the established constellations been there for centuries but it looks alive i thought i saw it move no the constellations dont move not that way they chester broke off he did move bink cried his arm fetching an arrow from his bag his quiver chester corrected him something strange here must be atmospherics or maybe tne air moving bink said chester snorted they watched the centaur in the sky take out his arrow fit it to his bow and cast about for some target there was a swan in view but it was a very large tame bird not suitable for hunting there was a fox but it slid out of sight behind some herdsmen before the centaur could take proper aim then a great bear showed up it was trying to catch a lion cub but the adult lion was nearby almost as large as the bear and in an ornery mood the two big preda tors circled each other while the pointing arrowhead of the centaur traced their movements which one should be taken first take the lion stupid chester muttered then the bear will take the cub and leave yon alone bink was fascinated both by this animation of the constellations and by the strength and grace of the weird beasts the centaur was a regular creature of coursebut only in mythology relating to mundania did animals like bears and lions and swans exist parts of them showed up in the form of sphinxes chimerae griffins and inch but that didnt really count a mundane lion could also be reckoned as the body of a griffin with the head of an ant lion a composite deriving from the xanth originals now with the shield down animals could cross the boundary freely and probably at the fringe all types mixed bink regretted hi retrospect that he had not had the chance to see such creatures as bears in the flesh when he had visited mundania but he had been glad enough to return to xanth then almost under the centaurs tail another strange mundane creature appeared a wolf it resembled a oneheaded dog bink had seen werewolves in the flesh but that might not count what a horror it must be in mundania where wolves were locked permanently in their animal form unable to revert to men the skycentaur whirled on the wolf aiming his bow but the wolf was already moving on because a huge scorpion was following him the scorpion was being chased by a manno it only thought the man was after it the man a hugely muscled brute was actually pursuing a serpent trying to smash in its head with a club yeta dragon was hot after the man and a really strange longnecked animal followed the dragon in fact the whole sky was alive with oddities making it seem like a much more interesting place than the land of xanth twhat is that thing with the neck bink asked mythological zoology is not my specialty chester said but i believe it is a mundane monster called a gaffe he paused no thats not quite it a grraff no aa giraffe thats it the long neck is to keep it clear of hostile ground magic or something its strangest feature as i understand it is that despite that long neck it has no voice strange magic indeed bink agreed strange unmagic technically the land of mundania could use a good sensible shot of magic the sky was now densely crowded with animals as the remaining stars emerged farther along was a crab and a wingless bull and a genuine singleheaded dog birds aboundedhalffamiliar ones like the phoenix and bird of paradise and a host of strange ones like the crane toucan eagle peacock dove and crow there were people toomen children and several fetching young women that reminded bink again of chameleon the longer he was away from her the more he missed her so what if she had her ugly phase she also had her lovely phase lookthere is the river eridanus chester cried bmk found it the river flowed half across the sky meandering from the feet of a giant all the way to bink couldnt see where it finished where could a river in the sky go all manner of fish were associated with it and one what is that bink cried the fabulous mundane whale chester said im glad no such monster as that exists in our land biufc agreed emphatically he traced the river again seeking its termination it spread and thinned becoming vague eluding him then he spied a small lizard a chameleon he exclaimed as he spoke its name the lizard changed becoming the human chameleon he knew and loved his wife she looked out at him from the deepest depths of the sky and her mouth opened bink bink she seemed to say come to me bink was on his feet nearly banging his head against a bone im comingl he cried joyfully why had he ever left her but there was no way to reach her he could not climb the air or fly up there and in any event he knew she was just a picture not real just a transformed lizard itself imaginary still he wished now the constellation centaur shot his arrow the missile blazed as it flew forming a brilliant streak across the sky growing brighter and yet brighter as it drew near suddenly it loomed frighteningly large and close as if flying right out of the skyand cracked into a nearby tree it was a dogwood it yelped with pain then growled and bared its teethlike inner branches in canine fury seeking its enemy in a moment it had torn the arrow to shreds bulk looked across at chester but could not make out the centaurs expression in the dark that constellation arrow no more than a shooting star had struck a real tree close byl was that centaur shooting at us k he wasnt he was criminally careless chester replied grimly if he was he made a damn poor shot thats a bad example that reflects on the merits of all centaurs i will forward nun a reminder now visible against the sparkling night sky in silhouette chester stood tall and magnificent a fine stallion of a man and nocked one of his own arrows he drew on the bow with all his formidable power and loosed the shaft upward up up it flew somehow visible despite the night up inroossibly high right to the verge of the nocturnal dome right toward the centaur constellation bink knew no physical arrow could strike a star or pattern of stars after all the constellations were merely imaginary lines drawn between those stars yet chesters arrow plunked into the flank of the constellation centaur the creature leaped with pain from his mouth issued two comets and a shooting star a powerful exclamation yeah same to you vacuumhead chester retorted the constellation reached back and yanked at chesters arrow a nova exploded from his mouth as he contemplated the damage several dim stars pulsed there suggestive of the wound he grabbed a handful of soft down feathers from the swan and rubbed them against the injury now it was the defeathered swan who cussed a bright streak of shooting stars but the bird did not dare attack the centaur the skycentaur snatched the extensible tube called the telescope and put it to bis eye the magic of this tube enabled him to see much farther than otherwise he exclaimed with really foul invective looking for the originator of the objectionable arrow right here hoofhead chester bawled and lofted another arrow into the sky come down and fight like a centaur mub i wouldnt bink cautioned the constellation seemed to hear the challenge he swung his telescope around and oriented on the bonecamp a vile ringed planet shot from his mouth thats right dope chester cried come prove youre worthy of the name worthy of the name dope bink didnt like this at all but was unable to stop it the constellation nocked another arrow so did chester for a time the two faced each other bows drawn as it were daring each other to shoot first then almost together their arrows leaped forth both shots were uncomfortably accurate bink saw the two arrows cross midway in the heavens and home in on their targets as if magically guided neither centaur moved this was evidently a point of honor in such duels the one who jumped clear would show weakness of nerve and few centaurs were weak in that department both arrows missedbut not by much chesters shot almost grazed the constellations forehead while the skycentaurs arrow thunked into the ground beside chesters left forehoof which happened to be quite close to the good magicians head humfrey woke with a start you equine menace he cried grumpily watch what youre doingl i am watching chester said thats not my arrow see it has stardust on it humfrey drew the arrow from the dirt why so it does he squinted up into the sky but stardust is not supposed to be down here whats going on now crorabie stirred squawk youre the magician the golem said youre supposed to know about things about stellar constellations coming to life its been a long time since i reviewed that particular magic humfrey stared up into the sky however it would be a worthwhile study crombie wheres the most convenient access to that realm crombie pointed now bink saw a pattern of stars resembling steps coming down to the horizon they looked increasingly solid and they seemed closer as he looked descending almost to the rim of bones maybe it was possible after all to ascend he looked up into the stars again they were even more brilliant than before and the lines between them were stronger the stick figures had assumed shadings that made them quite realistic he saw chameleon again beckoning him im going up squawk crombie agreed tm always ready for a good fight and that cometmouthed centaur needs a lesson chester was already on his way to the steps but at this he paused dont be a fool the magician snapped running after them crombie refers to the centaur in the sky not you you are loudmouthed not cometmouthed um of course chester agreed without complete enthusiasm he made a visible effort to shake off the annoyance charge they charged for the steps are you fools crazy grundy yelled theres nothing up there for you chester glanced at him bink saw the change in the shape of the centaurs head outlined against the massed constellations i didnt hear crombie squawk he didnt squawk the golem yelled im speaking for myself this time dont go into the sky its madness its fascinating humfrey said firsthand study of animated constellations there may never be a better opportunity i have to teach that centaur a lesson chester said binks eyes had returned to chameleon his need for her became as big as the sky he continued forward its the madness grundy cried yanking at the feathers of crombies neck it doesnt affect me i see only the facts because fm not real this is hostile magic dont go youre probably right twerp humfrey agreed but this offering is too compelling to be denied so was the siren dont do it grundy repeated where is your quest if you let the madness take you now what do you care chester demanded you have no feelings he put his forehooves on the first step it was firm anchored at every comer by a pinpoint star the lines were like threads and the panels between them like glass a translucent staircase not quite invisible going up into the sky bink knew it was magic and not to be trusted but chameleon was up there waiting for him and he had to go his talent would not permit it if it were not safe after all well im not going gnindy screamed he jumped from the griffins back fell into the foliage of a flowerbug bush and scared up a swarm of flowerbugs in a moment he was lost in the night good riddance chester muttered mounting the steps the surfaces bowed slightly under his weight drawing the anchoring stars inward but held crombie impatient with this spread his wings and flew around the centaur and came to rest higher on the stairway apparently the ascent was too steep for comfortable flying by a creature of this size so he preferred to mount by foot the good magician was third and bulk last in a line they ascended the stairway spiraled so that soon crombie was climbing directly above bink it was an interesting effect but bulk was more intrigued by the view below as he climbed above the level of the trees the nocturnal landscape of the xanth wilderness opened out below impressive because of its special nature bink had once been transformed into a bird and once had ridden a magic carpet and once had flown in human form magic had given him quite a varied experience but this slow ascent up through the levels of the forest with firm footing beneath him this was different from the various forms of flight and in a certain respect unique he was highly aware than he could fall the steps had no railing to hold him in no barrier at the fringes of the steps this seemed to put him right into the situation in a way that flight did not to be above the ground yet tied to it the night forest was beautiful a number of trees glowed some reached bonewhite tentacles up others were balls of pastel hues some had giant flowers that resembled eyes and these eyes seemed to be focusing on bink other treetops formed into mazes of interlocking branches as he watched the whole forest assumed the shape of a single human face dont col it mouthed bink paused momentarily disgruntled was the wilderness really trying to speak to him whose interest did it represent it could be jealous of his escape to the sky hungry for his body or just mischievous crombie had balked at the tangle tree chester had been fortuitously deafened in tune to save them from the sirens call his talent had been operating then why was it quiescent now he looked upward the enormous panorama of the sky awaited himanimals monsters and people they were all frozen in place at the moment awaiting the arrival of binfcs party up there lay adventure he resumed his climb he had to hurry because the others had continued moving and were now several spirals ahead of him he didnt want to be late for the action as he caught up to the magician who was lagging behind the stout fourlegged entities something buzzed in from the darkness to the side it sounded like a very large insect one of the exotic bugs not another gold bug he hoped he waved his arms hoping to scare it off bink a small voice cried what now he was getting winded from his rapid climb and had to watch carefully to be sure he didnt make a misstep while absorbing the splendors of the immense canopy above and the broad disk below he was in the very center of a phenomenal scene and he wanted to experience every aspect of it with full intensity and he didn t need any bugs distracting him go away the bug flew near there was light associated with it it was a flying fish propelling itself by a jet of bubbles from its fuselage so that its rigid wings could provide sufficient lift the gills were airintakes and assorted little fins provided stability and spot maneuverability flying fish were swift bink knew they had to be or they dropped to the ground this one carried a light on its back like a miniature lantern and bink its grundy and lo it was indeed the golem braced on the back of the fish guiding it with little reins and a bit set in its mouth grundys free hand held the lamp which seemed to be a tiny star captive in a little net i caught this fish by luring it with fishtalk now it understands and is helping i have the spellreversal wood along he tapped his saddle with his reinhand it was the gnarly fragment that bink had discarded but how can the fish fly bink demanded how can you translate the reversal it doesnt affect the fish because the fish has no talent the fish is magical grundy explained with limited patience the wood only reverses exterior magic not inherent magic that doesnt make much sense to me bink said the wood reversed birdbeaks talent but did not change him back into a man the golem continued it fouled up the gnomes information but did not make him a regular man either it didnt affect you because the golem was not aware of binks talent but this remained a pertinent question had binks talent conquered the woodor been reversed by it the answer could be a matter of life and deathl what about you bink demanded youre still translating im not real grundy said shortly take away my magic and im nothing but string and mud the wood is just wood to me but the wood was affecting you before you were speaking gibberish until i got you away from it was i grundy asked startled i never realized i guess translation is my talent so he faded out considering i know im not translating now im speaking for myselfl and there was the answer well keep that wood away from me bink said i dont trust it no i have to bring it close to you put your hand on it bink i will not bink exclaimed grundy jerked the reins to one side kicked the flanks of the fish and leaned forward the fish swerved reared and accelerated right at bink hey he protested as it grazed his hand but at that moment his outlook changed abruptly the stars were mere stars and the stairswere the branches of a latticework tree above him the others were near its summit about to step onto the thinning twigs that could not support their weight crombie was already supporting much of his mass by flapping his wings and chester i bink shook his head hi amazement a centaur climbing a tree then the fish buzzed out of range and the madness returned bink was on the translucent stairway again climbing toward the glowing constellations its crazy i know he cried but i cant help myself i have to go on up i the golem guided his fish in close again you cant throw it off even when you know its doom its mad bink agreed suffering a measure of sanity as the wood passed near again but true but dont i worry about meill survive go get chester off that branch before he kills himself i right grundy agreed he spurred his mount and buzzed upward bink resumed his climb cursing himself for his foolishness the fish disappeared in the night only the caged starthat bink now knew was nothing more than a glowberryshowed grundys location that light moved up near the centaur good grief golem chester exclaimed what the horsefeathers am i doing hi a tree bink could not hear grundys side of the conversation but could guess its nature after a moment chester started backing down the stairway steps hey oaf the magician cried get your asss rear out of my face go down the centaur cried this is no stair its a tree were climbing to our doom its information let me by its madness grundy take your wood to him the light descended great galloping gizzards humfrey cried it is a tree weve got to get down but now the centaur was climbing again i havent finished my business with that constellation centaur he said you equine fool humfrey exclaimed desist the fish zoomed down toward bink i cant handle them both grundy cried ive only got the single piece of wood and there are four of you the griffin can fly hell be all right for now bink said the stairi mean the treeis narrow give chester the wood no one can pass him then you search for more wood i had already thought of that the golem said the fish zoomed off in a moment chester reversed his course again the good magician cursed in most unmagicianlike vernacular but was forced to retreat hi the face of the centaurs rear soon they were right above binkand he too cursed as his ascent was balked the constellations seeing the retreat exploded in rage the sky centaur cried silently at his summons the other monsters of the heavens gathered the dragon the hydra the serpent the winged horse the giant and in the river the whale the madness remained upon him but bink no longer wanted to climb the stairway the monsters were converging clustering about the top of the stairspiral the serpent was starting down its sinuous body coiling along the spiral while the winged ones flew down bink was not certain whether they were real or illusion or something in betweenbut remembering the arrowstrike at the dogwood tree he was disinclined to gamble weve got to get under cover he cried but crombie highest on the stair and unaffected by the spellwood flew up to do battle with the winged horse squawk he cried fneigh the horse replied grundy buzzed by on his steed oooh what they said wings spread griffin and horse faced off claws swiping hooves striking contact was made but bink couldnt tell from the whirling flapping silhouettes which creature was prevailing then the serpent arrived chester could not use his bow effectively since no arrow would travel a spiral path so waited with his sword bink wondered what the centaur saw since he had the wood and so perceived realityor something probably it was not a serpent but an equivalent threat meanwhile bink had to interpret it as he saw it as the huge snakehead came close the centaur bellowed a warning and struck it across the nose blade met fang the serpents teeth were large reflecting starlight and they gleamed with what might be poison there were two projecting ones and they moved with the precision of a fencer chester was compelled to retreat since he had only one sword then chester took a cue from the winged horse and used his front hooves he bashed the serpent on the nose onetwo onetwo while dazzling it with the sword his front feet did not have the power of his rear ones but his hooves had sharp fighting edges and a cumulative impact that could splinter bark from a tree or scales from a serpent what would happen bink wondered if the wood were to touch the serpent would it give the serpent a different view of reality would the centaur then seem to be something else how could anyone be sure what magic was real and what false the serpent hissed and gaped its jaws so widely that its mouth became as tall as the centaur its sinuous tongue snaked out to wrap around chesters sword arm immobilizing it but chester shifted his weapon to his other hand and efficiently lopped off the tongue the serpent made a hissing howl of agony and snapped its mouth closed the tusks clanging against each other chester took a moment to unwrap the segment of tongue from his arm then resumed slashing at the nose he was holding his own the dragon arrived it zoomed in at the good magician humfrey might be captive to the madness but he was not a fool his hand dived into his jacket and came out with a vial but so swift was the dragons onslaught that there was no time to open the container instead humfrey flipped it into the opening mouth the dragon snapped at it automatically the vial crunched under its bite vapor exploded expanding into a cloud that jetted out between the dragons teeth and coalesced about its head but it did not form into anything elseno demon no smoke screen not even a sandwich it just clung there in hardening gobs what is it bink cried did the vial misfire i had to grab randomly humfrey replied its i believe it is foaming insulation slavering what foaming insulation it foams up then hardens in place to keep things warmor cold bink shook his head the magician was mad all right how could anything act to keep things hot or cold it either had to be like fire heating or like ice cooling and why would anyone bother with such magic the dragon however was not taking it with equanimity it flexed in midair and shook its head violently from side to side trying to rid itself of the clinging stuff it chewed and gulped seeking to eliminate the foam i wouldnt do that if i were you humfrey told it the dragon ignored him it roared then it huffed and puffed working up a head of fire hi its belly it looped about its flapping wings throwing off chunks of hardened foam then it oriented on the magician and blasted out its terrible fire only a thin jet of flame emerged then surprisingly the dragons body began inflating it swelled up like a balloon until only the legs tail wing tips and snout projected from the ball what bink asked amazed the insulation hardens fee place immediately in the presence of heat humfrey explained thus the drag ons own fire had solidified it unfortunately that particular type of insulation is also the dragon exploded stars shot out hi every direction scorching the jungle foliage below zooming by bink to the side and making a fine display above explosively flammable when ignited humfrey finished they watched the upwardflying stars rise to their heights then explode in multicolored displays of sparks the whole night sky became briefly brighter i tried to warn that dragon humfrey said without sympathy one simply does not apply open flame to flammable insulation bink privately hardly blamed the dragon for misunderstanding that caution he would have made the same mistake as the dragon had if his talent permitted it but this did impress on him one thing should he ever have a serious disagreement with the good magician he would have to watch out for those magic bottles there was no telling what might come out of them now a monster found bink it was the hydra it had no wings and could not have used the stairs because they were blocked by the serpent the hydra seemed to nave descended by hanging from a threadbut no such thread was visible bink swung at the monster with his sword he was in excellent form he caught the nearest of the seven heads cleanly just behind the horns and it flew off gore spouted out of the neck with such force that the jet separated into two channels if this was all it took to beat this monster bink would have no trouble the two jets coagulated in midair forming into twin lumps still attached to the neck as more gore emerged it splashed over these lumps hardening enlarging them excrescences developed and the color darkened until the lumps became two new heads each was smaller than the original but just as vicious bink had only succeeded in doubling the menace he faced this was a problem if each head he cut off converted into two the longer and better he fought the worse off he would bell yet if he did not fight well he would soon be consumed in sevenno eight chunks catch buik chester called throwing something bink didnt appreciate the interruption to his concentration but grabbed for it anyway in the dark his sweeping fingers merely batted it aside in the moment it touched him his sanity returned he saw himself on a branch of the tree pointing his sword at but then the reversespell wood bounced out of range and the madness resumed its grip on nun he saw tiie chunk fly toward the hydraand one of the heads reached out to gulp it down in that instant bulk suffered a rapid continuation of his prior line of thought what would spellreversal do inside an imaginary monster if the hydra form were wholly a product of bulks distorted perceptionhis madness which he shared with his friendsit should be nullifiedno the wood had to be near him to nullity the monsters he perceived but since his friends saw the monsters too and the wood could not be near them all at onceit had to be that the wood would not affect the monster unless that monster had objective reality even then the wood would not affect the form of the hydra but only its talentif the hydra had a talent most magical creatures did not have magic talents their magic consisted of their very existence sonothing should happen the hydra screamed from all its eight mouths abruptly it dropped to the ground it landed heavily and lay still its stars fading out bulk watched it openmouthed the hydra had not changed formit had suffered destruction what had happened then he worked it out the hydra had a magic talent after all that of hanging by an invisible thread the spellreversal wood had nullified that magic causing the monster to plummet forcefully down to its death its invisible thread had not disappeared it had acted to draw the creature down as powerfully as it had drawn it up before disaster but now the wood was gone how were they to escape the madness bink looked up the good magicians foaming agent had destroyed the dragon and chesters hooves and sword had beaten back the serpent crombies fighting spirit had proved to be too much for the winged horse so the individual battles had been won but the war remained unpromising a number of constellations had remained in the sky the centaur giant and whale had not been able to descend because they lacked wings or flying magic and the stairway had been preempted by the serpent now seeing the fate of their companions these three bellowed then rage from the safety of the nocturnal welkin novas and ringed planets and miniature lightning bolts and curlytailed comets radiated from their mouths in confusing profusion and wonderful foulness with the whale spouting obscene curlicues oh yeah chester bawled well come up there and do the same to you youre the cowards who started it all and crombie and humfrey and bink closed in about him as well as they were able no stop grundy screamed from his flying fish zooming in a circular holding pattern youve all seen the nature of your madness dont yield to it again pass the wood around restore your perspectives get your feet on the ground again dont let the spooks lure yon to destruction hes right you know humfrey muttered but i dropped the wood bink cried i dropped our sanity then go down and fetch it the golem cried and you horserearyou threw it to him you go down and help him squawk crombie exclaimed and birdbeak says hes going up alone to grab all the glory for himself oh no he doesnt chester roared right the golem agreed you have to go together to be fair about it you real creatures place great store by fairness dont you or is honor a foreign concept to you birdbeak you dont want horserears competition because you know hed show you up if you didnt have a head start squawk squawk bink almost thought he saw a comet spew from crombies mouth right so you prove you can match him anywhere anytimeby getting down there and finding that wood before he does and take the gnome with you horserear can take the washout with him washout that was what the golem had decided to call bink binks blood pressure started building just because his talent wasnt visible all right and may dung fall on you chester said til fetch the stupid wood then on to glorious battle thus ingloriously they descended the glassy stair the monsters above exploded with derision the sky lit up with their exclamations exploding cherry bombs in many silent colors glowing tornadoes forest fires the whale diverted the river eridanus so that its water poured down in a scintillating cataract the giant swung his huge club bashing stars out of their sockets and sending them flying down the centaur fired glowing arrows keep moving slowpokes the golem yelled keep walking away from their challenges that makes them madder than anything else you can do hey yeah chester agreed youre pretty smart for a tangle of string and tar im sanebecause i have none of the foolish emotions of reality to interfere with my thought processes gnrady said sanebecause i am string and tar therefore you are the only one qualified to lead us out of madness the magician said you are the only one who can perceive objective realitybecause you have no subjective aspect yes isnt it great but the golem hardly looked happy bink understood suddenly that grundy would gladly join them in madness though he knew it led to disaster if this could be the proof of his reality only the golems unreality enabled him to hang on to what life he had what a paradoxical fate an arrow struck a catnip bush right beside him the plant yowled and spat nipping at the shaft then batting it back and forth with its pawbuds oh i want to stick an arrow right up under his tail chester muttered that centaurs a disgrace to the species first find the wood grundy cried one of the giants batted stars whizzed over bulks head and ignited a rubber tree the plant stretched enormously trying to get away from its own burning substance the smell was horrible we cant find anything here in the smoke chester complained coughing then follow mel grundy cried showing the way on his fish choking they followed the golem the constellations raged above them firing volleys of missiles but could not score directly madness had no power over sane leadership yet the madness tried the whale took hold of the river again and yanked it brutally from its new channel the water spilled across the starry field in a thinning milky wash forming a flood then it found a new channel coursed along it ripped out several stars growing there and poured down toward the ground look out buik cried were at the foot of that waterfall indeed they were the mass of water was descending at them like a globulous avalanche they scrambled desperatelybut it caught them drenching them instantly in its milky fluid crashing about them with a sound like thunder and foaming waist high crombie hunched bedraggled his feathers losing their luster chester wrapped his arms about his human torso as if to fend the liquid off and the magician the good magician was wrapped in a big bright oncefluffy beach towel soaked it was worse than nothing wrong vial he explained sheepishly i wanted a raincoat they slogged out of the immediate waterfall and through the runoff bink found himself shivering the water of the sky river was chill the madness had been intriguing when the constellations first took on life but now he wished he were home warm and dry with chameleon ah chameleon he liked her especially in her normal stage neither beautiful nor smart but a pleasant middle range it always seemed so fresh that brief period when she was average since she was always changing but he loved her hi any form and intellect especially at times like now when he was wet and cold and tired and afraid he swiped at a floating star taking out some of his discomfort on it the bright mote was probably as miserable as he washed out of its place in the sky and become mere flotsam on earth the water here was too shallow for the whale the only sky monster that might have been a real threat at this stage the party wandered out of the slush in real life this must be a thunderstorm chester commented the walk became interminable the golem kept urging them through the night the wrath of the constellations pursued them some distance then was lost as they plunged under the jungle canopy the madness remained with them however the ground seemed to become a mass of peanut butter roiling under their steps the trees dangerous hi their own right seemed to develop an alien menace they turned purple and hummed in chorus and proffered sinister oblong fruits bink knew that the madness whether it seemed benign or malign would destroy them all in moments if they yielded to it his sense of selfpreservation encouraged him to resist it and his resistance became stronger with practicebut still he could not penetrate all the way to reality in a way this resembled the queens illusionbut this affected emotion as well as perception so was more treacherous he heard the golem squawking at crombie in griffintalk then saw grundy rest his flyingfish steed on crombies head apparently the fish was tired and had to be relieved it deserves a reward bink said for its timely service it does why grundy asked bink started to answer then realized the futility of it the golem was not real he did not care grundy did what he had to do but human conscience and compassion were not part of his makeup just take my word the fish must be rewarded what would it like this is a lot of trouble grundy muttered but he swished and gurgled at the fish it wants a family all he needs is a lady of his species bink pointed out or a man if he happens to be female she whatever more fishtalk in the mad region he cant locate one the golem explained a little of that spellreversal wood would solve that problem bink said in fact we could all use some we got mixed up by the madness and water and never thought of the obvious lets see if crombies talent can locate some more of that wood crombie squawked with dismayed realization he whirled and pointedright at a quivering mound of jelly thats a bloodsucker tree grundy said we cant go there why not chester asked facetiously you dont have any blood the wood must be beyond it bink said crombies talent is still working but we have to watch out for the incidental hazards along the way now more than ever in the night and with the madnessonly you can do it grundy tve been doing itl the golem said aggrieved we need light chester said birdbeuh crombie where can we get safe light the griffin pointed there was a flock of longlegged bubbly things with horrendously glowing eyes bink walked over cautiously and discovered that these were plants not animals what had seemed like legs were actually stems he picked one and its eye emitted a beam that illuminated everything it touched what is it really bink asked a torchflower grundy said watch you dont set fire to the forest the rain had stopped but the foliage still dripped not too much danger of that at the moment bink said armed with their lights they moved in the direction crombie had pointed for the wood meandering circuitously to avoid the hazards the golem perceived it was obvious that they could not have survived the natural traps of the jungle without the guidance of the golem it would have been bad enough in ordinary circumstances the madness made it impossible suddenly they arrived a monstrous stump loomed out of the ground it was as thick at the base as a man could span but broke off at headheight in jagged ruin what a tree that must have been bulk exclairrfed i wonder how it died they closed about the stumpand suddenly were sane the glowing eyes they held were revealed as the torchflowers the golem had said they were and the deep jungle showed its true magic instead of its madmagic in fact bink felt clearerheaded than ever before in his life the madness spellit has been reversed to make us absolutely sane he exclaimed like the golem look at the path we came by chester said we skirted poison thorns carnivorous grass oilbarrel treesour torches could have exploded this whole region don t i know it grundy agreed why do you think i kept yelling at you if i had nerves theyd be frayed to the bone every time you wandered from the course i set more things were coming clear to bink grundy why did you bother to help us instead of riding away on your fish you went to extraordinary trouble the fish grundy exclaimed i have to pay him off he pried a sliver of wood from the massive stump and affixed it to the fishs dorsal fin with a bit of his own string there you go bubbleeye he said with something that sounded suspiciously like affection as long as you carry that youll see everything as it is in the madness region so you can spot your lady fish once you have succeeded ditch the wood i understand it is not good to see a female too realistically crombie made an emphatic squawk of agreement that needed no translation the fish took ofi zooming into the sky with a powerful thrust of bubbles banking neatly around branches relieved of the golems weight and spurred by the hope of mad romance it was a speedy creature why did you do that bink asked the golem you short of memory you told me to nitnoggin i mean why did you do it with such grace you showed genuine feeling for that fish i couldnt have grundy snapped and why did you guide us all around the hazards if we had perished your service to the good magician would have been finished what use would that have been to me grundy demanded kicking angrily at a tuft of grass with one motley foot it would have freed you bink said instead you went to a great deal of trouble to herd us ofi that stair and to safety you really didnt have to your job is translation not leadership listen washouti dont have to take this crap from you think about it bink said evenly why help a washout grundy thought about it i must have been mad after all he admitted how could you be madwhen you werent affected by the madness what are you up to chester demanded why hassle the golem he did good work because the golem is a hypocrite bink said there was only one reason he helped us because i cared you nitwit grundy yelled why do i have to justify saving your life bink was silent crombie and chester and the good magician turned mutely to face the golem what did i say grundy demanded angrily why are you freeloaders staring at me crombie squawked birdbeak says the golem paused he saysi cant make out what he says whats the matter with me the wood of this tree reverses spells humfrey said it has canceled out your talent im not touching that wood neither are we bink said but we are all quite sane at the moment because the ambience of the stump is stronger than that of a single chip that is why we are now able to perceive you as you are do you realize what you said so the wood messes up my talent same as it does yours we knew that already because it changes our magic without changing us binfc continued because what is us is real but that would mean im halfway real and you halfway care chester said that was just a figure of speech i have no emotion move away from the tree bink said get out of the range of the stump tell us what you see out there grundy paced away and looked about the jungle he criedl its changed its mad care bink said the good magicians answer in your effort to save us you brought yourself halfway to your own destination you have begun to assume the liabilities of being real yon feel compassion you feel anger you suffer pleasure and frustration and uncertainty you did what you did because conscience extends beyond logic is it worth it grundy looked at the distortions beyond the stump its madness i he exclaimed and they all laughed chapter vortex fiends ht dawn they emerged from the madness region each holding a piece of spellreversal wood they had traveled tediously separating crombie at intervals from ins piece of wood getting his indication of the best immediate route then returning his chunk to him so that he could perceive threats accurately until the next orientation once they were out they located a reasonably secure roost in a storkleg tree setting their pieces of wood in a circle about its spindly trunks so that no hostile magic could approach them without getting reversed that was not a perfect defense but they were so tired they had to make do several hours later binfc woke stretched and descended the centaur remained lodged on a broad branch his four hooves dangling down on either side it seemed the treeclimbing experience during the madness had added a nonmagical talent to his repertoire the magician lay curled in a ball within a large nest he had conjured from one of his vials crombie ever the good soldier was already up scouting the area and the golem was with him one thing i want to know bink started as he munched on slices of raisin bread from a loaf crombie had plucked from a local breadfruit tree it was a trifle overripe but otherwise excellent crombie squawked is who destroyed that reversespell tree grundy finished youre translating again tm not touching any wood at the moment the golem fidgeted but i dont think im as real as i was last night during the madness still there must be some feeling remaining bink said it can be like that approaching a goal two steps forward one backbut you must never give up grundy showed more animation say thats a positive way of looking at it mushmind bink was glad to have given encouragement though the golems unendearing little mannerisms remained evident how did you know what i was about to ask about the destruction of you always come up with questions bink the golem said so we pointed out the location of the subject of your next question and it matched up with the tree stump so we researched it it was a challenge that was an intriguing ramification of crombies talentl anticipating the answers to future questions magic kept coming up with surprises only a real creature likes challenges bink said i guess so its sort of fun the challenge of becoming real now that i know that maybe its possible but i still have this ragtag body no amount of caring can change that it just means that now i fear the death that will surely come he shrugged dismissing it anyway the tree was blasted by a curse from that direction he pointed bink looked all i see is a lake then startled didnt the ogre say something about fiends of the lake who hurled a curse that blasted the whole forest grundy said we checked that is the lake humfrey descended from the tree td better bottle some of this wood if i can get my magic to work on it he said never can tell when it might be useful cast a spell hurling it away from your bottle chester suggested from the tree he too dropped to the ground after some awkward maneuvering that put his handsome posterior in jeopardy centaurs really did not belong in trees the magician set up his vial and wood and uttered an incantation there was a flash a puff of smoke and a gradual clearing of the air there sat the vial corked there sat the wood the good magician was gone where did he go bink demanded crombie whirled and pointed his wing directly toward the bottle oh no bink cried horrified his spell reversed all right it banished him to the bottle he dashed over and picked it up jerking out the cork vapor issued forth expanding and swirling and coalescing and forming in due course into the good magician there was a fried egg perched on his head i forgot i was keeping breakfast in that one he said ruefully grundy could hold back his newfound emotion no longer he burst out laughing he fell to the ground and rolled about guffawing oh nobody gnomes the trouble hes seen the golem gasped going into a further paroxysm a sense of humor is part of being real chester said solemnly just so humfrey agreed somewhat shortly good thing an enemy did not get hold of the bottle the holder has power over the content the magician tried againand again eventually he found the proper aspect of reversal and managed to conjure the wood into the vial bink hoped the effort was worth it at least he knew now how the good magician had assembled such an assortment of items he simply bottled anything he thought he might need then bink encountered another pile of earth hey magician he cried time to investigate this thing what is making these mounds are they all over xanth or just where we happen to be humfrey came over to contemplate the pile i suppose id better he grumped there was one on the sirens isle and another at our bonecamp he brought out his magic mirror what thing is this he snapped at it the mirror clouded thoughtfully then cleared it produced the image of a wormlike creature thats a wiggle bink exclaimed horrified are the wiggles swarming again thats not a wiggle chester said look at the scale its ten times too large and in the mirror a measuring stick appeared beside the worm showing it to be ten times the length of a wiggle dont you know your taxonomy thats a squiggle a squiggle bink asked blankly he did not want to admit that he had never heard of that species it looks like an overgrown wiggle to me they are cousins chester explained the squiggles are larger slower and do not swarm they are solitary creatures traveling under the ground they are harmless but the piles of dirt i had forgotten about that chester said i should have recognized the castings before they eject the dirt from their runnels behind them and where they touch the surface it forms into a pile as they runnel on the further castings plug up the hole so there is nothing left except the pile but what do they do they move about make piles of earth thats all but why are they following me i have nothing to do with squiggles could be coincidence humfrey said he addressed the mirror is it the mirrors unhappy baby face showed someone or something is setting the squiggle to spy on us then humfrey said and the mirror smiled the question is who the mirror turned dark the same as the source of magic humfrey demanded the mirror denied it binks enemy then and the smiling baby returned not the same as the fiends of the lake bink asked the baby smiled you mean it is the same dont confuse the mirror with your illogic the magician snapped it agreed it was not the samel uh yes bink said still if our route takes us past the fiends we have a problem with the enemy spying on us all the way and throwing obstacles in our way hes sure to excite the fiends into something dire i believe you are correct humfrey said it may be time for me to expend some more of my magic glory be chester exclaimed ironically quiet horserear humfrey snapped now let me see do we have to pass the fiends of the lake to reach our destination the mirror smiled and the fiends have cursemagic sufficient to blast forests the mirror agreed whats the most convenient way to pass without trouble the mirror showed a picture of bulk watching a play humfrey looked up can any of you make sense of this crombie squawked where am i grundy translated let me rephrase that question humfrey said quickly where is crombie while bink is watching the play the mirror showed one of the magicians vials the griffin went into an angry medley of squawks oh come off it beakbrain the golem said you know i can t repeat words like that in public not if i want to become real beakbrains concern is understandable chester said why should he be banished to a bottle he might never get out tm supposed to do the translations grundy complained forgetting his prior reluctance humfrey put away the mirror if you wont pay attention to my advice he informed crombie then do it your own way you temperamental real people are at it again grundy said the rational thing to do is listen to the advice consider the alternatives discuss them and form a consensus the little imp is making uncommon sense chester said which little imp grundy demanded l i suspect the magician said grimly that the garpolous golem would be best off in a bottle were fighting again bink said if the mirror says we can pass the fiends most conveniently by traveling in bottles id rather gamble on that than on the sort of thing weve just been through you dont have to gamble grundy pointed out you have to go watch a dumb play i have faith in my mirror humfrey said and the mirror blushed so brightly there was a faint glow through his jacket to prove it i will submit to bottling myself i believe the one beauregard used is pleasantly upholstered and huge enough for two suppose crombie and grundy and i enter that bottle and give it to bink to carry then he can ride chester to the play im willing bink said he wondered privately whether the good magician would take all his other bottles with him into the bottle that seemed a bit paradoxical but no doubt was possible but i dont know exactly where the fiends are and id rather not barge in on them unexpectedly if we approach carefully circumspectly they may be less fiendish crombie pointed to the lake yes i know but where at the lake at the edge on an island i mean before i innocently walk into a treeblasting curse crombie squawked and spread his wings his proud colors flashed as he flew up and made for the lake wait featherbrain chester cried theyll see you by air that will give us all awayl but the griffin ignored him they watched crombie wing handsomely out over the water his plumage flexing red blue and white i have to admit the ornery cuss is a beautiful animal chester murmured then the griffin folded his wings and plummeted toward the surface of the lake spinning in the air a curse bink cried they shot him down with a curse but then the figure straightened out regained altitude and winged back crombie seemed to be all right what happened bink demanded as the griflin landed was it a curse squawkl crombie replied grundy translated what curse i merely did my turnabout to get a closer fix on the fiends they reside under the water under the waterl bink cried how can we go there humfrey brought out another vial and handed it to bink these pills will do the trick take one every two hours while submerged it will theres a mound startingl chester cried a spy humfrey whipped out yet another vial uncorked it and aimed it at the upwelling dirt a jet of vapor shot out striking the mound crystals of ice formed the mound froze tire extinguisher the magician explained very cold that squiggle is frozen stiff in its tunnel let me kill it while i can catch it chester said eagerly wait bink said how long will the freeze last only a couple of minutes humfrey said then the squiggle will resume activity with no impairment and no memory of the missing minutes bink asked it should not be aware of the lapse squiggles arent very smart then don t kill it get out of its observation it will be convinced this was a false alarm that we were never here it will so report to its master throwing the enemy off the track the magicians brow lifted very intelligent bink you are thinking more like a leader now we shall hide in the bottle and you and chester can carry it with you quickly before the freeze abates the griffin remained uncertain but acquiesced the magician set the vial performed his incantation and man griffin and golem vanished grab the bottle get on my back hang on chester cried times almost up bink snatched up the lone vial remaining jumped on chesters back and hung on the centaur took off in a moment his hooves were splashing through the shallow water gimme a pill chester cried binfc fumbled out a pill from the bottle praying he would not spill the works as he bounced around he popped one into his mouth and handed the other forward to chesters raised hand i hope these work he cried thats all we needanother wrong bottle chester exclaimed gobble a foaming insulation pill sink wished the centaur hadnt thought of that insulation or freezing extinguisherouch he glanced back was it his imagination or was the dirt mound growing again had they gotten away in time suppose the squiggle saw their footprints then chester hit a dropoff and they plunged underwater bink choked involuntarily as the liquid covered his mouthbut the water was just like air to his breathing in fact it was like air to his whole body except for its color they could breathe this experience reminded him of something in a moment he had it the queens anniversary party that had been illusory underwater scenery while this was genuine unfortunately the queens version had been prettier here things were murky and dull chester plodded on picking his way carefully through the unfamiliar aquatic environment dusky clouds of sediment stirred up around his legs curious fish looked the pair over chester now held his bow in his hands hi case they should encounter a sea monster apart from the tension it was soon rather dull going bink drew out the bottle that held the magician and put his eye to the side vaguely he made out the shapes of a tiny griffin and tinier man they were in a carpeted room like that of a palace and were looking at moving pictures in the magic mirror it seemed very comfortable much nicer in fact than forging through the murk toward fiends another ugly thought came suppose he had grabbed the wrong bottle himself and popped the magician into his mouth in lieu of a waterbreathing pill such things were very scary right now bink put the vial in his pocket reassured that his friends were secure he wondered what would happen if he shook the bottle violently but resisted the urge to experiment lets go visit the fiends he said with false cheer shortly they approached a splendid marine castle it was formed from seashellswhich meant it was probably magical since few seashells formed in lakes without the aid of magic little whirlpools ascended from its turrets apparently bringing air down to the inhabitants instead of a moat the castle had a thick wall of seaweed patrolled by vigilant swordfish well lets hope the fiends are kind to travelers bink said there were no bubbles as he spoke the pill had fully acclimatized him lets hope the magicians mirror knew its business the centaur responded grimly and that the fiends dont connect the fool griffin with us if they saw him they marched up to the main gate a behemoth rose out of the muck mostly mouth hoooldl the behemoth bellowed whoo goooes there it was very proficient and resonant on the long os the sound reverberated across the reaches of the cavernous maw chester and bink travelers bink said with some trepidation wed like lodging for the night soooo the monster inquired then gooool its month gaped even more horrendously go the centaur repeated aggressively we just came soo gooo the behemoth reverberated its orifice gaping so widely that the centaur could have ridden right into it without ducking his head chester reached for his sword uh hoooldi mean hold bink murmured i rememberthe gargoylei think it means to go inside inside the mouth the centaur peered into the monsters tunnellike throat damned if ill cooperate in my own consumption but thats the entrance to the castle bink explained the behemoth itself chester stared well ill be gelded and without further hesitation he galloped in sure enough the throat continued on into the castle lights appeared at the end of the tunnel and soon they emerged into a palatial receiving hall intricately woven tapestries covered the walls and the floor was done in fancy wooden squares a handsome almost pretty young man walked up to greet them he had ornate curls about his ears and a neat mustache his costume was a princely robe embroidered with brightly colored threads and he wore soft slippers with pointed toes welcome to gateway castle he said may i inquire your identities and the purpose of this visit you may chester said there was a pause well the man said a bit nettled well why dont you inquire chester said i gave you permission small muscles quirked about the mans mouth making him less pretty i so inquire i am chester centaur and this is my companion bink hes human so i noted and your purpose we seek the source of magic bink said you have lost your way it is at the amazon village some distance north but the direct route is hazardous to your sanity we have been there bink said that is not the ultimate source but merely the upwelling of magic dust what we seek lies below according to our information a more convenient route passes through this castle the man almost smiled oh you would not care for that route try us and see this is beyond my cognizance you will have to talk with the lord of the manor good enough bink said he wondered what sort of a fiend this lord would be who had such a docile human servant if you would be good enough to come this way were good enough chester said but first we must do something about your hooves the floor is teak parquet we do not wish it scratched or dented why put it on the floor then chester demanded we do not apply it to the floor of our stable the man said he produced several disks of furry apply these to your hooves they will adhere ar muffle the impact how about wearing one of these on your mouth chester demanded its a small concession bink murmured chesters hooves were sound since the healing elixir had eliminated all damage to the centaurs hind end but they were hard enough to leave an imprint humor the poor man the fiends are probably very strict about such things and punish their servants for violations with imperfect grace chester pressed bis hooves one at a time onto the felt disks the material clung to them and it made the centaurs footfalls silent they moved through an elegant hall descended carpeted steps and entered a small chamber there was barely room for chester to stand if this is your main hall he began the man touched a button the door slid closed then abruptly the room moved bink flung out his hands startled and chester kicked a hole in the rear wall easy visitors the man said with a small frown havent you ridden an elevator before it is inanimate magic a chamber that rises or sinks when occupied saves wear on stairs oh bink said abashed he preferred more conventional magic the magic lift stopped the door slid open they stepped out into another hall and hi due course came to the chambers of the lord of the manor he was to binks surprise a man garbed richly in silver cloth and diamonds but with the same foolish slippers his servant wore so you proffer service for a nights lodging he said briskly this is our custom bink said and ours too the lord agreed heartily have you any special talents bink couldnt tell his own and didnt know chesters uh not exactly but were strong and can do work work oh my heavens no the lord exclaimed people do not work herel oh how do you live then bink asked we organize we directand we entertain the lord said have you any entertainment abilities bink spread his hands im afraid not excellent you will make an ideal audience audience bink knew that chester was as perplexed as he the mirror had shown him watching a playyet that could hardly be a service we send our troupes out to entertain the masses accepting payment hi materials and services it is a rewarding profession esthetically and practically but it is necessary to obtain advance audience ratings so that we can gauge our reception precisely this innocuous employment hardly jibed with the local reputation to be an audienceto watch your showsthat s all you require it hardly seems equitable im afraid we would not be able to present an informed critical report no necessity our magic monitors will gauge your reactions and point up our rough edges you will have nothing to do but react honestly i suppose we could do thai bink said dubiously if you really are satisfied something funny here chester said how come you have a reputation as fiends uh that s not diplomatic bink murmured embarrassed rends who called us fiends the lord demanded the ogre chester replied he said you blasted a whole forest with a curse the lord stroked his goatee the ogre survives chester shut up bink hissed but the centaurs unruly nature had taken control all he was doing was rescuing his lady ogre and you couldnt stand to have him happy so ah yes that ogre i suppose to an ogres way of thinking we would be fiends to us crunching human bones is fiendish it is all in ones perspective apparently the centaur had not antagonized the lord though bink judged that to be sheer luck unless the lord like his troupe was an actorin which case there could be serious and subtle trouble this one is now a vegetarian bink said but im curious do you really have such devastating curses and why should you care what an ogre does you really dont have cause to worry about ogres here under the lake they cant swim we do really have such curses the lord said they constitute group efiort the massing of all our magic we have no individual talents only individual contributions toward the whole bink was amazed here was a whole society with duplicating talents magic did repeat itself we do not employ our curses haphazardly however we went after the ogre as a professional matter he was interfering with our monopoly both bink and chester were blank your what we handle all formal entertainments in southern xanth that bad actor blundered into one of our sets and kidnapped our leading lady we do not tolerate such interference or competition you used an ogress for a leading lady bink asked we used a transformed nympha consummate actress all our players are consummate as you shall see in that role she resembled the most ogrelike ogress imaginable absolutely horrible he paused considering in fact with her artistic temperament she was getting pretty ogrelike hi life prima donna then the ogres error was understandable perhaps but not tolerable he had no business on that set we had to scrub the whole production it ruined our season bink wondered what reception the ogre would encounter as he rescued his ideal female an actress in ogress guise actually from the castle of the fiends what about the reversespell tree chester asked people were taking its fruit and being entertained by the reversal effects we did not appreciate the competition so we eliminated it chester glanced at bink but did not speak perhaps these people really were somewhat fiendish to abolish all rival forms of entertainment and where did you say you were traveling to the lord inquired to the source of magic bink said we under stand it is underground and that the best route leads through this castle i do not appreciate humor at my expense the lord said frowning if you do not wish to inform me of your mission that is certainly your privilege but do not taunt me with an obvious fabrication bink had the impression that obviousness was a worse affront than fabrication to this person listen fiend chester said bridling in most obvious fashion centaurs do not lie uh let me handle this bink said quickly there is surely some misunderstanding we are on quest for the source of magicbut perhaps we have been misinformed as to its access the lord mellowed that must be the case below this castle lies only the vortex nothing that goes that route ever returns we are the gateway we straddle the vortex protecting innocent creatures from being drawn unwittingly into that horrible fate who informed you that the object of your quest lay in such a direction well a magician never trust a magician they are all up to mischief uh maybe so bink said uneasily and chester nodded thoughtfully he was very convincing they tend to be the lord said darkly abruptly he shifted the subject i will show you the vortex this way if you please he led the way to an interior panel it slid aside at his touch there was a glistening wall of glassy substance no not glass it was moving fleeting irregularities showed horizontally now bink could see through it somewhat vaguely making out the threedimensional shape it was a column perhaps twice his armspan in diameter with a hollow center in fact it was water coursing around in circles at high speed or hi spirals going down a whirlpool chester exclaimed we are looking at the nether column of a whirlpool correct the lord said with pride we have constructed our castle around it containing it by magic substances may pass into it but not out of it criminals and other untoward persons are fed into its maw to disappear forever this is a most salutary deterrent surely so the mass of moving fluid was awesome in its smooth power and frightening yet it was also in its fashion luring like the song of the siren or the madness bink yanked bis gaze away but where does it go who would presume to know the lord inquired in return quirking an eyebrow expressively he slid the panel across and the vision of the vortex was gone enough of this the lord decided we shall wine and dine you fittingly and then you will audience our play the meal was excellent served by fetching young women in scant green outfits who paid flattering attention to the travelers especially chester they seemed to admire both his muscular manportion and his handsome equine portion bink wondered as he had before what it was girls saw in horses the siren had been so eager to ride at last stuffed bink and chester were ushered to the theater the stage was several times the size of the chamber for the audience apparently these people did not like to watch as much as they liked to perform the curtain lifted and it was on a gaudily costumed affair replete with bold swordsmen and buxom women and funny jokers the staged duels were impressive but bink wondered how proficient those men would be with their weapons in a real battle there was a considerable difference between technical skill and combat nerve the women were marvelously seductivebut would they be as shapely without the support of their special clothes or as wittily suggestive minus the memorized lines you do not find our production entertaining the lord inquired i prefer life bink replied the lord made a note on his pad more realism then the play shifted to a scene of music the heroine sang a lovely song of loss and longing meditating on her faithless lover and it was difficult to imagine how any lout no matter how louty could be faithless to such a desirable creature bink thought of chameleon again and longed for her again chester was standing raptly beside him probably thinking of horsing around with cherie centaur who was indeed a fetching filly then the song was augmented by a hauntingly lovely accompaniment a flute was playing its notes of such absolute quality and clarity that the ladys voice was shamed bink looked toward that sound and there it was a gleaming silver flute hanging in the air beside the heroine playing by itself a magic flute the lady ceased singing surprised but the flute played on indeed freed of the limitations of her voice it trilled on into an aria of phenomenal expertise and beauty now the entire cast of players stood listening seeming to find it as novel as bink did the lord jumped to his feet who is performing that magic he demanded no one answered all were absorbed in the presentation clear that set the lord cried redfaced everybody out out out slowly they cleared fading into the wings looking back at the solo instrument the stage was empty but still the flute played performing a medley of melodies each more lovely than the one preceding the lord grabbed bink by the shoulders are you doing it he demanded seeming about ready to choke bink tore his attention from the flute i have no magic like that he said the lord hauled on chesters muscular arm you it must be yours then chesters head turned to face him what he asked as if coming out of a reverie in that instant flute and music faded chester bink exclaimed your talent all the beauty in your nature suppressed because it was linked to your magic and as a centaur you couldnt my talent chester repeated amazed it must be me i never did dare towho would have believed play it again bink urged make beautiful music prove you have magic just as your herouncle herman the hermit didl yes chester agreed he concentrated the flute reappeared it began to play haltingly at first then with greater conviction and beauty and strangely the centaurs rather homely face began to seem less so not so strange bink realized much of chesters brutality of expression stemmed from his habitual snarl that snarl had abated he had no need of it any more now you dont owe the magician any service bink pointed out you found your talent yourself what abominable mischief the lord cried you accepted our hospitality on the agreement that you would render service as an audience you are not an audienceyou are a performer you have reneged on your agreement with us now a portion of chesters familiar arrogance reasserted itself the flute blew a flat note manfeathers the centaur snapped i was only playing along with your heroines song bring your play back ill watch it and accompany it hardly the lord said grimly we tolerate no nonguild performances in our midst we maintain a monopoly what are you going to do chester demanded throw a fit i mean a curse uh i wouldnt bink cautioned his friend ill not tolerate such arrogance from a mere halfman the lord said oh yeah chester retorted with an easy and insulting gesture he caught the mans shirtfront with one hand and lifted him off the floor chester were their guests bink protested not any more the lord gasped get out of this castle before we destroy you for your insolence my insolencefor playing a magic flute chester demanded incredulously how would you like that flute up your chester bink cried warningly though he had considerable sympathy for the centaurs position he invoked the one name that had power to restrain chesters wrath cherie wouldnt like it if you oh i wouldnt do it to her chester said reconsidered not with a flute all this time the centaur had been holding the lord suspended in air suddenly the mans shirt ripped and then he he fell ignominiously to the floor more than ignominiously he landed in a fresh pile of dirt actually this cushioned his impact saving him from possible injury but it multiplied his rage dirt the lord cried this animal dumped me in dirt well thats where you belong chester said i really wouldnt want to dirty my clean silver flute on you he glanced at bink im glad its silver and not some cheap metal shows quality that flute yes bink agreed hastily now if we can leave whats dirt doing on my teak parquet the lord demanded there was now a crowd of actors and servants about him helping him up brushing him off fawning the squiggle bink said dismayed it found us again oh so its a friend of yours the lord cried proceeding dramatically from rage to rage i should have known it shall be the first to be cursed and he pointed one finger shaking with emotion at the pile all together now aone atwo athree everyone linked hands and concentrated at the count of three the curse came forth like a bolt of lightning from the lords finger ball ughtning it formed into a glowing mass the size of a fist and drifted down to touch the dirt at contact it explodedor imploded there was a flash of darkness and a momentary acrid odor then the air cleared and there was nothing no dun no squiggle no flooring in that region the lord glanced at the hole with satisfaction thats one squiggle that will never bother us again he said now for you halfman he raised his terrible finger to point at chester aone atwo bink dived across knocking the mans arm aside the curse spun off and smashed into a column there was another implosion of darkness and a chunk of the column dissolved into nothingness now see what youve done the lord cried becoming if possible even more angry than before bink could not protest probably his talent had been responsible for the seemingly random shot the curse had to destroy something after all bink himself would be immunebut not chester lets get out of here bink said give me a ride out of range of those curses chester about to draw his sword reconsidered in midmotion thats righti can take care of myself but youre just a man come on bink scrambled to straddle the centaurs back and they leaped away just as the lord was leveling another curse chester galloped down the hall his feet oddly silent because of the hoofpads the fiends set up a howl of pursuit which way is out bink cried how should i know thats birdbeaks department im only a former guest of the fiends good old chester all prickle and performance were somewhere upstairs bink said except they dont use stairs we could break out a window and swim he reached into his pocket feeling the bottle that contained crombie grundy and the magician he fumbled until he found the one containing the waterbreathingspell pills couldnt afford a mistake now wed better take new pills its been over two hours they gulped their pills on the run now they were ready for the waterif they could find it they had left the pursuit behind for the moment no man on foot could match the speed of a centaur bink had a second thought we dont want to go outwe want to go down into the nether region to the source of magic where they tried to scare us away from chester agreed he spun about as neatly as he had when dodging exploding pineapples his two front leet down so that fore and hind sections rotated about the axis then he cantered back the way they had come hold up bink screamed this is suicidal we dont even know where the entrance to the vortex is the vortex has to be in the center of the castle matter of architectural stability chester said besides which i have a fair directional sense of my own i know roughly where it is from here i am prepared to make my own entrance bink tended to forget that behind the brutal facade lay a fine centaur mind chester knew what he was doing they rounded a cornerand plowed into the charging fiends people went tumbling every which waybut a massive curse rose up from the jumble and sailed after chester bhik glancing nervously back spied it chesterrun he cried theres a curse on your tail on my tail chester cried indignantly and leaped forward he didnt mind threats to his homely face but his beautiful behind was sacred the curse oriented on its target pursued with determination this one we cant avoid bulk said its locked onto us as the other was locked onto the ogre should we swear off crunching bones i never was much for human bones anyway i think the vortex is ahead chester said hang onim going in he leapeddirectly at a blank wooden panel the wood shattered under the impact of his forehooves and the two of them crashed directly into the vortex bulks last thought as the awful swirl engulfed him hauling him brutally around and around and down and down providing one terrifying glimpse of its dark center shaft was what would happen to the curse that followed them then he spiraled into oblivion chapter precious nymph b i ink woke naked and battered but not cold he lay strewn on the edge of a warm glowing lake hastily he dragged his feet out of the water fearful of predators he heard a groan a little farther along lay the centaur limbs projecting in six directions it had been an extremely violent descent had they not had that waterbreathing magic they would surely have drowned bink scrambled to his feet and lumbered toward his friend chester are youv he paused midway between them he spied the sparkle of a star or jewel foolishly he paused to pick it up he had no use for such a bauble but it turned out to be only a shard of glass chester groaned again and lifted his head takes more than a mere vortex to put away a centaur he said but maybe not much more bink completed the distance between them and tried to help his friend rise hey are you trying to cut me chester demanded oops sorry i picked up this fragment of bink paused again looking at it theres something in it that is chester got to his feet let me see that he reached down to take the fragment his eyes rounded in surprise thats humfreyl what bink thought he had misheard its hard to see in this dim glow but its him all light this must be a piece of the magic mirror thrown ashore by coincidence what happened to the good magician i lost the bottlel bink exclaimed with horror it was in my pocket his hand slapped his flesh where his pocket had been he had the mirror with him how did even one fragment of it get out of the bottle unless unless the bottle was smashed bink finished in which case in which case they were released but whereand hi what condition they didnt have the waterbreathing pills if they got out just when that curse caught up chester looked closely at the fragment of glass humfrey seems to be welland i see the griffin behind him i think theyre still inside the bottle though bulk looked they are i see the curving glass walls and the upholstery it has been shaken up some but the bottle never broke he was relieved a broken bottle might well have meant the end of his friends and they have another fragment of glassl he raised his hand hi a wave hi folks silently humfrey waved back he sees us in his fragment chester exclaimed but thats impossible because the broken mirror is out here anything is possible with magic bink said it was a cliche truism but right now he had his doubts look at the shambles in there chester said that bottle must have been bounced against a wall and the mirror broke and a piece of it flew out here bink said uncertainly right where we could find it thats quite a coincidence even if we can believe the possibility what else can we believe chester demanded bink could not argue his talent operated through seeming coincidence it must have had a part in this but wouldnt it have been easier to have the magicians bottle itself float to shore here instead of one piece of glass we can see them but not hear them maybe if we print a message but they had nothing to do that with if we can find the bottle we can let them out chester pointed out he seemed to be feeling better physically yes bink held the fragment close to his face and mouthed elaborately where are you humfrey spread his hands he pointed to the bottle wall outside it turbulent water swirled its phosphorescence making streaky linepatterns the bottle was somewhere in a river being carried along by the currentwhere i guess that mirror isnt much use chester said crombie could locate usbut cant get to us we might get to the bottlebut cant find it well have to follow the river down bink said it must start at the vortex pool here hi this lake and dribble on to wherever it goes yet if we follow it we delay our quest for the source of magic chester finished that made bink pause the quest will have to wait he decided we have to save our friends i suppose so the centaur agreed even that arrogant griffin do you really dislike crombie well hes a scrapper like me cant blame him for that i suppose but id like to try his strength once just for the record male competition well bink understood that for he experienced it himself at times but there were more important matters now im thirsty bink said he walked back to the lake shore have you noticed chester remarked that there is no life in this lake no fish no monsters no plants no beach creatures no life bink repeated bat were all right so we havent drunk from it yet or if we did it was from the fresh water of the vortex when we were on the pill thats true bink said uncomfortably i wonder whether the cork loosened in humfreys bottle and he got a sample of this water and hauled the cork back in place right after the mirror broke could be bink agreed wed best not gamble well need food soon too wed better check around we cant rescue the magician if we dont take care of ourselves right chester agreed and the first thing to do i is is to find my clothes sink finished i they were farther along the shore complete with bints sword as luck would have it but as luck would also have it the bottle was not with them chester had retained his weapons and rope so was in good shape they moved on through the cavern passages leaving the suspicious river behind their eyes acclimatising to the dimming subterranean reaches bink hoped they would not encounter nickelpedes here but was careful not to voice this wish no sense alarming chester they tried to mark their way by scratching xs in the floor every so often but bink wasnt sure how effective this would be time passed and the way was interminableespecially since they did not know where they were going binks thirst had been casual at first but now that he knew there was no water it became more press ing how long could they go on before abruptly they saw lightreal light not the mere passage glow they hurried cautiously up to itand discovered a magic lantern suspended from a jag of stone its soft effulgence was a welcome sightbut there was nothing else peopleor goblins bink asked nervous and hopeful chester took it down and studied it looks like fairywork to me he said goblins dont really need light and hi any event this is too delicately wrought even fairies arent necessarily friendly bink said i still it seems a better risk than starving here alone they took the lamp and went on with slightly improved prospects but nothing further developed apparently someone or something had lit a lamp left it and departed strange weary dirty hungry and unpleasantly thirsty they parked at last on a boulder we have to find food or at least water bink said trying to make it seem casual there doesnt seem to be any on this main passage but he paused listening is that chester cocked his head yes i think it is water dripping you know i havent wanted to say anything but my tongue has been drying up hi my mouth if we could behind this wall i think maybe if we stand clear the centaur faced about so that his better half addressed the wall in question then he kicked a section of the wall collapsed now the sound was louder water flowing over stone let me climb in there bink said if i can collect a cupful just in case chester said taking his coil of rope and looping it about bulks waist we dont know what to expect in these dark chambers if you fall in a hole haul you out yes bink agreed let me take the magic lantern he scrambled into the hole once he got by the nibble he found himself hi a larger irregular cavern whose floor slanted down into darkness the sound of water was coming from that darkness he moved forward careful of his footing trailing the line behind him the water sound became temptingly loud bink traced it to a crevice in the floor he held his lantern over it now at last he saw the glint of a streamlet he reached down with his fingers and just as his shoulder nudged the crevice lip his fingers touched the water how could he draw any up after a moments thought he ripped a piece of cloth from his already tattered sleeve and dangled that down into the water he let it soak up what liquid it cared to then brought it to the surface while he was doing this he heard a distant singing he stiffened with alarm were the lake fiends coming here no that seemed highly unlikely they were water dwellers not rock dwellers and by the lord of the manors own admission they knew nothing of this nether region this had to be some creature of the caves perhaps the owner of the magic lantern by the time he brought the dripping rag to his mouth the singing was quite dose there was the scent of fresh flowers bink put the dangling end of the rag in his mouth and squeezed cool clear liquid dripped down it was the best water he had ever tasted then something strange happened bink experienced a surge of dizzinessnot sickening but wonderfully pleasant he felt alive vibrant and full of the warmth of human spirit that was good water indeed he dipped his rag into the crevice again soaking it for chester this was an inefficient way to drink but a great deal better than nothing while he lay there he heard the singing again it was a nymph of imperfect voice but sounding young and sweet and joyful a pleasant shiver went through him bulk brought up the rag and laid it on the cave floor he took up the light and moved toward the voice it came from a section beyond the water and soon bink came to the end of his tether he untied the rope let it drop from his waist and went on now he spied a beam of light emanating from another crack the singer was in the chamber beyond bink knelt and put his eye to the crack silently she was sitting on a stool fashioned of silver sorting through a barrel filled with precious stones their colors reflected brilliantly decorating all the walls of the room she was a typical nymph long and bare of leg with a tiny skirt just about covering a pert derriere slender of waist full of bosom and innocent and largeeyed of face her hair sparkled like the keg of jewels he had seen nymphs like this many times each had her association with tree or rock or stream or lake or mountain yet they were all so uniform in face and feature that their beauty became commonplace it was as if some magician had established the ideal femalehuman aspect and scattered it about the land of xanth for decoration attaching individual units to particular locales so that the distribution would be uniform so she was nothing special the precious stones in contrast were a phenomenal treasure yet bhik glanced only passingly at the stones his gaze became fixed on the nymph shehe feltit was rapt adoration what am i doing he demanded of himself with chester waiting for a drink bink had no business here and for answer he only sighed longingly the nymph overheard she glanced up alertly breaking off her innocent melody but could not see him perplexed she shook her maiden tresses and returned to her work evidently deciding that she had imagined it no i am herel bink cried surprising himself behind the wall she screamed a cute little scream jumped up and fled the keg overturned dumping jewels across the floor wait dont run bink cried he smashed his fist into the wall with such force the stone cracked he wrenched out more fragments widening the hole then jumped down into the room he almost slipped on some pearls but did a little dance and got his balance now he stood still and listened there was a strange smell reminiscent of the breath of an attacking dragon one just behind a person and gaining bink looked about nervously but there was no dragon all was silent why didnt he hear her still running in a moment he had it figured she might flee in alarm but she would hardly leave her treasure unguarded obviously she had dodged around a corner and now was watching him from hiding please miss bink called i mean no harm to you i only want to to hug you to kiss you to shocked he halted his thoughts in midtrain he was a married man what was he doing chasing a strange nymph he should get back to chester take the centaur his ragful of water again he paused in his thoughts oh no yet he could hardly doubt his sudden emotion he had imbibed from a spring and become enamored of the first maiden he had seen thereafter it must have been a love spring but why had his talent let him drink it the answer was distressingly obvious he wished he hadnt thought of the question his talent had no regard for his feelings or those of others it protected only his physical personal welfare it must have decided that his wife chameleon represented some kind of threat to his welfare so it was finding him another love it had not been satisfied with separating him from chameleon temporarily now it intended to make that separation permanent i will not have it he cried aloud i love chameleon and that was true love potions did not undo existing relations but now he also loved this nymphand she was a great deal more accessible was he at war with his own talent he had ethics it evidently did not he was civilized while it was primitive who was to be the master here he fought but could not undo the effect of the love spring had he anticipated what his talent was leading him into he might have balked it before he drank but now he was the victim of a fait accompli well he would settle with his talent when he found a better occasion all was fair hi magic nymph come here and tell me your name or ill steal all your treasure he yelled when she did not respond he righted the keg and began scooping up gems there was an amazing assortment diamonds pearls opals emeralds sapphires and too many others to classify how had the nymph come by such a fortune now the nymph appeared peeking around a curve in the tunnel coincidentally bulk smelled the fleeting scent of woodland flowers but i need that treasure she protested buik continued his work the stones sailed into the barrel what is your name he demanded whats yours there was an odor like that of a hesitant deerfly at the edge of a glade i asked you first all he wanted to do was keep her in conversation until he could catch her but youre the stranger she pointed out with female logic ah welt he liked her logic he knew it was the effect of the potion but he was captive to her mannerisms my name is bink i am jewel she said the nymph of jewels if you insist on the whole definition now give me back my stones ill be glad to jewel for a kiss what kind of a nymph do you think i am she protested in typical nymphly fashion now there was the odor of pineoil disinfectant i hope to find out tell me about yourself she edged farther into the room distrusting him tm just a rock nymph i see that all the precious stones get properly planted in the ground so that goblins dragons men and other voracious creatures can mine them bink smelled the mixed fumes of hardlaboring men and goblins its all very important because otherwise those creatures would be even wilder than they are the mining gives them something to do so that was how the jewels got planted bink had always wondered about that or would have wondered had he thought about it but where do you get them to start with oh they just appear by magic of course the keg never empties it doesnt see it is already overflowing with the gems you are trying to put back you arent supposed to put them back bink looked surprised it was so he had assumed the keg was empty without really checking it because his main attention had been on the nymph how am i ever going to process all those extra stones she demanded with cute petulance usually it takes an hour to place each one and you have spilled hundreds she stamped her sweet little foot not knowing how to express her annoyance effectively nymphs had been designed for appearance not emotion me you spilled them when you ran bink retorted im trying to pick them up well its your fault because you scared me what were you doing behind the wall no ones supposed to go there thats why its walled off the water she paused with new alarm you didnt i did bink said i was thirsty and she screamed again and fled again nymphs by nature were flighty bulk continued his gathering ar ranging the surplus jewels in a pile beside the keg knowing she would be back he hated himself somewhat knowing he should leave her alone but found himself unable to stop himself and he did owe it to her to clean up this mess as well as he could though the pile was getting unwieldy jewel peeked back around the corner if youd just go away and let me catch up not until ive finished cleaning up this overflow bink said as you pointed out it is my fault he placed a huge eggshaped opal on top of bis mound and watched the whole thing subside squirting out diamonds and things he was getting nowhere she edged in closer no youre right i spilled it ill catch up somehow you justjust leave please the sneezy tang of dust tickled his nose as if a herd of centaurs had just charged along a dry road in midsummer your magic talent bink exclaimed smells well i never she said modestly affronted now the dustodor was tinged by the fumes of burning oil i mean you can makeyou smell like what you feel oh that the oil merged into perfume yes whats your talent i cant tell you but i just told you mine its only fair she edged within range bink grabbed her she screamed again most fetcbingly and struggled without much strength that too was the way nymphs were delightfully and ineffectively difficult he drew her in for a firm kiss on the lips she was a most pleasant armful and her lips tasted like honey at least they smelled like it that wasnt very nice she rebuked him when he ended the kiss but she didnt seem very angry her odor was of freshly overturned earth i love you bulk said come with me i cant go with you she said smelling of freshly cut grass i have my job to do and i have mine bink said whats your job im on a quest for the source of magic but thats way down in the center of the world or somewhere she said you cant travel that way there are dragons and goblins and rats were used to them bink said im not used to them im afraid of the dark i couldnt go there even if even if she wanted to because of course she did not love him she had not drunk the lovewater bink had a naughty idea come and take a drink with me then we cann she struggled to disengage and he let her go the last thing he wanted to do was hurt her no i couldnt afford love i must plant all these jewels but what am i to do from the moment i saw you youll just have to take the antidote she said smelling of a newly lit candle bink recognized the connection the candle symbolized her bright idea there is an antidote he hadnt thought of that there must be for every spell theres an equal and opposite counterspell somewhere all you have to do is find it mi know who can find it bink said my friend crombie you have friends she asked surprised smelling of startled birds of course i have friends down here i meant i thought you were alone no i was looking for water for me and chester wem chester i thought your friend was crombie chester centaur crombie is a griffin and theres magician humfrey and a magician she exclaimed impressed all to look for the source of magic yes the king wants to know theres a king along too no bink said momentarily exasperated the king assigned me to make the quest but we had some trouble and got separated and i suppose rd better show you where theres water she decided and foodyou must be hungry too yes he said reaching for her well be glad to do some service in return oh no she cried skipping away with an enticing bounce of anatomy and the scent of hickory smoke not until you drink the antidote just so i really must get back to chester bink said hell be worried she considered for a moment bink im sorry about what happened fetch your friends and ill see they get fed then you really must go yes bink walked slowly to the hole in the wall not that way she cried go round by the regular passages but i dont know the way i have no light i have to follow the rope back definitely not she took her own magic lantern a twin of the one bink had found before from the wall and grasped binks arm firmly i know all the halls around here ill find him for you bink willingly suffered himself to be led even apart from the potion he was discerning commendable traits in her she was not one of the emptyheaded nymphs like those associated with ocean foam or wild oats she had a sense of purpose and fitness and decency no doubt her responsible job of jewelplacing had matured her still potion or not he had no business with this creature once his friends were fed he would have to leave her he wondered how long it would take the potion to wear oft some spells were temporary but others were lifelong they circled through intersecting passages in a moment they came upon chester still waiting by the hole here we are bink called chester jumped so that all four hooves were off the floor bink he exclamied as he landed what happened who is that nymph chester this is jewel jewelchester bink introduced i he hesitated he drank a love potion jewel said brightly the centaur made a motion as of tearing out two fistfuls of mane the secret enemy strikes again bink hadnt thought of that of course that was the most reasonable explanation his talent hadnt be trayed him but it hadnt protected him from this non physical threat either thus his enemy had scored how could he pursue the source of magic when his heart was tied up here but his heart was also tied up back home with chameleon that was part of the reason he was on this quest sohe had better just get on with it if we can get back together with crombie and the magician maybe crombie can point out the location of the antidote bulk said where are your friends jewel asked they re in a bottle bink explained but we can communicate with them through a fragment of magic mirror here introduce you to them he fumbled in his pocket for the bit of glass his fingers found nothing oh notve lost the fragment he turned the pocket inside out there was a hole in it where the sharp edge of glass had sawed its way out well well find them somehow bink said numbly we wont give up until we do that would seem best chester agreed gravely however well have to take the nymph along with us why bink had mixed emotions the object of the counterspell has to be present thats the way these things work you loved the first female you encountered after imbibing the potion you must unlove her in the same fashion i cant come with you jewel protested though she looked at chester as if wishing for a ride on his back i have a lot of work to do how much will you get done if bink stays herechester inquired she threw up her hands in feminine exasperation come to my apartment both of you well discuss it jater jewels apartment was as attractive as herself she had a cluster of caves completely carpeted the carpetmoss ran across the floor up over the walls and across the ceiling without a break except for the round doors it was extremely cosy she had no chairs table or bed it seemed she sat or lay down anywhere anytime in perfect comfort well have to do something about those clothes she said to bink bink looked down at himself his clothing had more or less dried on him after its soaking in the vortex and lake it glowed in uneven patches but these are all i have he said regretfully you can dryclean them she said go into the lavatory and put them in the cleaner it only takes a moment bink entered the room she indicated and closed the curtain he located the cleaner an ovenlike alcove through which a warm current of ah passed his tunic and shorts he set them within this then moved over to the basin where a rivulet of water ran through above it was a polished rock surface a mirror the vanity of the distaff always required a mirror seeing himself reflected was a shock he was more bedraggled than his clothes his hair was tangled and plastered over his forehead and he had a beard just at the ugly starting stage cavedirt was smeared over portions of his face and body from his crawl through the wall he looked like a juvenile ogre no wonder the nymph had been afraid of him at first he used the keen blade of his sword to shave his face since there was no magic shaving brush here to brush his whiskers away conveniently then he rinsed and combed his hair he found his clothing dry and clean and pressed obviously more than hot air was at work his torn sleeve had been neatly hemmed so that the absence of cloth looked intentional he wondered if some magic dust circulated in these caves augmenting the function of such things as dry cleaners the nymph seemed to have many magical conveniences and quite a comfort able lifestyle it would not be hard to adapt to such a style he shook his head that was the love potion speaking not his common sense he had to be on guard against rationalization he did not belong down here and he would have to leave when his mission was done though he leave part of his heart behind nevertheless he dressed himself neatly even giv ing his boots a turn at the cleaner too bad the magicians bottle couldnt have washed ashore instead of his footwear when he emerged from the lavatory jewel looked him over with surprised admiration you are a handsome man chester smiled wryly i suppose it was hard to tell before would that i could wash my face and suffer a similar transformation they all laughed somewhat ill at ease we must pay for your hospitalityand for your help chester said when the laugh subsided fitfully my hospitality i give freely pay would demean it jewel said my help you seem to be coopting there is no pay for slave labor no jewel bink cried cut to the heart of his emotion i would not force anything on you or cause you grief she softened i know it bink you drank of the lovewater you would not hurt me yet since i must help you find your friends so they can find the counterspell and this takes me away from my work then we must help you do your work bink said you can t you dont know the first thing about sorting precious stones or where they should be set and if you did the borer would not work for you the borer my steed beast he phases through the rock to reach where i must set the stones i alone can control himand then only when i sing he works for a song nothing else bulk exchanged glances with chester after we eat we will show you our music chester said jewels meal was strange but excellent she served an assortment of mushrooms and fungusthings that grew magically she explained without the need of fight some tasted like dragon steak and some like potato chips chipped from a hot potato tree and dessert was very like chocolate pie fresh from the brown cow so round and soft and pungent it practically flowed off the plate she also had a kind of chalky powder she mixed with the water to produce excellent milk you know chester murmured aside to bink you could have found a worse nymph to encounter after your draught sink didnt answer after the magic drink he would have loved a harpy it wouldnt have mattered how foul she was the love potion was absolutely heedless of its consequence magic without conscience indeed as he had learned to his horror the history of xanth had been influenced by just such love springs the original mundane species had intermated producing crossbreeds like the chimeras harpies griffins and centaurs who was to say this was wrong where would the land of xanth be now without the noble centaurs yet binks own drink of this water was supremely inconvenient in a personal way rationally he had to stay with his wile chameleon but emotionally chester finished his repast he concentrated and the silver flute appeared it played rapturously jewel sat frozen listening to the silvery melody then she began to sing in harmony with it her voice could not approach the purity of the flute but it complemented the instrument nicely bink was entrancedand would have been he told himself regardless of the potion something grotesque poked into the room chesters flute cut off in midnote and his sword appeared in his hand stay your hand centaur jewel cried that is my borer chester did not attack but his sword remained ready it looks like a giant worm yes she agreed hes related to the wiggles and squiggles but hes much larger and slower hes a digglenot very bright but invaluable for my work chester decided it was all right i thought i had seen everything in the lexicon but i missed this one lets see whether we can help you work if he likes my music and you have any stones to place near the river are you kidding jewel asked in her nymphly idiom with half the keg spilled i have dozens of stones for the river might as well start there under her direction they boarded the diggle jewel bestrode the monster worm near its front end a basket of precious stones held before her bink sat next and chester last his four feet somewhat awkward in this situation he was used to being ridden not to riding though he had done it before with the dragon now we make music jewel said he will work as long as he likes the sound and he doesnt require much variation after a few hours i get tired and nave to stop but if the centaurs flute the flute appeared it played the great worm crawled forward carrying them along as if they were mere files it did not scramble or flex as the dragon did it elongated and contracted its body in stages so that the sections they rode were constantly changing in diameter it was a strange mode of travel but an effective one this was a very large worm and it traveled swiftly a flange flexed out from the diggles front segment and as he tunneled into the rock the flange extended the diameter of the phasetunnel so that the riders could fit through also it occurred to bink that this was a variant of the type of magic in the good magicians i waterbreathing pills the rock like the water was not being tunneled through so much as it was being temporarily changed so that they could pass through it without making a hole chester had to duck his head to stay within the phase and his flute was crowded but it kept playing its captivating melodies bink was sure chester was more than happy to have this pretext to practice his newly discovered talent after a lifetime of suppression i have to admit this is a worthwhile service the nymph said i always thought centaurs had no magic the centaurs thought so too bink said covertly admiring her form from behind to hell with the love potion she had a shape to conjure with then the worm lurched striking a different type of rock and bink was thrown forward against the nymph uh sorry he said righting himself though indeed he was not very sorry i uh yes i know jewel said maybe youd better put your arms about my waist to steady yourself it does get bumpy on occasion i think id better not bink said youre sort of noble in your fashion she observed a girl could get to like you iim married bink said miserably ii need that antidote yes of course she agreed suddenly the diggle emerged through a wall into a large chamber the river chester observed when he spoke his flute ceased its playing the worm turned his snout questing for the vanished music dont stop jewel cried he quits when the flute resumed we want to follow the river down bink said if we see a bottle floating hi it first i have to place some stones he said firmly she guided the worm to a projecting formation halted him and held out a fat diamond right inside there she said itll take a million years for the water to wash that into sight the diggle took the stone hi his orifice and carried it into the rock his head tapered into a virtual point with a mouth smaller than a mans so holding the jewel was no problem when his snout emerged the diamond was gone and the formation was whole bink was startled then realized he shouldnt be they had not left any tunnel behind them either one down jewel said briskly nine hundred and ninetynine to go but bulks eyes were on the glowing river looking for the bottle such as the power of the potion he halfhoped he wouldnt find it once they found the magician and then located the antidote he would be out of love with jeweland that was difficult to contemplate he knew what was right but his heart wasnt in it time passed jewel placed diamonds opals emeralds sapphires amethysts jades and many garnets in the rocks along the river and sprinkled pearls in the water for the oysters to find oysters just love pearls she explained they just gobble them up she sang as she worked alternating with chesters flute while bulks attention roved from her to the water and back again he could indeed have encountered a worse subject for the potion to fix on then the river opened out into another lake this is the abode of the demons who are able to drink and use the tainted water jewel cautioned them the demons know me but the two of you will have to obtain a permit to pass through their territory they dont like trespassers bink felt chesters motion behind him as of hand touching bow and sword they had had trouble with fiends they didnt need trouble with demons the cavern walls became carved to resemble stone buildings with squaredofl corners and alleys between very like a city bink had never actually seen a city except in pictures the early settlers of xanth had made cities but with the decline in population these had disappeared bink and chester dismounted and walked beside the worm here on the street soon a magic wagon rolled up it resembled a monsterdrawn coach but lacked the monster the wheels were fat bouncy donuts of rubber and the body seemed to be metal a purring emanated from the interior there was probably a little monster inside pedaling the wheels wheres the fire the demon demanded from the coach he was blue and the top of his head was round and flat like a saucer right here blue steel jewel said clapping one hand to her bosom will you issue a ticket for my friends theyre looking for the source of magic the source of magic another voice exclaimed there were bink now saw two demons in the vehicle the second was of coppery hue thats a matter for the chief all right copper jewel agreed she evidently knew these demons well enough to banter with them bink suffered a sharp green pang of jealousy jewel guided them to a building marked precinct station and parked the worm i must remain with the diggle to sing him a song she said you go in and see the chief i will wait now buik was afraid she would not wait that she would take this opportunity to leave them to betray them to the demons that way she would be safe from pursuit either vengeful or romantic but he had to trust her after all he loved her the demon inside sat at a broad desk poring over a book he glanced up as they entered ah yeswe were fated to meet again he said beauregard bulk exclaimed amazed ill issue the permits of course the demon said you were the specific instrument of my release according to the rules of the game and i feel an undemonly obligation but allow me to entertain yon properly as you entertained me at the ogres domicile there is much you must be advised of before you pursue your quest further uh theres a nymph waiting outside bink said beauregard shook his head you do seem to be jinxed bink first you lose the bottle then your heart but never fear well include the nymph in the party we shall entertain the diggle at our motor pool he will enjoy the swim we know jewel well in fact you could hardly have been more fortunate in your misfortune in due course jewel joined them for supper it was hard to believe that dawn had been at the fringe of the region of madness in a tree and breakfast had been at the lake castle of the fiends lunch with the nymph and supper hereall in the same day down here under the ground day had less meaning still it had been an eventful period the demons meal was similar to the nymphs only it was fashioned from minute magic creatures called yeast and bacteria bink wondered whether there were frontteria too but didnt ask some of the food was like squash which had been squashed only minutes before some resembled roast haunch of mediumlong pig dessert was the frozen eye of a scream bird genuine eye scream was a rare delicacy and so was this yellow flavored imitation i sampled the eye of a smilk once chester said but it was not as good as this you have good taste beauregard said on no centaur eyes have inferior flavor chester said quickly you are too modest but the demon smiled reas suringly screams have more fat than srnilks so their eyes provide more flavor as you recognized after the repast they retired to beauregards den where a tame firedrake blazed merrily now we shall provide you excellent accommodations for the night the demon said we shall not interfere in any way with your quest however what is it you know that we dont bink asked anxiously i know the nature of demons beauregard said oh we dont plan to bother you here were going on to bear with me bink beauregard brought out a fancy little bottle uttered an obscure word and made a mystic gesture the cork popped out vapor issued forth and formed intogood magician humfrey amazed bink could only ask but where is crombie back hi the bottle humfrey said shortly it would help if you recovered your fumble promptly but if beauregard can rescue you i have not rescued him the demon said i have conjured him he must now do my bidding just as you once did his bidding bink said correct it all depends on who is confined and who possesses the controlling magic the magician has dabbled in demonology he is now subject to our humanology but does that mean no i shall not abuse the situation my interest is in research not ironies i merely make this demonstration to convince you that there is more to magic than you may have supposed and that the possible consequences of your quest may be more extensive than you would care to risk i already know something is trying to stop me bulk said yes it is some kind of demonand that is the problem most demons have no more magic than most humans do but the demons of the depths are something else they are to ordinary demons like me as magicians are to ordinary people like you it is not wise to venture into their demesnes youre a demon chester said suspiciously why are you telling us this because hes a good demon jewel said he helps people because i care about the welfare of xanth beauregard said if i were convinced xanth would be better off without people i would work toward that end but though i have had doubt on occasion so far i believe the species of man is a net benefit he looked at the magician even gnomes like him humfrey merely stood there why dont you set him free then bink asked not wholly trusting the demon i can not free him only the holder of his container can do that but here he is you summoned him from your bottle my magic has granted me a temporary lease on his service i can only evoke him briefly and can not keep him if i had his bottle then i could control him since he was so foolish as to confine himself in that manner that is why you must recover that bottle before before it breaks bink said it will never break it is an enchanted bottle i know for i occupied it and made sure it was secure no the danger is that your enemy will recover it first bink was appalled the enemy for then that enemy would control the magician and all humfreys power would be at the enemys service in that event humfreys chances of surviving would be pooralmost as poor as yours i must get that bottle bink cried if only i knew where it is that is the service i require beauregard said magician inform bink of your precise location so he can rescue you latitude twentyeight degrees northwest longitude one hundred and not that way simpleton beauregard interrupted tell it so he can use it er yes humfrey agreed perhaps wed better put crombie on do it the demon snapped the griffin appeared beside the magician say yes bink said eagerly if we have him point out your direction from here i mean our direction from there we can reverse it to reach you wont work beauregard said but crombie was already whirling his wing came to rest pointing directly at bink fine bink said well go that way try walking across the den beauregard said griffin hold that point perplexed bink walked crombie didnt move but his pointing wing continued aiming at bink its just a picture bink explained no matter how you look at it it looks right at you precisely the demon agreed this conjuration is in a certain respect an image the same aspect appears regardless of the orientation of the viewer to orient on the conjuration is useless it is the original we require easily solved demon humfrey snapped crombie point out the direction of our bottle as viewed from the locale of the conjuration how simple the conjuration was here so this would give the proper direction to there but would it work the griffin whirled and pointed again this time the wing aimed away from bink and downward that is the way you must go beauregard said gravely now before i banish the image have you any other questions i do chester said about my talent beauregard smiled very clever centaur i think you have the mind of a demon it is indeed possible in this situation for you to obtain the information you seek without incurring the magicians normal fee if your ethics permit such exploitation no chester said im not trying to cheat magician i know my talent now but ive already served part of the fee and am stuck for the rest humfrey smiled i never specified the question i would answer pick another question for the fee that was part of the agreement say good chester said like a colt with sudden access to the farthest and greenest pasture he pondered briefly cherieid sure like to know her talent if she has one a magical one i mean her and her lessmagicalthanthou attitude she has a talent humfrey said do you wish the answer now no i might figure it out myself again the magician spread his hands as you prefer however we are not insured against accidents of fate if you dont solve it and bink doesnt find my bottle before the enemy does i may be forced to renege do you care to take that risk what do you mean before the enemy does bink demanded how close is the enemy to that is what we were discussing before beauregard said it seems the magician can not be protected from his own informationtalent he is correct that bottle has been carried very close to the region your enemy inhabits and it is very likely that the enemy is aware of that thus this is not a routine search for the bottle but a race against active opposition but what is the nature of the enemy bink demanded begone magician beauregard said humfrey and crombie converted into smoke and swirled into the bottle i can not answer that question directly other than to remind you that the enemy must be some sort of demon therefore i spare myself the embarrassment of confessing my ignorance in the presence of my human counterpart in research professional rivalry you might say i dont care about professional rivalry bink retorted the good magician and crombie are my friends fve got to save them youre loyal jewel said admiringly the thing you must understand beauregard continued is that as you approach the source of magic the magic of the immediate environment becomes stronger in a function resembling a logarithmic progression therefore i dont understand that bulk said what have logs to do with it is the enemy a tree he means the magic gets stronger faster as you get closer chester explained centaurs had excellent mathematical comprehension precisely the demon agreed thus we demons being more proximate to the source tend to be more magical than you creatures at the fringe but in the immediate vicinity of the source the magic is far stronger than we can fathom therefore i can not identify your specific enemy or describe his magic but it is likely that it is stronger magic than you have encountered before ive met pretty strong magic bink said dubiously yes i know and you have extremely strong magic yourself but thiswell though i have never been able to fathom the precise nature of your talent therefore my prior remark about you being an ordinary individual empirical data suggest that it relates to your personal welfare but at the source suddenly i understand bink said where im going the magic is stronger than mine just so thus you will be vulnerable in a manner you have not been before your own magic suffers enhancement as you proceed but only hi a geometric ratio therefore it can not he means the enemy magic gets stronger faster than our magic chester said so were losing power proportionately precisely the demon agreed the nature of the curves suggests that the differential will not become gross until you are extremely close to the source so you may not be much inconvenienced by it or even aware of it still so if i continue bink said slowly th come up against an enemy who is stronger than i am correct because the strength of the magic field of xanth varies inversely with distance on both an individual and environmental basis what about the magic dust chester demanded that does indeed enhance magic in its vicinity beauregard agreed but it is not the major avenue for the distribution of magic the dust is basically convective while most magic is conductive were that village to close down its operations the magic of xanth would continue only slightly abated so they might as well relax bink said to continue because of the inverse ratio the enemy was not able to harm you on the surface though he tried with demonic persistence and cunning which is why i am convinced it is in fact a demon you face but here in the nether region the enemy can and will bring to bear overwhelming magic therefore it is foolish to pursue your quest further im human bink said yes unfortunately a demon would be more rational since you are a foolish human of exactly the type my research paper describes you will continue inevitably to your doomfor the sake of your ideals and friendships i must be more human than demon jewel said i think hes noble dont flatter me bink warned her it only exaggerates the effect of the potion she looked startled then prettily resolute im sorry the potion had toi mean youre such a nice handsome courageous decent man ii cant say im sorry it happened when we get back maybe will take a drink myself but one reason i need the magician is to find the antidote bink pointed out apart from my friendship for him i mean in fact we should have asked crombie to point out the locale of the antidote so i could summon them again beauregard said but i would not advise it why not bink asked because in the event the enemy is not yet aware of the precise location of their bottle we do not wish to call further attention to it we do not know what mechanisms the enemy has to observe you now that its squiggle is gone but we can not afford to assume they are negligible it would be better to rescue your friends first then attend to your more personal business yes that is true bink said he turned to the nymph jewel i regret having to inconvenience you further but my loyalty to my friends comes first i promise as soon as we rescue them thats all right she said seeming not at all displeased she could wait here chester said or go about her normal business once we obtain the antidote we can bring it back and no only the diggle can take you there fast enough jewel said and only i can guide the diggle theres lots of bad magic in the river channel and very little in the solid rock im coming along i hoped you would say that bink said of course my feeling doesnt count since jewel stepped up and kissed him on the mouth i like your honesty too she said lets get going bink momentarily stunned by the potency of this first voluntary kiss forced his mind to focus on the mission yeswe must hurry the goblins are very bad in the deeper reaches beauregard said in recent years they have lost thensavagery on the surface but below they retain it you have not encountered goblins like these it is not a matter of choice bink said we have to go there then stay on welllighted routes when youre not phasing through actual rock like nickelpedes they dont like light they will face it if they have to but generally they avoid it bink turned to the nymph is that why youre afraid of the dark can you keep us in the light she nodded yes yes she agreed to each question bink somehow had the impression that he could have asked somewhat more personal questions and had the same response or was that a flight of romantic fancy spawned by the potion at least get a good nights rest beauregard urged we demons dont need sleep as such but you humans can get very irritable if no wed better move right along bink said a few hours could make the difference so could fatigue beauregard pointed out you will need all your faculties about you when you face the big magic seems to me one demons stalling chester said beauregard spread his hands perhaps i am centaur there is one thing i have not told you if you plan to tell it tell it now bink said because were leaving now it is this the demon said reluctantly i am not at all certain that your quest is proper not properl bink exploded to rescue my friends to seek the source of the magic of xanth all i want is information you of all demons should understand that too well beauregard said information can be the most dangerous thing there is consider the power of your magician who specializes in information suppose he were armed with full knowledge about the ultimate nature of magic where would be the limits of his power then humfrey wouldnt hurt xanth bink protested hes a good magician but once knowledge of the nature of the source of magic were known what would stop an evil magician from obtaining it with the strongest magic of all he could rule xanthor destroy it bink considered he remembered how an evil magician had taken over the crown of xanthand had turned out not to be evil at all but that had been a special situation suppose a truly evil manor woman obtained unconscionable power i see your point til think about it maybe i wont go all the way to the source but i must rescue the magician regardless yes of course beauregard agreed seeming ill at ease for a demon they boarded the diggle and moved out following the direction crombie had indicated i dont know the deeper depths so well jewel said but theres a whole lot of solid rock here since were not following so close to the river ill tell the diggle to stay within the rock until we get there and only to come out where there is light i think you could sleep some while we travel while i sing the worm along you are beautiful bink said gratefully he leaned his head against her back and was lulled to sleep by her singing amplified and sweetened by his contact with her and the worm ground on chapter brain coral omk woke with a start as the diggle halted i think were here jewel murmured her voice was hoarse from hours of singing you should have waked me before bink said to take my turn singing the worm along youve sung yourself out your head was so nice on my shoulder i couldnt disturb you she rasped besides youll need all your strength i can feel the magic intensifying as we move along bink felt it too a subtle prickle on his skin like that of the magic dust for all he knew the rock through which they traveled might be the magicdust rock before it welled to the surface but the mystery remained what was it that imbued that rock with magic uh thanks he said awkwardly youre a sweet nymph well she turned her head making it easy to kiss she smelled of especially fine roses this magic too was enhanced by the environment bulk leaned forward inhaling the delicious fragrance bringing his lips close to they were interrupted by the sight of the bottle it bobbled on the glowing surface of another lake something was attached to it a bit of string or tar grundy bink cried the golem looked up about time you got here fetch in this bottle before is it safe to swim in this lake bink asked wary of the glow it might keep the goblins away but that didnt make it safe for people no jewel said the water is slowly poisonous to most forms of life one drink wont hurt much if you get out of it soon up at the headwaters where it is diluted by the fresh flow from the surface but down here where it has absorbed much more horrible magic right no swimming bink said chester can you lasso it out of range the centaur said if the eddy currents carry it closer to shore i can snag it readily enough better hurry grundy called theres something under the lake and it the fiends lived under a lake chester said do you think the enemy bink started stripping of his clothing i think id better swim out and get that bottle right now if the lake harms me the magician can give me a drop of his healing elixir that should be more potent too here dont do that jewel cried that lakei dont think youd ever reach the bottle here ill have the diggle phase through the water nothing hurts him when hes in phase at her direction and hoarse singing the worm slid into the water erecting its circular flange to form a temporary tunnel through the liquid as through rock he moved very slowly until chesters flute appeared and played a brisk beautiful marching tune the flute seemed larger and brighter than it had before and its sound was louder more magical enhancement the diggle speeded up expanding and contracting in time to die music he advanced purposefully toward the bottle oh thank you centaur jewel whispered hurry hurry the golem called the coral is aware of theis trying toishelp its coming up to get me then grundy screamed horribly as if in human pain im not real enough yet he gasped after the scream had torn its way out of his system im still j st a golem just a thing string and gum i can be bntrolled i m he broke off then screamed again then resumed fttore quietly im gone bink understood none of this yet had the sinking feeling that he should somehow have tried to help the golem to fight offwhat some encouragement some reminder of the feelings grundy evidently did have maybe the golem could have fought off his private personal horror if now the worm was almost at the bottle quickly grundy wrapped his stringarms about the cork braced his feet against the neck of the bottle and heaved by the power of the brain coral emerge he gasped the cork flew out smoke poured from the bottle swirled into a whirlwind ballooned then coalesced into the figures of the good magician and the griffin grundy rescued them chester exclaimed as his flute faded out fly to shore bink cried dont touch the water humfrey caught hold of crombie who spread his wings and bore them both up for a moment they tilted unsteadily then righted and moved smoothly forward bink ran up as they landed at the shore we were so worried about you afraid the enemy would get you first the enemy did humfrey said reaching for a vial as he let go of the griffin turn about bink desist your quest and you will not be harmed desist my quest bink cried amazed right when im so close to accomplishing it you know i wont do that i serve a new master but my scruples remain humfrey said there was something sinister about him now he remained a small gnomish man but now there was no humor in that characterization his gaze was more like that of a basilisk than that of a man a cold deadly stare it is necessary that you understand the bottle was opened by the agency of the entity that lies beneath this lake a creature of tremendous intelligence and magic and conscience but lacking the ability to move this is the brain coral who has to operate through other agencies to accomplish its noble purpose theenemy bink asked dismayed the one who sent the magic sword and the dragon and the squiggle and countless other obstructions most of which your own magic foiled before they manifested the coral can not control a conscious intelligent living entity it must operate through thought suggestions that seem like the creatures own notions that was why the dragon chased you and the squiggle spied on you and why the other seemingly coincidental complications occurred but your talent brought you through almost unscathed the siren lured you but the gorgon did not enchant you into stone the midas fly was diverted to another target the curse of the fiends missed you now at the heart of the corals magic you are finally balked you must turn back because but it can not control you bink protested you are a man an intelligent man a magician it assumed control of the golem possible only because grundys reality was not complete and this is the region of the corals greatest power it caused the golem to open the bottle crombie and i are subject to the holder of the bottle it does not matter that the bottle is now floating on the surface of the coral lake the conjuration was done in the name of the brain coral and it is binding butm bink protested unable to continue because he could not formulate his thought that was the most savage engagement of this campaign humfrey continued the struggle for possession of the bottle the coral managed to dislodge it from your clothing but your magic caused the cork to work loose and we started to emerge that was the impact of the fiends curse aiding you by what seemed like an incredible coincidence it shook the bottle within the vortex but the coral used a strong eddy current to jam the stopper back trapping grundy outside but your magic made the magic mirror get caught halfway shattering it with fragments inside and out enabling us to establish communication of a ort then the corals magic caused you to lose your ragment of glass but your magic guided you to leauregard who reestablished communication you lery nearly reached the bottle in time by turning the liability of your infatuation for the nymph into an assetyour talent outmaneuvered the coral neatly therebut here the corals magic is stronger than yours and so it got the bottle first barely in effect your two talents have canceled out but now the coral through the power of the bottle controls crombie and me all our powers are at its service and you have lost chester stood beside bink so you have become the enemy he said slowly not really now that we have access to the corals perspective we know that it is on the side of reason bink your quest is dangerous not merely for you but for all the land of xanth you must desist believe me i do not believe you bink said grimly not now not now that youve changed sides same here chester said conjure yourself back into the bottle and let us rescue the bottle and release you in our power then if you can repeat that statement til listen no that is what i thought chester said i undertook this mission as a service to you magician but i have never collected my answer from you i can quit your service anytime i want but i shall not renounce this quest merely because some hidden monster has scared you into changing your mind your position is comprehensible humfrey said with surprising mildness i do not as you point out have any present call on your service but i am obliged to advise you both that if we can not prevail upon your reason we must oppose you materially you mean you would actually fight us bink asked incredulously we do not wish to resort to force humfrey said but it is imperative that you desist go now give up your quest and all will be well and if we dont quit chester demanded belligerently eyeing crombie obviously the centaur would not be entirely loath to match his prowess against that of the griffin there had been a kind of rivalry between them all along in that case we should have to nullify you humfrey said gravely small he was but he remained a magician and his statement sent an ugly chill through bink nobody could afford to take lightly the threat of a magician bink was torn between unkind alternatives how could he fight his friends the very ones he had struggled so hard to rescue yet if they were under the spell of the enemy how could he afford to yield to their demand if only he could get at the brain coral the enemy and destroy it then his friends would be freed from its baleful influence but the coral was deep under the poison water unreachable unless jewel he cried send the diggle down to make holes through the coral i cant bink she said sadly the diggle never came back after we sent it after the bottle im stuck here with my bucket of gems she flipped a diamond angrily into the water i cant even plant them properly now the worm has been sent away humfrey said only the completion of your quest can destroy the coral along with all the land of xanth depart now or suffer the consequence bink glanced at chester i dont want to hurt him maybe if i can knock him out get him out of range of the coral while i take care of birdbeak chester said nominally regretful i dont want bloodshed bink cried these are our friends whom we must rescue i suppose so chester agreed reluctantly ill try to immobilize the griffin without hurting him too much maybe ill just pull out a few of his feathers bink realized that this was as much of a compromise as chester was prepared to make very well but stop the moment he yields now he faced humfrey again i intend to pursue my quest i ask you to depart and to refrain from trying to interfere it grieves me even to contemplate strife between us but humfrey rummaged in his belt of vials he brought one outhuhuh bink cried striding across yet his out huhmz horror at practicing any kind of violence against his friends held him back and he got there too late the cork came out and the vapor issued it formed into a green poncho which flapped about in the air before settling to the floor wrong bottle the magician muttered and uncorked another bink momentarily frozen realized that he could not subdue the magician until he separated the man from his arsenal of vials binks talent might have helped humfrey to confuse the bottles but that sort of error could not be counted on after the first time bink drew his sword intending to slice the belt from the good magicians waistbut realized that this seemed like a murderous attack again he hesitatedand was brought up short by the coalescing vapor suddenly thirteen black cats faced him spitting viciously bink had never seen a pure cat before hi the flesh he regarded the cat as an extinct species he just stood there and stared at this abrupt deextinction unable to formulate a durable opinion if he killed these animals would he be reextincting the species meanwhile the centaur joined battle with the griffin then encounter was savage from the outset despite chesters promises his bow was in his hands and an arrow sizzled through the air but crombie an experienced soldier did not wait for it to arrive he leaped and spread his wings then closed them with a great backblast of air he shot upward at an angle the arrow passing beneath his tail feathers then he banked near the cavern ceiling and plummeted toward the centaur screaming claws outstretched chesters bow was instantly replaced by his rope he swung up a loop that closed about the griffins torso drawing the wings closed he jerked and crombie was swung about in a quartercircle the centaur was about three times as massive as his opponent so was able to control him this way a black cat leaped at sinks face forcing him to pay attention to his own battle reflexively he brought his sword aroundand sliced the animal cleanly in half bink froze again in horror he had not meant to kill it a rare creature like this maybe these cats were all that remained in the whole land of xanth being preserved only by the magicians magic then two things changed his attitude first the severed halves of the cat he had struck did not die they metamorphosed into smaller cats this was not a real cat but a pseudocat shaped from lifeclay and given a feline imperative any part of it became another cat had a dog been shaped from the same material it would have fractured into more dogs so bink hardly needed to worry about preservation of that species second another cat was biting him on the ankle in a sudden fury of relief and ire bink laid about him with his blade he sliced cats in halves quarters and eighths and every segment became a smaller feline attacking him with renewed ferocity this was like fighting the hydra only this time he had no spellreversal wood to feed it and there was no thread to make it drop soon he had a hundred tiny cats pouncing on him like rats and then a thousand attacking like nickelpedes the more he fought the worse it got was this magic related to that of the hydra that monster had been typified by seven while the cats were thirteen but each doubled with each strike against a member if there were some key some counterspell to abolish doubling magic get smart bink chester called stomping on several cats that had wandered into his territory sweep them all into the drink of course bink stooped low and swung the flat of his sword sidewise sweeping dozens of thumbnailsized cats into the lake they hissed as they splashed like so many hot pebbles and then thrashed to the bottom whether they were drowning or being poisoned he could not tell but none emerged while he swept his way to victory bink absorbed the continuing centaurgriffin engagement he could not observe everything but was able to bridge the gaps well enough he had to keep track because if anyflung happened to chester bink would have another enemy to face j crombie initially incapacitated by the rope bent his head down and sheared his bond cleanly with one crunch of his sharp beak he spread his wings explosively made a defiant squawk and launched a threepoint charge at chesters head beak claw and talon the centaur thrown off balance by the abrupt slackening of the rope staggered he had better stability than a man but he had been hauling hard his equine shoulder thudded against a stalagmite and broke it off as the griffin made contact bink wincedbut as it turned out the stalagmite was more of a problem to crombie than to chester the pointed top fell across the griffins left wing weighing it down forcing crombie to flap his other wing vigorously to right himself chester rose up one talon slash down the side of his face where the griffins strike had missed his eye but his two great hands now grasped the griffins two front legs got you now birdie he cried but in this position he could not use his sword so he tried to bash the griffin against the broken base of the stalagmite crombie squawked and brought his hind legs up for a double slash that would have disemboweled the centaurs human portion had it scored chester hastily let go throwing crombie violently away from him then he grabbed for his bow and arrow again the griffin however spread his wings to brake his flight looped about and closed in again before the arrow could be brought to bear now it was handtoclaw bink had cleared his area of little catsbut the good magician had had time to organize his vials and open the next this coalesced into a mound of brightred cherry bombs oh no bink had had experience with these violent little fruits before as there was a tree of them on the palace grounds in fact these were probably from that same tree if any of them scored on him he dived for humfrey catching the magicians arm before he could throw humfrey struggled desperately against binks superior strength bink still held back hating this violence though he saw no alternative to it both of them fell to the floor the magicians belt tore loose and a collection of vials tumbled across the stone some of their corks popped out the cherry bombs were dislodged they rolled away and dunked into the lake where they detonated with harmless thuds and clouds of steam one rolled into jewels bucket of gems the explosion sent precious stones flying all over the cavern diamonds shot by binks ears a huge pearl thunked into the magicians chest opals got under chesters hooves oh no jewel cried horrified thats not the way its supposed to be done each has to be planted in exactly the right place bink was sorry about the gems but he had more pressing problems the new bottles were spewing forth a bewildering variety of things the first was a pair of winged shoes so thats where i left them humfrey exclaimed but they flew out of reach before he could grab them the second vial loosed a giant hourglass whose sands were running outalso harmless hi this instance the next was a collection of exoticlooking seeds some like huge flat fish eyes others like saltandpepper mix others like onewinged flies they fluttered out and littered a wide patch crunching underfoot rolling like marbles squishing and adhering hke burrs but they did not seem to be any direct threat unfortunately the other vials were also pouring out vapors these produced a bucket of garbage a bag of supergrow fertilizer a miniature thunderstorm and a small nova star now the seeds had food water and light suddenly they were sprouting tendrils poked out bodies swelled pods popped leaves burst forth roots gripped the rock and clasped items of garbage stems shot up to form a dense and variegated carpet diverse species fought their own miniature battles over the best fertilizer territory in moments bink and the magician were surrounded by an expanding little jungle vines clung to feet branches poked at bodies and leaves obscured vision soon the plants were flowering now their specieswere identifiable lady slippers produced footwear of a most delicate nature causing jewel to exclaim in delight and snatch off a pair for herself knotweeds formed the most intricate specialized knots bow granny lanyard clinch hangman and halfhitch bink had to step quickly to avoid getting tied up that would cost him the victory right there meanwhile the magician was trying to avoid the snapping jaws of dogtooth violets and dandelions while a hawkweed made little swoops at his head bink would have laughedbut had too many problems of his own a goldenrod was trying to impale him on its metallic spire and a sunflower was bunding him with its effulgence the nova star was no longer needed the cave was now as bright as day and would remain so until the sunflower went to seed bink ducked just in tune to avoid a flight of glinting arrowheadsbut his foot slipped on a buttercup squirting butter out and making him sit down hardooomph on the squishy head of a skunk cabbage suddenly he was steamed in the nauseating fragrance well what had he expected he had very little protective talent now the enemy brain coral had canceled out his magic bink was on his own and had to make his own breaks at least humfrey was no better off at the moment he was being given a hotfoot by a patch of fireweed he snatched up a flower from a water lily and poured its water out to douse the fire meanwhile several paintbrushes were decorating him with stripes of red green and blue stray diamonds from the nymphs collection were sticking to his clothes this was getting nowherel bink tore his way out of the miniature jungle holding his breath and closing his eyes as a parcel of poppies popped loudly about his head he felt something enclosing his hands and had to look it was a pair of foxgloves a bluebell rang in his ear then he was out of it and there was the magicians belt with its remaining vials suddenly he realized if he controlled this humfrey would be helpless all his magic was contained hi these vials bink stepped toward itbut at that moment the magician emerged from the foliage plastered with crowfeet humfrey brushed them off and the feet scampered away a lone primrose turned its flower away from this gaucherie humfrey dived for his magic belt arriving just as bink did bink laid his hands on it there was a tugofwar more vials spilled out one puffed into a kettle of barley soup that spilled across the floor and was eagerly lapped up by the questing rootlets of the jungle another developed into a package of mixed nuts and bolts then bink found a steaming rice pudding and heaved it at the magicianbut humfrey scored first with a big mince pie minces flew out explosively twentyfour of them littering a yet wider area bink caught the brunt of it in his face minces were wriggling in his hair and down his neck and partially obscuring his vision bink fanned the air with his sword trying to keep the magician back while he cleared his vision oddly he could perceive the neighboring battle of centaur and griffin better than his own at this moment chesters human torso was now streaked with blood from the vicious raking of the griffins talons but one of crombies forelegs was broken and one of his wings halfstripped of feathers that handtoclaw combat had been savage now the centaur was stalking his opponent with sword in hand and the griffin was flying in ragged circles just out of reach seeking an opening despite sinks cautions these two were deadly serious they were out to kill each other yet how could bink stop them the magician found a vial and opened it bink advanced alertlybut it was another miscue a huge bowl of yogurt manifested it had by the look and smell of it been in the bottle too long it had spoiled it floated gently toward the lake let the brain coral try a taste of that but humfrey already had another vial these mistakes were not the result of binks talent so much as sheer honest chance humfrey seemed to have a hundred things in his vials and few were readily adaptable to combat and now they were all mixed up the odds were against anything really dangerous appearing from any randomly chosen vial yet the odds could be beaten the vial produced a writhing vine from a kraken which undulated aggresjsively toward bink but he sliced it into fragments јwith his sword and advanced on the magician again bink knew he could control the situation now noth ing in humfreys bottles could match the devastating presence of a capable sword desperately humfrey opened bottles searching for something to further his cause three dancing fairies materialized hovering on translucent pastelhued wings but they were harmless and soon drifted over to consult with jewel who put them to work picking up stray gems a package of cough drops formed and burst but too close to the magician who went into paroxysms of coughing but then a wyvem appeared wyverns were basically small dragonsbut even the tiniest of dragons were dangerous bink leaped at it aiming for the monsters neck he scoredbut the wyverns tough scales deflected the blade it opened its mouth and fired a jet of hot steam at bulks face bulk danced backthen abruptly rammed his point directly into the cloud of vapor with all his force the sword plunged into the creatures open mouth through its palate and out the top of its head the wyvern gave a single cry of agony and expired as bink yanked back his weapon bink knew he had been luckyand that this was genuine luck not his talent at work but the problem with such luck was that it played no favorites the next break could go against him he had to wrap this up before such a break occurred but the magician had had lime to rummage among more vials he was looking for something having trouble locating it amid the jumble but each failure left him fewer vials to choose from and a correspondingly greater chance of success as bink turned on him again a set of long winter underwear formed and several tattered comic books and a wooden stepladder a stink bomb and a gross of magic writing quills bink had to laugh buikwatch out chester cried its only a ladys evening gown bink said glancing at the next offering no harm in it behind it is an evil eyel chester cried trouble that was what humfrey had been searching for bink grabbed the gown using it as a shield against the nemesis beyond a beam of light shot out passed himand scored on the centaur halfstunned chester reeledand the griffin dived in for the kill his beak stabbed at chesters blinded eyes forcing the centaur to prance backward nol buik screamed again too late bink realized that he must have leaned on his talent a long time so that his reactions to chance happenings were slow chesters rear hooves stepped off the ledge the centaur gave a great neighing cry of dismay and tumbled rear first into the evil water of the lake the water closed murkily over chesters head without further sound or struggle the centaur disappeared below bulks friend and ally was gone there was no time for remorse humfrey had found another vial i have you now buik this one contains sleeping potion he cried holding it up bmk did not dare charge him because the evil eye still hovered between them balked only by the evening gown bink held as a feeble shield he could see the eyes outline vaguely through the filmy cloth and had to maneuver constantly to avoid any direct visual contact with it yet that sleeping potion would not be stopped by mere cloth yield buik humfrey cried your ally is gone my ally hovers behind you the eye holds you hi check and the sleeping potion can reach you where you stand yield and the coral grants you your life bulk hesitatedand felt the swish of air as the griffin flew at him from behind bink whirled seeing the nymph standing nearby petrified with terror and he knew that even as the brain coral made the offer of clemency with one mouth it was betraying that offer with action until this point bink had been fighting a necessary if undesired battle now abruptly he was angry his friend gone himself betrayedwhat reason had he now to stay his hand look then at the evil eye buik cried at crombie whipping away the gown as he faced away from the menace instantly crombie turned his head away refusing to look buik still hi his rage charged the griffin with his sword now it was claw and beak against swordwith nei ther party daring to glance toward the magician bink waved the bright gown as a distraction while he sliced at the griffins head then wrapped the material about his left arm as a protection against the claws crombie could attack only with his left front leg his tattered wings did not provide sufficient leverage for close maneuvering so he had to stand on his hind legs still he had the deadly body of a griffin and the combattrained mind of a soldier and he was as clever and ferocious an enemy as bink had ever faced crombie knew bink was long familiar with his mannerisms and was himself a more competent swordsman than bink in fact crombie had been binks instructor though as a griffin he carried no sword there was no maneuver bink could make that crombie did not know and could not counter in short bink found himself overmatched but his anger sustained him he attacked the griffin determinedly slicing at legs and head stabbing at the body forcing his opponent to face the evil eye he swung the gown to entangle crombies good wing then screamed terribly and launched his shoulder into crombies bright breast bink was as massive as the griffin his crudely hurtling weight bore crombie back toward the deadly water but it was useless just as bink thought he had gained the advantage crombie slid sidewise and let bink stumble toward the water alone bink tried to brake and almost succeeded he teetered on the brink and sawthe golem grundy astride the stillfloating bottle now quite near the shore fish me out bink the golem cried the poison cant hurt me but im beginning to dissolve look out at the warning bink dropped flat his face landing bare inches from the water crombie passed over him having missed his push spreading his wings to sail out over the dark lake grundy scooped one tiny hand through the water splashing a few drops up to splatter the griffins tailand immediately that tail drooped the water was deadly all right crombie made a valiant effort flapping so vigorously that he rose up out of range of the splashing then he glided to the far side of the lake and crashlanded unable to control his flight well because of the defeathered wing and stunned tail bink used the respite to extend his sword to the golem who grabbed the point and let himself be towed to shore then bink remembered grundy had freed humfrey and crombiein the name of the enemy the golem was also a creature of the brain coral why was he siding with bink now two possibilities first the coral might have only borrowed the golem then released him so that grundy had reverted to binks camp yet in that case the coral could take over the golem again at any time and grundy was not to be trusted in the heat of battle the coral might have forgotten grundy but as that battle simplified that would change second grundy might remain an agent of the enemy right now in that case but why should the coral try to fool bink this way why not just finish him off without respite bink didnt know but it occurred to him it might be his smartest course to play along to pretend to be fooled the enemy might have some weakness bink hadnt fathomed and if he could figure it out using the golem as a clue the soldier had not given up unable to turn in air because of his disabled guidance system crombie oriented himself on land got up speed and took off across the lake again dont touch meim steeped hi poison grundy cried ill spot the eye for you bink you concentrate on glad for the little ally despite his doubts bink did as the griffin sailed at him bink leaped up making a twohanded strike directly overhead with his sword crombie unable to swerve took the slash on his good wing the blade cut through the feathers and muscle andtendon and bone halfsevering the wing crombie fell to the groundbut he was not defeated he squawked and bounced to his feet whirling andleaping at bink front claw extended surprised at the soldiers sheer tenacity bink fell away tripped over an irregularity in the rock and landed on his back as the griffin landed on him beak plunging for his face bink shoved his sword violently upward this time it was no whig he scored on but the neck blood spurted out soaking him burning hot this had to be a mortal woundyet still the griffin fought slashing with three feet going for sinks gut bink rolled from under dragging his sword with him but it snagged on a bone and was wrenched out of his hand instead he threw himself on crombies neck from behind wrapping both arms about the spilling neck choking it trying to break it until this moment bink could not have imagined himself killing his friendbut the vision of chesters demise was burning in his mind and he had become an almost mindless killer crombie gave a tremendous heave and threw him off bulk dived in again grabbing for the legs as chester had catching a hind one such a tactic could never have worked on the soldier in his human form for crombie was an expert handtohand fighter but he was in animal form unable to use much of his highly specialized human expertise to prevent the griffin from reorienting bink hauled hard on that leg putting his head down and dragging the form across the rock dont look grundy cried the eye is ahead of you could he trust the golem surely notyet it would be foolish to risk looking where the eye might be bink closed his eyes took a new grasp and with his greatest exertion yet heaved the griffin over his head and forward crombie flew through the airand didnt land he was flying again or trying to bink had only helped launch him no wonder the griffin had not resisted that effort the eye is circling coming hi toward your face grundy cried to believe or not to believe the first demonstrably false statement the golem made would betray his affiliation so probably grundy would stick to the truth as long as he could bulk could trust him because he was an enemy agent ironic as that seemed he kept his eyes closed and shook out his robe where arms length hi front of you bulk spread the gown held it in both hands and leaped he carried the material across and down you got itl the golem cried wrap it up throw it hi the lake and bink did he felt the tugging within the gown and felt the slight mass of the captive eye the golem had spoken truly he heard the splash and cautiously opened one eye the gown was floating but it was soaked through anything caught hi it would be finished now he could look about crombie had flown only a short distance and had fallen into a small crevasse he was now wedged in its base prevented by his wounds and weakness from rising but the magician had remained active one step and i loose the sleeping potion he cried bink had had enough if you loose it you will be the first affected he said striding toward humfrey i can hold my breath as long as you can his sword was on the floor where it had dropped from the griffins wounds bink paused to pick it up wiping some of the blood off against his own clothing and held it ready in any event i doubt it takes effect before i reach you and if it does the golem will not be affected what side will he be on then hes part real yon know the coral can never be certain of its control the magician jerked the cork out refusing to be bluffed the vapor issued bink leaped forward swinging his sword as the substance coalescedand struck a small bottle a bottle materializing from a bottle oh no humfrey cried that was my supply of smartpills lost for this past decade what irony the magician had absentmindedly filed his smartpills inside another bottle and without them had been unable to figure out where he had put them now by a permutation of the war of talents they had shown upat the wrong time bink touched the magicians chest with the point of his sword you dont need any smartpill to know what will happen if you do not yield to me now humfrey sighed it seems i underestimated you bink i never supposed you could beat the griffin bink hoped never to have to try it again if crombie hadnt already been tired and woundedbut no sense worrying about what might have been you serve an enemy master i can not trust you yield and i will require one service of you then force you back into the bottle until my quest is complete otherwise i must slay you so as to render your brain coral helpless was this a blufi he did not want to kill the magician but if the battle renewed choose humfrey paused evidently in communion with some other mind goblins cant come too bright and besides they hate the coral no other resources in range cant counter your check he paused again bink realized the term check related to the mundane game king trent sometimes played called chess a check was a direct personal threat an apt term the coral is without honor humfrey continued but i am not i thought my prior offer to you was valid i did not know the griffin would attack you then i would like to believe you bink said his anger abating but not his caution i dare not i can only give you my word about my intent your word is better than mine in this circumstance i accept your terms bink lowered the sword but did not put it away and what of the golem he demanded whose side is he on heis one of us as you surmised you tricked me into acknowledging that by my reaction a moment ago you are very clever in the clutch bink forget the flattery why was grundy helping me the coral told me to the golem answered it doesnt make sense for the coral to fight itself if youd fought on crombies side he might have beaten me and he might still have lost humfrey said the coral too had seriously underestimated you bink it thought that once it canceled out your talentwhich remains horribly strong and devious forcing constant attentionyou could readily be overcome by physical means instead you fought with increasing savagery and skill as the pressure mounted what had seemed a nearcertainty became dubious thus the chance of the coral prevailing by force diminished while the chance of prevailing by reason increased reason bink exclaimed incredulously accordingly the coral delegated the golem to be your mendthe corals agent in your camp then if you won the physical battle and i were dead you would be prepared to listen to this friend well tm not prepared bink said i never trusted grundys change of sides arid would have thrown him back into the lake the moment he betrayed me at the moment i have more important business find the vial containing the healing elixir i know that has not yet been opened the magician squatted picking through the remaining vials this one jewell bink snapped timidly the nymph stepped toward him im afraid of you when youre like this bink and she had been afraid during the battle he could have used her help when the evil eye was stalking him instead of having to rely on the extremely questionable aid of the golem she was an alltootypical nymph in this respect incapable of decisive action in a crisis chameleon had been otherwise even in her stupidest phase she had acted to save him from harm even sacrificing herself he loved them bothbut he would stay with chameleon take this vial and sprinkle a drop on the griffin he directed her she was startled but crombie may be controlled by the enemy and because of that he did a horrible thing but he is my friend tra going to cure him and have the magician put him back in the bottle along with himself until this is over oh she took the vial and headed for the broken griffin bink nudged the magician forward with the point of his sword and they followed jewel more slowly humlrey had told bink he had won but bink knew it was not over yet not until the magician and griffin and goletn were back in the bottle and sink had control of that bottle and the coral would do its best to keep them out of that bottle jewel paused at the brink of the crevice looking down her free hand went to her mouth in a very feminine gesture that bink found oddly touching no not oddly he loved her therefore he reacted in a special manner even to her minor mannerisms but intellectually he knew better hes all blood she protested i cant take my attention from the magician bink said and added mentally or the golem if that vial does not contain the healing elixir i shall slay him instantly bold words bolstering his waning drive you have to apply it we need that griffin to point out the location of the antidote to the love potion iyes of course she said faintly she fumbled at the cork hestheres so much gorewhere do i crombie roused himself partially his eagle head rotated weakly on the slashed neck causing another gout of blood to escape squawk he says dont do it grundy translated hell only have to kill you bink angled his sword so that the blade reflected a glint of novastarlight into the griffins glazing eyes the sunflower had been brighter but now was fading its harvest time was approaching i dont expect honor hi a creature of the enemy or gratitude for a favor rendered he said grimly i have made a truce of sorts with the brain coral and i enforce it with this sword crombie will obey me implicitlyor the magician dies doubt me if you will how could they fail to doubt him when lie doubted himself yet if violence broke out again he would not simply let the coral take over crombie turned his tortured gaze on humfrey what bink says is true the magician said he has defeated us and now requires service in exchange for our lives the coral accedes perform his service and suffer confinement in the bottleor i will die and you will have to fight him again the griffin squawked once more weakly what is the service grundy translated you know what it is bink said to point out the nearest safest lovereversal magic were they stalling waiting for the sunflower to fade all the way so the goblins could come another squawk then the noble head fell to the floor he agrees but hes too weak to point grundy said we dont really need the antidote jewel said get on with it bink grated he had deep cuts where the griffins claws had raked his body and he was desperately tired now that the violent part of the action had abated he had to wrap this up before he collapsed sprinkle him jewel finally got the bottle open precious fluid sprayed out splattering her the rocks and the griffin one drop struck the golem who was suddenly cured of his partially dissolved state but none of it landed on bulk with what irony only the coral knew for sure crombie lifted his body free of the crevice bright and beautiful again he spread his wings turning to orient on bink bulks muscles tensed painfully he held the magician hostage but if the griffin attacked now jewel jumped between bink and crombie dont you dare she cried at the griffin there was the odor of burning paper for a long moment crombie looked at her his colorful wings partially extended beating slowly back and forth she was such a slip of a girl armed only with the bottle of elixir there was no way she could balk the magnificent animal indeed her body trembled with her nervousness one squawk and she would collapse in tears yet she had made the gesture bulk realized this was an extraordinary act for a true nymph she had tried to stand up for what she believed in could he condemn her because her courage was no greater than her strength then crombie rotated extended one wing fully and pointed toward the lake bink sighed conjure him into the bottle he told the magician do it right the first time if you try to conjure me youre dead there was a delay while jewel fetched the bottle from the edge of the lake where it still floated she had to scoop it up carefully not letting the moisture touch her skin then dry it off and set it within range of the magician humfrey performed his incantation the griffin dissolved into vapor and siphoned into the bottle belatedly it occurred to bink that humfrey could have done the same to bink anytime during their battle had he thought of it the loss of those smartpills must really have hurt yet it was hard to think of the obvious when being stalked by a sword andthe best bottle the demons residential one had not been available then now your turn bink told the magician into the same bottleyou and the golem the coral is reconsidering humfrey said it believes that if you knew the full story you would agree with the corals viewpoint will you listen more likely the coral is stalling until more of its minions can arrive bink said thinking again of the goblins they might not get along well with the brain coral but if some kind of deal were made but it knows the location and nature of the source of magicl humfrey said jsten and it will guide you there guide me there first then i will listen agreed agreed we trust you sink i dont trust you but all rightill make the deal i hope im not making a fatal mistake show me the source of magicand not with any oneword riddle i cant understandthen tell me why the brain coral has tried so hard to stop me from getting there first i suggest you imbibe a drop of the healing elixir yourself the magician said startled jewel turned oh binkyou should have been the first to have it no bink said it might have been the sleeping potion humfrey nodded had i attempted to betray you it would have shown when the griffin was treated he said you maneuvered to guard against betrayal most efficiently i must say even with your talent canceled out you have managed very well you are far removed from the stripling you once were arent we all bink growled hand still on sword jewel sprinkled a drop of elixir on him instantly his wounds healed and he was strong again but his suspicion of the good magician did not ease chapter demon xanth t i his way humfrey said bink kept ms sword drawn as he followed the magician jewel walked silently behind him carrying the golem incidentally humfrey said crombie was not deceiving you the antidote you seek does lie in the direction of the lakebut beyond it the coral could enable you to obtain itif things work out i have no interest in bribes from the enemy bink said curtly you dont jewel asked you dont want the antidote sorryi didnt mean i intended to renege bink told her its a matter of principle i cant let the enemy subvert me even though i do not wish to burden you with my love any longer than its no burden bink she said i never saw anything so brave as but since the antidote is evidently out of reach there is no point in keeping you im sorry i inconvenienced you for nothing you are free to go now she caught at his arm bink automatically moved his sword out of the way bink i bink yielded to his desire at last and kissed her to his surprise she returned the kiss emphatically the scent of yellow roses surrounded them then he pushed her gently away take good care of yourself nymph this sort of adventure is not for you i would like to believe that you are safe and happy with your gems and your job always bink i cant go you have to go here there is only horror and dan ger and i have no right to subject you to it you must depart without discovering the source of magic so that you will have no enemy now she smelled of pine trees on a hot day all pungent and fresh and mildly intoxicating the elixir had cured her hoarseness too and had erased the nosleep shadows under her eyes she was as lovely as she had been the moment he first saw her you have no right to send me away either she said humfrey moved bulks sword leaped up warningly jewel backed off frightened again have no concern the magician said we approach the source of magic bink wary hardly dared believe it i see nothing special see this rock humfrey asked pointing it is the magic rock slowly moving up leaking through to the surface after hundreds of years squeezing through a fault in the regular strata above it becomes magic dust part of the natural or magical conversion of the lands crust he pointed down belowis where it becomes charged the source of magic yesbut how is it charged with magic bink demanded why has the coral so adamantly opposed my approach you will soon know the magician showed the way to a natural curving tunnelramp that led down feel the intensifying strength of magic here the most minor talent looms like that of a magicianbut all talents are largely nullified by the ambience it is as if magic does not exist paradoxically because it can not be differentiated properly bink could not make much sense of that he continued on down alert for further betrayal conscious of the pressure of magic all about him if a lightning bug made its little spark here there would be a blast sufficient to blow the top off a mountain they were certainly approaching the sourcebut was this also a trap the ramp debouched into an enormous cave whose far wall was carved into the shape of a giant demon face the demon xanth the source of magic humfrey said simply this statue this mere mask bink asked incredulously what joke is this hardly a joke bink without this demon our land would be just like mundania a land without magic and this is all you have to show me how do you expect me to believe it i dont expect that you have to listen to the rationale only then can you grasp the immense significance of what you seeand appreciate the incalculable peril your presence here means to our society buik shook bis head with resignation i said id listen ill listen but i dont guarantee to believe your story you can not fail to believe humfrey said but whether you acceptthat is the gamble the information comes in this manner we shall walk about this chamber intercepting a few of the magic vortexes of the demons thoughts then we will understand i dont want any more magic experiencel bink protested all i want to know is the nature of the source you shall you shall humfrey said just walk with me that is all there is no other way he stepped forward still suspicious bink paced him for he did not want to let the magician get beyond the immediate reach of his sword suddenly he felt giddy it was as if he were falling but his feet were firm he paused bracing himself against he knew not what another siege of madness if that were the trap he saw stars not the paltry motes of the normal night sky but monstrous and monstrously strange balls of naming yet unburning substance of gas more dense than rock and tides without water they were so far apart that a dragon could not have flown from one to another in its lifetime and so numerous that a man could not count them all in his lifetime yet all were visible at once between these magically hugesmall distantclose unbelievable certainties flew the omnipotent demons touching a small star here to make it flicker a large one there to make it glow red and upon occasion puffing one into the blind ing flash of a nova the realm of the stars was the demons playground the vision faded bink looked dazedly around at the cave and the tremendous still face of the demon you stepped out of that particular thoughtvortex humfrey explained each one is extremely narrow though deep uh yes bink agreed he took another stepand faced a lovely shedemon with eyes as deep as the vortex of the fiends and hair that spread out like the tail of a comet she was not precisely female for the demons had no reproduction and therefore no sex unless they wanted it for entertainment they were eternal they had always existed and always would exist as long as there was any point in existence but for variety at times they played with variations of sex and assumed the aspect of male female itmale hemale shemale neutermale and anonymale at the moment she was close enough to a category to be viewed as such and it was not a he category she said formulating a concept so vastly spacious as to fail to register upon binks comprehension yet her portent was so significant it moved him profoundly he felt a sudden compelling urgency to but such a thing would have been inexpressibly obscene in human terms had it been possible or even conceivable she was not after all closest in category to female bink emerged from the thoughteddy and saw jewel standing transfixed meshed in a different current her lips were parted her bosom heaving what was she experiencing bink suffered a quadruplelevel reaction horror that she should be subjected to any thought as crudely and sophisticatedly compelling as the one he had just experienced for she was an innocent nymph jealousy that she should react so raptly to something other than himself especially if it were as suggestive a notion as the one he had absorbed guilt about feeling that way about a nymph he could not really have though he would not have wished the concept on the one he did have and intense curiosity suppose an itmale made an offeroh horrible yet so tempting too but humfrey was moving and bink had to move too he stepped into an eternal memory so long that it resembled a magic highway extending into infinity both ways the lineofsightthough sight was not precisely the sense employedto the past disappeared into a farfar distant flash the demon universe had begun hi an explosion and ended hi another and the whole of tune and matter was the mere hiatus between these bangswhich two bangs were hi turn only aspects of the same one obviously this was a completely alien universe from bulks own yet hi the throes of this flux of relevant meaninglessness it became believable a supermagic framework for the supermagical demons buik emerged from the thought but what do the demons have to do with the source of the magic of xanth he demanded plaintively then he entered a new fluxa complex one we cooperate we can enlarge our a the pseudofemale demon communicated seductively at least this was as much as bink could grasp of her import that had levels and resonances and symbolisms as myriad as the stars and as intense and diffuse and confusing my formula is e our as match ah yes it was a good offer considering the situation since their remaining elements differed making them noncompetitive not on your existence another protested enlarge our e not our a it was doea who stood to be diminished by the enlarging a enlarge both d and e another suggested it was d dcea agreed instantly and so did e for she would benefit to a certain degree too but this left xcan out reduce our n t th recommended and this appealed to xcan but tcen was also dealing with the eraisers and that gave t th disproportionate gain for the contract all deals fell through for no benefit bulk emerged his comprehension struggling the names were formulae the letters were values what was going on ah you have seen it humfrey said the demons have no names only pointscores variable inputs are substituted affecting the numeric values though they are not really numbers but degrees of concept with gravity and charm and luminosity and other dimensions we can hardly grasp the running score is paramount that explanation only furthered the mystery the demon xanth is only a score in a game the demon whose scoring formula is xcan three variables and a classexponent as nearly as we can understand it the magician said the rules of the game are beyond our comprehension but we do see their scores changing i dont care about a scorel bink cried whats the point whats the point in life humfrey asked hi return toto grow to improve to do something useful bink said not to play games with concepts you see it that way because you are a man not a demon these entities are incapable of growth or improvement but what about all their numbers their enlargements of velocity of viscosity oh i thought you understood the magician said those are not expansions of demon intellect or power but of status demons dont grow they are already allpowerful there is nothing that any of them could conceive of that each could not possess nothing any one of them could not accomplish so they cant improve or do anything useful by our definition for they are already absolute thus there is no inherent denial no challenge no challenge doesnt that get boring in a billion years it gets a billion times more boring the magician agreed so the demons play games bink asked incredulously what better way to pass time and recover interest in existence since they have no actual limitations they accept voluntary ones the excitement of the artificial challenge replaces the boredom of reality well maybe bink said doubtfully but what has this to do with us the demon x th is paying a game penalty for failing to complete a formulaapplication within the round humfrey said he has to remain in inertia in isolation until released bink stood still so as not to intercept any more thoughts i dont see any chains to hold him as for being alonethere are lots of creatures here no chains could hold him since he is omnipotent he plays the game by its rules and of course we dont count as company nothing in all the land of xanth does were vermin not demons butbut bink grabbed for meaning and could not hold it you said this demon was the source of magic i did indeed the demon x ffi has been confined here over a thousand years from his body has leaked a trace amount of magic infusing the surrounding material hardly enough for him to noticejust a natural emanation of his presence much as our own bodies give off heat buik found this as fantastic as the demons vortexthoughts a thousand years leakage of magic in that time even a small leak can amount to a fair amountat least it might seem so to vermin the magician assured nun all the magic of the land of xanth derives from this effectand all of it together would not make up a single letter of the demons formula but even if all this is sowhy did the brain coral try to prevent me from learning this the coral has nothing against you personally bink i think it rather respects your determination it is against anybody learning the truth because anyone who encounters the demon x a might be tempted to release him how could a mere vermini mean person release such an entity you said the demon only remains by choice humfrey shook his head what is choice to an omnipotent he remains here at the dictate of the game that is quite a different matter but he only plays the game for entertainment he can quit anytimel the game is valid only so long as its rules are honored after investing over a thousand years in this aspect of it and being so close to success within the rules why should he abridge it now bink shook his head this makes little sense to me would not torture myself in such fashion yet a thread of doubt tugged at the corner of his mind he was torturing himself about the nymph jewel honoring the human convention of his marriage to chameleon that to a demon might seem nonsensical humfrey merely looked at nun understanding some of what was passing through his mind very well bink said returning to the main point the coral did not want me to know about the demon because i might release him how could i release an allpowerful creature who does not want to be released oh xcan wants to be released i am sure it is merely necessary that protocol be followed you could do it simply by addressing the demon and saying xanth i free you anybody can do it except the demon himself but we dont count on its terms were nothings vermin i did not create the rules i only interpret them through the comprehension gleaned over centuries by the brain coral the magician said spreading his hands obviously our interpretation is inadequate but i conjecture that just as we two might make a bet on whether a given mote of dust might settle nearer me or you the demons bet on whether vermin will say certain words on certain occasions it does lend a certain entertaining randomness to the proceedings with all that power why doesnt xanth cause one of us to do it then that would be the same thing as doing it himself it would constitute cheating by the rules of the game he is bound to remain without influencing any other creature on his behalf much as we would not permit each other to blow on that mote of dust it is not a matter of power but of convention the demon knows everything that is going on here including this conversation between us but the moment he interferes he forfeits the point so he watches and waits doing noth ing except thinking bink said feeling nervous about the scrutiny of the demon if xanth were reading bulks thoughts while bulk was reading xanths thoughts especially in the case of that shemale memory ouch thinking is permissible it is another inherent function like his colossal magic he has not sought to influence us by his thoughts we have intercepted them on our own initiative the coral being closest to the demon for this millennium has intercepted more of x ths magic and thought than any other native creature so understands frim less imperfectly than any other vermin thus the brain coral has become the guardian of the demon and jealously prevents anyone else from achieving similar magic or information bink exclaimed no it has been a necessary and tedious chore that the coral would gladly have given up centuries ago the corals dearest wish is to inhabit a mortal body to live and love and hate and reproduce and die as we do but it can not lest the demon be released the coral has the longevity of the demon without his power it is an unenviable situation you mean the demon xanth would have been freed hundreds of years ago but for the interference of the coral true the magjcian said of all the nerve and the demon tolerates this the demon tolerates tins lest he forfeit the point well i consider this an egregious violation of the demons civil rights and im going to correct that right nowl bmk exclaimed with righteous wrath but he hesitated what does the coral gain by keeping the demon chained i dont know for certain but i can conjecture humfrey said it is not for itself it does this but to maintain the status quo think bink what would be the consequence of the demons release bink thought i suppose he would just return to his game and what of us well the brain coral might be in trouble i know i would be upset if someone had balked me for centuries but the coral must have known the risk before it meddled it did the demon lacks human emotion he accepts the corals interference as part of the natural hazard of the game he will not seek revenge still there could be a consequence if xanth lacks human emotion bink said slowly what would stop him from carelessly destroying us all it would be one dispassionate even sensible way of ensuring that he would not be trapped here again now you are beginning to comprehend the corals concern humfrey said our lives may hang in the balance even if the demon ignores us and merely goes his way there will surely be a consequence i should think so bink agreed if xanth is the source of all magic in our land he interrupted himself appalled it could mean the end of magic we would become exactly like mundania humfrey concluded perhaps it would not happen right away it might take a while for the accumulated magic of a thousand years to fade or the loss might be instantaneous and absolute we just dont know but surely there would be a disaster of greater or lesser magnitude now at last you understand the burden the coral has borne alone the coral has saved our land from a fate worse than destruction but maybe the demon wouldnt go bink said maybe he likes it here would you care to gamble your way of life on that assumption no do you still condemn the coral for opposing you no i suppose i would have done the same in its place then you will depart without freeing the demon im not sure bink said i agreed to listen to the corals rationale i have done so but i must decide for myself what is right there is a question when the whole of our lands welfare is at stake yes the demons welfare is also at stake but all this is just a game to x it is life to us yes sink agreed noncommittally the magician saw that argument was useless this is the great gamble we did not wish to takethe gamble of the outcome of an individual crisis of conscience it rests in your hands the future of our society bink knew this was true nothing humfrey or the brain coral might try could affect him before he uttered the words to free the demon he could ponder a second or an hour or a year as he chose free of duress he did not want to make a mistake grundy bink said and the golem ran up to him not affected by the thought vortices do you wish to free the demon xanth i cant make decisions like that grundy protested im only clay and string a creature of magic like the demon himself bink said youre nonhuman not quite alive you might be construed as a miniature demon i thought you might have an insight grundy paced the cave floor seriously my job is translation i may not experience the emotion you do but i have an awful clear notion of the demon he is like me as a dragon is to a nickelpede i can tell you this he is without conscience or compassion he plays his game rigorously by its rules but if you free him you will have no thanks from him and no reward in fact that would be cheating on his part to proffer you any advantage for your service to him for that might influence you but even if reward were legitimate he wouldnt do it hed as soon step on you as smell you he is like you bink repeated as you were before you began to change now you are halfway real you caresomewhat i am now an imperfect golem xanth is a perfect demon for me humanization is a step up for him it would be a fall from grace he is not your kind yet i am not concerned with kind or thanks but with justice bink said is it right that the demon be freed by his logic you would be an utter fool to free him the good magician standing apart nodded agreement jewel bink said the nymph looked up smelling of old bones the demon frightens me worse than anything she said his magicwith the blink of one eye he could click us all out of existence you would not free him then oh binki never would she hesitated prettily i know you took the potion so this is unfairbut im so afraid of what that demon might do id do anything for you if only you didnt free him again the good magician nodded nymphs were fairly simple direct creatures unfettered by complex overlays of conscience or social strategy a real woman might feel the same way jewel did but she would express herself with far more subtlety proffering a superficially convincing rationale the nymph had named her price so the logical and the emotional advisers both warned against releasing the demon x yet bink remained uncertain something about this huge supermagical gameplaying entity and he had it honor within the demons framework the demon was honorable he never breached the code of the gamenot in its slightest detail though there were none of his kind present to observe and had not been for a thousand years integrity beyond human capacity was he to be penalized for this i respect you bulk said at last to humfrey and i respect the motive of the brain coral he turned to the golem i think you ought to have your chance to achieve full reality and to the nymph and i love you jewel he paused but i would have respect for nothing and love for nothing if i did not respect and love justice if i let personal attachments and desires prevail over my basic integrity of purpose i would lose my claim to distinction as a moral creature i must do what i think is right the others did not respond they only looked at him the problem is bink continued after a moment im not certain what is right the rationale of the demon xanth is so complex and the consequence of the loss of magic to our world is so greatwhere is right and wrong he paused again i wish i had chester here to share his emotion and reason with me you can recover the centaur humfrey said the waters of the coral lake do not kill they preserve he is suspended in brine unable to escape but alive the coral can not release him that brine preserves it similarly but you if you save the magic of our land you can draw on the phenomenal power of this region and draw him forth you offer another temptation of personal attachment bink said i can not let it influence me for now he realized that he had not yet won the battle against the brain coral he had prevailed physically but intellectually the issue remained in doubt how could he be sure the decision he made was his own then he had a bright notion argue the other case magician tell me why i should free the demon startled humfrey demurred you should not free the demon so you believe so the coral believes i can not tell whether that belief is really yours or merely a function of the will of your master so now you argue the opposite case and ill argue the case for leaving him chained maybe that way the truth will emerge you are something of a demon yourself humfrey muttered now i submit that these friends of mine are more important than an impersonal demon bulk said i dont know whats right for x th but i do know that my friends deserve the best how can i justify betraying them by freeing the demon humfrey looked as if he had swallowed the evil eye but he came back gamely enough it is not a question of betrayal bink none of these creatures would ever have experienced magic if it had not been for the presence of the demon now period of incarceration has been fulfilled and he must be released to do otherwise would be to betray your role in the demons game i have no obligation to the demons game bink retorted getting into the feel of it pure chance brought me here that is the role that you as a sapient creature uninfluenced by the demons will come by your own initiative or accident of chance to free him you fought against us all to achieve this point of decision and won are you going to throw it all away now yesif that is best how can you presume to know what is best for an entity like xcan free him and let him forge his own destiny at the expense of my friends my land and my love justice is absolute you can not weigh personal factors against it justice is not absolute it depends on the situation when there is right and wrong on both sides of the scale the preponderance you can not weigh rights and wrongs on a scale bink humfrey said becoming passionate hi his role as demons advocate now bink was sure it was the good magician speaking not the brain coral the enemy had had to free humfrey at least to this extent to allow him to play this game of the moment the magicians mind and emotion had not been erased and that was part of what bink had needed to know right and wrong are not to be found in things or histories and can not be properly defined in either human or demon terms they are merely aspects of viewpoint the question is whether the demon should be allowed to pursue his quest in his own fashion he is pursuing it in his own fashion bink said if i dont free him thats according to the rules of his game too i have no obligation the demons honor compels him to obey a stricture no man would tolerate humfrey said it is not surprising that your own honor is inferior to that perfect standard bulk felt as if he had been smashed by a forest blasting curse the magician was a devastating infighter even in a cause he opposed except that this could be the magicians real position that the coral was forced to allow him to argue my honor compels me to follow the code of my kind imperfect as that may be humfrey spread his hands i can not debate that the only real war between good and evil is within the soul of yourselfwhoever you are if you are a man you must act as a man yes bink agreed and my code says he paused amazed and mortified it says i can not let a living feeling creature suffer because of my inaction it doesnt matter that the demon would not free me were our positions reversed i am not a demon and shall not act like one it only matters that a man does not stand by and allow a wrong he perceives to continue not when he can so readily correct it oh bink jewel cried smelling of myrrh dont do it he looked at her again so lovely even in her apprehension yet so fallible chameleon would have endorsed his decision not because she wished to please him but because she was a human being who believed as he did in doing the right thing yet though jewel like all nymphs lacked an overriding social conscience she was as good a person as her state permitted i love you jewel i know this is just another thing the coral did to stop me butwell if i hadnt taken that potion and if i werent already married it would have been awfully easy to love you anyway i dont suppose it makes you feel any better to know that i am also risking my wife and my unborn baby and my parents and all else i hold dear but i must do what i must do you utter fool grundy exclaimed if i were real id snatch up the nymph and to hell with the demon youll get no reward from x tb i know bhik said ill get no thanks from any one then he addressed the huge demon face i free you xanth he said chapter magic loss instantly the demon burst loose the seeping magic of xcan immediate environment was as nothing compared to the full magic of his release there was a blinding effulgence a deafening noise and an explosion that threw bink across the cavern he crashed jarringly into a wall as his senses cleared be perceived the collapse of the cavern in slowmotion sight and sound huge stones crunched to the floor and shattered into sand all the world seemed to be collapsing into the space left by the demon this was a demise bink had not anticipated not willful destruction by x th not the tedium of loss of magic but careless extinction in the wake of the demons departure it was true the demon didnt care now as the dust clouded in to choke him and the only light was from the sparks of colliding rocks bink wondered what had he done why hadnt he heeded the brain corals warning and left the demon alone why hadnt he yielded to his love for jewel and even in the ongoing carnage while expecting momentary conclusion of his life this made him pause in surprise love not so he was out of love with jewel that meant the magic really was gone the love potion had been nullified his talent would no longer protect him the land of xanth was now one with mundania bink closed his eyes and cried there was a great deal of dust in the air that needed washing out of his eyes and he was wrackingly afraid but it was more than that he was crying for xanth he had destroyed the uniqueness of the world he knew even if he survived this cavein how could he live with that he did not know how the society he had belonged to would react what would happen to the dragons and tangle trees and zombies how could the people live without magic it was as if the entire population had abruptly been exiled to the drear realm of notalents the action abated bink found himself grimed with rock powder bruised but with limbs and sword intact miraculously he had survived had anyone else he peered through the rubble dun light descended from a hole far above evidently the demons route of departure xcan must simply have shot up and out forging his path heedlessly through the rock what power magician jewel bink cried but there was no answer the fall of stone had been so complete that only his own section remained even partially clear his talent must have saved him just before it faded he could not depend on it any more however it was evident that spells had been the first magic to go he stepped out over the rubble more dust swirled up it coated everything bulk realized that though he thought he had been aware of the whole process of the demons departure he could actually have been unconscious for some time so much dust had settled yet he had no bruise on his head and no headache yet again the physical and magical explosion of the demons release could account for many incongruous effects magician he called again knowing it was futile he bink had survivedbut his friends had lacked his critical protection at the key moment somewhere beneath this slope of stone he spied a glint a wan reflection only a glimmer between two dusky rocks he pried them apart and there it was the bottle containing crombie strewn across it was a bit of rag bink picked up the bottle letting the cloth falland saw that it was what remained of grundy the golem the little manfigure had owed its animation to magic now he was just a limp wad of material bink closed his eyes again experiencing another chill seizure of grief he had done what he had felt was rightbut he had not truly reckoned the consequence fine points of morality were intangible life and death were tangible by what right had he condemned these creatures to death was it moral for him to slay them in the name of his morality he put the cloth in his pocket along with the bottle evidently the golems last act had been to grab the bottle protecting it with his body that had been effective and so grundy had given up his life for that of the griffin he served he had cared and therefore achieved his realityjust in time to have it dashed by circumstance where was the morality in that startled by another thought bink drew out the bottle again was crombie still in there in what form with magic gone he could be deadunless some magic remained corked in the bottle better not open it whatever lingering chance crombie had resided in that bottle if he were loosed and the magic dissipated into the airwould crombie emerge as a man again or a griffin or a bottlesized compressed mass bink had just gambled enormously freeing the demon he was not about to gamble similarly with the life of his friend he repocketed the bottle how drear it was this depth of the hole alone with a bottle and a defunct golem and his own mortification the ethical principle on which he had based his decision was opaque to him now the demon xanth had lain prisoner for over a thousand years he could have lain for another century or so without harm couldnt he bink discovered he was not at the bottom of the hole after all the rubble opened into a deeper hole and at the bottom was dark water the lake but the level had lowered drastically now the dank gray convolutions of a formerly submerged structure lay dimly revealed the brain coral it too was dead it could not exist without the potent magic of the demon i fear you were right coral bink said sadly you let me through and i destroyed you you and our world he smelled smokenot the clean fresh odor of a healthy blaze but the smoldering foulness of incompletely burning vegetation evidently the demons departure had ignited some brush assuming there was brush down here underground the intense magic must have done it leaving behind a real fire it probably would not burn far here deep in the ground but it certainly was stinking up the place then he heard a delicate groan surely not the coral he scrambled toward the soundand found jewel wedged in a vertical crevice bleeding from a gash on the head but definitely alive hastily he drew her out halfcarrying her to a brighter place he propped her up against a rock and patted her face with his fingertips trying to bring her to consciousness she stirred dont wake me bulk let me die in peace ive killed everyone else he said sullenly at least you will be able to to return to my job i cant do it without magic there was something strange about her bink concentrated and it came you dont smell it was magic she said she sighed if im alive fm alive i suppose but i really do wish youd let me die let you die i wouldnt do that i she glanced up at him cannily even through the bloodcaked dust on her face she was lovely the magic is gone you dont love me any more still i owe it to you to get you home bink said he looked up trying to decide on the most feasible route and did not see her enigmatic reaction they checked through the rubble a little longer but could not find the magician bink was relieved in a fashion now he could hope that humfrey had survived and had departed before him binfc peered up at the demons exit well never make it up there he said glumly too much of it is sheer cliff i know a way jewel said it will be difficult without the diggle but there are natural passages oh she broke off suddenly there was a monster barring the way it resembled a dragon but lacked wings and fire it was more like a very large serpent with legs thats a tunnel dragoni think jewel said but somethings missing the magic bink said its changing into a mundane creatureand it doesnt understand you mean ill change into a mundane woman she inquired not entirely displeased i believe so there really is not much difference between a nymph and a they usually dont bother people she continued uneasily before bink could react she added theyre very shy dragons oh a nymphly nonsequitur bink kept his hand near his sword this is an unusual occasion sure enough the legged serpent charged jaws gaping wide though it was small for a land dragon since it was adapted to squeeze through narrow passages it was still a formidable creature its head was larger than binks and its body sinuously powerful in the conditions of this cavern bink could not swing his sword freely so he held it out ahead of him the serpent snapped at the bladea foolish thing to do since the charmed blade would likely cut its jaw hi two the teeth closed on itand the blade was yanked out of binks hand then he remembered without magic the swords charm was gone he had to make it work by himself completely the serpent flung the sword aside and opened its jaws again there was blood on its lower lip the blade had done some minor damage but now bink faced the monster barehanded the head struck forward bink danced backward but as the strike missed and the head dropped low bink struck the serpent on the top of the head with his fist the thing hissed in furious amazement as its chinless chin bashed into the floor but binks foot was already on its neck crushing it down the serpents legs scraped across the stone as it tried to free itself but bink had it pinned my sword he cried jewel hastily picked it up and extended it pointfirst toward him bink was already grabbing for it before he noticed and then almost lost his balance and his captive as he aborted his grab other way he snapped oh it had not occurred to her that he would need to take hold of the handle she was a complete innocent about weapons she took it gingerly by the blade and poked the hilt hi his direction but as he took it the serpent wrenched free bink jumped back his sword ready the thing had had enough it backed awayan awkward maneuver when slitheringthen dived into a sidehole youre so brave jewel said i was stupid to let it disarm me he said gruffly he was not at all proud of the encounter it had been fraught with clumsiness not at all elegant just a stupid indecisive brawl lets get on before i make a worse mistake i brought you out of your home and ill get you back there safely before i leave you its only right only right she repeated faintly something wrong what am i going to do without magic she flared nothing will work bulk considered youre right i have wrecked your livelihood id better take you to the surface with me she brightened then dulled no that wouldnt work its all right i told you the potion has no effect now i dont love you i wont be bothering you you can settle in one of the villages or maybe work in the kings palace it wont be much without magic but it has to be better than this he made a gesture indicating the dismal caverns i wonder she murmured they continued jewel did know the labyrinth of the caverns fairly well once they were out of the demons depths and brought them steadily if circuitously upward beyond the immediate region of the demons vacancy there had not been much damage but everywhere the magic was gone and the creatures were crazed rats tried to zap him with their rodent magic and failed and resorted to teeth they were no more used to naked teeth as weapons than bink was to using an uncharmed sword so the sides were fair he drove them back with slashing sweeps of his sword there might be no magic in the blade but the edge remained sharp and it could hurt and kill still it took a lot of energy to swing that sword and his arm grew tired there had been another charm to make the sword lighter and more responsive to direction without making it selfwilled like the one that had attacked bink in the gardens of castle roogna the rats crowded closer staying just out of range and coming in to nip at his heels when he climbed jewel was no better off she lacked even a knife of her own and had to borrow bulks knife to defend herself a monster could be killed but these smaller creatures seemed inexhaustible they werent nickelpedes fortunately but they were reminiscent of them the wayft will be dark in places jewel said i hadnt thoughtwithout magic theres no glow no magic light im afraid of the dark there had been some residual glow but it was fading bink looked at the rats so close with reason he said we have to see what were fighting he felt naked without his talent though it only protected him against magica protection that was irrelevant now for practical purposes his situation was unchanged since no magic threatened him not now or ever again firewe need fire for light torches if we can make torches i know where some fire stones are jewel said but she reconsidered immediately only i dont think they are working without magic do you know where theres dry grassi mean strawsomething we could twist up tight and bum andbut i dont know how the mundanes make fire so i know where theres magic fire she broke off oh this is awful no magic she looked as if about to cry as bink knew real sternness of character was not to be found in nymphs they seemed to have been fashioned by magic to accommodate mans casual dreams not his serious ones yet he had cried too when he first grasped the immensity of what he had done how much of his perception of the nature of nymphs was humanchauvinistic i know bink cried surprising himself there was something burningi smelled it before if we went therepicked up some of whatevers burning great she agreed with a flash of nymphenthusiasm or female enthusiasm he corrected his impression mentally they soon found it by following their noses the remains of a magic garden the goblins must have tended now sere and brown the dead foliage was smoldering and the smoke formed layers in the upper reaches of the garden cave the goblins of course were far removed from this region they had been so afraid of the fire that they had not even tried to put it out bink and jewel gathered what seemed like the best material forming it into an irregular rope and lit the end the thing guttered and flared and went out in a cloud of awfulsmelling smoke but after several tries they got it working better it was enough to have it smolder until they needed an open flame which they could blow up anytime jewel carried it it gave her a feeling of security she sorely needed and bink had to have his hands free for fighting now the worst of the enemies were the goblins who evidently resented the intrusion into their garden there had been no direct evidence of them before but of course they had been on the diggle with protective magic and much light in the absence of light the goblins grew bolder they seemed to have been bred from men and rats now that the magic was gone the manaspect was diminishing and the rataspect was becoming more pronounced bink realized that this was evident mostly in their habits physically they still resembled brutish little men with big soft feet and small hard heads the difficulty with the goblins was that they had the intelligence of men and the scruples of rodents they slunk just out of sight but they were not cowards it was simply that no one three or six of them could stand up to dinks sword and there was not room for a greater number of them to approach him at one time so they stayed clearwithout giving up i think they know i freed the demon bink muttered theyre out for revenge i dont blame them you did what you believed was right jewel flared he put his arm about her slender waist and you are doing what you believe is right helping me reach the surfaceeven though we both know i was wrong i have destroyed the magic of xanth no you werent wrong she said you had empathy for the demon and he squeezed her thank you for saying that do you mind if i he stopped i forgot im not in love with you any more i dont mind anyway she said but he let her go embarrassed there was an evil cackle of laughter from a goblin bink stooped to pick up a stone to hurl at the creature but of course it missed bink armed himself with a number of rocks and hurled one every time he saw a goblin soon he got remarkably accurate and the goblins gave him a wider berth stones had a special magic that had nothing to do with real magic they were hard and sharp and plentiful and bink had a much better arm than any goblin possessed still they did not give up beauregards warning had been accurate bink had not encountered goblins as brave and tenacious as these before bulk wanted to rest for he was tired but dared not if he rested he might sleep and that could be disaster of course he could have jewel watch while he slept but she was after all only a nymphrather a young woman and he was afraid the goblins would overwhelm her in such a situation her fate in goblin hands would probably be worse than his he glanced at her covertly this rough trek was taking its toll her hair had lost its original sparkle and hung in lusterless straggles she reminded him some what of chameleonbut not in her beauty phase they dragged on and made progress near the surface the ascent became more difficult theres not much communication with the topworld jewel gasped this is the best routebut how you climb it without wings or a rope i dont know bink didnt know either if this had been a convenient route crombies talent would have pointed it out on the way in the day sky was visible through a crack in the ground abovebut the walls sloped hi from the broader cavernspace below and they were slick with moisture impossible to climb without magic we cant stay here long jewel said worriedly theres a tangle tree near the exit and its roots can get ornery she stopped short startled im still doing it without magic that was why crombies talent hadnt pointed this way he realized a tanglerl but the bad magic was gone with the good lets go he cried he found the tangle roots and ripped them out of the rock and severed them where they would not come free quickly he knotted them into a strong if ragged rope tangle roots were strong they were made for holding struggling prey fast no question this rope would hold his weight but how can we get it up there jewel asked anxiously theres a major tangle roottrunk crossing at the narrowest section bink said see right up there he pointed she looked i never noticed i must have been here half a dozen tunes before teasing the tangler and wondering what the world above was like i was supposed to be planting gems her nymphly confession trailed ofe you certainly are observant you certainly are complimentary dont worry you will get to see the surface world this time i wont leave you until youre safe on the surface and in good hands maybe at the magicdust village she looked away not answering he glanced at her peering through the smoke of the smoldering weed rope she held concerned did i say something wrong she looked back at him with sudden decision bink you remember when we first met he laughed how could i forget you were so beautiful and i was so grimyalmost as grimy as we both are now and i had just taken the he shrugged not wanting to get into the embarrassing matter of the love potion again you know im almost sad thats over youre an awfully nice nymph and without your help you loved me then and i didnt love you she said you were devious and i was simple you lured me in close then grabbed me and kissed me bink fidgeted im sorry jewel iit wont happen again thats what you think she said and flung her arms about him and planted a passionate kiss on his halfopen mouth dirty as she was it was still a remarkable experience almost he felt the tug of the love potion again he had loved her before without knowing her now he knew her and understood her nymphly limitations and respected her for trying so hard to overcome them and he liked her more than was entirely proper a genuine affection had been developing beneath the artificial love and that affection remained what would chameleon think if she saw this embrace jewel released him turnabouts fair play she said i am more complex than i was a few hours ago and you are simpler now get on up your rope what did she mean by that bemused bink weighted the rope with a solid rock and lofted it up toward the roottrunk it fell short because of the weight of the rope he tried again harder but the rope was still too heavy it dragged steadily its weight becoming greater as the rock got higher finally he made a wad out of the rope and hurled the mass of it up this time it got thereand fell back having failed to pass over the root but he was making progress and after several more tries he got it over the rock fell down hauling the rope after it it snagged before the rock came down within reach but several jerks on the other end of the rope freed it bink knotted the ends together forming a complete loop of rope that could not come loose i can climb this first then you can sit in the loop and ill haul you up he said he knew there was no chance of her climbing by herself her arms were too delicate blow the torch up high so the goblins wont come too close she nodded bink took a few deep breaths feeling his worn system revving up in anticipation of this final effort then he took hold and began to climb the rope it started out better than he had feared but soon got worse his arms tired quickly since they had been none too fresh to begin with he clamped his legs about the rope hanging on to give his arms a rest but they recovered reluctantly oh for some healing elixir still jewel was waiting and so were the rats and goblins he could not afford to delay too long excruciatingly he dragged himself up with smaller and smaller wrenches his breath rasped his head felt light and his arms seemed to turn into waterlogged wood just beyond the elbows but he kept moving so suddenly it seemed a miracle he was at the top maybe his mind had simply gone a bit dead too cutting out the agony of the continuing effort and revived when he arrived he clung to the big root which was somewhat furry the better to grip its prey perhaps he had never before this adventure anticipated gladly embracing a tangle tree he sung a leg over missed and felt himself falling it was almost a relief this relaxation but the rope was still there and he wrapped himself about it and hung panting so little to go so hard to do there was a knot up near the apex bink braced his feet against it and used his relatively fresh leg muscles to push him up and somehow scrambled around the root now he perceived that rough bark underlay the fur on top making it good for clinging to good for scrambling he clung and scrambled and finally inched over to the top of it and lay there panting weakly too worn out even to feel proper relief binkl jewel cried from below are you all right that roused him his labor was far from over i should be asking you that are the rats staying back can you get in the seat to come up he didnt know how he would pull up her weight in his present state but he couldnt tell her that im not all right im not coming up jewel get up the rope the rats cant reach you there if you pull the end up after you its not the rats bink ive lived down here all my life i can handle the rats and even the goblins as long as i have my light its you you are a handsome man me i dont understand but he was beginning to she was not referring to his present appearance which was homelier than chesters face the signs had been there he had merely refused to interpret them when you took the potion you remained an honest person jewel called you were strong stronger than any nymph could be you never used the potion as an excuse to betray your quest or your friends i respected and envied that quality hi you and tried to use it as a model the only exception was that one kiss you stole so i stole it back i love you bhik and now but you never drank that potion he protested and even if you had now that the magic is gone i never drank that potion she agreed therefore the loss of magic could not take my love away growth was forced upon me driving out my nymphly innocence now i can perceive reality and i know there can be no antidote but time for me i can not go with you but you have no life down there bink cried appalled his love for her had been magic hers for him was real she loved better than he had her nymphhood was indeed behind her there must be some way to work it out there is and i am utilizing it when i saw how you sacrificed me when the spell was on you i knew there could be no hope at all when it was off it is ironic that my love bloomed only when you gave me up because you gave me up because you were true to your principles and your prior commitment now i shall be true to mine farewell bink no he cried come out of there there has to be some better way but the rope was sliding and bumping over the root she had untied it at the bottom part of the loop and was drawing it free he grabbed for it too late the end passed over the root and dropped into the darkness jewel he cried dont do this i dont love you but i do like you i but that was a dead end she was right even when he had loved her he had known he could not have her that was unchanged there was no answer from below the nymph had done the honorable thing and gone her way alone freeing him exactly as he would have done in that circumstance there was nothing he could do now but go home farewell jewel he called hoping she would hear you may not have my love but you do have my respect you are a woman now he rested listening but heard nothing more from her finally he got off the root and looked about he was in a deep cleft that he now recognized as a section of the gap the great chasm that cleft the land of xanth in twain the tree was anchored hi the bottom but reached up toward the top and a branch extended over the rim in the absence of magic the tree was safe to climb in fact the terrain would hold few direct threats for him now he could proceed directly to the kings palace arriving there within a day he spied some inert bugs they were lying in a patch of sunlight their pincers twitching bink felt compassion and nudged them gently toward the nearest shadow with one foot poor little things then he recognized them these were nickelpedes shorn of their magic what a fall they had taken but when he swung himself from the last tentacle of the tangler and reached the surface he discovered it to be unfamiliar this crevice ran northsouth not eastwest unless the loss of magic had somehow turned the sun around it had to be a different chasm not the gap he was lost after all now that he thought about it he doubted he could have come as far north as the gap so he was probably somewhere south of it and south of the palace his best bet was to travel north until he encountered the gap or some other familiar landmark the trek was more difficult than he had anticipated there was no hostile magic truebut there was also no beneficial magic the nature of the landscape had changed fundamentally becoming mundane there were no flying fruits no shoetrees or jeanbushes to replace his ragged apparel no watermelons to drink from he had to find ordinary food and water and hardly knew what to look for the animals stunned by their loss of magic avoided him they werent smart enough to realize that he too had been shorn of magic that was a blessing it was late afternoon how many hours or days he had spent below he could not be sure but here in the sight of the sun he would be able to keep track again he would have to spend the night in the forest it seemed safe enough be could climb a tree he looked for a good one many of the trees of this forest seemed dead perhaps they were merely dormant in this new winter of the absence of magic it might take months or years for the full ravages of that winter to become known some trees flourished they must be the mundane varieties freed from the competition of magic would he be better off in a healthy mundane tree or a defunct magical one buik shivered it was getting chill and he could find no blanket bushes however it was not merely temperature that affected him he was tired and lonely and full of remorse for what he had done tomorrow he would have to face his friends at the palace and tell them but surely they would already have guessed his guilt it was not confession that bothered him but punishment jewel had been wise to avoid him he had no future at home there seemed to be a certain vague familiarity about this region there were trails through the brush like those of ant lions and brambles and regions of odoriferous plants thats it he exclaimed where we intersected the magic highway to the magicdust village he peered up through the languishing foliage there it wasa walkway fashioned from logs and vines suspended from the stoutest trees it made no loops in air but of course it wasnt magic now he climbed aboard the lowest loop and walked along it the thing seemed dangerously insecure sagging beneath his weight and swinging sidewise alarmingly but it held in due course it brought him to the village he had feared a scene of gloom instead the entire village seemed to be celebrating another great bonfire was blazing and men and women of all types were dancing around it men how had they gotten here this was a village of womenl could it be another wave of conquest from mundania with the brutish men reveling in this village of helpless women yet there seemed to be no threat the men were happy of coursebut so were the women bink walked on into the village looking for trolla its leader a man spied him as he stepped off the hanging walk hello friend the man called welcome home whos your widow widow bink asked blankly your womanbefore the gorgon got you shell be overjoyed to have you back the gorgonl suddenly bmk understood youre the stone men freed by the loss of magic and you werent the man laughed youd better come see the head man then trolla bink said if shes still here whos looking for trolla someone demanded it was a huge ugly troll well an average troll they were all huge and ugly bulks hand hovered near the hilt of his sword i only want to talk with her sokay the troll said genially he cupped his mouth with his hands bitch get over here a dozen young women glanced his way startled thinking he meant them bink covered a smile uh the gorgon he said what happened to her oh we were going to string her up after we you know the troll said she was a goodlooking slut except for those snaky tangles in her hair but she jumped into the lake and before we realized there werent any more monsters in it she was too far off to catch last we saw she was headed north north toward magician humfreys castle bink was glad she had escaped but knew she would not find humfrey at home that was another aspect of the tragedy bink had wrought trolla responsive to the summons was arriving bink she exclaimed you made it i made it he agreed gravely i abolished magic from the land of xanth i converted it to mundania now i return home to pay the penalty the penalty the troll cried you freed us all youre a hero this was an aspect bink hadnt considered then you arent angry at the loss of magic angry trolla cried angry that my husband is back good enough to eat she hugged the troll to her in an embrace that would have cracked normal ribs he was well able to sustain this though he seemed momentarily uneasy about something a female griffin glided up awk she inquired and heres the one who guided you released from the midasspell trolla said where is your handsome griffin bink thought it best not to tell about the bottle he is confined he was actually a transformed man he spoke well of the lady griffin but he sends his regrets the griffiness turned away disappointed apparently she did not have a male of her own perhaps she would find a male of her land soonthough with the alteration of form that was slowly taking place in such magical creatures bink wondered whether that male would be more like an eagle or more like a lion or would the present griffins retain their shapes while their offspring would be eagles and lions suppose crombie emerged from the bottle but retained his griffin form would he then find this griffiness worthwhile if so what would their offspring be the loss of magic posed as many questions as the presence of magic come we shall fete you royally tonight and you shall tell us the whole story trolla said i uh im pretty tired bink demurred id rather not tell the story my friend the good magicianis missing and so is the centaur and the memories yes you need distraction trolla agreed we do have a few leftover females daughters of older villagers they are very lonely at the moment and uh no thanks please bink said quickly he had broken too many hearts already just some food and a place to spend the night if theres room were short of room our population has just doubled but the girls will tend to you it will give them something to do theyll be glad to share their rooms bink was too tired to protest further but as it turned out the girls were an assortment of fairies and lady elves who paid him flattering attention but were not really interested hi him as a man they made a game out of feeding him odds and ends each one putting her morsel in his mouth with her own little hands twittering merrily they wouldnt let him have a plate everything had to be trotted in from another room piecemeal then he lay in a bed made out of thirty small colored pillows while the fairies flitted around the breeze from their gossamer wings fanning him they could no longer fly of course and soon their wings would fall off as they reverted to mundane forms but at the moment they were cute he went to sleep counting the creatures that leaped merrily over him hi the course of their game of followtheleader but in the morning he had to face reality again the bleak journey home he was glad his quest had done at least this little bit of good perhaps his talent had planned it this way before being nullified by the loss of magic so as to provide him with a good safe place for this night but as for the rest of xanthwhat hope remained for it the griffiness accompanied him for a distance guiding him again and in a surprisingly brief time he was up to the dead forest halfway familiar territory it was no longer so different from the rest of the wilderness he thanked her wished her well and continued on alone northward the loneliness closed in about him the lack of magic was so pervasive and depressing all the little amenities he was accustomed to were gone there were no blue toads sitting on their squat vegetable stools no indian pipes wafting their sweet smoke aloft no trees moved their branches out of his way or cast avoidancespells on him everything was hopelessly mundane he felt tired again and not merely from the march was life really worthwhile without magic well chameleon would be locked in her normal phase the one he liked best neither pretty nor smart but rather nice overall yes he could live with that for some time before it got dull assuming that he was allowed to he paused he heard a clipclop as of hooves on a beaten path an enemy he hardly cared it was company hallooo he cried yes it was a womans voice he charged toward it there standing on a beaten path was a lady centaur she was not especially pretty her flanks were dull her tail tangled with burrs and her human torso and face though obviously feminine were not well proportioned a colt followed her and he was not only unhandsome he was downright homely except for his sleek hindquarters in fact he resembled chester bink exclaimed thats chesters coltl why youre bink the filly said now he recognized her cherie chesters mate yet she was in no way the beauty he had ridden before what had happened but he had enough sense to express himself obliquely what are you doing here i thought you were staying in the centaur village until but that was a trap too for chester would never return im trotting to the palace to find out what is responsible for the miracle she said do you realize that obscenity has been banished from xanth bink remembered cherie considered magic obscene at least when it manifested in centaurs she tolerated it as a necessary evil hi others for she regarded herself as a liberalminded filly but preferred to discuss it only clinically well he had the detail on itl he was glad that at least one person liked the change im afraid im responsible you abolished magic she asked startled its a long story bink said and a painful one i dont expect others to accept it as well as you will get on my back she said you travel too slow ill take you hi to the palace and you can tell me the whole story im dying to knowl she might be dying literally when she learned the truth about chester but he had to tell her bink mounted and hung on as she broke into a trot he had anticipated a daylong march but now this would be unnecessary she would get them to the palace before dark he told her the story he found himself going into more detail than strictly necessary and realized this was because he dreaded the denouementwhere chester had fought his dreadful battle and lost true he might have won had the evil eye intended for bink not stunned himbut that would be scant comfort to her cherie was a widowand he had to be the one to tell her his narrative was interrupted by a bellow a dragon hove into viewbut it was a miserable monster the oncebright scales had faded into mottled gray when it snorted fire only dust emerged the thing was already looking gaunt and ill it depended on magic for its hunting nevertheless the dragon charged intent on consuming centaur rider and colt bink drew his sword and cherie skittered lightly on her feet ready to kick even a bedraggled dragon of this size was a terror then bink saw a scar on the dragons neck say dont i know you he exclaimed the dragon paused then it lifted its head in a signal of recognition chester and crombie and i met this dragon and made a truce bink said we fought the nickelpedes together the nickelpedes are harmless now cherie said their pincers have lost their she pursed her lips distastefully their magic i trotted right down inside the gap and stepped on them and they couldnt hurt me bmk knew dragon magic is gone from xanth bink told it youll have to learn to hunt and fight without your fire in time you will change into your dominant mundane component or your offspring will i think that would be a large snake im sorry the dragon stared at him in horror then it whipped about and halfgalloped halfslithered off im sorry too cherie said i realize now that xanth isnt really xanth without magic spells do have their place creatures like thatmagic is natural to them this was a considerable concession for her bulk resumed his narrative he could stall no longer so nerved himself and said what he had to so i have crombie here in the bottle he concluded and waited aware of the awful tenseness in her body but chester and humfrey remain below he said because i freed the demon but you dont know they are dead she said her body still so tense that riding her was uncomfortable they can be found brought back i dont know how bink said glumly he didnt like this at all humfreys probably just lost thats why you couldnt find his body dazed by the collapse without his informational magic he could be confused for a goblin and chesterhes too ornery totohes not dead hes just pickled you said that was a preservative lake so i did bink agreed ibut it was drained so that i could see the convolutions of the brain coral it wasnt drained all the way hes down there deep below i know it like the griffin in the bottle we can find him revive him bink shook his head not without magic she bucked him off bink flew through the ah saw the ground coming at his head knew that his talent would do nothingand landed hi cheries arms she had leaped to catch him at the last moment sorry bhik its just that obscenity bothers me centaurs dont she righted him and set him on his feet never completing her statement she might not be beautiful now but she had the centaur strength strength not beauty she had been a magnificently breasted creature in the time of magic now she remained ample but she sagged somewhat as most human or humanoid females of similar measurement did her face had been delightfully pert now it was plain what could account for the sudden change except the loss of magic let me get this straight bink said you feel all magic is obscene not all magic bink for some of you it seems to be naturalbut youre only human for a centaur it is a different matter were civilized suppose centaurs had magic too her face shaped into controlled disgust we had better be on our way before it gets too late there is a fair distance yet to cover like herman the hermit chesters uncle bulk persisted he could summon willothewisps he was exiled from our society she said her expression had a surly quality that reminded him of chester suppose other centaurs had magicm bink why are you being so offensive do you want me to have to leave you here in the wilderness she beckoned to her colt who came quickly to her side suppose you yourself had a magic talent bink asked would you still consider it obscene that does it she snorted i will not endure such obnoxious behavior even from a human come chet and she started off damn it filly listen to me bink cried you know why chester came on my quest because he wanted to discover his own magic talent if you deny magic in centaurs you deny himbecause he does have magic good magic that she spun about raising her forehooves to strike him down a filly she might be but she could kill him with a single blow bink danced back good magic he repeated not anything stupid like turning green leaves purple or negative like giving people hotfeet he plays a magic flute a silver flute the most lovely music i ever heard deep inside hes an awfully pretty person but hes suppressed it becausem im going to stomp you absolutely flat she neighed smashing at him with both forefeet you have no right even to suggest but he was cool now while she was halfbunded by rage he avoided her strikes as he would those of a savage unicorn without ever turning his back or retreating more than he had to he could have stabbed her six times with his sword but never drew it this debate was all academic now since magic was gone from xanth but he was perversely determined that she should admit the truth and you cherieyou have magic too you make yourself look the way you want to look you enhance yourself its a type of illusion restricted to she struck at him with both forefeet at once in a perfect fury he was affronting her deepest sensitivities telling her that she herself was obscene but he was ready anticipating her reactions avoiding them his voice was his sword and he intended to score with it he had had too much of delusion his own especially he would wipe the whole slate clean in a way it was himself he was attacking his shame at what he had done to xanth when he freed the demon i challenge you he cried look at yourself in a lake see the difference your magic is gone even hi her fury she realized she was not getting anywhere all right ill look she cried then ill kick you to the moon as it happened they had passed a small pond recently they returned to it hi silence bink already starting to be sorry for what he was doing to her and the lady centaur looked at herself she was certain what she would find yet honest enough to have her certainty disrupted by the fact oh no she cried shocked im homely im hideous im uglier than chester no youre beautifulwith magic bink insisted wanting to make up for the revelation he had forced on her because magic is natural to you as it is to me you have no more reason to oppose it than you do any other natural function like eating or breeding or get away from me she screamed you monster you in another fit of fury she stamped her hoof in the pond making a splash but the water only settled back as water did and the ripples quieted and the image returned with devastating import listen cherie bink cried you pointed out that chester can be rescued im just building on that i dont dare open crombies bottle because the process requires magic and there is none chester must stay in the lake for the same reason in suspended animation we need magic it doesnt matter whether we like it without it chester is dead we cant get anywhere as long as you with extreme reluctance she nodded agreement i thought nothing would make me tolerate obscenity but for chester i would do anything even she gulped and twitched her tail even magic but we need a new quest bink said with sudden inspiration as he washed himself in the pond a quest to restore magic to the land of xanth maybe if we all work together humans and centaurs and all xanths creatures we can find another demon but he petered out realizing the futility of the notion how could they summon xfan or efar or any other superrnagical entity the demons had no interest in this realm yes cherie agreed finding hope as bink lost it maybe the king will know how to go about it get on my back im going to gallop bink remounted her and she took off she did not have the sheer power chester had but bink had to cling to her slender waist to stay on as she zoomed through the forest and with magic ill be beautiful again she murmured into the wind wistfully bink tired nodded sleepily as cherie charged on through the desolate wilderness then he was almost pitched off as she braked they faced a huge shaggy pair of creatures make way you monsters cherie cried without rancor they were after all monsters this is a public easement you cant block it we not block it centaur lass one monster said you give way to let we pass crunch the ogre bink exclaimed what are you doing so far from home you know this monster cherie asked bink i certainly do whats more now i can understand him without translation the ogre who now resembled a brute of a man peered at bink from beneath his low skull you man we met the one on quest me on gooeyrooon with she loved best gooeymoon cherie murmured oh so thats sleeping beauty bink said contemplating the ogress she was as ugly a creature as he cared to imagine yet beneath her hair which resembled a mop just used to wipe up vomit and her baggy coarse dress she seemed to have rather more delicate contours than one might expect in an ogress then he remembered she was no true ogress but an actress playing a part in one of the fiends productions she could probably look beautiful if she tried why then was she not trying uh one question the female no dummy caught his gist before he got it out true me once have other face she told bink me glad get out of that rat race me find man better than any fiend me like it best by he be queened so the prima donna had found a husband worthy of her attention after meeting the fiends bink found himself hi agreement with her choice she was maintaining the ogress guise which was in any event merely a physical reflection of her normal personality while teaching crunch to speak more intelligibly one savvy lady fiend there uh congratulations bink said aside he explained to cherie they married on our advice humfrey and crombie and chester and the golem and i except that humfrey was asleep it was quite a story im sure cherie agreed dubiously yes me bash he good the fair sheogre said he head like wood ogres are very passionate bink murmured cherie after her initial surprise was quick to catch on how do you keep his love she inquired with a certain female mischief doesnt he like to go out adventuring bink realized she was thinking of chester perhaps unconsciously me let he go me never say no the ogress said full of the wisdom of her sex when he come back me give he crack she struck the ogre with a horrendous backhand wallop by way of example just as well for bink had been about to misunderstand the reference make he feel like beast then give he feast crunchs face contorted into a smile of agreement he was obviously well satisfied and probably better off bink thought than he might have been with a natural ogress who would have taken his nature for granted whatever faults the actress might have she certainly knew how to handle her male tjoes the loss of magic interfere with your lifestyle bink inquired both ogres looked at him blankly they never noticed cherie exclaimed theres true love for you the ogre couple went on its way and cherie resumed her run but she was thoughtful bink just as a rhetorical exampledoes a male really like to feel like a beast yes sometimes bink agreed thinking of chameleon when she was in her stupidbeautiful phase she seemed to live only to please him and he felt extremely manly but when she was in her smartugly phase she turned him off with her wit as well as her appearance in that respect she was smarter when she was stupid than when she was smart of course now all that was over she would stay always in her normal phase avoiding the extremes she would never turn him offor on and a centaurif he felt nice a real stallion at home yes males need to feel wanted and needed and dominant even when they arent especially at home that ogress knows what shes doing so it seems cherie agreed shes a complete fake a mere actress yet hes so happy hed do anything for her but lady centaurs can act too when they nave reason then she was silent as she ran chapter paradox wish dink nodding again was suddenly jolted awake cherie was braking so hard he was being crushed against her human back he threw his arms about her waist hanging on careful not to grab too high what i almost forgot i havent nursed chet in hours chet bhik repeated dazedly oh the foal she signaled to her young one who promptly came up to nurse sink hastily excused himself for another kind of call of nature centaurs were not sensitive about natural functions hi fact they could and did perform some of them on the run humans were more squeamish at least in public it made him realize one reason why cherie did not seem as lovely now her breasts were enlarged to the point of ponderosity so that she could nurse her foal little centaurs required a great deal of milk especially when they had to run as much as this one did after a decent interval sink cautiously returned the foal was still nursing but cherie spied bink oh dont be so damned human she snapped what do you think im doingmagic bink had to laugh embarrassed she had a point he had no more occasion to let his squeamishness interfere with business than she did his definitions of what might be obscene made no more sense than hers he came forward albeit diffidently it occurred to him that centaurs were well adapted to their functions had cherie had an udder like a horse the foal would have had a difficult time he was an upright little chap whose human section did not bend down like the neck of a horse were going the wrong way cherie exclaimed oh no you strayed from the path were lost were on the path but we should not be going toward castle roogna nobody there can help but the king the king is just an ordinary man now what can he do bink sighed he had just assumed king trent would have some sort of answer but cherie was right what can anyone do without he was trying to spare her the use of the obscene word though he knew this was foolish nursing chet started me thinking she said giving the foal a loving pat on the head here is my foal chesters colt a representative of the dominant species of xanth what am i doing running away from chester chet needs a real stud to teach rum the facts of life i could never forgive myself if but youre not running away bink protested were going to the king to find out what to do in the absence ofhow we can oh go ahead say itl she exclaimed angrily magic you have shown me hi your blundering human way that it is necessary and integral to our way of life including my own private personal life damn you now im taking the rationale further we cant just go home and commiserate with former magicians we have to do something now immediately before its too late its already too late bink said the demon is gone but maybe he hasnt gone far maybe he forgot something and will return to fetch it and we can trap him no that wouldnt be right i meant it when i freed him even though i dont like the result of that freedom you have integrity bink inconvenient as it sometimes is maybe we can call him back talk to him persuade him to give us back a few spells bink shook his head no nothing we can do will influence the demon xanth he doesnt care at all about our welfare if you had met him youd know she turned her head to face him maybe id better meet him then how can i get it through your equine brain bink cried exasperated i told you hes gone all the same i want to see where he was there might be something left something you missed no offense bink but you are only human if there were some way we could there is no way bink cried chester had been stubborn enough but this filly listen bink you rubbed my nose hi the fact of my need of magic now im rubbing yours in the fact of your need to do something instead of just giving in you may tell yourself youre going to fetch help but actually youre just running away the solution to our problem is at the prison of the demon not at the kings palace maybe well failbut we do have to go back there and try and she started back the way they had come youve been there show me the way involuntarily he ran along beside her very much like the foal to the cave of the demon he asked incredulously there are goblins and demagicked dragons and to hell with all that obscenity she neighed who knows what is happening to chester now there it was her ultimate loyalty to her mate now that he thought of it that way his own attitude seemed inferior maybe his humanity did make him imperfect why hadnt he stayed at least long enough to locate his friend because he had been afraid of what he might find he had indeed been running away maybe chester could be hauled out of the brine and saved without the aid of magic maybe good magician humfrey yet survived a small chance certainly but so long as there was any chance at all bink was derelict in his duty to his friends by not making every possible effort to find them he had the sick certainty that they were dead but even that confirmation would be better than his hiding from the truth he climbed back aboard cherie and she launched herself onward they made amazingly good progress soon they had passed the place where they had encountered each other and were galloping across the terrain in the direction bink indicated a centaur could really movebut even so it was almost as if there were some magic enchantment facilitating their progress that was an illusion of course and not a magical one it was just that cherie was now goaded by her eagerness to rescue her stallion foolish as that ambition might be bink directed her to the tangletree cleft bypassing the magicdust village as they galloped up it seemed to bink that the tangler quivered that had to be a trick of the fading light since without magic the monster was impotent cherie drew up to the branch that overlapped the rim of the chasm climbing down a tangle treei find that hard to she broke ofi bink it moved i saw it the wind bink cried with abrupt illumination it rustles the tendrils of course she agreed relieved for a moment i almost thoughtbut i knew it wasnt so bink peered down into the crevasse and spied the crack in its base where the trees big root crossed he really did not want to go down there again but didnt want to admit it iuhi can swing down on a vine but you i can swing down too she said thats why centaurs have strong arms and good chest muscles we have greater weight to support come chet she grasped a large tentacle and stepped off the brink sure enough she was able to let herself down hand under hand with her front legs acting as brakes her posterior swung grandly around in a descending spiral until she reached the base the colt followed her example though with such difficulty that she hastened to catch him at the base embarrassed by their examples bink swung down himself he should have led the way instead of letting fillies and foals do it at the base of the tree gazing down into the looming black hole that was the aperture to the underworld bink had further misgivings this descent is worse i dont think chet can make it and how could you climb up again it nearly killed me getting to the top and your weightno offense chester could climb it cherie said confidently then he could haul the rest of us up bink visualized the muscles of chesters human torso and remembered the colossal power of the centaur only a monster like the ogre had more strength of arm maybe just maybe it was possible especially if they set up a double rope so the rest of them could haul on the other end and help chester lift himself but that presumed they would actually find and rescue chester if they failed cherie herself would be lost for bink could never haul her up he might handle the foal but that was the limit cherie was already testing tangler tentacles for strength she had faith that banished doubt and bink envied her that he had always thought of chester as the ornery one but now he understood that the true strength of the family lay in cherie chester was mere magic putty in her handsoops obscene concept and so also it seemed was bink he did not want to return to the horrors of the depths to battle uselessly against the halfgoblins and snakedragons in the dark but he knew he would do it because cherie was going to rescue her poor dead stallion or else this ones good she announced tugging at a particularly long stout tentacle that dangled from the very top of the tree bink you climb up and sever it with your knife uh yeah sure he said with imperfect enthusiasm then he was ashamed of himself if he was going to do this thing at least he should do it with some spirit yes of course and he started to climb the dread trunk he experienced a strange uplift and exhilaration it was as if a burden had been lifted from his body in a moment he realized what it was conscience now that he had made his decision and knew it was right even if suicidal he was at peace with his conscience and it was wonderful this was what cherie had experienced which had made her almost fly through the wilderness her strength expanded even without magic there was magic in a persons attitude he reached the point where the tentacles sprouted like grotesque hairs from the apex of the trunk braced himself with his legs looped about it and slashed into the base of the selected tentacle and felt a shudder in the tree reminiscent of the one made by the tangler crombie had attacked so long ago no he reminded himself immediately it was not magic the tree was still alive it had merely lost its magic and become as mundane trees it might feel the pain of the cut and react but would not be able to move its tentacles about consciously he severed the tentacle and watched it drop then he cut a second and a third to be sure they had enough yet the tree was still shuddering as he descended and the hanging tentacles seemed to be quivering more than might reasonably be accounted for by the wind would it be possible for a tangler to revive without magic no it must be the effect of his climbing shaking the trunk sending ripples through the vines they tied the first tentacle to the root knotting it with difficulty because of its diameter and dangled it down it seemed to swing freely marvelously limber so they hauled it back up with some care they knotted another tentacle to its end extending its effective length this time they heard the thump as it struck the rock below ill go first bink said then ill stand guard with my sword while you lower chet there are goblins uh have we anything for a light we need fire to scare away the cherie gave him a straight stare if you were a goblin would you mess with a centaur foal she tapped one forefoot meaningfully bink remembered how he had foiled her attack not long ago when he forced her to face the obscene concept but he was twice the height of a goblin and armed with a sword and familiar with centaurs most important he had known that whatever cheries rage of the moment she was his friend and would not really hurt him no goblin had any such assurance and a centaur filly protecting her young would be a terror i would not mess with a centaur foal even if i were a dragon he said i can see in the dark a little when i have to she continued i can hear the echoes of my hooves so ill know the approximate contours to the caves well get there without another word bink leaned down grasped the tentacle rope and swung himself into the hole he handed himself into the depths rapidly feeling much stronger than he had during the ascent with surprising suddenness he was past the knot and at the floor he peered up at the wan illumination above okay im down the rope writhed up as cherie hauled it centaurs had excellent balance for this sort of thing since they could plant four feet on the ground and devote the full strength of their arms to the task soon chet came swinging down the rope looped about his middle while he held on lightly with his hands in all this time he had spoken no word and made no demand or complaint bink was sure that would change drastically as chet matured bink untied the little fellow at the base and gave him a pat on the back chefs finel he called now it was cheries turn she had made it into the crevasse all right but this was a narrower darker longer haul with a less secure rope and bink was privately worried stand clear hi case i should swing she called bink knew she had almost said fall she was well aware of the hazard but she had courage she swung down without event handing herself along until she neared the floor then the narrowing tentacle snapped dropping her the last few feet but she landed squarely unhurt bink relaxed all right bmk she said immediately get on my back and tell me where to go silently bink went to mount herand in that silence he heard something somethings moving he snapped surprised to discover how nervous he was wheres chet right here beside me she said they listenedand now it was plain a scraping rustling sound off to the side and up definitely not any of them yet it didnt sound like goblins either then bink saw a snakelike thing writhing between them and the hole silhouetted by the light a tangler rootits movingl he exclaimed we must have jarred it loose from the earth she said its own weight is pulling it free and its shape makes it twist as it drops yes but bink was uncertain that looked too much like conscious motion could the tangler be animating again if so there would be no escape this wayl they started along the cavern trail bink found he remembered it fairly well even hi the darkand he found he could see a little maybe some glow remained actually it seemed to get brighter as his eyes adjusted the glowits returning cherie said i thought it was my imagination bink agreed maybe there is some residual magic down here they moved on more rapidly bink couldnt help wondering if the tangler was coming back to life and the glow was getting brighter could that mean that magic was returning the implications were suddenly the passage debouched intoa palace chamber so large he could not readily compass it with his gaze jewels sparkled on every side hanging brilliantly in air a fountain of scintillating water spread out upside down its droplets falling back toward the ceiling streamers of colored paper formed whirls and whorls that traveled as if by their own volition tilting sidewise or curling into spirals only to straighten out again on every side were fresh wonders too many to assimilate in all it was a display of the most phenomenal magic bink had seen there had been no cave like this in this region before cherie looked around as startled as he is could this be the work of your demon xanth as she spoke the name the demon xcan materialized he sat in a throne of solid diamond his glowing eye fixed on bink who still bestrode cherie while the foal pressed closely to her side you are the one i want x th exclaimed you stupid nonentity who threw yourself and your whole culture into peril for no likely gain to either such idiocy deserves the penalty it brings bink awed nevertheless tried to defend himself why did you return then what do you want with me they have changed the nomenclature system x tb replied they are into differentials now i shall have to study that system for an eon or two lest i apply it with gaucherie so i am returning to this familiar place for the moment an eonmoment bink asked incredulously approximately i brought you here to ensure that my privacy will be preserved every entity of this world that knows of me must be abolished abolished bink asked stunned nothing personal the demon assured him i really dont care about your existence one way or the other but if my presence is known other vermin may seek me outand i want to be left alone so i must abolish you and the others who are aware of me preserving my secret most of you have already been eliminated only you and the nymph remain leave jewel out of it bink pleaded shes innocent she only came because of me she doesnt deserve this filly and her foal are innocent too the demon pointed out this has no relevance cherie turned to face bink her human torso twisted in the supple manner he remembered of old and her beauty was back to its original splendor magic became her without doubt you freed this thingand this is his attitude why doesnt he go elsewhere where none of us can find him hes leaked a lot of magic here bink said it is quiescent without him but so long as magical creatures like dragons and centaurs remain we know it hasnt departed entirely the whole of the land of xanth is steeped with it and this must be more comfortable for him like a wellworn shoe instead of one fresh from the shoetree that chafes the demon is not of our kind he has no gratitude i knew that when i freed him there will be a brief delay before i terminate you the demon said make yourselves comfortable despite his immediate peril bink was curious why the delay the nymph has hidden herself and i do not choose to expend magic wastefully in an effort to locate her but you are omnipotent waste should have no meaning to you truei am omnipotent but there is proportion in all things it bothers my sensitivities to use more magic than a given situation warrants therefore i am minimizing the effort here i have amplified your persona she loves youi do not pretend to know the meaning of that termand will come to you here believing you to be in a danger she can ameliorate then i can conveniently abolish you all so the return of magic to the land of xanth meant the end for bink and his friends yet the rest of xanth profited so it was not a total loss still i dont suppose you would be satisfied if we simply promised not to reveal your presence or took a forgetpotion no good a voice said from binks pocket it was grundy the golem back in form with the restoration of magic he climbed out to perch on binks shoulder you could never keep such a promise magic would have the truth out of you in a moment even if you took a forgetpotion it would be neutralized then the information would be exposed a truth spell cherie agreed i should have trusted my original judgment magic is a curse bink refused to give up maybe we should reverse it he told the demon spread the word to all the land that you are down here and will destroy anyone who intrudes youd encourage ninetynine nuts to rise to the challenge cherie pointed out the demon would be constantly annoyed and have to waste his magic destroying them one by one the demon looked at her approvingly you have an equine rear but a sapient head he remarked centaurs do she agreed and what do you think of mem you are the absolute epitome of obscenity sink froze but the demon laughed the sound blasted out deafeningly the magically ornate palace shattered about him filling the air with debris but none of it touched them know something grundy remarked hes changinglike me changinglike you bink repeated of coursel while his magic was leaking out infusing the whole land of xanth some of our culture was seeping in making him a little bit like us thats why he feels comfortable here thats why he can laugh he does have some crude feelings cherie was right on it which means he might respond to a feeling challenge can you come up with one i can try bmk said then as the demons mirth subsided he said demon i know a way to protect your privacy we have a shieldstone formerly used to protect the whole land of xanth from intrusion by outsiders we valued our privacy as much as you value yours nothing living can pass through that shield all i need to do is tell our king trent about you and he will set up the shield to prevent anyone from coming down here the shield worked for us for over a century it will work for you too then it wont matter who knows about you every fool who tries to reach you will die automatically the demon considered the notion appeals but the human mind and motivation are largely foreign to me how can i be sure your king will honor your request i know he will bink said hes a good man an honest one and a savvy politician he wiu immediately appreciate the need to protect your privacy and will act on it how sure of that are you the demon asked td stake my life on it your life is insignificant compared to my convenience the demon said without humor but my talent is significant in human terms bink argued it will act in my interest by encouraging the king to your talent is nothing to me i could reverse it by a simple snap of my fingers the demon snapped his fingers with a sound like the detonation of a cherry bomb bink felt a horribly disquieting internal wrench however your challenge intrigues me there is a certain element of chance involved that can not occur when i myself undertake a challenge therefore i must indulge myself to a certain extent vicariously you say you shall stake your life on your ability to preserve my privacy this is really no collateral since your life is already forfeit but ill accept it shall we gamble yes bulk agreed if thats what it takes to save my friends ill undertake any binfc i dont like this cherie said here is the testing laboratory the demon said indicating a huge pit that appeared as he gestured around it were spaced half a dozen doorways the walls were vertical stone too high and slick to climb and here is the intruder a monster appeared in the center a minotaur with the head and tail and hooves of a bull and the body of a powerful man if he escapes this chamber alive he will intrude on my privacy you will stop him if you can done bulk cried he jumped down into the arena drawing his sword the minotaur surveyed him coolly the return of magic had invigorated bink making him feel strong againand he had never been a physical weakling the muscles of his arms showed through the tattered shirt and his body was balanced and responsive his sword moved with smooth proficiency buoyed by its magic and the charmed blade gleamed the monster decided to pass up the pleasure of this quarrel it spun on one hoof and walked toward the exit farthest from binfc binfc pursued it turn about and fight like a monster he cried unwilling to cut it down from behind instead the creature broke into a run but bulks momentum carried him forward faster and he caught the minotaur before it reached the exit he hauled on its tail causing the thing to crash into a wall bink put his sword to its throat yield he cried the minotaur shiveredand became a monster bug with tremendous pincers stinger and mandibles bink startled stepped back he was fighting a magic monsterone that could change its form at willl this was going to be a much more formidable challenge than he had in his naivet supposed what a fool he had been to hold back his sword expecting this thing to yield surely its life like his own would be forfeit if it lost he had to kill it in a hurry before it killed himor got away which amounted to the same thing even while he realized this the bug was skittering toward the exit bink leaped after it his sword swinging but the bug had eyestalks that looked back at himin fact it was now a giant slug sliding along on a trail of slime binks sword swished over its head harmlessly he could however move faster than a slug even a large one bink jumped over it and reached the exit first barring the way he took careful aim and made a twohanded strike at the slugs head to slice it lengthwise but his blade clanged off the shell of a snail the monster had changed again to the nearest variant that would protect it either it was hardpressed or it lacked imagination bink gave it no chance to think he thrust directly into the opening of the shell this time he scoredon the substance of a big green jellyfish his blade sliced through it and emerged from the far side dripping without really hurting the blob he carried his stroke on up and out and shook the blade off disgusted how could he kill a mass of jelly that sealed up after his cut he sniffed now he recognized the odor of the thing lime limeflavored jelly was it edible could he destroy the monster by eating it but as he pondered the monster changed into a purple vulture the size of a man bink leaped for it trying to slay it before it flew up beyond his reach and skidded on the remaining patch of lime goo what a disastrous coincidence coincidence nothis was his talent operatingin reverse the demon had negligently switched it now seeming coincidence would always work against bink instead of for him he was his own worst enemy still he had done all right for himself when his talent had been largely canceled out by the brain corals magic what be needed to do now was to minimize the element coincidence played in this battle his talent never revealed itself openly so was restricted awaiting its chance to operate everything he did should be so carefully planned that it left virtually nothing to chance that way chance could not operate against him the bird did not fly it ran toward the center of the arena bink scrambled to his feet and pursued watching his step here was a pebble that he might have tripped over there was another spot of grease his prior slip in the jelly had been mainly carelessness he could immunize that but why didnt the bird simply fly while bink was being so careful of his motions probably because the monster was not a magician each form it assumed was about the same mass and landbound a good talent but not an extraordinary one there were definite limits kong trent could change a fly into a hephalumph or a worm into a flying dragon size and function were of no account but this monster only changed its form not its abilities good bink stalked the vulture alert for any move it might make toward the exit to flee him it would have to turn its back and then he would strike it down no element of chance involved there so no way for his reversed talent to intercede binks early life when he had not known about his talent had prepared him for operating without it his recent adventures when it had been either neutralized or eliminated entirely had served as a refresher course the monster would have to stand and fight rather than depending on bink to foul up suddenly it was a mana burly touslehaired brute in tattered clothing carrying a gleaming sword the man looked as if he knew his business in fact he looked familiar in factit was a replica of bink himself the mon ster was getting smart fighting sword with sword fair enough bink said and launched his attack as he had guessed the monster was no swordsman he might look like bink but he couldnt fight the way bink could this battle would soon be over bink made a feint then engaged the others sword and knocked it out of the monsters hand he backed the monster up against the wall ready for the finish bink a woman cried in despair bink recognized that voice it was jewel drawn by the spell the demon had made she had arrived just at the wrong moment it had to be the machination of his reversed talent interfering just in time to save his enemy from destruction unless he acted immediately bink she cried again jumping down into the arena and throwing herself between him and the monster she smelled of a summer storm why didnt you stay out of the caverns where you would be safe then she stopped amazed youre both bink no hes the monster the monster said before bink spoke hes trying to kill an unarmed man for shame jewel flashed facing bink the storm had become a hurricane with the odors of sleet and dust and crushed brick windborne begone monster lets get out of here the monster said to her taking her by the arm and walking toward an exit of all the nerve cherie cried from above get that fool nymph out of there but jewel stayed with the cunning monster escorting him toward safetyand a disaster she could not imagine bink stood frozen unable to bring himself to act against jewel bink shell die too if you let him go cherie screamed that nerved him bink launched himself at the pair catching them each about the waist and hauling them down he intended to separate them stab the monster and explain to jewel later but when he righted himself he discovered that he had a nymph on each arm the monster now resembled jeweland bink couldnt tell them apart he jumped to his feet sword ready jewel identify yourself he shouted the monster could hardly have been smart enough to think of this on its own binks talent had probably decreed such a fortuitous choice of appearances bink had not given it any opportunity to catch him in an accident so it had acted on the monster instead coincidence took many forms me the two nymphs cried together getting to their feet oh no they sounded alike too jewel im fighting a changeshape monster he cried to them both if i dont kill him hell kill me one way or another ive got to know which one he is assuming the monster was male bink had to assume that because he didnt want to kill a female him both nymphs cried pointing at each other the scent of skunk cabbage filled the air both backed away from each other and from him worse and worse now his talent had the bit in its teeth determined not to let him prevail yet he had to kill the monster and to spare jewel he could not afford to choose randomly the nymphs were heading for different exits already it was too late to catch both upon his choice rested the fate of himself and all his friendsand his infernal talent would surely make him choose wrongly no matter which one he chose it would be the wrong one somehow yet to make no choice would also spell doom bink realized that the only way he could be sure of salvaging anything was to kill them both the monster and the nymphwoman who loved him appalling decision unless he could somehow trick the monster into revealing itself you are the monster he cried and charged the nymph on the right swinging his sword she flicked a glance over her shoulder saw him and screamed in mortal terror and the smell of dragons breath the essence of terror was strong bulk completed his swing avoiding her as she cowered and hurled his sword at the second nymph who was almost at the other exit the one he had decided was really the monster but the nearnymph hi her terror threw up her hands defensively one hand brushed binks sword arm just as he threw the weapon fouling his aim his talent again using his friend to balk his attack on his enemy yet it was not over the monster seeing the approaching blade leaped to the sideright into the misthrown sword the blade struck the chest and plunged through such was the force of binks throw and the charm of the weapon transfixed the monster fell two bad lucks had canceled each other out buik meanwhile crashed into jewel bearing her to the floor sorry he said i had to do it to make sure thats quite all right she said struggling to get up bulk got to his own feet and took her by the elbow helping her but his eyes were on the dead or dying monster what was its natural form the monster didnt change it still looked exactly like jewel with full bosom slender waist healthy hips ideal legs and sparkling hairand blood washing out around the embedded sword strange if the monster was mortally injured why didnt it revert to form if it were not why didnt it scramble up and out the exit jewel drew away from him let me go clean up bulk she said at the moment she smeued of nothing of nothing make a smell sink said grabbing her arm again bink let me go she cried pulling toward the exit make a smell he growled twisting her arm behind her back suddenly he held a tangle tree its vines twisted to grab him but they lacked the strength of a real tangler even a dwarf species bink clamped both his arms about the tree squeezing the tentacles in against the trunk hard the tree became a squat sea serpent bink hunched his head down and continued squeezing the serpent became a twoheaded wolf whose jaws snapped at binks ears he squeezed harder he could afford to lose an ear in order to win the battle the wolf became a giant tiger lily snarling horrendously but bink was crushing its stem finally it got smart it changed into a needle cactus the needles stabbed into binks arms and facebut he did not let go the pain was terrible but he knew that if he gave the monster any leeway at all it would change into something he couldnt catch or his talent would arrange some coincidental break for it also he was angry because of this creature he had cut down an innocent nymph whose only fault was loving him he had assumed that jinxes had canceled out when his misthrown sword cut her down but that had not been the case what an awful force his talent could bel his hands and face were bleeding and a needle was poking into one eye but bink squeezed that cactustorso with the passion of sheer hate until it squirted white fluid the thing dissolved into foulsmelling goo bink could no longer hold on there was nothing to grasp but he tore at the stuff with his hands flinging gobs of it across the arena and stomped the main mass sat could the monster survive dismemberment even hi this stage enough the demon said you have beaten it he gestured negligently and abruptly bink was fit and clean again without injuryand somehow he knew his talent was back to normal the demon had been testing mm not bis talent he had wonbut at what cost he ran to jewelthe real jewelreminded of the time chameleon had been similarly wounded but the evil magician had done that while this time bulk himself had done it you desire her the demon asked take her along and jewel was whole and lovely smelling of gardenias just as if she had been dunked in healing elixir oh bulk she saidand fled the arena let her go cherie said wisely only time can heal the wound that doesnt show but i cant let her think i meant to she knows you didnt mean to hurt her bink or she wih know when she thinks it out at leisure but she also knows that she has no future with you she is a creature of the caverns the openness of the surface world would terrify her even if you werent married she could not leave her home for you now that youre safe she has to go bink stared the way jewel had gone i wish there were something i could do you can leave her alone cherie said firmly she must make her own life good horse sense grundy the golem agreed i will permit you to perform the agreed task in your fashion the demon said to bink i hold no regard for you or your welfare but i do honor the conditions of a wager all i want from your society is that it not intrude on my private demesnes if it does i might be moved to do something you would be sorry forsuch as cauterizing the entire surface of the planet with a single sheet of fire now have i conveyed my directive in a form your puny intellect can comprehend bink did not regard his intellect as puny compared to that of the demon the creature was omnipotent not omniscient allpowerful not allknowing but it would not be politic to remark on that at the moment bink had no doubt that the demon could and would obliterate all life in the land of xanth if irritated thus it was in bulks personal interest to keep the demon happy and to see that no other idiots like him intruded so his talent would extend itself toward that endas xcan surely was aware yes then bink had a bright flash but it would be easier to ensure your privacy if there were no loose ends like lost magicians or pickled centaurs cherie perked up alertly bink youre a genius this magician xanth inquired he reached up through the ceiling and brought down a gruesome skeleton i can reanimate him for you bink after his initial shock saw that this skeleton was much larger than any humfrey could have worn uh not that one he said relieved smaller like a a gnome and alive oh that one xcan said he reached through a wall and brought back good magician humfrey disheveled but intact about tune you got to me humfrey grumped i was running out of air under that rubble now the demon reached down through the floor he brought back chester encased in a glistening envelope of lake water as he set the centaur down the envelope burst the water evaporated and chester looked around so you went swimming without me cherie said severely here i stay home tending your colt while you gad about chester scowled i gad about because you spend all your time with the colt uh theres no need bink interposed stay out of this she murmured to him with a wink then to chester she flared because he is just like you i cant keep you from risking your fool tail on stupid dangerous adventures you big dumb oaf but at least i have him to remind me of if you paid more attention to me id stay home more he retorted well ill pay more attention to you now horsehead she said kissing him as the arena dissolved and a more cosy room formed about them i need you you do he asked gratified what for for making another foal you ass one that looks just like me that you can take out for runs yeah he agreed with sudden illumination how about getting started right now then he looked about remembering where he was and actually blushed the golem smirked uh in due course and you can run some with chet too she continued so you can help him find his talent there was no hint of the discomfort she must have suffered getting the word out chester stared at her hisyou mean youw oh come on chester she snapped youre wrong ten times a day cant i be wrong once in my life i cant say i like it but since magic seems to be part of the centaurs heritage ill simply have to live with it magic does have its uses after all it brought you back she paused glancing at him sidelong in fact i might even be amenable to a little flute music startled chester looked at her then at bink realizing that someone had blabbed perhaps that can be arrangedin decent privacy after all we are centaurs youre such a beast she said flicking her tail at him bink covered a smile when cherie learned a lesson she learned it welll which seems to cover that situation sufficiently tedious as it has been the demon said now if you are all quite ready to depart never to return yet bink was not quite satisfied he did not trust this sudden generosity on the part of the demon youre really satisfied to be forever walled off from our society you can not wall me off the demon pointed out i am the source of magic you will only wall you off i will watch and participate anytime i choosewhich will probably be never as your society is of little interest to me once you depart i forget you you ought at least to thank bink for freeing you cherie said i thank him by sparing his ridiculous life xcan said and if bulk hadnt known better he might have thought the demon was nettled he earned his life she retorted you owe him more than that binfc tried to caution her dont aggravate him he murmured he can blink us all into nothingness without even bunking the demon agreed one eyelid twitched as if about to blink well bink could have left you to rot for another thousand years without blinking himself she cried heedlessly but he didnt because he has what you will never understand humanity filly you intrigue me xcan murmured it is true i am omnipotent not omniscientbut i believe i could comprehend human motive if i concentrated on it i dare you she cried even chester grew nervous at this what are you trying to do cherie he asked her do you want us all extinguished the demon glanced at grundy halfthing is there substance to her challenge whats in it for me the golem demanded the demon lifted one finger light coalesced about grundy that the light seemed to draw into the golemand lo grundy was no longer a thing of clay and string he stood on living legs and had a living face he was now an elf iim real he cried then seeing the demons gaze upon him he remembered the question yes there is substance its part of being a feeling creature you have to laugh to cry to experience sorrow and gratitude andand its the most wonderful thing then i shall cogitate on it the demon said in a century or so when i have worked out my revised nomenclature he returned to cherie would one gift satisfy you feeling filly i dont need anything she said i already have chester bink is the one then i grant bink one wish no thats not it you have to show you understand by giving him something nice that he would not have thought of himself ah another challenge the demon said he pondered then he reached out and lifted cherie hi one hand bink and chester jumped with alarm but it was not a hostile move would this suffice the demon put her to his mouth again bink and chester jumped but the demon was only whispering his mouth so large that the whisper shook her whole body yet the words were inaudible to the others cherie perked up why yes that would suffice you do understand she exclaimed merely interpolation from observed gestures of his kind the demon set her down then nicked another finger a little globe appeared in air sailing toward bink who caught it it seemed to be a solidhied bubble that is your wishthe one you must choose for yourself the demon said hold the sphere before you and utter your wish and anything within the realm of magic will be yours bink held up the globe i wish that the men who were restored from stone by the absence of magic so they could return to the village of magic dust wfll remain restored now that magic is back he said and that the lady griffin will not turn back to gold and that all the things killed by the loss of magic like the brain coral the demon made a minor gesture of impatience as you see the bubble did not burst that means your wish does not qualify for two reasons first it is not a selfish one you gain nothing for yourself by it second those stone and gold speus can only be restored by reapplication of their inputs once interrupted they are gone none of those people have returned to stone or gold and none of the similar spells hi your land have been reinstated only magic life has been restored such as that of the golem and the coral the other spells are like fire they burn continuously once started but once doused remain out do not waste my attention on such redundancy your wish must go for a selfish purpose oh bink said taken aback i cant think of any wish of that kind it was a generous notion though cherie murmured to him the demon waved his hand you must carry the wish until it is expended enough i become bored with this trivia and the party stood in the forest that bink and cherie and the colt had left it was as if the demon had never beenexcept for the sphere and sinks friends restored and the reviving magic of the forest even cherie seemed satisfied with that magic now bink shook his head and pocketed the wishglobe all he wanted to do now was to get home to chameleon and he needed no special magic for that carry bink as usual chester said cherie you carry the magician he paused crombiel we forgot the loudbeaked griffin bink felt in his pocket no i have him here in the bottle i can release him now no let him stew there a while longer chester decided evidently he had not quite forgiven the soldier for the savage fight the two had had maybe thats best cherie agreed he was in a lifeanddeath struggle when he was confined he might come out fighting let him come chester said belligerently i think it would be better to wait bink said just in case it was dusk but they moved on rapidly the monsters of the night seemed to hold no terror after their adventure bink knew he could use his stored wish to get them out of trouble if he had to or he could release crombie and let him handle it most of the more dangerous wilderness entities were still recovering from the shock of the temporary loss of magic and were not aggressive chester had a problem however i have paid the fee for an answer he reminded the good magician but i found my talent by myself now i could ask about cheries talent but i already know it cherie said coloring slightly at this confession of nearobscenity dont waste your question on thatl you know your talent chester repeated startled what ill tell you another time she said modestly but that leaves me without a wishi mean without an answer he said i paid for it with my life but dont know what to ask no problem humfrey said i could tell you what to ask you could then chester saw the trap but that would use it up i mean your telling me the question would use up the answerand then i wouldnt have the answer to my question that does seem to present a problem humfrey agreed you might elect to pay another fee not by the hair of your handsome tail cherie cried no more adventures away from home already my freedom is slipping away chester muttered not really displeased bink listened glumly he was glad to be getting home but still felt guilt about what had happened to jewel he had a wishbut he knew he could not simply wish jewel out of love with him her love was real not magical and could not be abolished magically also how would chameleon react to this matter he would have to tell her they galloped up to the palace as night became complete the grounds were illuminated by shining luna moths whose fluttering green radiance gave the palace an unearthly beauty queen iris was evidently alert for three moons rose to brighten the palace as they entered and there was a fanfare from invisible trumpets they were promptly ushered to the library the kings favorite room without ceremony bink told his story king trent listened without interrupting as bink concluded he nodded i shall make arrangements to set the shield as you suggested the king said at last i think we will not publicize the presence of the demon but we shall see that no one irttrudes on him i knew you would see it that way bink said relieved ii had no idea there would be such a consequence to my quest it must have been terrible here without magic oh i had no trouble the king said i spent twenty years in mundania remember i still have a number of little unmagic mannerisms about me but iris was verging on a nervous breakdown and the rest of the kingdom was not much better ofi still i believe the net effect was beneficial citizens really appreciate their magic now i suppose so bink agreed i never realized how important magic was until i saw xanth without it but here in our group were left with distressing magical loose ends chester has a surplus answer and i have a wish i cant use and crombie is confined ah yes the king agreed wed better reconstitute him now bink uncorked the bottle releasing crombie the griffin coalesced squawk he proclaimed about time grundy translated king trent looked at the griffinand it became a man well crombie said patting himself to make certain of his condition you didnt need to leave me bottled up i could hear what was going on all the time he turned to chester and you you hoofheaded hulki only fought you because the coral controlled me you didnt have to be scared of me once that was settled chester swelled up scared of youl you featherbrained punk anytime you want to try it again horsetail that will suffice the king said gently and both shut up albeit with imperfect grace king trent smiled returning his attention to bink sometimes you miss the obvious bink let chester give his answer to you to me but its hi sure you can have it chester said i dont need it but i already have a wish i cant use andm now you use chesters question to ask the good magician what to do with your wish the king said bink turned to humfrey the man was snoring quietly in a comfortable chair there was an awkward pause grundy went up and jogged the magicians ankle get with it midge humfrey woke with a small start give it to crombie the magician said before bink opened his mouth and lapsed back into sleep what chester demanded the answer i sweated for only brings a free wish to this bird bulk marveled himself but handed the wishbubble to crombie may i ask what you mean to use it for crombie fidgeted a moment an unusual performance for him uh bink you remember that nymph the one who jewel bink agreed i dread trying to explain about her to well iuh you see i had this fragment of the magic mirror in the bottle and i used it to check on sabrina and i fear constancy was never her strong suit the king interposed i dont believe you two were right for each other anyway what about her bink asked perplexed she was twotiming me crorabie said scowling right when she had me on the vergebut the other guy is married so she was going to let on the kid was mine andi knew i couldnt trust a woman so sabrina had deserted crombie as she had deserted bink himself before he knew chameleon yet she connived to marry crombie anywayand it had been fated that he would have to marry her unless he married someone else first im sorry bink said but i think it would be best simply to let her go no sense wasting a wish for vengeance no thats not what i had in mind crombie assured him i wouldnt trust any woman now but i think i could love a nymph jewel bink asked amazed i dont expect you to believe this crombie said seriously i dont really believe it myself but a soldier has to face realities i lost the battle before it started there i was lying in that cleft where you had slain me bink i dont blame you for that it was a hell of a good fight but i was really hurting suddenly she came smelling of pine needles and gardenias bringing the healing elixir i never saw anything so sweet in my life she was weak and hesitant just like a nymph no threat to any man least of all a soldier no competition the kind of female i could really get along with and the way she stood by you crombie shook his head thats why i went back in the bottle after pointing out the antidote for you i wouldnt do anything to hurt that nymph and killing you would have torn her up and if you got the antidote youd get out of love with her which was how i wanted you shes lovely and loyal but since she still loves you thats hopeless bink said ill never see her again and even if i did he shrugged there can be nothing between us right so if you dont mind ill just take this wish and wish her to drink some of that love potionand to see me next thing then shell feel about me the way you felt about her only ill be available seeing as i have to marry someone anyway and crombie was a dashing soldier and a handsome man inevitably the love the potion started would become real the hurt jewel felt for what bink had done to her striking her down with his sword would make the transition easier except but you like to travel about chester said before bink could formulate the same objection she lives below planting precious stones thats her job she wouldnt leave it so well separateand rejoin crombie said ti be seeing her parttime not all the time thats the way i like it im a soldier and that neatly solved sinks problem what about me grundy demanded without birdbeak i have no job im real now i cant just disappear there is occasional need for translation around this court the king said we shall find employment for you he glanced about that about suffices for tonight quarters have been arranged for all of you here at the palace with that he ushered them out bink was last to go iim sorry i caused all this trouble he said the good magician tried to warn me and so did beauregard the demon but i wouldnt listen just because i wanted to know the source of magic have no concern bulk the king said with a reassuring smile i was aware that there was an element of risk when i sent youbut i was as curious about the source of magic as you and i felt that it was best to have the discovery made by you protected by your talent i knew your talent would see you through but my talent was lost when the magic went and was it bmk didnt it strike you that the demons return was unusually fortuitous well he wanted a private place to which he could have arranged anywhere in the universe what really brought him back i submit that it was your talent still looking out for your longrange interests your marriage was in trouble so your magic indulged in an extraordinary convolution to set it straight ii can t believe my talent could operate to affect the origin of magic itself bink protested i have no such difficulty the process is called feedback and it can and does reflect profoundly on the origin life itself may be regarded as a feedback process but even if that were not the case your talent could have anticipated the chain of events and established a course that would inevitably bring magic back to the land of xanth much as an arrow shot into the air inevitably returns uh when we fought the constellations chesters arrows didnt the king shook his head forgive an inept analogy i shall not bore you further with my mundane perspective i am satisfied with the result of your quest and you should be satisfied too i suspect that had any other person released the demon xcan would never have returned to our realm at this point the matter is academic we shall have to find another occupation for you but there is no rush go home to your wife and son son oh did i forget to inform you as of dusk you became the father of a magicianclass baby my likely successor to the thronein due course i suggest that infant s talent is the demons selected gift to you and perhaps another reason your own talent put you through this adventure what talent does the baby have bink asked feeling giddy his sonan overt magician at birth oh i wouldnt spoil the surprise by telling you go home and see for yourself king trent clapped him heartily on the shoulder your home life will never be dull again bink found himself on his way talents never repeated in the land of xanth except maybe among fiends so his son could not be a transformer like the king or a storm master like the prior king or a magicadapter like king roogna who had built castle roogna or an illusionist like queen iris what could it be that showed so early as he approached the cabin at the edge of the palace estate and smelled the faint residual odor of cheese from the cottage binjks thoughts turned to chameleon it had been only a week since he had left her but it seemed like a year she would be in her normal phase now ordinary in appearance and intelligence his favorite their mutual worry about the prospects of their baby was over the boy was not variable like her or seemingly without talent like him his love for her had been tested most severely by the love potion and availability of a most desirable alternative what a relief to have crombie going after jewel though that could be another action of his talent at any rate now bink knew how much he loved chameleon he might never have realized had he not had this adventure so the king was right he someone emerged from the cabin she cast a triple shadow hi the light of the three moons and she was beautiful he ran to meet her with an exclamation of joy grabbed her anddiscovered it was not chameleon millie he exclaimed turning her hastily loose she had phenomenal sex appeal but all he wanted was chameleon millie the ghost what are you doing here taking care of your wife millie said and your son i think im going to like being a nursemaid again especially to so important a person important bink asked blankly he talks to things she blurted enthusiastically tfl mean he googoos at them and they answer back his crib sang him a lullaby his pillow quacked like a duck a rock warned me not to trip over it so i wouldnt drop the magician communication with the inanimate bink breathed seeing the significance of it hell never get lost because every rock will give him directions hell never be hungry because a lake will tell him the best place to fish or a treeno not a tree thats alive some rock will tell him where to find fruit hell be able to learn more news than the good magician humfrey and without consorting with demons though some of my best friends are demons like beauregard no one will be able to betray him because the very walls will tell him about any plots he a grim shape loomed out of the dark dripping clods of earth bink gripped his sword oh no its all right millie cried thats only jonathan thats no manthats a zombie bink protested hes an old friend of mine she said i knew him back when castle roogna was new now that im alive again he feels responsible for my welfare oh bink sensed a story therebut at the moment he only wanted to see his wife and son was he the zombie i met in the garden she agreed he got lost in the queens maze the night of the anniversary party then he came to me inside and got pickled it took quite a spell to undo that now were looking for a spell to make him alive again too so we can she blushed delicately obviously the zombie had been more than a friend in life millie had displayed an embarrassing interest in bink himself during that party but it seemed the appearance of the zombie ended that another loose end sinks talent had neatly tied up when my son gets older we can have him ask about that bink said there must be some rock somewhere that knows where a spell to restore zombies would be oh yes millie cried ecstatically oh thank you bink faced the zombie but did not offer to shake hands i think you were another omen for me jonathan when i met you the first time it signaled death with all its horrors the death of magic but through that death i found a kind of rebirthand so will you bink turned to the door of the cottage ready to join his family about the author piers anthony was born in
