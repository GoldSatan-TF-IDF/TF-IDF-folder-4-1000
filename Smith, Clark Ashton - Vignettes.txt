vignettes by clark ashton smith beyond the mountains surely beyond the mountains there is peacebeyond the mountains that lie so blue and still at the worlds extreme such ancient calm such infinite quietude is upon them that surely no toiling cities no sea whose foam a ship has ever cloven can lie beyond but valleys of azure silence where amaranthine fiowers sleep and dream untroubled of any wind by the hyalescense of tranquilly flowing streams unbroken as the surface of a mirror the broken lute because you are silent to my lyric prayers deaf to the melodies i have made from the sighs and murmurs of a wounded love i have broken my golden lute and cast it away tarnished and unstrung among the red leaves and faded roses of the september garden silence the silver dust of lilies the muted mournful wind of autumn and the fitfully drifting leaves have claimed it for their own seeing it there as you pass on your queenly way amid the crumbling roses will you not echo in your heart one sigh of the many sighs which as a music for your pleasure were breathed from its chords during the summers halfforgotten days nostalgia of the unknown the nostalgia of things unknown of lands forgotten or unfound is upfound at times often i long for the gleam of yellow suns upon terraces of translucent azure marble mocking the wildless waters of lakes uafathomably calm for lost legendary palaces of serpentine silver and ebony whose columns are green stalactites for the pillars of fallen temples standing in the vast purpureal sunset of a land of lost and marvellous romance i sigh for the darkgreen depths of cedar forests through whose fantastically woven boughs one sees at intervals an unknown tropic ocean like gleams of blue diamond for isles of palm and coral that fret an amber morning somewhere beyond cathay or taprobane for the strange and hidden cities of the desert with burning brazen domes and slender pinnacles of gold and copper that pierce a heaven of heated lazuli grey sorrow oftimes in the golden november days i meet among the dead roses of the garden the ghost of an old sorrowa sorrow grey and dim as the mist of autumnas a wandering mist that was once a rain of tears there through the long decline of afternoon i walk among the roses with the ghost of my sorrow whose halfforgotten halfinvisible form becomes dimmer and more indistinct till i know its face no longer from the twilight nor its voice from the vesper wind the hair of circe i am afraid of thy hair lustrous heavily curled it suggests the coils of a golden snake and half the fascination of thy painted lips of thy still and purplelidded eyes is due to the fear that it may awake beneath my caresses the eyes of circe thine eyes are green and still as the lakes of the desert they awake in me the thirst for strange and bitter mysteries the desire of secrets that are deadly and sterile
