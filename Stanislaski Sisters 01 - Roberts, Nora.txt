roberts nora stanislaski sistersstanislaski sisters nora roberts stanislaski taming natasha prologue eyes snapping with a combination of temper and triumph natasha marched into her bedroom so mikhail and alexi thought it would be funny to dress the dog in her new bra and best dance skirt and they had discovered she reflected just what happened to irritating younger brothers when they put their grubby hands on what didnt belong to them she imagined mik would be limping for the rest of the day best of all mama had ordered them to wash the bra and skirtвђwith their own hands and hang them out to dry where she thought with growing pleasure several of the neighbor boys would be sure to see them at their task theyd be humiliated mama she thought always dealt out perfect justice it was even better than the kick in the shins she herself had dealt out to her brother natasha turned toward the long mirror on her wall and to calm herself lowered into a pliг her fourteenyearold body was as slim as her brothers with just a hint of curves at breast and hip ballet lessons had taught those limbs those joints those bones to bend twist adjust to demands had schooled her mind toward discipline and given her heart the greatest of joys she knew the lessons were expensive and how hard her parents worked to see that sheвђand her siblingsвђhad what they wanted most because she knew she practiced religiously worked harder than anyone else in her class one day she would be a great ballerina and every time she danced she would thank them for the gift imagining herself in a sparkling tutu hearing the music swell she closed goldenbrown eyes lifted a delicate chin her hair a long curling fall of black swung gently as she rose on her toes and turned in a slow pirouette when she opened them she saw her sister in the doorway theyre nearly finished washing it rachel announced as usual when she looked at natasha she was struck with a mix of pride and envy pride that her sister was so beautiful looked so lovely when she danced envy that at eight she felt she would never be fourteen never be so pretty so graceful natashas ribbons never fell out of her hair leaving it a tangled mess and she was getting breasts they were small but they were there for rachel every ambition need and desire centered around being fourteen natasha merely smiled turned another pirouette are they whining a little rachels lips twitched when mamas too far away to hear and mik says you broke his leg good he deserves a broken leg for taking my things it was a little funny rachel came in to bounce on the bed sasha looked so silly in your pretty white bra and pink skirt a little funny natasha admitted she walked to her dresser to pick up her brush maybe very funny when they put on swan lake and pretended to dance with him with temper over she grinned and ran the brush idly through her hair well theyre only boys rachel wrinkled her nose boys were currently very low on her list boys are stupid they yell too loud and smell too much being a girls better though she wore faded jeans a ragged tshirt and a yankees cap over her disordered black hair she believed it absolutely her eyes the same color as her sisters danced we can get them back she told herself she was above such things but natasha studied rachel with growing interest rachel might have been the baby of the family but she was devious how miks baseball jersey which rachel privately coveted i think sasha would look very handsome in it when they go out to hang the wash we can get it nobody knows where he hides it when hes not wearing it i know rachels smile spread over her pretty face i know everything ill tell you and ill help you pay him back ifвђ natasha lifted a brow devious and clever rachel always had an angle if if i can wear your gold earrings the little hoops with the stars carved on them the last time i let you wear a pair of my earrings you lost one i didnt lose it i just cant find it yet part of her wanted to pout but that would have to wait until the deal was set ill get the jersey help you dress sasha and keep mama busy you let me wear the earrings for three days one day two natasha let out a sigh all right then with a cagey smile rachel held out her hand earrings first shaking her head natasha opened her little jewelry box and took out the hoops how can you be such a wheedler when youre only eight when youre the youngest you have to wheedle she hopped up happily putting on the earrings in the mirror everybody else gets everything first if i were the oldest these would be my earrings well youre not and theyre mine dont lose them rachel rolled her eyes then studied the results she was positive the earrings made her look older maybe as much as ten if youre going to wear them lets fix your hair natasha plucked off the ball cap and began to run the brush through rachels long loose curls well tie it back so the earrings will show i cant find my clip you can use one of mine when you were eight did you look like me i dont know considering natasha bent so their faces were sidebyside in the mirror we have the same eyes almost and our mouths too you have a nicer nose i do the idea that she had anything nicer or prettier or better than her big sister was a towering thrill really yes i think because she understood natasha rubbed her cheek against rachels one day when were grown up people will look when we walk down the street theres the stanislaski sisters theyll say arent they a striking pair the image had rachel giggling and prancing around the room they shared then theyll see mikhail and alexi and say ohoh here come the stanislaski brothers and that means trouble theyd be right natasha heard the back door slam glanced out the window and there they are oh look rachel its perfect the two boys heads lowered in mortification dragged their feet on the way to the clothesline while the dog raced in circles around them they look so embarrassed natasha said with satisfaction look how red their faces are its not enough lets get the jersey earrings dangling rachel grabbed her cap and raced out of the room boys would never defeat the stanislaski sisters natasha thought and rushed after her for gayle link welcome to the fold chapter one contents prev next why is it that all the really greatlooking men are married is that a trick question natasha arranged a velvetgowned doll in a childsized bentwood rocker before she turned to her assistant okay annie what greatlooking man are we talking about in particular the tall blond and gorgeous one whos standing outside the shop window with his niftylooking wife and beautiful little girl annie tucked a wad of gum into her cheek and heaved a gusty sigh they look like an ad for perfect family digest then perhaps theyll come in and buy the perfect toy natasha stepped back from her grouping of victorian dolls and accessories with a nod of approval it looked exactly as she wantedвђappealing elegant and oldfashioned she checked everything down to the tasseled fan in a tiny china hand the toy store wasnt just her business it was her greatest pleasure everything from the smallest rattle to the biggest stuffed bear was chosen by her with the same eye for detail and quality she insisted on the best for her shop and her customers whether it was a fivehundreddollar doll with its own fur wrap or a twodollar palmsized race car when the match was right she was pleased to ring up either sale in the three years since she had opened her jingling front door natasha had made the fun house one of the most thriving concerns in the small college town on the west virginia border it had taken drive and persistence but her success was more a direct result of her innate understanding of children she didnt want her clients to walk out with a toy she wanted them to walk out with the right toy deciding to make a few adjustments natasha moved over to a display of miniature cars i think theyre going to come in annie was saying as she smoothed down her short crop of auburn hair the little girls practically bouncing out of her mary janes want me to open up always precise natasha glanced at the grinning clown clock overhead we have five minutes yet whats five minutes tash im telling you this guy is incredible wanting a closer look annie edged down an aisle to restack board games oh yes six foot two a hundred and sixty pounds the best shoulders ive ever seen fill out a suit jacket oh lord its tweed i didnt know a guy in tweed could make me salivate a man in cardboard can make you salivate most of the guys i know are cardboard a dimple winked at the corner of annies mouth she peeked around the counter of wooden toys to see if he was still at the window he must have spent some time at the beach this summer his hairs sunstreaked and hes got a fabulous tan oh god he smiled at the little girl i think im in love choreographing a scaleddown traffic jam natasha smiled you always think youre in love i know annie sighed i wish i could see the color of his eyes hes got one of those wonderfully lean and bony faces im sure hes incredibly intelligent and has suffered horribly natasha shot a quick amused look over her shoulder annie with her tall skinny build had a heart as soft as marshmallow cream im sure his wife would be fascinated with your fantasy its a womans privilegeвђno her obligationвђto weave fantasies over men like that though she couldnt have disagreed more natasha let annie have her way all right then go ahead and open up one doll spence said giving his daughters ear a tug i might have thought twice about moving into that house if id realized there was a toy store a half mile away youd buy her the bloody toy store if you had your way he spared one glance for the woman beside him dont start nina the slender blonde shrugged her shoulders rippling the trim rose linen jacket of her suit then looked at the little girl i just meant your daddy tends to spoil you because he loves you so much besides you deserve a present for being so good about the move little frederica kimballs bottom lip pouted i like my new house she slipped her hand into her fathers automatically aligning herself with him and against the world i have a yard and a swing set all of my own nina looked them over the tall rangy man and the fairysized young girl they had identical stubborn chins as far as she could remember shed never won an argument with either one i suppose im the only one who doesnt see that as an advantage over living in new york ninas tone warmed slightly as she stroked the girls hair i cant help worrying about you a little bit i really only want you to be happy darling you and your daddy we are to break the tension spence swung freddie into his arms arent we funny face shes about to be that much happier relenting nina gave spences hand a squeeze theyre opening good morning they were gray annie noted biting back a long dreamy ahh a glorious gray she tucked her little fantasy into the back of her mind and ushered in the first customers of the day may i help you my daughters interested in a doll spence set freddie on her feet again well youve come to the right place annie dutifully switched her attention to the child she really was a cute little thing with her fathers gray eyes and pale flyaway blond hair what kind of doll would you like a pretty one freddie answered immediately a pretty one with red hair and blue eyes im sure we have just what you want she offered a hand would you like to look around after a glance at her father for approval freddie linked hands with annie and wandered off damn it spence found himself wincing nina squeezed his hand for the second time spenceвђ i delude myself thinking that it doesnt matter that she doesnt even remember just because she wanted a doll with red hair and blue eyes doesnt mean anything red hair and blue eyes he repeated the frustration welled up once more just like angelas she remembers nina and it does matter stuffing his hands into his pockets he walked away three years he thought it had been nearly three years now freddie had still been in diapers but she remembered angelaвђbeautiful careless angela not even the most liberal critic would have considered angela a mother she had never cuddled or crooned never rocked or soothed he studied a small porcelainfaced doll dressed in pale angelic blue tiny tapering fingers huge dreamy eyes angela had been like that he remembered ethereally beautiful and cold as glass he had loved her as a man might love a piece of artвђdistantly admiring the perfection of form and constantly searching for the meaning beneath it between them they had somehow created a warm gorgeous child who had managed to find her way through the first years of her life almost without help from her parents but he would make it up to her spence shut his eyes for a moment he intended to do everything in his power to give his daughter the love the structure and the security she deserved the realness the word seemed trite but it was the only one he could find that described what he wanted for his daughterвђthe real the solid bond of family she loved him he felt some of the tension ease from his shoulders as he thought of the way freddies big eyes would shine when he tucked her in at night at the way her arms would wrap tightly around him when he held her perhaps he would never fully forgive himself for being so involved with his own problems his own life during her infancy but things had changed even this move had been made with her welfare in mind he heard her laugh and the rest of the tension dissolved on a wave of pure pleasure there was no sweeter music than his little girls laugh an entire symphony could be written around it he wouldnt disturb her yet spence thought let her indulge herself with the bright and beautiful dolls before he had to remind her that only one could be hers relaxed again he began to pay attention to the shop like the dolls hed imagined for his daughter it was bright and beautiful though small it was packed from wall to wall with everything a child might covet a big golden giraffe and a sadeyed purple dog hung from the ceiling wooden trains cars and planes all painted in bold colors jockeyed for position on a long display table with elegant miniature furniture an oldfashioned jackinthebox sat beside an intricate scale model of a futuristic space station there were dolls some beautiful some charmingly homely erector sets and tea sets the lack of studied arrangement made the result all the more appealing this was a place to pretend and to wish a crowded aladdins cave designed to make childrens eyes light in wonder to make them laugh as his daughter was laughing now he could already foresee that hed be hardpressed to keep freddie from making regular visits that was one of the reasons hed made the move to a small town he wanted his daughter to be able to reap the pleasures of local shops where the merchants would know her name she would be able to walk from one end of town to the other without those bigcity worries about muggings abductions and drugs there would be no need for dead bolts and security systems for white noise machines to block out the surge and grind of traffic even a girl as little as his freddie wouldnt be swallowed up here and perhaps without the pace and the pressure he would make peace with himself idly he picked up a music box it was of delicately crafted porcelain graced with a figure of a ravenhaired gypsy woman in a flounced red dress in her ears were tiny gold loops and in her hands a tambourine with colored streamers he was certain he wouldnt have found anything more skillfully made on fifth avenue he wondered how the owner could leave it out where small curious fingers might reach and break intrigued he turned the key and watched the figure revolve around the tiny china camp fire tchaikovsky he recognized the movement instantly and his skilled ear approved the quality of tone a moody even passionate piece he thought finding it strange to come across such exquisite workmanship in a toy store then he glanced up and saw natasha he stared he couldnt help it she was standing a few feet away her head up slightly tilted as she watched him her hair was as dark as the dancers and corkscrewed around her face in a wild disarray that flowed beyond her shoulders her skin was a dark rich gold that was set off by the simple red dress she wore but this woman was not fragile he thought though she was small he got the impression of power perhaps it was her face with its full unpainted mouth and high slashing cheekbones her eyes were almost as dark as her hair heavylidded and thickly lashed even from a distance of ten feet he sensed it strong undiluted sex it surrounded her as other women surrounded themselves with perfumes for the first time in years he felt the musclenumbing heat of pure desire natasha saw it then recognized and resented it what kind of man she wondered walked into a room with his wife and daughter then looked at another woman with naked hunger in his eyes not her kind determined to ignore the look as she had ignored it from others in the past she crossed to him do you need some help help spence thought blankly he needed oxygen he hadnt known it was literally possible for a woman to take a mans breath away who are you natasha stanislaski she offered her coolest smile i own the store her voice seemed to hang in the air husky vital with a trace of her slavic origins adding eroticism as truly as the music still playing behind him she smelled of soap nothing more yet the fragrance completely seduced him when he didnt speak she lifted a brow it might have been amusing to knock a man off his feet but she was busy at the moment and the man was married your daughter has her selection down to three dolls perhaps youd like to help her with her final choice in a minute your accentвђis it russian yes she wondered if she should tell him his wife was standing near the front door bored and impatient how long have you been in america since i was six she aimed a deliberately cold glance about the same age as your little girl excuse meвђ he had his hand on her arm before he could stop himself even though he knew the move was a bad one the venom in her eyes surprised him sorry i was going to ask you about this music box natasha shifted her gaze to it as the music began to wind down its one of our best handcrafted here in the states are you interested in buying it i havent decided but i thought you might not have realized it was sitting out on that shelf why its not the kind of merchandise one expects to find in a toy store it could easily be broken natasha took it and placed it farther back on the shelf and it can be mended she made a quick clearly habitual movement with her shoulders it spoke of arrogance rather than carelessness i believe children should be allowed the pleasures of music dont you yes for the first time a smile flickered over his face it was as annie had noted a particularly effective one natasha had to admit through her annoyance she felt the trickle of attraction and strangely kinship then he said as a matter of fact i believe that quite strongly perhaps we could discuss it over dinner holding herself rigid natasha battled back fury it was difficult for one with her hot often turbulent nature but she reminded herself that the man had not only his wife but his young daughter in the store the angry insults that rose to her throat were swallowed but not before spence saw them reflected in her eyes no was all she said as she turned missвђ spence began then freddie whirled down the aisle carrying a big floppy raggedy ann daddy isnt she nice eyes shining she held out the doll for his approval it was redheaded spence thought but it was anything but beautiful nor to his relief was it a symbol of angela because he knew freddie expected it he took his time examining her choice this is he said after a moment the very best doll ive seen today really he crouched until he was eye to eye with his daughter absolutely you have excellent taste funny face freddie reached out crushing the doll between them as she hugged her father i can have her i thought she was for me as freddie giggled he picked up the pair of them ill be happy to wrap her for you natashas tone was warmer she knew he might be a jerk but he loved his daughter i can carry her freddie squeezed her new friend close all right then ill just give you a ribbon for her hair would you like that a blue one a blue one it is natasha led the way to the cash register nina took one look at the doll and rolled her eyes darling is that the best you could do daddy likes her freddie murmured ducking her head yes i do very much he added with a telling look for nina setting freddie on her feet again he fished out his wallet the mother was certainly no prize natasha decided though that didnt give the man a right to come on to a clerk in a toy store she made change and handed over the receipt then took out a length of blue ribbon thank you she said to freddie i think shes going to like her new home with you very much ill take good care of her freddie promised while she struggled to tie the ribbon through the yarn mop of hair can people come in to look at the toys or do they have to buy one natasha smiled then taking another ribbon tied a quick sassy bow in the childs hair you can come in and look anytime you like spence we really must be going nina stood holding the door open right he hesitated it was a small town he reminded himself and if freddie could come in and look so could he it was nice meeting you miss stanislaski goodbye she waited until the door jingled and closed then let out a muttered stream of curses annie peeked around a tower of building blocks excuse me that man yes with a little sigh annie waltzed down the aisle that man he brings his wife and child into a place like this then looks at me as if he wants to nibble on my toes tash her expression pained annie pressed a hand to her heart please dont excite me i find it insulting she skirted around the checkout counter and swung a fist at a punching bag he asked me to dinner he what delight showed in annies eyes before a look from natasha dampened it youre right it is insulting seeing as hes a married manвђeven though his wife seemed like a cold fish his marital problems are no concern of mine noвђ practicality warred with fantasy i guess you turned him down a choked sound caught in natashas throat as she turned of course i turned him down i mean of course annie put in quickly the man has a nerve natasha said her fingers itched to hit something coming into my place of business and propositioning me he didnt scandalized and thrilled annie grabbed natashas arm tash he didnt really proposition you right here with his eyes he did the message was clear it infuriated her how often men looked at her and only saw the physical only wanted to see the physical she thought in disgust she had tolerated suggestions propositions and proposals since before she had fully understood what they meant but she understood now and tolerated nothing if he hadnt had that sweet little girl with him i would have slapped his face because the image pleased her so much she let loose on the hapless punching bag again annie had seen her employers temper fly often enough to know how to cool it she was sweet wasnt she her names freddie isnt that cute natasha took a long steadying breath even as she rubbed her fisted hand in her other palm yes she told me they had just moved to shepherdstown from new york the doll was going to be her first new friend poor little thing natasha knew too well the fears and anxieties of being a child in a strange place forget the father she told herself with a toss of her head she looks to be about the same age as jobeth riley annoyance forgotten natasha went behind the counter again and picked up the phone it wouldnt hurt to give mrs riley a call spence stood at the musicroom window and stared out at a bed of summer flowers having flowers outside the window and a bumpy slope of lawn that would need tending was a new experience hed never cut grass in his life smiling to himself he wondered how soon he could try his hand at it there was a big spreading maple its leaves a dark dark green in a few weeks he imagined they would grow red and vibrant before they tumbled from the branches he had enjoyed the view from his condo on central park west watching the seasons come and go with the changing trees but not like this he realized here the grass the trees the flowers he saw belonged to him they were for him to enjoy and to care for here he could let freddie take out her dolls for an afternoon tea party and not have to worry every second she was out of his sight they would make a good life here a solid life for both of them hed felt it when hed flown down to discuss his position with the deanвђand again when hed walked through this big rambling house with the anxious realestate agent dogging his heels she hadnt had to sell it spence thought hed been sold the moment hed walked in the front door as he watched a hummingbird swooped to hover at the cup of a bright red petunia in that instant he was more convinced than ever that his decision to leave the city had been the right one having a brief fling with rural living ninas words rolled through his mind as he watched the sun flash on the birds iridescent wings it was difficult to blame her for saying it for believing it when he had always chosen to live in the middle of things he couldnt deny he had enjoyed those glittery parties that had lasted until dawn or the elegant midnight suppers after a symphony or ballet he had been born into a world of glamour and wealth and prestige he had lived all of his life in a place where only the best was acceptable and he had relished it spence admitted summering in monte carlo wintering in nice or cannes weekends in aruba or cancun he wouldnt wish those experiences away but he could wish and did that he had accepted the responsibilities of his life sooner he accepted them now spence watched the hummingbird streak away like a sapphire bullet and as much to his own surprise as to that of people who knew him he was enjoying those responsibilities freddie made the difference all the difference he thought of her and she came running across the back lawn her new rag doll tucked under her arm she made a beeline as he expected to the swing set it was so new that the blue and white paint gleamed in the sunlight and the hard plastic seats were shiny as leather with the doll in her lap she pushed off her face lifted skyward her tiny mouth moving to some private song love rammed into him with a velvet fist solid and painful in all of his life he had never known anything as consuming or as basic as the emotion she brought to him simply by being as she glided back and forth she cuddled the doll bringing her close to whisper secrets into her ear it pleased him to see freddie so taken with the cloth and cotton doll she could have chosen china or velvet but had picked something that looked as though it needed love shed spoken of the toy store throughout the morning and was wishing spence knew for a return trip oh she wouldnt ask for anything he thought not directly she would use her eyes it both amused and baffled him that at five his little girl had already mastered that peculiar and effective feminine trick hed thought of the toy store himself and its owner no feminine tricks there just pure womanly disdain it made him wince again to remember how clumsy hed been out of practice he reminded himself with a selfdeprecating smile and rubbed a hand over the back of his neck what was more he couldnt remember ever experiencing that strong a sexual punch it was like being hit by lightning he decided a man was entitled to fumble a bit after being electrified but her reactionвђ frowning spence replayed the scene in his mind shed been furious shed damn near been quivering with fury before hed opened his mouthвђand put his foot in it she hadnt even attempted to be polite in her refusal just noвђa single hard syllable crusted with frost at the edges it wasnt as if hed asked her to go to bed with him but hed wanted to from the first instant he had been able to imagine carrying her off to some dark remote spot in the woods where the ground was springy with moss and the trees blocked out the sky there he could take the heat of those full sulky lips there he could indulge in the wild passion her face promised wild mindless sex heedless of time or place of right or wrong good god amazed he pulled himself back he was thinking like a teenager no spence admitted thrusting his hands into his pockets again he was thinking like a manвђone who had gone four years without a woman he wasnt certain if he wanted to thank natasha stanislaski for unlocking all those needs again or throttle her but he was certain he was going to see her again im all packed nina paused in the doorway she gave a little sigh spence was clearly absorbed in his own thoughts again spencer she said raising her voice as she crossed the room i said im all packed what oh he managed a distracted smile and forced his shoulders to relax well miss you nina youll be glad to see the back of me she corrected then gave him a quick peck on the cheek no his smile came easier now she saw dutifully wiping the faint trace of lipstick from his skin i appreciate all youve done to help us settle in i know how tight your schedule is i could hardly let my brother tackle the wilds of west virginia alone she took his hand in a rare show of genuine agitation oh spence are you sure forget everything ive said before and think really think it through its such a big change for both of you what will you possibly do here in your free time cut the grass now he grinned at her expression sit on the porch maybe ill even write music again you could write in new york i havent written two bars in almost four years he reminded her all right she walked to the piano and waved a hand but if you wanted a change you could have found a place on long island or even in connecticut i like it here nina believe me this is the best thing i could do for freddie and myself i hope youre right because she loved him she smiled again i still say youll be back in new york within six months in the meantime as that childs only aunt i expect to be kept apprised of her progress she glanced down annoyed to see a chip in her nail polish the idea of her attending public schoolвђ nina never mind she held up a hand theres no use starting this argument when i have a plane to catch and im quite aware shes your child yes she is nina tapped a finger on the glossy surface of the baby grand spence i know youre still carrying around guilt because of angela i dont like to see it his easy smile vanished some mistakes take a long time to be erased she made you miserable nina said flatly there were problems within the first year of your marriage oh you werent forthcoming with information she added when he didnt respond but there were others all too eager to pass it along to me or anyone else who would listen it was no secret that she didnt want the child and how much better was i wanting the baby only because i thought it would fill the gaps in my marriage thats a large burden to hand a child you made mistakes you recognized them and you rectified them angela never suffered a pang of guilt in her life if she hadnt died you would have divorced her and taken custody of freddie the results the same i know that sounds cold the truth often is i dont like to think that youre making this move changing your life this dramatically because youre trying to make up for something thats long over maybe thats part of it but theres more he held out a hand waiting until nina came to him look at her he pointed out the window to where freddie continued to swing high free as the hummingbird shes happy and so am i chapter two contents prev next im not scared of course youre not spence looked at his daughters brave reflection in the mirror while he carefully braided her hair he didnt need the quaver in her voice to tell him she was terrified there was a rock in the pit of his own stomach the size of a fist some of the kids might cry her big eyes were already misted but i wont youre going to have fun he wasnt any more certain of that than his nervous daughter the trouble with being a parent he thought was that you were supposed to sound sure of everything the first day of schools always a little scary but once you get there and meet everyone youll have a great time she fixed him with a steady owlish stare really you liked kindergarten didnt you it was evasive he admitted to himself but he couldnt make promises he might not be able to keep mostly she lowered her eyes poking at the yellow sea horseshaped comb on her dresser but amy and pam wont be there youll make new friends youve already met jobeth he thought of the pixieish brunette who had strolled by the house with her mother a couple of days before i guess and jobeth is nice butвђ how could she explain that jobeth already knew all of the other girls maybe i should wait till tomorrow their eyes met in the mirror again he rested his chin on her shoulder she smelled of the pale green soap she loved because it was shaped like a dinosaur her face was so much like his own yet softer finer and to him infinitely beautiful you could but then tomorrow would be your first day of school youd still have butterflies butterflies right here he patted her tummy doesnt it feel like butterflies dancing in there that made her giggle kind of ive got them too really her eyes opened wide really ive got to go to school this morning just like you she fiddled with the pink ribbons hed tied on the ends of her pigtails she knew it wasnt the same for him but didnt say so because she was afraid hed get that worried look freddie had heard him talking to aunt nina once and remembered how impatient he had sounded when shed complained that he was uprooting her niece during her formative years freddie wasnt sure exactly what formative years were but she knew her daddy had been upset and that even when aunt nina had gone again hed still had that worried look she didnt want to make him worried or to make him think aunt nina was right if they went back to new york the only swing sets were in the park besides she liked the big house and her new room even better her fathers new job was so close he would be home every night long before dinner remembering not to pout freddie decided that since she wanted to stay shed have to go to school will you be here when i get home i think so but if im not vera will be he said thinking of their longtime housekeeper you can tell me everything that happened after kissing the top of her head he set her on her feet she looked achingly small in her pink and white playsuit her gray eyes were solemn her bottom lip trembling he fought back the urge to gather her up and promise that shed never have to go to school or anywhere else that frightened her lets go see what vera packed in your new lunch box twenty minutes later he was standing on the curb holding freddies hand in his own with almost as much dread as his daughter he saw the big yellow school bus lumbering over the hill he should have driven her to school he thought in sudden panicвђat least for the first few days he should take her himself instead of putting her onto that bus with strangers yet it had seemed better to make the whole event normal to let her ease into the group and become one of them from the outset how could he let her go she was just a baby his baby what if he was wrong this wasnt just a matter of picking out the wrong color dress for her simply because it was the designated day and time he was going to tell his daughter to get onto that bus then walk away what if the driver was careless and drove off a cliff how could he be sure someone would make certain freddie got back onto the right bus that afternoon the bus rumbled to a halt and his fingers tightened instinctively on hers when the door clattered open he was almost ready to make a run for it hi there the driver a large woman with a wide smile nodded at him behind her children were yelling and bouncing on the seats you must be professor kimball yes he had excuses for not putting freddie on the bus on the tip of his tongue im dorothy mansfield the kids just call me miss d and you must be frederica yes maam she bit her bottom lip to keep from turning away and hiding her face against her fathers side its freddie whew miss d gave another big grin im glad to hear that frederica sure is a mouthful well hop aboard freddie girl this is the big day john harman you give that book back to mikey lessn you want to sit behind me in the hot seat the rest of the week eyes swimming freddie put one foot onto the first step swallowing she climbed the second why dont you take a seat with jobeth and lisa there miss d suggested kindly she turned back to spence with a wink and a wave dont worry about a thing professor well take good care of her the door closed on a puff of air then the bus rumbled ahead spence could only stand on the curb and watch it take his little girl away he wasnt exactly idle spences time was eaten up almost from the moment he walked into the college he had his own schedule to study associates to meet instruments and sheet music to pore over there was a faculty meeting a hurried lunch in the lounge and there were papers dozens of papers to read and digest it was a familiar routine one that he had begun three years before when hed taken a post at the julliard school but like freddie he was the new kid in town and it was up to him to make the adjustments he worried about her at lunchtime he imagined her sitting in the school cafeteria a room that smelled of peanut butter and waxy cartons of milk she would be huddled at the end of a table scattered with crumbs alone miserable while other children laughed and joked with their friends he could see her at recess standing apart and looking on longingly while the others raced and shouted and climbed like spiders on jungle gyms the trauma would leave her insecure and unhappy for the rest of her life all because hed put her onto that damn yellow bus by the end of the day he was feeling as guilty as a child abuser certain his little girl would come home in tears devastated by the rigors of the first day of school more than once he asked himself if nina had been right all along perhaps he should have left well enough alone and stayed in new york where at least freddie had had friends and the familiar with his briefcase in one hand and his jacket slung over his shoulder he started for home it was hardly more than a mile and the weather remained unseasonably warm until winter hit he would take advantage of it and walk to and from campus he had already fallen in love with the town there were pretty shops and rambling old houses all along the treelined main street it was a college town and proud of it but it was equally proud of its age and dignity the street climbed and here and there the sidewalk showed cracks where tree roots had undermined it though there were cars passing it was quiet enough to hear the bark of a dog or the music from a radio a woman weeding marigolds along her walkway looked up and waved at him cheered spence waved back she didnt even know him he thought but she had waved he looked forward to seeing her again planting bulbs perhaps or sweeping snow from her porch he could smell chrysanthemums for some reason that alone gave him a shot of pleasure no he hadnt made a mistake he and freddie belonged here in less than a week it had become home he stopped on the curb to wait for a laboring sedan to pass and glancing across the street saw the sign for the fun house it was perfect spence thought the perfect name it conjured up laughter and surprises just as the window display with its building blocks chubbycheeked dolls and shiny red cars promised a childhood treasure trove at the moment he could think of nothing he wanted more than to find something that would bring a smile to his daughters face you spoil her he could hear ninas voice clearly in his ears so what glancing quickly up and down the street he crossed to the opposite curb his little girl had walked onto the school bus as bravely as any soldier marching into battle there was no harm in buying her a small medal the door jingled as he entered there was a scent as cheerful as the sound of the bells peppermint he thought and smiled it delighted him to hear the tinny strains of the merrygoround broke down coming from the rear of the shop ill be right with you he had forgotten spence realized how that voice could cruise along the air he wouldnt make a fool of himself again this time he was prepared for what she looked like sounded like smelled like he had come into to buy a present for his daughter not to flirt with the proprietor then he grinned into the face of a forlorn panda there didnt seem to be any law against doing both im sure bonnie will love it natasha said as she carried the miniature carousel for her customer its a beautiful birthday present she saw it in here a few weeks ago and hasnt been able to talk about anything else bonnies grandmother tried not to grimace at the price i guess shes old enough to take care of it bonnies a very responsible girl natasha went on then spotted spence at the counter ill be right with you the temperature of her voice dropped a cool twenty degrees take your time it annoyed him that his reaction to her should be so strong while hers played tugofwar at the opposite end of the spectrum it was obvious shed decided to dislike him it might be interesting spence thought while he watched her slender capable hands wrap the carousel to find out her reasons and change her mind thats mrs mortimer oh no dear the price tag said natasha who knew mrs mortimer juggled expenses on a fixed income only smiled im sorry didnt i tell you it was on sale no mrs mortimer let out a little breath of relief as she counted out bills well this must be my lucky day and bonnies natasha topped the gift with a pretty celebratory pink bow remembering it was bonnies favorite color be sure to tell her happy birthday i will the proud grandmother lifted her package i cant wait to see her face when she opens this bye natasha natasha waited until the door closed may i help you with something that was a very nice thing to do she lifted a brow what do you mean you know what i mean he had the absurd urge to take her hand and kiss it it was incredible he thought he was almost thirtyfive and tumbling into puppy love with a woman he barely knew id meant to come in before oh was your daughter dissatisfied with her doll no she loves it it was just that iвђ good god he was nearly stuttering five minutes with her and he felt as awkward as a teenager at his first dance he steadied himself with an effort i felt wed gotten off on the wrong foot before should i apologize if you like just because he looked appealing and a little awkward was no reason to go easy on him did you come in only for that no his eyes darkened just slightly noting it natasha wondered if shed erred in her initial impression perhaps he wasnt harmless after all there was something deeper in those eyes stronger and more dangerous what surprised her further was that she found it exciting disgusted with herself she gave him a polite smile was there something else i wanted something for my daughter the hell with the gorgeous russian princess he thought he had more important things to tend to what was it you wanted for her i dont know that was true enough setting down his briefcase he glanced around the shop unbending a little natasha came around the counter is it her birthday no feeling foolish he shrugged its the first day of school and she looked soвђ brave getting on the bus this morning this time natashas smile was spontaneous and full of warmth it nearly stopped his heart you shouldnt worry when she comes home shell be full of stories about everything and everyone the first day is much harder i think on the parent than on the child its been the longest day of my life she laughed a rich smoky sound that seemed impossibly erotic in a room full of clowns and stuffed bears it sounds like you both deserve a present you were looking at a music box before i have another you might like so saying she led the way to the back of the shop spence did his best to ignore the subtle sway of her hips and the soft freshscrubbed flavor of her scent the box she chose was carved of wood its pedestal topped with a cat and a fiddle a cow and a quarter moon as it turned to stardust he saw the laughing dog and the dish with the spoon its charming its one of my favorites shed decided that any man who adored his daughter so blatantly couldnt be all bad so she smiled again i think it would be a lovely memento something she could play on her first day of college and remember her father was thinking of her if he survives first grade he shifted slightly to look at her thank you its perfect it was the oddest thingвђhis body had hardly brushed hers but shed felt a jolt for an instant she forgot he was a customer a father a husband and thought of him only as a man his eyes were the color of the river at dusk his lips as they formed the barest hint of a smile were impossibly attractive alluring involuntarily she wondered what it would be like to feel them against her ownвђto watch his face as mouth met mouth and see herself reflected in his eyes appalled she stepped back and her voice grew colder ill box it for you intrigued by the sudden change in tone he took his time following her back to the counter hadnt he seen something in those fabulous eyes of hers or was it wishful thinking it had gone quickly enough heat smothered in frost for the life of him he could find no reason for either natasha he laid a hand on hers as she began to pack the music box slowly she lifted her eyes she was already hating herself for noticing that his hands were beautiful widepalmed longfingered there was also a note of patience in his voice that stretched her already frayed nerves yes why do i keep getting the feeling youd like to boil me in oil youre mistaken she said evenly i dont think id like that you dont sound convinced he felt her hand flex under his soft and strong the image of steellined velvet seemed particularly apt im having some trouble figuring out exactly what ive done to annoy you then youll have to think about it cash or charge hed had little practice with rejection like a wasp it stung the ego no matter how beautiful she was he had no desire to continue to ram his head against the same brick wall cash the door jangled open behind them and he released her hand three children fresh from school came in giggling a young boy with red hair and a face bursting with freckles stood on his toes in front of the counter i have three dollars he announced natasha fought back a grin youre very rich today mr jensen he flashed her a smile that revealed his latest missing tooth ive been saving up i want the race car natasha only lifted a brow as she counted out spences change does your mother know youre here spending your life savings her new customer remained silent scott he shifted from one foot to the other she didnt say i couldnt and she didnt say you could natasha surmised she leaned over to tug at his cowlick go and ask her then you come back the race car will still be here but tashвђ you wouldnt want your mother to be mad at me would you scott looked thoughtful for a moment and natasha could tell it was a tough choice i guess not then go ask her and ill hold one for you hope blossomed promise natasha put a hand on her heart solemnly she looked back at spence and the amusement faded from her eyes i hope freddie enjoys her present im sure she will he walked out annoyed with himself for wishing he were a tenyearold boy with a missing tooth natasha locked the shop at six the sun was still bright the air still steamy it made her think of picnics under a shady tree a nicer fantasy than the microwave meal on her agenda she mused but at the moment impractical as she walked home she watched a couple stroll hand in hand into the restaurant across the street someone hailed her from a passing car and she waved in response she could have stopped in the local pub and whiled away an hour over a glass of wine with any number of people she knew finding a dinner companion was as simple as sticking her head through one of a dozen doors and making the suggestion she wasnt in the mood for company not even her own it was the heat she told herself as she turned the corner the heat that had hung mercilessly in the air throughout the summer and showed no sign of yielding to autumn it made her restless it made her remember it had been summer when her life had changed so irrevocably even now years later sometimes when she saw the roses in full bloom or heard the drunken buzz of bees she would ache and wonder what might have happened what would her life be like now ifвђ she detested herself for playing those wishing games there were roses now fragile pink ones that thrived despite the heat and lack of rain she had planted them herself in the little patch of grass outside her apartment tending them brought her pleasure and pain and what was life she asked herself as she ran a fingertip over a petal without them both the warm scent of the roses followed her up the walkway her rooms were quiet she had thought about getting a kitten or a pup so that there would be something there to greet her in the evening something that loved and depended on her but then she realized how unfair it would be to leave it alone while she was at the shop so she turned to music flicking on the stereo as she stepped out of her shoes even that was a test tchaikovskys romeo and juliet she could see herself dancing to those haunting romantic strains the hot lights surrounding her the music beating like her blood her movements fluid controlled without looking it a triple pirouette showing grace without effort that was past natasha reminded herself regrets were for the weak she moved out of habit changing her work clothes for a loose sleeveless jumpsuit hanging up her skirt and blouse neatly as she had been taught it was habit again rather than necessity that had her checking the cotton skirt for wear there was iced tea in the refrigerator and one of those packaged meals for the microwave that she both depended on and detested she laughed at herself as she pushed the buttons to heat it she was getting like an old woman natasha decided cranky and cross from the heat sighing she rubbed the cold glass over her forehead that man had started her off she thought for a few moments in the shop today she had actually started to like him hed been so sweet worrying about his little girl wanting to reward her for being brave enough to face that momentous first day in school shed liked the way his voice had sounded the way his eyes had smiled for those few moments he had seemed like someone she could laugh with talk with then that had changed a part of it was surely her fault she admitted but that didnt diminish his blame she had felt something she hadnt felt hadnt chosen to feel in a long long time that frisson of excitement that tug of need it made her angry and ashamed of herself it made her furious with him the nerve she thought as she yanked her dish out of the microwave flirting with her as if she were some naive fool before he went home to his wife and daughter have dinner with him indeed she jammed her fork into the steaming seafood pasta that kind of man expected payment in full for a meal the candlelight and wine type she thought with a sneer soft voice patient eyes clever hands and no heart just like anthony impatient she set the dish aside and picked up the glass that was already dripping with moisture but she was wiser now than she had been at eighteen much wiser much stronger she was no longer a woman who could be lured by charm and smooth words not that this man was smooth she remembered with a quick smile heвђlord she didnt even know his name and she already detested himвђhe was a little clumsy a little awkward that was a charm of its own but he was she thought very much like anthony tall and blond with those oh so american good looks looks that concealed a lack of morals and a carelessly deceitful heart what anthony had cost her could never be tallied since that time natasha had made very very certain no man would ever cost her so dearly again but she had survived she lifted her glass in a selftoast not only had she survived but except for times when memories crowded in on her she was happy she loved the shop and the chance it gave her to be around children and make them happy in her three years there she had watched them grow she had a wonderful funny friend in annie books that stayed in the black and a home that suited her she heard a thump over her head and smiled the jorgensons were getting ready for the evening meal she imagined don was fussing around marilyn who was carrying their first child natasha liked knowing they were there just above her happy in love and full of hope that was family to her what she had had in her youth what she had expected as an adult she could still see papa fretting over mama when she neared her time every time natasha remembered thinking of her three younger siblings how he had wept with happiness when his wife and babies were safe and well he adored his nadia even now natasha knew he still brought flowers home to the little house in brooklyn when he came home after a days work he kissed his wife not with an absent peck on the cheek but robustly joyfully a man wildly in love after almost thirty years it was her father who had kept her from shoveling all men into the pit anthony had dug for her seeing her father and mother together had kept that small secret hope alight that someday she would find someone who would love her as much and as honestly someday she thought with a shrug but for now she had her own business her own home and her own life no man no matter how beautiful his hands or how clear his eyes was going to rock her boat secretly she hoped her newest customers wife gave him nothing but grief one more story please daddy freddie her eyes heavy her face shiny from her bath used her most persuasive smile she was nestled against spence in her big white canopy bed youre already asleep no im not she peeked up at him fighting to keep her eyes open it had been the very best day of her life and she didnt want it to end did i tell you that jobeths cat had kittens six of them twice spence flicked a finger down her nose he knew a hint when he heard one and fell back on the parents standard well see sleepy freddie smiled she knew from his tone that her father was already weakening mrs pattersons real nice shes going to let us have show and tell every friday so you said and hed been worried spence thought i get the feeling you like school its neat she yawned hugely did you fill out all the forms theyll be ready for you to take in tomorrow all five hundred of them he thought with a sigh time to unplug the batteries funny face one more story the madeup kind she yawned again comforted by the soft cotton of his shut beneath her cheek and the familiar scent of his aftershave he gave in knowing she would sleep long before he got to the happy ever after he wove a story around a beautiful darkhaired princess from a foreign land and the knight who tried to rescue her from her ivory tower foolishness spence thought even as he added a sorcerer and a twoheaded dragon he knew his thoughts were drifting toward natasha again she was certainly beautiful but he didnt think hed ever met a woman less in need of rescuing it was just his bad luck that he had to pass her shop every day to and from campus hed ignore her if anything he should be grateful to her shed made him want made him feel things he hadnt thought he could anymore maybe now that he and freddie were settled hed start socializing again there were plenty of attractive single women at the college but the idea of dating didnt fill him with delight socializing spence corrected dating was for teenagers and conjured up visions of drivein movies pizza and sweaty palms he was a grown man and it was certainly time he started enjoying female companionship again over the age of five he thought looking at freddies small hand balled in his palm just what would you think he asked silently if i brought a woman home to dinner it made him remember how big and hurt her eyes had been when he and angela had swept out of the condo for evenings at the theater or the opera it wont ever be like that again he promised as he shifted her from his chest to the pillow he settled the grinning raggedy ann beside her then tucked the covers under her chin resting a hand on the bedpost he glanced around the room it already had freddies stamp on it the dolls lining the shelves with books jumbled beneath them the fuzzy pink elephant slippers beside her oldest and most favored sneakers the room had that littlegirl scent of shampoo and crayons a nightlight in the shape of a unicorn assured that she wouldnt wake up in the dark and be afraid he stayed a moment longer finding himself as soothed by the light as she quietly he stepped out leaving her door open a few inches downstairs he found vera carrying a tray of coffee the mexican housekeeper was wide from shoulders to hips and gave the impression of a small compact freight train when she moved from room to room since freddies birth she had proven not only efficient but indispensable spence knew it was often possible to insure an employees loyalty with a paycheck but not her love from the moment freddie had come home in her silktrimmed blanket vera had been in love she cast an eye up the stairs now and her lined face folded into a smile she had one big day huh yes and one she fought ending to the last gasp vera you didnt have to bother she shrugged her shoulders while she carried the coffee into his office you said you have to work tonight yes for a little while so i make you coffee before i go in and put my feet up to watch tv she arranged the tray on his desk fussing a bit while she talked my baby shes happy with school and her new friends she didnt add that she had wept into her apron when freddie had stepped onto the bus with the house empty all day i have plenty of time to get my work done you dont stay up too late dr kimball no it was a polite lie he knew he was too restless for sleep thank you vera de nada she patted her irongray hair i wanted to tell you that i like this place very much i was afraid to leave new york but now im happy we couldnt manage without you si she took this as her due for seven years she had worked for the senor and basked in the prestige of being housekeeper for an important manвђa respected musician a doctor of music and a college professor since the birth of his daughter she had been so in love with her baby that she would have worked for spence whatever his station she had grumbled about moving from the beautiful high rise in new york to the rambling house in the small town but vera was shrewd enough to know that the senor had been thinking of freddie freddie had come home from school only hours before laughing excited with the names of new best friends tumbling from her lips so vera was content you are a good father dr kimball spence glanced over before he sat down behind his desk he was well aware that there had been a time vera had considered him a very poor one im learning si casually she adjusted a book on the shelf in this big house you wont have to worry about disturbing freddies sleep if you play your piano at night he looked over again knowing she was encouraging him in her way to concentrate on his music no it shouldnt disturb her good night vera after a quick glance around to be certain there was nothing more for her to tidy she left him alone spence poured the coffee then studied the papers on his desk freddies school forms were stacked next to his own work he had a great deal of preparation ahead of him before his classes began the following week he looked forward to it even as he tried not to regret that the music that had once played so effortlessly inside his head was still silent chapter three contents prev next natasha scooped the barrette through the hair above her ear and hoped it would stay fixed for more than five minutes she studied her reflection in the narrow mirror over the sink in the back of the shop before she decided to add a touch of lipstick it didnt matter that it had been a long and hectic day or that her feet were all but crying with fatigue tonight was her treat to herself her reward for a job well done every semester she signed up for one course at the college she chose whatever seemed most fun most intriguing or most unusual renaissance poetry one year automotive maintenance another this term two evenings a week she would be taking music history tonight she would begin an exploration of a new topic everything she learned she would store for her own pleasure as other women stored diamonds and emeralds it didnt have to be useful in natashas opinion a glittery necklace wasnt particularly useful either it was simply exciting to own she had her notebook her pens and pencils and a flood of enthusiasm to prepare herself she had raided the library and pored over related books for the last two weeks pride wouldnt allow her to go into class ignorant curiosity made her wonder if her instructor could take the dry distant facts and add excitement there was little doubt that this particular instructor was adding dashes of excitement in other quarters annie had teased her just that morning about the new professor everyone was talking about dr spencer b kimball the name sounded very distinguished to natasha quite unlike the description of a hunk that annie had passed along annies information came from her cousins daughter who was majoring in elementary education with a minor in music a sungod annie had relayed and made natasha laugh a very gifted sungod natasha mused while she turned off lights in the shop she knew kimballs work well or the work he had composed before he had suddenly and inexplicably stopped writing music why she had even danced to his prelude in d minor when she had been with the corps de ballet in new york a million years ago she thought as she stepped onto the street now she would be able to meet the genius listen to his views and perhaps find new meanings in many of the classics she already loved he was probably the temperamental artiste type she decided pleased with the way the evening breeze lifted her hair and cooled her neck or a pale eccentric with one earring it didnt matter she intended to work hard each course she took was a matter of pride to her it still stung to remember how little she had known when shed been eighteen how little she had cared to know natasha admitted other than dance she had of her own choice closed herself off from so many worlds in order to focus everything on one when that had been taken away she had been as lost as a child set adrift on the atlantic she had found her way to shore just as her family had once found its way across the wilds of the ukraine to the jungles of manhattan she liked herself betterвђthe independent ambitious american woman she had become as she was now she could walk into the big beautiful old building on campus with as much pride as any freshman student there were footsteps echoing in the corridors distant dislocated there was a hushed reverence that natasha always associated with churches and universities in a way there was religion hereвђthe belief in learning she felt somewhat reverent herself as she made her way to her class as a child of five in her small farming village she had never even imagined such a building or the books and beauty it contained several students were already waiting a mixed bag she noted ranging from college to middle age all of them seemed to buzz with that excitement of beginning she saw by the clock that it was two minutes shy of eight shed expected kimball to be there busily shuffling his papers peering at them behind glasses his hair a little wild and streaming to his shoulders absently she smiled at a young man in hornrims who was staring at her as if hed just woken from a dream ready to begin she sat down then looked up when the same man clumsily maneuvered himself into the desk beside her hello he looked as though shed struck him with a bat rather than offered a casual greeting he pushed his glasses nervously up his nose hello imвђimвђterry maynard he finished on a burst as his name apparently came to him at last natasha she smiled again he was on the sunny side of twentyfive and harmless as a puppy i havent ah seen you on campus before no though at twentyseven it amused her to be taken for a coed she kept her voice sober im only taking this one class for fun for fun terry appeared to take music very seriously do you know who dr kimball is his obvious awe made him almost whisper the name ive heard of him youre a music major yes i hope to well one day i hope to play with the new york symphony his blunt fingers reached nervously to adjust his glasses im a violinist she smiled again and made his adams apple bob thats wonderful im sure youre very good what do you play five card draw then she laughed and settled back in her chair im sorry i dont play an instrument but i love to listen to music and thought id enjoy the class she glanced at the clock on the wall if it ever starts that is apparently our esteemed professor is late at that moment the esteemed professor was rushing down the corridors cursing himself for ever agreeing to take on this night class by the time he had helped freddie with her homeworkвђhow many animals can you find in this pictureвђconvinced her that brussels sprouts were cute instead of yucky and changed his shirt because her affectionate hug had transferred some mysterious sticky substance to his sleeve he had wanted nothing more than a good book and a warm brandy instead he was going to have to face a roomful of eager faces all waiting to learn what beethoven had worn when hed composed his ninth symphony in the foulest of moods he walked into class good evening im dr kimball the murmurs and rattles quieted i must apologize for being late if youll all take a seat well dive right in as he spoke he scanned the room and found himself staring into natashas astonished face no she wasnt aware shed spoken the word aloud and wouldnt have cared it was some sort of joke she thought and a particularly bad one thisвђthis man in the casually elegant jacket was spencer kimball a musician whose songs she had admired and danced to the man who while barely into his twenties had been performing at carnegie hall being hailed as a genius this man who had tried to pick her up in a toy store was the illustrious dr kimball it was ludicrous it was infuriating it wasвђ wonderful spence thought as he stared at her absolutely wonderful in fact it was perfect as long as he could control the laugh that was bubbling in his throat so the czarina was one of his students it was better much better than a warm brandy and an evening of quiet im sure he said after a long pause well all find the next few months fascinating she should have signed up for astronomy natasha told herself she could have learned all kinds of interesting things about the planets and stars asteroids shed have been much better off learning aboutвђwhat was itвђgravitational pull and inertia whatever that was surely it was much more important for her to find out how many moons revolved around jupiter than to study burgundian composers of the fifteenth century she would transfer natasha decided first thing in the morning she would make the arrangements in fact she would get up and walk out right now if she wasnt certain dr spencer kimball would smirk running her pencil between her fingers she crossed her legs and determined not to listen it was a pity his voice was so attractive impatient natasha looked at the clock nearly an hour to go she would do what she did when she waited at the dentists office pretend she was someplace else struggling to block spences voice from her mind she began to swing her foot and doodle on her pad she didnt notice when her doodles became notes or when she began to hang on every word he made fifteenthcentury musicians seem alive and vitalвђand their music as real as flesh and blood rondeaux vieralais ballades she could almost hear the threepart chansons of the dawning renaissance the reverent soaring kyries and glorias of the masses she was caught up involved in that ancient rivalry between church and state and musics part in the politics she could see huge banqueting halls filled with elegantly dressed aristocrats feasting on music as well as food next time well be discussing the francoremish school and rhythmic developments spence gave his class an easy smile and ill try to be on time was it over natasha glanced at the clock again and was shocked to see it was indeed after nine incredible isnt he she looked at terry his eyes were gleaming behind his lenses yes it cost her to admit it but truth was truth you should hear him in theory class he noticed with envy that several students were grouped around his idol as yet terry hadnt worked up the nerve to approach him illвђsee you thursday what oh good night terry i could ah give you a ride home if you want the fact that he was nearly out of gas and his muffler was currently held on by a coat hanger didnt enter his mind she favored him with an absent smile that had his heart doing a chacha thats nice of you but i dont live far she hoped to breeze out of the classroom while spence was still occupied she should have known better he simply put a hand on her arm and stopped her id like to speak with you a moment natasha im in a hurry it wont take long he nodded to the last of his departing students then eased back against his desk and grinned at her i should have paid more attention to my roster but then again its nice to know there are still surprises in the world that depends on your point of view dr kimball spence he continued to grin class is over so it is her regal nod made him think again of russian royalty excuse me natasha he waited almost seeing impatience shimmer around her as she turned i cant imagine that someone with your heritage doesnt believe in destiny destiny of all the classrooms in all the universities in all the world she walks into mine she wouldnt laugh shed be damned if she would but her mouth quirked up at the comers before she controlled it and here i was thinking it was just bad luck why music history she balanced her notebook on her hip it was a tossup between that and astronomy that sounds like a fascinating story why dont we go down the street for a cup of coffee you can tell me about it now he saw itвђmolten fury that turned her eyes from rich velvet to sharp jet now why does that infuriate you he inquired almost to himself is an offer of a cup of coffee in this town similar to an illicit proposition you should know dr kimball she turned but he reached the door before her slamming it with enough force to make her step back he was every bit as angry as herself she noted not that it mattered it was only that he had seemed a mild sort of man detestable but mild there was nothing mild about him now those fascinating bones and angles in his face might have been carved of stone clarify open the door gladly after you answer my question he was angry spence realized he hadnt felt this kind of hot bloodpumping rage in years it felt wonderful i realize that just because im attracted to you doesnt mean you have to return the favor she threw up her chin hating herself for finding the stormcloudgray eyes so hypnotic i dont fine he couldnt strangle her for that however much hed like to but damn it i want to know why you aim and fire every time im around you because men like you deserve to be shot men like me he repeated measuring out the words what exactly does that mean he was standing close all but looming over her as in the shop when he had brushed up against her she felt those bubble bursts of excitement attraction confusion it was more than enough to push her over the edge do you think because you have a nice face and a pretty smile you can do whatever you like yes she answered before he could speak and slapped her notebook against his chest you think you have only to snap your fingers she demonstrated dramatically and a woman will fall into your arms not this woman her accent thickened when she was on a roll he noted somewhat baffled by her claim i dont recall snapping my fingers she let loose one short explicit ukrainian oath and grabbed the knob you want to have a cup of coffee with me good well have your coffeeвђand well call your wife and ask her to join us my what he closed his hand over hers so that the door was jerked open then slammed shut again i dont have a wife really the single word dripped with scorn her eyes flashed at him and i suppose the woman who came with you to the shop is your sister it should have been funny but he couldnt quite get the joke nina as a matter of fact she is natasha yanked open the door with a sound of disgust that is pathetic filled with righteous indignation she stormed down the corridor and out the main door in a staccato rhythm that matched her mood her heels beat on the concrete as she started down the steps when she was abruptly whirled around she nearly took the last two in a tumble youve got a hell of a nerve i she managed i have a nerve you think youve got it all figured out dont you having the advantage of height spence could stare down at her natasha saw shadows move over his face as temper colored his voice he didnt appear awkward now but every bit in control or i should say you think youve got me figured it takes very little the fingers on her arm were very firm she hated knowing that mixed with her own anger was basic sexual attraction fighting it off she tossed back her hair youre really very typical i wonder can your opinion of me get any lower now fury ground edge to edge with desire doubtful in that case i might as well satisfy myself the notebook flew out of her hand when he dragged her close she managed a single startled sound in her throat before his mouth covered hers covered crushed then conquered natasha would have fought him over and over she told herself she would fight him but it was shockвђat least she prayed it was shockвђthat had her arms falling limply to her sides it was wrong it was unforgivable and oh god it was wonderful instinctively hed found the key to unlock the passion that had lain dormant in her for so long her blood swam hot with it her mind hazed dimly she heard someone laugh as they strolled down the sidewalk below a beep of a car horn a shout of greeting then silence once more she murmured a pitiful protest that shamed her and was easily ignored as his tongued glided over her own his taste was a banquet after a long fast though she kept her hands balled at her sides she leaned into the kiss kissing her was like walking through a mine field any moment he expected the bomb to go off and blow him to pieces he should have stopped after the first shock but danger had a thrill of its own and she was dangerous as his fingers dived into her hair he could feel the ground quiver and quake it was herвђthe promise the threat of titanic passion he could taste it on her lips even as she fought to hold it back he could feel it in her taut terrified stance if she released it she could make him a slave needs such as hed never known battered his system with heavy fists images all fire and smoke danced in his brain something struggled to break free like a bird beating at the bars of a cage he could feel it straining then natasha was pulling away from him standing apart and staring at him with wide eloquent eyes she couldnt breathe for an instant she was genuinely afraid she would die on the spot with this unwanted shameful desire on her conscience in defiance she took a huge gulp of air i could never hate anyone as much as i hate you he shook his head to clear it she had left him dizzy dazed and utterly defenseless for his own sake he waited until he was sure he could speak thats a lofty position you put me in natasha he stepped down until they were at eye level there were tears on her lashes but they were offset by the condemnation in her eyes lets just be sure youve put me there for the right reasons is it because i kissed you or because you liked it she swung her hand out he could have avoided the blow easily enough but thought she deserved a hit as the crack of the slap echoed he decided they were even dont come near me again she said breathing hard i warn you if you do i wont care what i say or who hears me if it wasnt for your little girlвђ she broke off and bent to gather her things her pride was shattered along with her selfesteem you dont deserve such a beautiful child he caught her arm again but this time the expression on his face made her blood go cold youre right i never have and probably never will deserve freddie but im all she has her motherвђmy wifeвђdied three years ago he strode off was caught in the beam of a street lamp then disappeared into the dark beyond her notebook pressed against her chest natasha sank weakly onto the bottom step what in hell was she going to do now there was no choice no matter how much she hated it there was really only one course to take natasha rubbed the palms of her hands on the thighs of her khakis then started up the freshly painted wooden steps it was a nice house she thought stalling of course shed seen it so often that she rarely noticed it anymore it was one of those sturdy old brick places tucked back from the street and shielded by trees and box hedges the summer flowers had yet to fade but the fall blooms were already staking their claim showy delphiniums vied with spicy scented mums vivid dahlias with starry asters someone was caring for them she could see fresh mulch on the flower beds damp with watering wanting a little more time she studied the house there were curtains at the windows thin ivory sheers that would let in the light higher up she caught a glimpse of a fanciful pattern of unicorns that identified a little girls room she gathered her courage and crossed the porch to the front door it would be quick she promised herself not painless but quick she rapped released her breath and waited the woman who answered was short and wide with a face as brown and wrinkled as a raisin natasha found herself fixed by a pair of small dark eyes while the housekeeper dried her hands on the skirt of a stained apron may i help you id like to see dr kimball if hes in she smiled pretending she didnt feel as though she were stepping into the pillory im natasha stanislaski she saw the housekeepers little eyes narrow so that they nearly disappearing into the folds of her face vera had at first taken natasha for one of the senors students and had been prepared to nudge her on her way you own the toy store in town thats right ah with a nod she opened the door wider to let natasha in freddie says you are a very nice lady who gave her a blue ribbon for her doll i promised to take her back but just to look she gestured for natasha to follow as they made their way down the hall natasha caught the hesitant notes of a piano when she saw her reflection in an old oval mirror it surprised her that she was smiling he was sitting at the piano with the child on his lap looking over her head while she slowly tapped out mary had a little lamb the sun streamed in through the windows behind them at that moment she wished she could paint how else could it be captured it was perfect the light the shadows the pale pastels of the room all combined to make the perfect backdrop the alignment of their heads their bodies was too natural and eloquent ever to be posed the girl was in pink and white the laces of one sneaker untied he had taken off his jacket and tie then rolled up the sleeves of the pale dress shirt to the elbows like a workman there was the fragile shine of the childs hair the deeper glow of his the child leaned back against her father her head resting just under his collarbone the faintest smile of pleasure lighted her face over it all was the simple nursery rhyme music she was playing he had his hands on the knees of her jeans his long beautiful fingers tapping the time in tandem with the tick of the antique metronome she could see it all the love the patience the pride no please natasha whispered holding out a hand to vera dont disturb them you play now daddy freddie tilted her head toward his her hair wisped around her face where it had escaped from its clips play something pretty fur elise natasha recognized it instantly that soft romantic somehow lonely music it went straight to her heart as she watched his fingers stroke caress seduce the keys what was he thinking she could see that his thoughts had turned inwardвђto the music to himself there was an effortlessness in the way his fingers flowed over the keys and yet she knew that kind of beauty was never achieved without the greatest effort the song swelled note after note unbearably sad impossibly beautiful like the vase of waxy calla lilies that rested on the glossy surface of the piano too much emotion natasha thought too much pain though the sun was still shining through the gauzy curtains and the child on his lap continued to smile the urge to go to him to put a comforting hand onto his shoulder to hold them both against her heart was so strong that she had to curl her fingers into her palms then the music drifted away the last note lingering like a sigh i like that one freddie told him did you make it up no he looked at his fingers spreading them flexing them then letting them rest on hers beethoven did then he was smiling again pressing his lips to the soft curve of his daughters neck had enough for today funny face can i play outside until dinner wellвђ whatll you give me it was an old game and a favorite one giggling she swiveled on his lap and gave him a hard smacking kiss still squealing from the bear hug she spotted natasha hi miss stanislaski would like to see you dr kimball at his nod vera walked back to the kitchen hello natasha managed to smile even when spence lifted his daughter and turned she wasnt over the music yet it was still pouring through her like tears i hope i havent come at a bad time no after a last squeeze he set freddie down and she immediately bounded to natasha were all finished with my lesson did you come to play no not this time unable to resist natasha bent to stroke freddies cheek actually i came to talk to your father but she was a coward natasha thought in disgust rather than look at him she continued to address freddie how do you like school you have mrs patterson dont you shes nice she didnt even yell when mikey towerss icky bug collection got loose in the classroom and i can read all of go dog go natasha crouched so that they were eye to eye do you like my hat freddie laughed recognizing the line from the dr seuss classic i like the dog party part the best so do i automatically she tied freddies loose laces will you come to the store and visit me soon okay delighted with herself freddie raced for the door bye miss stanofвђstanifвђ tash she sent freddie a wink all the kids call me tash tash freddie grinned at the sound of the name then streaked away she listened to freddies sneakers squeak down the hall then took a long breath im sorry to disturb you at home but i felt it would be moreвђ what was the word appropriate comfortable it would be better all right his eyes were very cool not like those of the man who had played such sad and passionate music would you like to sit down no she said it too quickly then reminded herself that it was better if they were both stiffly polite it wont take long i only want to apologize oh for something specific fire blazed in her eyes he enjoyed seeing it particularly since hed spent most of the night cursing her when i make a mistake i make a point of admitting it but since you behaved soвђ oh why did she always lose her english when she was angry unconscionably he suggested her brow shot up into her fall of hair so you admit it i thought you were the one who was here to admit something enjoying himself he sat on the arm of a wing chair in pale blue damask dont let me interrupt she was tempted very tempted to turn on her heel and stalk out pride was equally as strong as temper she would do what she had come to do then forget it what i said about youвђabout you and your daughter was unfair and untrue even when i wasвђ mistaken about other things i knew it was untrue and im very sorry i said it i can see that out of the corner of his eye he caught a movement he turned his head in time to see freddie make her sprinters rush for the swings well forget it natasha followed his gaze and softened she really is a beautiful child i hope you let her come into the shop from time to time the tone of her voice had him studying natasha more carefully was it longing sorrow i doubt i could keep her away youre very fond of children natasha brought her emotions under control with a quick jerk yes of course in my business its a requirement i wont keep you dr kimball he rose to accept the hand she had formally held out spence he corrected gently tightening his fingers on hers what else was it you were mistaken about so it wasnt going to be easy then again natasha thought she deserved a dose of humiliation i thought you were married and was very angry and insulted when you asked me out youre taking my word now that im not married no i looked it up in the library in whos who he stared at her for a moment longer then threw back his head and laughed god what a trusting soul find anything else that interested you only things that would fill your ego you still have my hand i know tell me natasha did you dislike me on general principles or only because you thought i was a married man and had no business flirting with you fluting she nearly choked on the word there was nothing so innocent in the way you looked at me as ifвђ as ifвђ he prompted as if we were already lovers she thought and felt her skin heat i didnt like it she said shortly because you thought i was married yes no she said correcting herself when she realized where that could lead i just didnt like it he brought her hand to his lips dont she managed how would you like me to look at you it isnt necessary for you to look at all but it is he could feel it again that highstrung passion just waiting to burst free from whatever cell she had locked it in youll be sitting right in front of me tomorrow night in class im going to transfer no you wont he brushed a finger over the small gold hoop in her ear you enjoyed it too much i could see the wheels turning in that fabulous head of yours and if you did he continued before she could sputter out a response id just make a nuisance of myself in your shop why because youre the first woman ive wanted in longer than i can remember excitement rippled up her spine like chain lightning before she could prevent it the memory of that stormy kiss curved back to weaken her yes that had been a man who had wanted and had no matter how she had resisted made her want too but that had only been one kiss fueled by lust despite the moonlight and soft air she knew heartbreakingly well where such desires could lead thats nonsense simple honesty he murmured fascinated by the emotions that came and went in her dark eyes i thought it best since wed gotten off to such a shaky beginning since youve determined for yourself that im not married knowing im attracted to you shouldnt insult you im not insulted she said carefully im just not interested do you always kiss men youre not interested in i didnt kiss you she jerked her hand free you kissed me we can fix that he gathered her close this time kiss me back she could have pulled away his arms werent banding her as they had before but were wrapped loosely coaxingly around her his lips were soft this time soft persuasive patient she could feel the warmth seep into her bloodstream like a drug with a little moan she slipped her hands up his back and held on it was like holding a candle and feeling the wax slowly melt as the fire burned at its center he could feel her yield degree by degree until her lips parted for his own accepting inviting but even as she gave he could sense some strong hard core that resisted held back she didnt want to feel whatever he was making her feel impatient he dragged her closer though her body molded itself to his and her head fell back in erotic surrender there was still a part of her standing just out of his reach what she gave him only stirred his appetite for more she was breathless when he released her it took an effort too much of an effort natasha thought to level herself but once she had her voice was steady i dont want to be involved with me or with anyone with anyone good he brushed a hand over her hair itll be simpler to change your mind im very stubborn she muttered yes ive noticed why dont you stay for dinner no all right ill take you to dinner saturday night no seventhirty ill pick you up no you wouldnt want me to come by the shop saturday afternoon and embarrass you out of patience she stalked to the door i cant understand how a man that could play music with such sensitivity could be such a clod just lucky i guess he thought when the door slammed alone again he caught himself whistling chapter four contents prev next saturdays in a toy store were noisy crowded and chaotic they were supposed to be to a child even the word saturday was magicвђit meant a magic twentyfour hours when school was too faraway to be a problem there were bikes to be ridden games to be played races to be won for as long as natasha had been running the fun house she had enjoyed saturdays as much as her pintsize clientele it was one more black mark against spence that he was the reason she couldnt enjoy this one shed told him no she reminded herself as she rang up sales on a set of jacks three plastic dinosaurs and a pint of blowing bubbles and shed meant no the man didnt seem to understand plain english why else would he have sent her the single red rose and to the shop of all places she thought now trying to scowl at it annies romantic enthusiasm had been impossible to hold off even when natasha had ignored the flower annie had rescued it running across the street to buy a plastic bud vase so that it could have a place of honor on the checkout counter natasha did her best not to look at it not to stroke the tightly closed petals but it wasnt as easy to ignore the fragile scent that wafted toward her every time she rang up a sale why did men think they could soften up a woman with a flower because they could natasha admitted biting off a sigh as she glanced toward it that didnt mean she was going out to dinner with him tossing back her hair natasha counted out the pile of sweaty pennies and nickels the young hampston boy passed her for his monthly comicbook purchase life should be so simple she thought as the boy rushed out with the latest adventures of commander zark damn it it was that simple on a deep breath she steeled her determination her life was exactly that simple no matter how spence tried to complicate it to prove it she intended to go home soak in a hot tub then spend the rest of her evening stretched out on the sofa watching an old movie and eating popcorn hed been clever she left the counter to go into the next aisle to referee a huffy disagreement between the freedmont brothers about how they should spend their pooled resources she wondered if the esteemed professor looked at their relationshipвђtheir nonrelationship she correctedвђas a chess match shed always been too reckless too succeed at that particular game but she had a feeling spence would play it patiently and well all the same if he thought she would be easily checkmated he had a surprise coming spence had led her second class brilliantly never looking at her any longer than he had looked at any of his other students answering her questions in the same tone he used with others yes a very patient player then just when shed relaxed hed passed her that first red rose as she walked out of class a very smart move to endanger her queen if shed had any spine at all natasha thought now she would have dropped it onto the floor and ground it under her heel but she hadnt and now had to scramble to keep one play ahead of him because it had caught her off guard natasha told herself just like the one that had been delivered to the shop this morning if he kept it up people were going to begin to talk in a town this size news items like red roses bounced from shop to pub from pub to front stoop and from front stoop to backyard gossip sessions she needed to find a way to stop it at the moment she couldnt come up with anything better than ignoring it ignoring spence she added how she wished she could bringing herself back to the problem at hand natasha hooked an arm around each of the squabbling freedmont boys in a mock headlock enough if you keep calling each other names like nerd andвђ what was the other dork the taller of the boys told her with relish yes dork she couldnt resist committing it to memory thats a good one if you keep it up ill tell your mother not to let you come in for two weeks aw tash that means everyone else will see all the creepy things i get in for halloween before either of you she let that threat hang giving the two little necks a quick squeeze so ill make a suggestion flip a coin and decide whether to buy the football or the magic set whatever you dont get now you ask for for christmas good idea the boys grimaced at each other from either side of her pretty good no you have to say its very good or ill knock your heads together she left them arguing over which coin to use for the fatal flip you missed your calling annie commented when the brothers raced off with the football hows that you should be working for the un she nodded out the front window the boys were practicing passing on their way down the street there arent many tougher nuts than the freedmont brothers i make them afraid of me first then offer them a dignified way out see definitely un material with a laugh natasha shook her head other peoples problems are the easiest to solve weakening she glanced toward the rose again if she had one wish at the moment it would be for someone to come along and solve her own an hour later she felt a tug on the hem of her skirt hi freddie hello she flicked her finger over a bow that was trying to hold back freddies flyaway hair it was tied from the blue ribbon natasha had given her on her first visit dont you look pretty today freddie beamed female to female do you like my outfit natasha surveyed the obviously new blue denim overalls parade stiff with sizing i like it very much i have a pair just like them you do nothing since freddie had decided to make natasha her newest heroine could have pleased her more my daddy got them for me thats nice despite her better judgment natasha scanned the shop for him did he ah bring you in today no vera did you said it was all right just to look sure it is im glad you came in and she was natasha realized just as she was stupidly disappointed that freddie hadnt brought her daddy im not supposed to touch anything freddie tucked her itchy fingers into her pockets vera said i should look with my eyes and not with my hands thats very good advice and some natasha wouldnt have minded others passing along to nimblefingered children but some things are okay to touch you just ask me okay im going to join the brownies and get a uniform and everything thats wonderful youll come in and show it to me delight nearly split freddies face in two okay it has a hat and im going to learn how to make pillows and candle holders and all kinds of things ill make you something id like that she tidied freddies lopsided bow daddy said you were going to eat dinner with him in a restaurant tonight well iвђ i dont like restaurants very much except for pizza so im going to stay home and veras going to fix tortillas for me and jobeth we get to eat in the kitchen that sounds nice if you dont like the restaurant you can come back and have some vera always makes a lot uttering a helpless little sigh natasha bent to tie freddies left shoelace thank you your hair smells pretty half in love natasha leaned closer to sniff freddies so does yours fascinated by natashas tangle of curls freddie reached out to touch i wish my hair was like yours she said its straight as a pin she added quoting her aunt nina smiling natasha brushed at the fragile wisps over freddies brow when i was a little girl we put an angel on top of the christmas tree every year she was very beautiful and she had hair just like yours pleasure came flushing into freddies cheeks ah there you are vera shuffled down the crowded aisle straw carryall on one arm a canvas bag on the other come come we must get back home before your father thinks we are lost she held out a hand for freddie and nodded to natasha good afternoon miss good afternoon curious natasha raised a brow she was being summed up again by the little dark eyes and definitely being found wanting natasha thought i hope youll bring freddie back to visit soon we will see it is as hard for a child to resist a toy store as it is for a man to resist a beautiful woman vera led freddie down the aisle not looking back when the girl waved and grinned over her shoulder well annie murmured as she stuck her head around the corner what brought that on with a humorless smile natasha shoved a pin back into her hair at a guess i would say the woman believes i have designs on her employer annie gave an unladylike snort if anything the employer has designs on you i should be so lucky her sigh was only a little envious now that we know the new hunk on the block isnt married alls right with the world why didnt you tell me you were going out with him because i wasnt but i heard freddie sayвђ he asked me out natasha clarified i said no i see after a brief pause annie tilted her head when did you have the accident accident yes the one where you suffered brain damage natashas face cleared with a laugh and she started toward the front of the shop im serious annie said as soon as they had five free minutes dr spencer kimball is gorgeous unattached andвђ she leaned over the counter to sniff at the rose charming why arent you taking off early to work on real problems like what to wear tonight i know what im wearing tonight my bathrobe annie couldnt resist the grin arent you rushing things just a tad i dont think you should wear your robe until at least your third date theres not going to be a first one natasha smiled at her next customer and rang up a sale it took annie forty minutes to work back to the subject at hand just what are you afraid of the irs tash im serious so am i when her pins worked loose again she gave up and yanked them out every american business person is afraid of the irs were talking about spence kimball no natasha corrected youre talking about spence kimball i thought we were friends surprised by annies tone natasha stopped tidying the racetrack display her saturday visitors had wrecked we are you know we are friends talk to each other tash confide in each other ask advice puffing out a breath annie stuffed her hands into the pockets of her baggy jeans look i know that things happened to you before you came here things youre still carrying around but never talk about i figured i was being a better friend by not asking you about it had she been so obvious natasha wondered all this time shed been certain she had buried the past and all that went with itвђdeeply feeling a little helpless she reached out to touch annies hand thank you with a dismissive shrug annie turned to flick the lock on the front door the shop was empty now the bustle of the afternoon only an echo remember when you let me cry on your shoulder after don newman dumped me natasha pressed her lips into a thin line he wasnt worth crying over i enjoyed crying over him annie returned with a quick amused smile i needed to cry and yell and moan and get a little drunk you were right there for me saying all those great nasty things about him that was the easy part natasha remembered he was a dork it pleased her tremendously to use the young freedmont boys insult yeah but he was a terrificlooking dork annie allowed herself a brief reminiscence anyway you helped me over that rough spot until i convinced myself i was better off without him youve never needed my shoulder tash because youve never let a guy get past this she lifted a hand pressing her palm against empty air amused natasha leaned back against the counter and what is that the great stanislaski force field annie told her guaranteed to repel all males from the age of twentyfive to fifty natasha lifted a brow not quite sure if she was amused any longer im not certain if youre trying to flatter or insult me neither just listen to me a minute okay annie took a deep breath to keep herself from rushing through something she thought should be taken stepbystep tash ive seen you brush off guys with less effort than youd swat away a gnat and just as automatically she added when natasha remained silent youre very pleasant about it and also very definite ive never seen you give any man a seconds thought once youve politely shown him the door ive even admired you for it for being so sure of yourself so comfortable with yourself that you didnt need a date on saturday night to keep your ego out of the dirt not sure of myself natasha murmured just apathetic about relationships all right annie nodded slowly ill accept that but this time its different what is natasha skirted the counter and began to tally the days sales you see you know im going to mention his name and youre nervous im not nervous natasha lied youve been nervous moody and distracted since kimball walked into the shop a couple of weeks ago in over three years ive never seen you give a man more than five minutes thought until now thats only because this one is more annoying than most at annies shrewd look natasha gave up all right there isвђ something she admitted but im not interested youre afraid to be interested natasha didnt like the sound of that but forced herself to shrug it off its the same thing no its not annie put a hand over natashas and squeezed look im not pushing you toward this guy for all i know he could have murdered his wife and buried her in the rose garden all im saying is youre not going to be comfortable with yourself until you stop being afraid annie was right natasha thought later as she sat on her bed with her chin on her hand she was moody she was distracted and she was afraid not of spence natasha assured herself no man would ever frighten her again but she was afraid of the feelings he stirred up forgotten unwanted feelings did that mean she was no longer in charge of her emotions no did that mean she would act irrationally impulsively just because needs and desires had pried their way back into her life no did that mean she would hide in her room afraid to face a man a most definite no she was only afraid because she had yet to test herself natasha thought moving toward her closet so tonight she would have dinner with the persistent dr kimball prove to herself that she was strong and perfectly capable of resisting a fleeting attraction then get back to normal natasha frowned at her wardrobe with a restless move of her shoulders she pulled out a deep blue cocktail dress with a jeweled belt not that she was dressing for him he was really irrelevant it was one of her favorite dresses natasha thought as she stripped off her robe and she rarely had the opportunity to wear anything but work clothes he knocked at precisely seven twentyeight natasha detested herself for anxiously watching the clock she had reapplied her lipstick twice checked and rechecked the contents of her purse and fervently wished that she had delayed taking her stand she was acting like a teenager natasha told herself as she walked to the door it was only dinner the first and last dinner she intended to share with him and he was only a man she added pulling the door open an outrageously attractive man he looked wonderful was all she could think with his hair swept back from his face and that half smile in his eyes it had never occurred to her that a man could be gut wrenchingly sexy in a suit and a tie hi he held out another red rose natasha nearly sighed it was a pity the smokegray suit didnt make him seem more professorial giving in a little she tapped the blossom against her cheek it wasnt the roses that changed my mind about what about having dinner with you she stepped back deciding that she had no choice but to let him in while she put the flower into water he smiled then fully and exasperated her by looking charming and cocky at the same time what did im hungry she set her short velvet jacket on the arm of the sofa ill put this in water you can sit if you like she wasnt going to give him an inch spence thought as he watched her walk away oddly enough that only made her more interesting he took a deep breath shaking his head incredible just when he was convinced that nothing smelled sexier than soap she put something on that made him think of midnight and weeping violins deciding that he was safer thinking of something else he studied the room she preferred vivid colors he mused noting the emerald and teal slashes of the pillows on a sapphireblue couch there was a huge brass urn beside it stuffed with silky peacock feathers candles of varying sizes and shades were set around the room so that it smelled romantically of vanilla and jasmine and gardenia a shelf in the corner was crammed with books that ran the gamut from popular fiction to classic literature by way of home improvements for the novice the table surfaces were crowded with mementos framed pictures dried bouquets fanciful statuettes inspired by fairy tales there was a gingerbread house no bigger than his palm a girl dressed as red riding hood a pig peeking out of the window of a tiny straw house a beautiful woman holding a single glass slipper practical tips on plumbing passionate colors and fairy tales he mused touching a fingertip to the tiny crystal slipper it was as curious and as intriguing a combination as the woman herself hearing her come back into the room spence turned these are beautiful he said gesturing to one of the figures freddies eyes would pop out thank you my brother makes them makes them fascinated spence picked up the gingerbread house to study it more closely it was carved from polished wood then intricately painted so that each licorice whip and lollipop looked good enough to eat its incredible you rarely see workmanship like this whatever her reservations she warmed toward him and crossed the room to join him hes been carving and sculpting since he was a child one day his art will be in galleries and museums it should be already the sincerity in his voice hit her most vulnerable spot her love of family its not so easy hes young and hardheaded and proud so he keeps his job hammering wood instead of carving it to bring in money for the family but one dayвђ she smiled at the collection he makes these for me because i struggled so hard to learn to read english from this book of fairy tales i found in the boxes of things the church gave us when we came to new york the pictures were so pretty and i wanted so badly to know the stories that went with them she caught herself embarrassed to have said anything we should go he only nodded having already decided to pry gently until she told him more you should wear your jacket he lifted it from the sofa its getting chilly the restaurant hed chosen was only a short drive away and sat on one of the wooded hills that overlooked the potomac if natasha had been given a guess she would have been on target with his preference for a quiet elegant backdrop and discreetly speedy service over her first glass of wine she told herself to relax and enjoy freddie was in the shop today so i heard amused spence lifted his own glass she wants her hair curled natashas puzzled look became a smile she lifted a hand to her own oh thats sweet easy for you to say ive just gotten the hang of pigtails to her surprise natasha could easily picture him patiently braiding the soft flaxen tresses shes beautiful the image of him holding the girl on his lap at the piano slipped back into her mind she has your eyes dont look now spence murmured but i believe youve given me a compliment feeling awkward natasha lifted the menu to soften the blow she told him im about to make up for skipping lunch this afternoon true to her word she ordered generously as long as she was eating natasha figured the interlude would go smoothly over appetizers she was careful to steer the conversation toward subjects they had touched on in class comfortably they discussed late fifteenthcentury music with its fourpart harmonies and traveling musicians spence appreciated her genuine curiosity and interest but was equally determined to explore more personal areas tell me about your family natasha slipped a hot butterdrenched morsel of lobster into her mouth enjoying the delicate almost decadent flavor im the oldest of four she began then became abruptly aware that his fingertips were playing casually with hers on the tablecloth she slid her hand out of reach her maneuver had him lifting his glass to hide a smile are you all spies a flicker of temper joined the lights that the candle brought to her eyes certainly not i wondered since you seem so reluctant to talk about them his face sober he leaned toward her say get moose and squirrel her mouth quivered before she gave up and laughed no she dipped her lobster in melted butter again coating it slowly enjoying the scent then the taste and texture i have two brothers and a sister my parents still live in brooklyn why did you move here to west virginia i wanted a change she lifted a shoulder didnt you yes a faint line appeared between his brows as he studied her you said you were about freddies age when you came to the states do you remember much about your life before that of course for some reason she sensed he was thinking more of his daughter than of her own memories of the ukraine ive always believed impressions made on us in those first few years stay the longest good or bad they help form what we are concerned she leaned closer smiling tell me when you think about being five what do you remember sitting at the piano doing scales it came so clearly that he nearly laughed smelling hothouse roses and watching the snow outside the window being torn between finishing my practice and getting to the park to throw snowballs at my nanny your nanny natasha repeated but with a chuckle rather than a sneer he noted she cupped her chin in her hands leaning closer alluring him with the play of light and shadow over her face and what did you do both a responsible child he ran a fingertip down her wrist and surprised a shiver out of her before she moved her hand away he felt her pulse scramble what do you remember about being five because her reaction annoyed her she was determined to show him nothing she only shrugged my father bringing in wood for the fire his hair and coat all covered with snow the baby cryingвђmy youngest brother the smell of the bread my mother had baked pretending to be asleep while i listened to papa talk to her about escape were you afraid yes her eyes blurred with the memory she didnt often look back didnt often need to but when she did it came not with the watery look of old dreams but clear as glass oh yes very afraid more than i will ever be again will you tell me why his eyes were dark and fixed on her face because id like to understand she started to pass it off even had the words in her mind but the memory remained too vivid we waited until spring and took only what we could carry we told no one no one at all and set off in the wagon papa said we were going to visit my mothers sister who lived in the west but i think there were some who knew who watched us go with tired faces and big eyes papa had papers badly forged but he had a map and hoped we would avoid the border guards and you were only five nearly six by then thinking she ran a fingertip around and around the rim of her glass mikhail was between four and five alex just two at night if we could risk a fire we would sit around it and papa would tell stories those were good nights we would fall asleep listening to his voice and smelling the smoke from the fire we went over the mountains and into hungary it took us ninetythree days he couldnt imagine it not even when he could see it reflected so clearly in her eyes her voice was low but the emotions were all there bringing it richness thinking of the little girl he took her hand and waited for her to go on my father had planned for years perhaps he had dreamed it all of his life he had names people who would help defectors there was war the cold one but i was too young to understand i understood the fear in my parents in the others who helped us we were smuggled out of hungary into austria the church sponsored us brought us to america it was a long time before i stopped waiting for the police to come and take my father away she brought herself back embarrassed to have spoken of it surprised to find her hand caught firmly in his thats a lot for a child to deal with i also remember eating my first hot dog she smiled and picked up her wine again she never spoke of that time never not even with family now that she had with him she felt a desperate need to change the subject and the day my father brought home our first television no childhood even one with nannies is ever completely secure but we grow up im a businesswoman and youre a respected composer why dont you write she felt his fingers tense on hers im sorry she said quickly i had no business asking that its all right his fingers relaxed again i dont write because i cant she hesitated then went on impulse i know your music something that intense doesnt fade it hasnt mattered a great deal in the past couple of years just lately its begun to matter again dont be patient when he smiled she shook her head at once impatient and regal her hand was gripping his now hard and strong no i mean it people always say when the time is right when the mood is right when the place is right years are wasted that way if my father had waited until we were older until the trip was safer we might still be in the ukraine there are some things that should be grabbed with both hands and taken life can be very very short he could feel the urgency in the way her hands gripped his and he could see the shadow of regret in her eyes the reason for both intrigued him as much as her words you may be right he said slowly then brought the palm of her hand to his lips waiting isnt always the best answer its getting late natasha pulled her hand free then balled it into a fist on her lap but that didnt stop the heat from spearing her arm we should go she was relaxed again when he walked her to her door during the short drive home he had made her laugh with stories of freddies ploys to interest him in a kitten i think cutting pictures of cats from a magazine to make you a poster was very clever she turned to lean back against her front door you are going to let her have one im trying not to be a pushover natasha only smiled big old houses like yours tend to get mice in the winter in fact in a house of that size youd be wise to take two of jobeths kittens if freddie pulls that one on me ill know exactly where she got it he twirled one of natashas curls around his fingers and you have a quiz coming up next week natasha lifted both brows blackmail dr kimball you bet i intend to ace your quiz and i have a strong feeling that freddie could talk you into taking the entire litter all by herself if she put her mind to it just the little gray one youve already been to see them a couple of times youre not going to ask me in no all right he slipped his arms around her waist spenceвђ im just taking your advice he murmured as he skimmed his lips over her jaw not being patient he brought her closer his mouth brushed her earlobe taking what i want his teeth scraped over her bottom lip not wasting time then he was crushing his mouth against hers he could taste the faintest tang of wine on her lips and knew he could get drunk on that alone her flavors were rich exotic intoxicating like the hint of autumn in the air she made him think of smoking fires drifting fog and her body was already pressed eagerly against his in an instantaneous acknowledgment passion didnt bloom it didnt whisper it exploded so that even the air around them seemed to shudder with it she made him feel reckless unaware of what he murmured to her he raced his lips over her face coming back always coming back to her heated hungry mouth in one rough stroke he took his hands over her her head was spinning if only she could believe it was the wine but she knew it was he only he who made her dizzy and dazed and desperate she wanted to be touched by him on a breathless moan she let her head fall back and the urgent trail of his lips streaked down her throat feeling this way had to be wrong old fears and doubts swirled inside her leaving empty holes that begged to be filled and when they were filled with liquid shimmering pleasure the fear only grew spence her fingers dug into his shoulders she fought a war between the need to stop him and the impossible desire to go on please he was as shaken as she and took a moment burying his face in her hair something happens to me every time im with you i cant explain it she wanted badly to hold him against herself but forced her arms to drop to her sides it cant continue to happen he drew away just far enough to be able to take her face into both hands the chill of the evening and the heat of passion had brought color to her cheeks if i wanted to stop it which i dont i couldnt she kept her eyes level with his and tried not to be moved by the gentle way he cradled her face you want to go to bed with me yes he wasnt certain if he wanted to laugh or curse her for being so matteroffact but its not quite that simple sex is never simple his eyes narrowed im not interested in having sex with you you just saidвђ i want to make love with you theres a difference i dont choose to romanticize it the annoyance in his eyes vanished as quickly as it had appeared then im sorry ill have to disappoint you when we make love whenever wherever its going to be very romantic before she could evade he closed his mouth over hers thats a promise i intend to keep chapter five contents prev next natasha hey ah natasha broken out of thoughts that werent particularly productive natasha glanced over and spied terry he was wearing a long yellowand whitestriped scarf in defense against a sudden plunge in temperature that had sprinkled frost on the ground as he raced after her it flapped awkwardly behind him by the time he reached her his glasses had slipped crookedly down to the tip of his reddening nose hi terry the hundredyard dash had winded him he dearly hoped it wouldnt aggravate his asthma hi i wasвђi saw you heading in hed been waiting hopefully for her for twenty minutes feeling a bit like a mother with a clumsy child she straightened his glasses then wrapped the scarf more securely around his skinny neck his rapid breathing fogged his lenses you should be wearing gloves she told him then patting his chilled hand led him up the steps overwhelmed he tried to speak and only made a strangled sound in his throat are you catching a cold searching through her purse she found a tissue and offered it he cleared his throat loudly no but he took the tissue and vowed to keep it until the day he died i was just wondering if tonightвђafter classвђyou know if you dont have anything to doвђ youve probably got plans but if you dont then maybeвђ we could have a cup of coffee two cups he amended desperately i mean you could have your own cup and id have one so saying he turned a thin shade of green the poor boy was lonely natasha thought giving him an absent smile sure it wouldnt hurt to keep him company for an hour or so she decided as she walked into class and it would help her keep her mind offвђ off the man standing in front of the class natasha reflected with a scowl the man who had kissed the breath out of her two weeks before and who was currently laughing with a sassy little blonde who couldnt have been a day over twenty her mood grim she plopped down at her desk and poked her nose into a textbook spence knew the moment she walked into the room he was more than a little gratified to have seen the huffy jealousy on her face before she stuck a book in front of it apparently fate hadnt been dealing him such a bad hand when it kept him up to his ears in professional and personal problems for the last couple of weeks between leaky plumbing pta and brownie meetings and a faculty conference he hadnt had an hour free but now things were running smoothly again he studied the top of natashas head he intended to make up for lost time sitting on the edge of his desk he opened a discussion of the distinctions between sacred and secular music during the baroque period she didnt want to be interested natasha was sure he knew it why else would he deliberately call on her for an opinionвђtwice oh he was clever she thought not by a flicker not by the slightest intonation did he reveal a more personal relationship with her no one in class would possibly suspect that this smooth even brilliant lecturer had kissed her senseless not once not twice but three times now he calmly talked of early seventeenthcentury operatic developments in his black turtleneck and gray tweed jacket he looked casually elegant and totally in charge and of course as always he had the class in the palms of those beautiful hands he eloquently used to make a point when he smiled over a students comment natasha heard the little blonde two seats behind her sigh because shed nearly done so herself natasha stiffened her spine he probably had a whole string of eager women a man who looked like him talked like him kissed like him was bound to he was the type that made promises to one woman at midnight and snuggled up to another over breakfast in bed wasnt it fortunate she no longer believed in promises something was going on inside that fabulous head of hers spence mused one moment she was listening to him as if he had the answers to the mysteries of the universe on the tip of his tongue the next she was sitting rigidly and staring off into space as though she wished herself somewhere else he would swear that she was angry and that the anger was directed squarely at him why was an entirely different matter whenever hed tried to have a word with her after class over the last couple of weeks shed been out of the building like a bullet tonight he would have to outmaneuver her she stood the moment class was over spence watched her smile at the man sitting across from her then she bent down to pick up the books and pencils the man scattered as he rose what was his name spence wondered maynard that was it mr maynard was in several of his classes and managed to fade into the background in each one yet at the moment the unobtrusive mr maynard was crouched knee to knee with natasha i think weve got them all natasha gave terrys glasses a friendly shove back up his nose thanks dont forget your scarfвђ she began then looked up a hand closed over her arm and helped her to her feet thank you dr kimball id like to talk to you natasha would you she gave the hand on her arm a brief look then snatched up her coat and books feeling as though she were on a chessboard again she decided to aggressively counter his move im sorry itll have to wait i have a date a date he managed getting an immediate picture of someone dark dashing and musclebound yes excuse me she shook off his hand and stuck an arm into the sleeve of her coat since the men on either side of her seemed equally paralyzed she shifted the books to her other arm and struggled to find the second sleeve are you ready terry well yeah sure yeah he was staring at spence with a mixture of awe and trepidation but i can wait if you want to talk to dr kimball first theres no need she scooped up his arm and pulled him to the door women spence thought as he sat down at a desk hed already accepted the fact that he had never understood them apparently he never would jeez tash dont you think you should have seen what dr kimball wanted i know what he wanted she said between her teeth as she pushed open the main doors the rush of autumn air cooled her cheeks i wasnt in the mood to discuss it tonight when terry tripped over the uneven sidewalk she realized she was still dragging him and slowed her pace besides i thought we were going to have some coffee right when she smiled at him he tugged on his scarf as if to keep from strangling they walked into a small lounge where half the little square tables were empty at the antique bar two men were muttering over their beers a couple in the corner were all but sitting on each others laps and ignoring their drinks shed always liked this room with its dim lighting and old blackandwhite posters of james dean and marilyn monroe it smelled of cigarettes and jug wine there was a big portable stereo on a shelf above the bar that played an old chuck berry number loudly enough to make up for the lack of patrons natasha felt the bass vibrate through her chair as she sat down just coffee joe she called to the man behind the bar before she leaned her elbows on the table so she said to terry hows everything going okay he couldnt believe it he was here sitting with her on a date shed called it a date herself it would take a little prodding patient she shrugged out of her coat the overheated room had her pushing the sleeves of her sweater past her elbows it must be different for you here did you ever tell me where you were going to college before i graduated from michigan state because his lenses were fogged again natasha seemed to be shrouded by a thin mysterious mist when i ah heard that dr kimball would be teaching here i decided to take a couple years of graduate study you came here because of spenceвђdr kimball i didnt want to miss the opportunity i went to new york last year to hear him lecture terry lifted a hand and nearly knocked over a bowl of sugar hes incredible i suppose she murmured as their coffee was served where you been hiding the bartender asked giving her shoulder a casual squeeze i havent seen you in here all month business is good hows darla history joe gave her a quick friendly wink im all yours tash ill keep it in mind with a laugh she turned back to terry is something wrong she asked when she saw him dragging at his collar yes no that isвђ is he your boyfriend myвђ to keep herself from laughing in terrys face she took a sip of coffee you mean joe no she cleared her throat and sipped again no hes not were justвђ she searched for a word pals oh relief and insecurity warred i just thought since heвђ well he was only joking wanting to put terry at ease again she squeezed his hand what about you do you have a girl back in michigan no theres nobody nobody at all he turned his hand over gripping hers oh my god as realization hit natasha felt her mouth drop open only a fool would have missed it she thought as she stared into terrys adoring myopic eyes a fool she added who was so tied up with her own problems that she missed what was happening under her nose she was going to have to be careful natasha decided very careful terry she began youre very sweetвђ that was all it took to make his hand shake coffee spilled down his shirt moving quickly natasha shifted chairs so that she was beside him snatching paper napkins from the dispenser she began to blot the stain its a good thing they never serve it hot in this place if you soak this in cold water right away you should be all right overcome terry grabbed both of her hands her head was bent close and the scent of her hair was making him dizzy i love you he blurted and took aim with his mouth his glasses slid down his nose natasha felt his lips hit her cheekbone cold and trembly because her heart went out to him she decided that being careful wasnt the right approach firmness was called for quickly no you dont her voice was brisk she pulled back far enough to dab at the spill on the table i dont her response threw him off it was nothing like any of the fantasies hed woven there was the one where hed saved her from a runaway truck and another where hed played the song he was writing for her and she had collapsed in a passionate weeping puddle into his arms his imagination hadnt stretched far enough to see her wiping up coffee and calmly telling him he wasnt in love at all yes i do he snatched at her hand again thats ridiculous she said and smiled to take the sting out of the words you like me and i like you too no its more than that iвђ all right why do you love me because youre beautiful he managed losing his grip as he stared into her face again youre the most beautiful woman ive ever seen and thats enough disengaging her hand from his she linked her fingers to rest her chin on them what if i told you i was a thiefвђor that i liked to run down small furry animals with my car maybe ive been married three times and have murdered all my husbands in their sleep tashвђ she laughed but resisted the temptation to pet his cheek i mean you dont know me enough to love me if you did what i looked like wouldnt matter butвђbut i think about you all the time because youve told yourself it would be nice to be in love with me he looked so forlorn that she took a chance and laid one hand upon his im very flattered does this mean you wont go out with me im out with you now she pushed her cup of coffee in front of him as friends she said before the light could dawn again in his eyes im too old to be anything but your friend no youre not oh yes suddenly she felt a hundred yes i am you think im stupid he muttered in place of confused excitement came a crushing wave of humiliation he could feel his cheeks sting with it no i dont her voice softened and she reached once more for his hands terry listenвђ before she could stop him he pushed back his chair ive got to go cursing herself natasha picked up his striped scarf there was no use in following him now he needed time she decided and she needed air the leaves were beginning to turn and a few that had fallen early scraped along the sidewalk ahead of the wind it was the kind of evening natasha liked best but now she barely noticed it shed left her coffee untouched to take a long circular walk through town heading home she thought of a dozen ways she could have handled terrys infatuation better through her clumsiness she had wounded a sensitive vulnerable boy it could have been avoided all of it if she had been paying attention to what was happening in front of her face instead shed been blinded by her own unwelcome feelings for someone else she knew too well what it was to believe yourself in love desperately hopelessly in love and she knew how it hurt to discover that the one you loved didnt return those feelings cruel or kind the rejection of love left the heart bruised uttering a sigh she ran a hand over the scarf in her pocket had she ever been so trusting and defenseless yes she answered herself that and much much more it was about damn time spence thought as he watched her start up the walk obviously her mind was a million miles away on her date he decided and tried not to grind his teeth well he was going to see to it that she had a lot more to think about in very short order didnt he walk you home natasha stopped dead with an involuntary gasp in the beam of her porch light she saw spence sitting on her stoop that was all she needed she thought while she dragged a hand through her hair with terry shed felt as though shed kicked a puppy now she was going to have to face down a large hungry wolf what are you doing here freezing she nearly laughed his breath was puffing out in white steam with the wind chill she imagined that the effective temperature was hovering around twentyfive degrees fahrenheit after a moment natasha decided she must be a very poor sport to be amused at the thought of spence sitting on cold concrete for the past hour he rose as she continued down the walk how could she have forgotten how tall he was didnt you invite your friend back for a drink no she reached out and twisted the knob like most of the doors in town it was unlocked if i had youd be very embarrassed thats not the word for it im suppose im lucky i didnt find you waiting up for me inside you would have he muttered if it had occurred to me to try the door good night wait a damn minute he slapped his palm on the door before she could close it in his face i didnt sit out here in the cold for my health i want to talk to you there was something satisfying in the brief fruitless pushpush they played with the door its late and getting later by the second if you close the door im just going to beat on it until all your neighbors poke their heads out their windows five minutes she said graciously because she had planned to grant him that in any case ill give you a brandy then youll go youre all heart natasha no she laid her coat over the back of the couch im not she disappeared into the kitchen without another word when she returned with two snifters of brandy he was standing in the center of the room running terrys scarf through his fingers what kind of game are you playing she set down his brandy then sipped calmly at her own i dont know what you mean what are you doing going out on dates with some college kid whos still wet behind the ears both her back and her voice stiffened its none of your business whom i go out with it is now spence replied realizing it now mattered to him no its not and terrys a very nice young man youngs the operative word spence tossed the scarf aside hes certainly too young for you is that so it was one thing for her to say it and quite another to have spence throw it at her like an accusation i believe thats for me to decide hit a nerve that time spence muttered to himself there had been a timeвђhadnt thereвђwhen he had been considered fairly smooth with women maybe i should have said youre too old for him oh yes despite herself she began to see the humor of it thats a great deal better would you like to drink this brandy or wear it ill drink it thanks he lifted the glass but instead of bringing it to his lips took another turn around the room he was jealous spence realized it was rather pathetic but he was jealous of an awkward tonguetied grad student and while he was about it he was making a very big fool of himself listen maybe i should start over i dont know why you would want to start something over you should never have begun but like a dog with a bone he couldnt stop gnawing its just that hes obviously not your type fire blazed again oh and youd know about my type spence held up his free hand all right one straight question before my foot is permanently lodged in my mouth are you interested in him of course i am then she cursed herself it was impossible to use terry and his feelings as a barricade against spence hes a very nice boy spence almost relaxed then spotted the scarf again still spread over the back of her couch what are you doing with that i picked it up for him the sight of it bright and a little foolish on the jewel colors of her couch made her feel like the most vicious kind of femme fatale he left it behind after i broke his heart he thinks hes in love with me miserable she dropped into a chair oh go away i dont know why im talking to you the look on her face made him want to smile and stroke her hair he thought better of it and kept his tone brisk because youre upset and im the only one here i guess thatll do she didnt object when spence sat down across from her he was very sweet and nervous and i had no idea what he was feelingвђor what he thought he was feeling i should have realized but i didnt until he spilled his coffee all over his shirt andвђ dont laugh at him spence continued to smile as he shook his head im not believe me i know exactly how he must have felt there are some women who make you clumsy their eyes met and held dont flirt with me im past flirting with you natasha restless she rose to pace the room youre changing the subject am i she waved an impatient hand as she paced i hurt his feelings if i had known what was happening i might have stopped it there is nothing she said passionately nothing worse than loving someone and being turned away no he understood that and he could see by the shadows haunting her eyes that she did too but you dont really believe hes in love with you he believes it i ask him why he thinks it and do you know what he says she whirled back her hair swirling around her shoulders with the movement he says because he thinks im beautiful thats it she threw up her hands and started to pace again spence only watched caught up in her movements and by the musical cadence that agitation brought to her voice when he says it i want to slap him and sayвђwhats wrong with you a face is nothing but a face you dont know my mind or my heart but he has big sad eyes so i cant yell at him you never had a problem yelling at me you dont have big sad eyes and youre not a boy who thinks hes in love im not a boy he agreed catching her by the shoulders from behind even as she stiffened he turned her around and i like more than your face natasha though i like that very much you dont know anything about me either yes i do i know you lived through experiences i can hardly imagine i know you love and miss your family that you understand children and have a natural affection for them youre organized stubborn and passionate he ran his hands down her arms then back to her shoulders i know youve been in love before he tightened his grip before she could pull away and youre not ready to talk about it you have a sharp curious mind and caring heart and you wish you werent attracted to me but you are she lowered her lashes briefly to veil her eyes then it would seem you know more of me than i of you thats easy to fix i dont know if i want to or why i should his lips brushed hers then retreated before she could respond or reject theres something there he murmured thats reason enough maybe there is she began no she drew back when he would have kissed her again dont im not very strong tonight a good way to make me feel guilty if i press my advantage she felt twin rushes of disappointment and relief when he released her ill make you dinner she said on impulse now tomorrow just dinner she added wondering if she should already be regretting the invitation if you bring freddie shed like that so would i good seven oclock natasha picked up his coat and held it out now you have to go you should learn to say whats on your mind with a half laugh spence took the coat from her one more thing only one yeah he swung her back into his arms for one long hard mindnumbing kiss he had the satisfaction of seeing her sink weakly onto the arm of the sofa when he released her good night he said then stepping outside gulped in a deep breath of cold air it was the first time freddie had been asked out to a grownup dinner and she waited impatiently while her father shaved usually she enjoyed watching him slide the razor through the white foam on his face there were even times when she secretly wished she were a boy so that she could look forward to the ritual but tonight she thought her father was awfully slow can we go now standing in his bathrobe spence rinsed off the traces of lather it might be a better idea if i put some pants on freddie only rolled her eyes when are you going to spence scooped her up to bite gently at her neck as soon as you beat it taking him at his word she raced downstairs to prowl the foyer and count to sixty around the fifth round she sat on the bottom step to play with the buckle of her left shoe freddie had it all figured out her father was going to marry either tash or mrs patterson because they were both pretty and had nice smiles afterward the one he married would come and live in their new house soon she would have a new baby sister a baby brother would do in a pinch but it was definitely a second choice everybody would be happy because everybody would like each other a lot and her daddy would play his music late at night again when she heard spence start down freddie jumped up and whirled around to face him daddy i counted to sixty a jillion times i bet you left out the thirties again he took her coat from the hall closet and helped bundle her into it no i didnt at least she didnt think she had you took forever with a sigh she pulled him to the door were still going to be early she wont mind at that moment natasha was pulling a sweater over her head and wondering why she had invited anyone to dinner particularly a man every instinct told her to avoid shed been distracted all day worrying if the food would be right if shed chosen the most complimentary wine and now she was changing for the third time totally out of character she told herself as she frowned at her reflection in the mirror the casual blue sweater and leggings calmed her if she looked at ease natasha decided she would be at ease she fastened long silver columns at her ears gave her hair a quick toss then hurried back to the kitchen she had hardly checked her sauce when she heard the knock they were early she thought allowing herself one mild oath before going to the door they looked wonderful agitation vanished in a smile the sight of the little girl with her hand caught firmly in her fathers went straight to her heart because it came naturally she bent to kiss freddie on both cheeks hello thank you for asking me to dinner freddie recited the sentence then looked at her father for approval youre welcome arent you going to kiss daddy too natasha hesitated then caught spences quick challenging grin of course she brushed her lips formally against his cheeks that is a traditional ukrainian greeting im very grateful for glasnost still smiling he took her hand and brought it to his lips are we going to have borscht freddie wanted to know borscht natasha lifted a brow as she helped freddie out of her coat when i told mrs patterson that me and daddy were going to have dinner at your house she said that borscht was russian for beet soup freddie managed not to say she thought it sounded gross but natasha got the idea im sorry i didnt make any she said straight faced i made another traditional dish instead spaghetti and meatballs it was easy surprisingly so they ate at the old gateleg table by the window and their talk ranged from freddies struggles with arithmetic to neapolitan opera it took only a little prodding for natasha to talk of her family freddie wanted to know everything there was about being a big sister we didnt fight very much natasha reflected as she drank afterdinner coffee and balanced freddie on her knee but when we did i won because i was the oldest and the meanest youre not mean sometimes when im angry i am she looked at spence rememberingвђand regrettingвђtelling him he didnt deserve freddie then im sorry when people fight it doesnt always mean they dont like each other spence murmured he was doing his best not to think how perfect how perfectly right his daughter looked cuddled on natashas lap too far too fast he warned himself for everyone involved freddie wasnt sure she understood but she was only five then she remembered happily that she would soon be six im going to have a birthday are you natasha looked appropriately impressed when in two weeks will you come to my party id love to natasha looked at spence as freddie recited all the wonderful treats that were in store it wasnt wise to get so involved with the little girl she warned herself not when the little girl was attached so securely to a man who made natasha long for things she had put behind her spence smiled at her no it wasnt wise she thought again but it was irresistible chapter six contents prev next chicken pox spence said the two words again he stood in the doorway and watched his little girl sleep its a hell of a birthday present sweetie in two days his daughter would be six and by then according to the doctor shed be covered with the itchy rash that was now confined to her belly and chest it was going around the pediatrician had said it would run its course easy for him to say spence thought it wasnt his daughter whose eyes were teary it wasnt his baby with a hundredandonedegree temperature shed never been sick before spence realized as he rubbed his tired eyes oh the sniffles now and again but nothing a little tlc and baby aspirin hadnt put right he dragged a hand through his hair freddie moaned in her sleep and tried to find a cool spot on her pillow the call from nina hadnt helped hed had to come down hard to prevent her from catching the shuttle and arriving on his doorstep that hadnt stopped her telling him that freddie had undoubtedly caught chicken pox because she was attending public school that was nonsense of course but when he looked at his little girl tossing in her bed her face flushed with fever the guilt was almost unbearable logic told him that chicken pox was a normal part of childhood his heart told him that he should be able to find a way to make it go away for the first time he realized how much he wanted someone beside him not to take things over not to smooth over the downside of parenting just to be there to understand what it felt like when your child was sick or hurt or unhappy someone to talk to in the middle of the night when worries or pleasures kept you awake when he thought of that someone he thought only of natasha a big leap he reminded himself and walked back to the bedside one he wasnt sure he could make again and land on both feet he cooled freddies forehead with the damp cloth vera had brought in her eyes opened daddy yes funny face im right here her lower lip trembled im thirsty ill go get you a cold drink sick or not she knew how to maneuver can i have kool aid he pressed a kiss on her cheek sure what kind the blue kind the blue kind he kissed her again ill be right back he was halfway down the stairs when the phone rang simultaneously with a knock on the door damn it vera get the phone will you out of patience he yanked open the front door the smile natasha had practiced all evening faded im sorry ive come at a bad time yeah but he reached out to pull her inside hang on a minute veraвђoh good he added when he saw the housekeeper hovering freddie wants some kool aid the blue kind i will make it vera folded her hands in front of her apron mrs barklay is on the phone tell herвђ spence broke off swearing as veras mouth pruned she didnt like to tell nina anything all right ill get it i should go natasha put in feeling foolish i only came by because you werent at class tonight and i wondered if you were well its freddie spence glanced at the phone and wondered if he could strangle his sister over it she has the chicken pox oh poor thing she had to smother the automatic urge to go up and look in on the child herself not your child natasha reminded herself not your place ill get out of your way im sorry things are a little confused dont be i hope shes well soon let me know if i can do anything at that moment freddie called for her father in a voice that was half sniffle and half croak it was spences quick helpless glance up the stairs that had natasha ignoring what she thought was her better judgment would you like me to go up for a minute i could sit with her until you have things under control again no yes spence blew out a long breath if he didnt deal with nina now shed only call back id appreciate it reaching the end of his rope he yanked up the phone receiver nina natasha followed the glow of the nightlight into freddies room she found her sitting up in bed surrounded by dolls two big tears were sliding down her cheeks i want my daddy she said obviously miserable hell be right here her heart lost natasha sat down on the bed and drew freddie into her arms i dont feel good i know here blow your nose freddie complied then settled her head on natashas breast she sighed finding it pleasantly different from her fathers hard chest or veras cushy one i went to the doctor and got medicine so i cant go to my brownie meeting tomorrow therell be other meetings as soon as the medicine makes you well i have chicken pox freddie announced torn between discomfort and pride and im hot and itchy its a silly thing the chicken pox natasha said soothingly she tucked freddies tousled hair behind one ear i dont think chickens get it at all freddies lips turned up just a little jobeth had it last week and so did mikey now i cant have a birthday party youll have a party later when everyones well again thats what daddy said a fresh tear trailed down her cheek its not the same no but sometimes not the same is even better curious freddie watched the light glint off the gold hoop in natashas ear how it gives you more time to think about how much fun youll have would you like to rock im too big to rock im not wrapping freddie in a blanket natasha carried her to the white wicker rocker she cleared it of stuffed animals then tucked one particularly worn rabbit in freddies arms when i was a little girl and i was sick my mother would always rock me in this big squeaky chair we had by the window she would sing me songs no matter how bad i felt when she rocked me i felt better my mother didnt rock me freddies head was aching and she wanted badly to pop a comforting thumb into her mouth she knew she was too old for that she didnt like me thats not true natasha instinctively tightened her arms around the child im sure she loved you very much she wanted my daddy to send me away at a loss natasha lowered her cheek to the top of freddies head what could she say now freddies words had been too matteroffact to dismiss as a fantasy people sometimes say things they dont mean and that they regret very much did your daddy send you away no there you see do you like me of course i do she rocked gently to and fro i like you very much the movement the soft female scent and voice lulled freddie why dont you have a little girl the pain was there deep and dull natasha closed her eyes against it perhaps one day i will freddie tangled her fingers in natashas hair comforted will you sing like your mother did yes and you try to sleep dont go no ill stay awhile spence watched them from the doorway in the shadowed light they looked achingly beautiful the tiny flaxenhaired child in the arms of the dark goldenskinned woman the rocker whispered as it moved back and forth while natasha sang some old ukrainian folk song from her own childhood it move him as completely as uniquely as holding the woman in his own arms had moved him and yet so differently so quietly that he wanted to stand just as he was watching through the night natasha looked up and saw him he looked so frazzled that she had to smile shes sleeping now if his legs were weak he hoped it was because hed climbed up and down the stairs countless times in the last twentyfour hours giving in to them he sat down on the edge of the bed he studied his daughters flushed face nestled peacefully in the crook of natashas arm its supposed to get worse before it gets better yes it does she stroked a hand down freddies hair we all had it when we were children amazingly we all survived he blew out a long breath i guess im being an idiot no youre very sweet she watched him as she continued to rock wondering how difficult it had been for him to raise a baby without a mothers love difficult enough she decided that he deserved credit for seeing that his daughter was happy secure and unafraid to love she smiled again whenever one of us was sick as children and still today my father would badger the doctor then he would go to church to light candles after that he would say this old gypsy chant hed learned from his grandmother its covering all the bases so far ive badgered the doctor spence managed a smile of his own you wouldnt happen to remember that chant ill say it for you carefully she rose lifting freddie in her arms should i lay her down thanks together they tucked in the blankets i mean it youre welcome she looked over the sleeping child and though her smile was easy she was beginning to feel awkward i should go parents of sick children need their rest at least i can offer you a drink he held up the glass how about some kool aid its the blue kind i think ill pass she moved around the bed toward the door when the fever breaks shell be bored then youll really have your work cut out for you how about some pointers he took natashas hand as they started down the steps crayons new ones the best is usually the simplest how is it someone like you doesnt have a horde of children of her own he didnt have to feel her stiffen to know hed said the wrong thing he could see the sorrow come and go in her eyes im sorry no need recovered she picked up her coat from where shed laid it on the newel post id like to come and see freddie again if its all right he took her coat and set it down again if you wont take the blue stuff how about some tea i could use the company all right ill justвђ he turned and nearly collided with vera i will fix the tea she said after a last look at natasha your housekeeper thinks i have designs on you i hope you wont disappoint her spence said as he led natasha into the music room im afraid i must disappoint both of you then she laughed and wandered to the piano but you should be very busy all the young women in college talk about dr kimball she tucked her tongue into her cheek youre a hunk spence popular opinion is equally divided between you and the captain of the football team very funny im not joking but its fun to embarrass you she sat and ran her fingers over the keys do you compose here i did once its wrong of you not to write she played a series of chords arts more than a privilege its a responsibility she searched for the melody then with a sound of impatience shook her head i cant play i was too old when i tried to learn he liked the way she looked sitting there her hair falling over her shoulders half curtaining her face her fingers resting lightly on the keys of the piano he had played since childhood if you want to learn ill teach you id rather you write a song it was more than impulse she thought tonight he looked as though he needed a friend she smiled and held out a hand here with me he glanced up as vera carried in a tray just set it there vera thank you you will want something else he looked back at natasha yes he would want something else he wanted it very much no good night he listened to the housekeepers shuffling steps why are you doing this because you need to laugh come write a song for me it doesnt have to be good he did laugh you want me to write a bad song for you it can be a terrible song when you play it for freddie shell hold her ears and giggle a bad songs about all i can do these days but he was amused enough to sit down beside her if i do this i have to have your solemn oath that it wont be repeated for any of my students cross my heart he began to noodle with the keys natasha breaking in now and then to add her inspiration it wasnt as bad as it might have been spence considered as he ran through some chords no one would call it brilliant but it had a certain primitive charm let me try tossing back her hair natasha struggled to repeat the notes here as he sometimes did with his daughter he put his hands over natashas to guide them the feeling he realized was entirely different relax his murmur whispered beside her ear she only wished she could i hate to do poorly at anything she managed with his palms firmly over her hands she struggled to concentrate on the music youre doing fine her hair soft and fragrant brushed his cheek as they bent over the keys it didnt occur to him that he hadnt played with the piano in years oh he had playedвђbeethoven gershwin mozart and bernstein but hardly for funвђ it had been much too long since he had sat before the keys for entertainment no no an a minor maybe natasha stubbornly hit a b major again i like this better it throws it off thats the point he grinned at her want to collaborate you do better without me i dont think so his grin faded he cupped her face in one hand i really dont think so this wasnt what she had intended she had wanted to lighten his mood to be his friend she hadnt wanted to stir these feelings in both of them feelings they would be wiser to ignore but they were there pulsing no matter how strong her will she couldnt deny them even the light touch of his fingers on her face made her ache made her yearn made her remember the teas getting cold but she didnt pull away didnt try to stand when he leaned over to touch his mouth to hers she only shut her eyes this cant go anywhere she murmured it already has his hand moved up her back strong possessive in contrast with the light play of his lips i think about you all the time about being with you touching you ive never wanted anyone the way i want you slowly he ran a hand down her throat over her shoulder along her arm until their fingers linked over the piano keys its like a thirst natasha a constant thirst and when im with you like this i know its the same for you she wanted to deny it but his mouth was roaming hungrily over her face taunting hers to tremble with need and she did need to be held like this wanted like this it had been easy in the past to pretend that being desired wasnt necessary no she hadnt had to pretend until now until him it had been true now suddenly like a door opening like a light being switched on everything had changed she yearned for him and her blood swam faster just knowing he wanted her even for a moment she told herself as her hands clutched at his hair to pull his mouth to hers even for this moment it was there again that whirlwind of sensation that erupted the instant they came together too fast too hot too real to be borne too stunning to be resisted it was as though he were the first though he was not it was as though he were the only one though that could never be as she poured herself into the kiss she wished desperately that her life could begin again in that moment with him there was more than passion here the emotions that swirled inside her nearly swallowed him there was desperation fear and a bottomless generosity that left him dazed nothing would ever be simple again knowing it a part of him tried to pull back to think to reason but the taste of her hot potent only drew him closer to the flame wait for the first time she admitted her own weakness and let her head rest against his shoulder this is too fast no he combed his fingers through her hair its taken years already spence struggling for balance she straightened i dont know what to do she said slowly watching him its important for me to know what to do i think we can figure it out but when he reached for her again she rose quickly and stepped away this isnt simple for me unnerved she pushed back her hair with both hands i know it might seem so because of the way i respond to you i know that its easier for men less personal somehow he rose very carefully very deliberately why dont you explain that i only mean that i know that men find things like this less difficult to justify justify he repeated rocking back on his heels how could he be angry so quickly after being so bewitched you make this sound like some kind of crime i dont always find the right words she snapped im not a college professor i didnt speak english until i was eight couldnt read it for longer than that he checked his temper as he studied her her eyes were dark with something more than anger she was standing stiffly head up but he couldnt tell if her stand was one of pride or selfdefense what does that have to do with anything nothing and everything frustrated she whirled back into the hallway to snatch up her coat i hate feeling stupidвђhate being stupid i dont belong here i shouldnt have come but you did he grabbed her by her shoulders so that her coat flew out to fall onto the bottom step why did you i dont know it doesnt matter why he gave her an impatient squeeze why do i feel as if im having two conversations at the same time whats going on in that head of yours natasha i want you she said passionately and i dont want to you want me before she could jerk away he pulled her against himself there was no patience in this kiss no persuasion it took and took until she was certain she could have nothing left to give why does that bother you he murmured against her lips unable to resist she ran her hands over his face memorizing the shape there are reasons tell me about them she shook her head and this time when she pulled back he released her i dont want my life to change if something happened between us yours would not but mine might i want to be sure it doesnt does this lead back to that business about men and women thinking differently yes that made him wonder who had broken her heart and he didnt smile you look more intelligent than that what i feel for you has already changed my life that frightened her because it made her want to believe it feelings come and go yes they do some of them what if i told you i was falling in love with you i wouldnt believe you her voice shook and she bent to pick up her coat and i would be angry with you for saying it maybe it was best to wait until he could make her believe and if i told you that until i met you i didnt know i was lonely she lowered her eyes much more moved by this than she would have been by any words of love i would have to think he touched her again just a hand to her hair do you think everything through her eyes were eloquent when she looked at him yes then think about this it wasnt my intention to seduce youвђnot that i havent given that a great deal of thought on my own but i didnt see it happening with my daughter sick upstairs you didnt seduce me now shes taking potshots at my ego that made her smile there was no seduction that implies planned persuasion i dont want to be seduced ill keep that in mind all the same i dont think i want to dissect all this like a music major with a beethoven concerto it ruins the romance in much the same way she smiled again i dont want romance thats a pity and a lie he thought remembering the way shed looked when hed given her a rose since chicken pox is going to be keeping me busy for the next week or two youll have some time will you come back to see freddie she shrugged into her coat then relented and to see you she did what began as just a quick call to bring freddie a getwell present turned into the better part of an evening soothing a miserable rashridden child and an exhausted frantic father surprisingly she enjoyed it and made a habit over the next ten days of dropping in over her lunch break to spell a stillsuspicious vera or after work to give spence a muchneeded hour of peace and quiet as far as romance went bathing an itchy girl in corn starch left a lot to be desired despite it natasha found herself only more attracted to spence and more in love with his daughter she watched him do his best to cheer the miserably uncomfortable patient on her birthday then helped him deal with the pair of kittens that were freddies favored birthday gift as the rash faded and boredom set in natasha pumped up spences rapidly fading imagination with stories of her own just one more story natasha smoothed freddies covers under her chin thats what you said three stories ago you tell good ones flattery will get you nowhere its past my bedtime natasha lifted a brow at the big red alarm clock and yours the doctor said i could go back to school on monday im not fectious infectious natasha corrected youll be glad to see your friends again mostly stalling freddie played with the edge of her blanket will you come and see me when im not sick i think i might she leaned over to make a grab and came up with a mewing kitten and to see lucy and desi and daddy cautious natasha scratched the kittens ears yes i suppose you like him dont you yes hes a very good teacher he likes you too freddie didnt add that she had seen her father kiss natasha at the foot of her bed just the night before when theyd thought she was asleep watching them had given her a funny feeling in her stomach but after a minute it had been a good funny feeling will you marry him and come and live with us well is that a proposal natasha managed to smile i think its nice that youd want me to but im only friends with your daddy like im friends with you if you came to live with us wed still be friends the child natasha reflected was as clever as her father wont we be friends if i live in my own house i guess the pouty lower lip poked out but id like it better if you lived here like jobeths mom does she makes cookies natasha leaned toward her nose to nose so you want me for my cookies i love you freddie threw her arms around natashas neck and clung id be a good girl if you came stunned natasha hugged the girl tight and rocked oh baby i love you too so youll marry us put like that natasha wasnt sure whether to laugh or cry i dont think getting married right now is the answer for any of us but ill still be your friend and come visit and tell you stories freddie gave a long sigh she knew when an adult was evading and realized that it would be smart to retreat a step particularly when she had already made up her mind natasha was exactly what she wanted for a mother and there was the added bonus that natasha made her daddy laugh freddie decided then and there that her most secret and solemn christmas wish would be for natasha to marry her father and bring home a baby sister promise freddie demanded cross my heart natasha gave her a kiss on each cheek now you go to sleep ill find your daddy so he can come up and kiss you goodnight freddie closed her eyes her lips curved with her own secret smile carrying the kitten natasha made her way downstairs shed put off her monthly books and an inventory to visit tonight more than a little midnight oil would be burned she decided rubbing the kitten against her cheek she would have to be careful with freddie now and with herself it was one thing for her to have fallen in love with the youngster but quite another for the girl to love her enough to want her for a mother how could she expect a child of six to understand that adults often had problems and fears that made it impossible for them to take the simple route the house was quiet but a light was shining from the music room she set down the kitten knowing he would unerringly race to the kitchen she found spence in the music room spread on the twocushion sofa so that his legs hung over one end in sloppy sweats and bare feet he looked very little like the brilliant composer and full professor of music nor had he shaved natasha was forced to admit that the shadow of stubble only made him more attractive especially when combined with tousled hair a week or two late for the barber he was sleeping deeply a throw pillow crunched under his head natasha knew because vera had unbent long enough to tell her that spence had stayed up throughout two nights during the worst of his daughters fever and discomfort she was aware too that he had juggled his schedule at the college with trips home during the day more than once during her visits shed found him up to his ears in paperwork once she had thought him pampered a man whod come by his talents and his position almost by birth perhaps he had been born with his talent she thought now but he worked hard for himself and for his child there was nothing she could admire more in a man im falling in love with him she admitted with his smile and his temper his devotion and his drive perhaps just perhaps they could give something to each other cautiously carefully with no promises between them she wanted to be his lover she had never wanted such a thing before with anthony it had just happened overwhelming her sweeping her up and away then leaving her shattered it wouldnt be that way with spence nothing would ever hurt her that deeply again and with him there was a chance just a chance of happiness shouldnt she take it moving quietly she unfolded the throw of soft blue wool that was draped along the back of the couch to spread it over him it had been a long time since shed taken a risk perhaps the time was here she bent to brush her lips over his brow and the man chapter seven contents prev next the black cat screeched a warning a rushing gust of wind blew open the door with an echoing slam and maniacal laughter rolled in what sounded like ooze dripped down the walls plunking dully onto the bare concrete floor as the prisoners rattled their chains there was a piercing scream followed by a long desperate moan great tunes annie commented and popped a gum ball into her mouth i should have ordered more of those records natasha took an orange fright wig and turned a harmless stuffed bear into a halloween ghoul thats the last one after tonight youll have to start thinking christmas anyway annie pushed back her pointed black hat then grinned showing blackened teeth here come the freedmont boys she rubbed her hands together and tried out a cackle if this costumes worth anything i should be able to turn them into frogs she didnt quite manage that but sold them fake blood and latex scars i wonder what those little dears have in store for the neighborhood tonight natasha mused nothing good annie ducked under a hanging bat shouldnt you get going yes in a minute stalling natasha fiddled with her dwindling supply of masks and fake noses the pig snouts sold better than id imagined i didnt realize so many people would want to dress up as livestock she picked one up to hold it over her nose maybe we should keep them out year round recognizing her friends tactics annie ran her tongue over her teeth to keep from grinning it was awfully nice of you to volunteer to help decorate for freddies party tonight its a little thing natasha said and hated herself for being nervous she replaced the snout then ran her finger over a wrinkled elephant trunk attached to oversize glasses since i suggested the idea of her having a halloween party to make up for her missed birthday i thought i should help uhhuh i wonder if her daddys going to come as prince charming he is not prince charming the big bad wolf on a laugh annie held up her hands in a gesture of peace sorry its just such a kick to see you unnerved im not unnerved that was a big lie natasha admitted while she packed up some of her contributions to the party you know youre welcome to come and i appreciate it id rather stay home and guard my house from preadolescent felons and dont worry she added before natasha could speak again ill lock up all right maybe ill justвђ natasha broke off as the door jingled open another customer she thought would give her a little more time when she spotted terry there was no way of saying who was more surprised hello he swallowed over the huge lump in his throat and tried to look beyond her costume tash yes hoping hed forgiven her by now she smiled and held out a hand hed changed his seat in class and every time she had tried to approach him hed darted off now he stood trapped embarrassed and uncertain he touched her outstretched hand then stuck his own into his pocket i didnt expect to see you here no she tilted her head this is my shop she wondered if it would strike him that she had been right when shed said how little he knew her and her voice softened i own it you own it he looked around unable to hide the impression it made on him wow thats something thank you did you come to buy something or just to look instantly he colored it was one thing to go into a store and another to go into one where the owner was a woman hed professed to love i justвђahвђ something for halloween she prompted they have parties at the college yeah well i kind of thought i might slip into a couple i guess its silly really butвђ halloween is very serious business here at the fun house natasha told him solemnly as she spoke another scream ripped from the speakers you see embarrassed that hed jumped terry managed a weak smile yeah well i was thinking maybe a mask or something you know his big bony hands waved in space then retreated to his pockets would you like to be scary or funny i dont ah i havent thought about it understanding natasha resisted the urge to pat his cheek you might get some ideas when you look at what we have left annie this is my friend terry maynard hes a violinist hi annie watched his glasses slide down his nose after his nervous nod of greeting and thought him adorable were running low but weve still got some pretty good stuff why dont you come over and take a look ill help you pick one out i have to run natasha began gathering up her two shopping bags hoping that the visit had put them back on more solid ground have a good time at your party terry thanks annie ill see you in the morning right dont bob for too many apples pushing her pointed hat out of her eyes again annie grinned at terry so youre a violinist yeah he gave natashas retreating back one last look when the door closed behind her he felt a pang but only a small one im taking some graduate classes at the college great hey can you play turkey in the straw outside natasha debated running home to get her car the cool clear air changed her mind the trees had turned the patchwork glory of a week before with its scarlets and vivid oranges and yellows had blended into a dull russet dry curling leaves spun from the branches to crowd against the curbs and scatter on the sidewalks they crackled under her feet as she began the short walk the hardiest flowers remained adding a spicy scent so different from the heavy fragrances of summer cooler cleaner crisper natasha thought as she drew it in she turned off the main street to where hedges and big trees shielded the houses jackolanterns sat on stoops and porches grinning as they waited to be lighted at dusk here and there effigies in flannel shirts and torn jeans hung from denuded branches witches and ghosts stuffed with straw sat on steps waiting to scare and delight the wandering trickortreaters if anyone had asked her why she had chosen a small town in which to settle this would have been one of her answers people here took the timeвђthe time to carve a pumpkin the time to take a bundle of old clothes and fashion it into a headless horseman tonight before the moon rose children could race along the streets dressed as fairies or goblins their goody bags would swell with storebought candy and homemade cookies while adults pretended not to recognize the miniature hoboes clowns and demons the only thing the children would have to fear was makebelieve her child would have been seven natasha paused for a moment pressing a hand to her stomach until the grief and the memory could be blocked how many times had she told herself the past was past and how many times would that past sneak up and slice at her true it came less often now but still so sharply and always unexpectedly days could go by even months then it surfaced crashing over her leaving her a little dazed a little tender like a woman who had walked into a wall a car engine was gunned a horn blasted hey tash she blinked and managed to lift a hand in passing salute though she couldnt identify the driver who continued on his way this was now she told herself blinking to focus again on the swirl of leaves this was here there was never any going back years before she had convinced herself that the only direction was forward deliberately she took a long deep breath relieved when she felt her system level tonight wasnt the time for sorrows she had promised another child a party and she intended to deliver she had to smile when she started up the steps of spences home he had already been working she noted two enormous jackolanterns flanked the porch like comedy and tragedy one grinned and the other scowled across the railing a white sheet had been shaped and spread so that the ghost it became seemed to be in full flight cardboard bats with red eyes swooped down from the eaves in an old rocker beside the door sat a hideous monster who held his laughing head in his hand on the door was a fullsize cutout of a witch stirring a steaming cauldron natasha knocked under the hags warty nose she was laughing when spence opened the door trick or treat she said he couldnt speak at all for a moment he thought he was imagining things had to be the musicbox gypsy was standing before him gold dripping from her ears and her wrists her wild mane of hair was banded by a sapphire scarf that flowed almost to her waist with the corkscrew curls more gold hung around her neck thick ornate chains that only accented her slenderness the red dress was snug scooped at the bodice and full in the skirt with richly colored scarfs tied at the waist her eyes were huge and dark made mysterious by some womanly art her lips were full and red turned up now as she spun in a saucy circle it took him only seconds to see it all down to the hints of black lace at the hem he felt as though hed been standing in the doorway for hours i have a crystal ball she told him reaching into her pocket to pull out a small clear orb if you cross my palm with silver ill gaze into it for you my god he managed youre beautiful she only laughed and stepped inside illusions tonight is meant for them with a quick glance around she slipped the crystal back into her pocket but the image of the gypsy and the mystery remained wheres freddie his hand had gone damp on the knob shesвђ it took a moment for his brain to kick back into gear shes at jobeths i wanted to put things together when she wasnt around a good idea she studied his gray sweats and dusty sneakers is this your costume no ive been hanging cobwebs ill give you a hand smiling she held up her bags i have some tricks and i have some treats which would you like first you have to ask he said quietly then hooking an arm around her waist brought her up hard against himself she threw her head back words of anger and defiance in her eyes and on the tip of her tongue then his mouth found hers the bags slipped out of her hands freed her fingers dived into his hair this wasnt what she wanted but it was what she needed without hesitation her lips parted inviting intimacy she heard his quiet moan of pleasure merge with her own it seemed right somehow it seemed perfectly right to be holding him like this just inside his front door with the scents of fall flowers and fresh polish in the air and the sharpedged breeze of autumn rushing over them it was right he could taste and feel the lightness with her body pressed against his own her lips warm and agile no illusion this no fantasy was she despite the colorful scarfs and glittering gold she was real she was here and she was his before the night was over he would prove it to both of them i hear violins he murmured as he trailed his lips down her throat spence she could only hear her heartbeat like thunder in her head struggling for sanity she pushed away you make me do things i tell myself i wont after a deep breath she gave him a steady look i came to help you with freddies party and i appreciate it quietly he closed the door just like i appreciate the way you look the way you taste the way you feel she shouldnt have been so aroused by only a look couldnt be not when the look told her that whatever the crystal in her pocket promised he already knew their destiny this is a very inappropriate time he loved the way her voice could take on that regal tone czarina to peasant then well find a better one exasperated she hefted the bags again ill help you hang your cobwebs if you promise to be freddies fatherвђand only freddies father while we do okay he didnt see any other way hed survive an evening with twenty costumed firstgraders and the party he thought wouldnt last forever well be pals for the duration she liked the sound of it choosing a bag she reached inside she held up a rubber mask of a bruised bloodied and scarred face competently she slipped it over spences head there you look wonderful he adjusted it until he could see her through both eyeholes and had a foolish and irresistible urge to look at himself in the hall mirror behind the mask he grinned ill suffocate not for a couple of hours yet she handed him the second bag come on it takes time to build a haunted house it took them two hours to transform spences elegantly decorated living room into a spooky dungeon fit for rats and screams of torture black and orange crepe paper hung on the walls and ceiling angelhair cobwebs draped the corners a mummy arms folded across its chest leaned in a corner a blackcaped witch hung in the air suspended on her broom thirsty and waiting for dusk an evileyed dracula lurked in the shadows ready to pounce you dont think its too scary spence asked as he hung up a pinthenoseonthepumpkin game theyre firstgraders natasha flicked a finger over a rubber spider that hung by a thread and sent him spinning very mild my brothers made a haunted house once they blindfolded rachel and me to take us through mikhail put my hand in a bowl of grapes and told me it was eyes now thats disgusting spence decided yes it delighted her to remember it then there was this spaghettiвђ never mind he interrupted i get the idea she laughed adjusting her earring in any case i had a wonderful time and have always wished id thought of it first the children tonight would be very disappointed if we didnt have some monsters waiting for them after theyve been spooked which they desperately want to be you turn on the lights so they see its all pretend too bad were out of grapes its all right when freddies older ill show you how to make a bloodied severed hand out of a rubber glove i cant wait what about food veras been a trojan with his mask on top of his head spence stood back to study the whole room it felt good really good to look at the results and to know that he and natasha had produced them together shes made everything from deviled eggs to witchs brew punch you know what would have been great a fog machine thats the spirit his grin made her laugh and long to kiss him next year he liked the sound of that he realized next year and the year after a little dazed at the speed with which his thoughts were racing he only studied her is something wrong no he smiled everythings just fine i have the prizes here wanting to rest her legs natasha sat on the arm of a chair beside a lounging ghoul for the games and costumes you didnt have to do that i told you i wanted to this is my favorite she pulled out a skull then flicking a switch set it on the floor where it skimmed along disembodied its empty eyes blinking your favorite tongue in cheek spence picked it up where it vibrated in his hand yes very gruesome she tilted her head say alas poor yorick he only laughed and switched it off then he pulled down his mask o that this too too solid flesh would melt she was chuckling when he came over and lifted her to her feet give us a kiss no she decided after a moment youre ugly okay obligingly he pushed the mask up again how about it much worse solemnly she slid the mask down again very funny no but it seemed necessary linking her arm with his she studied the room i think youll have a hit well have a hit he corrected you know freddies crazy about you yes natasha gave him an easy smile its mutual they heard the front door slam and a shout speaking of freddie children arrived first in trickles then in a flood when the clock struck six the room was full of ballerinas and pirates monsters and superheroes the haunted house brought gasps and shrieks and shudders no one was brave enough to make the tour alone though many made it twice then a third time occasionally a stalwart soul was courageous enough to poke a finger into the mummy or touch the vampires cape when the lights were switched on there were moans of disappointment and a few relieved sighs freddie a lifesize raggedy ann tore open her belated birthday presents with abandon youre a very good father natasha murmured thanks he linked his fingers with hers no longer questioning why it should be so right for them to stand together and watch over his daughters party why because you havent once retreated for aspirin and you hardly winced when mikey spilled punch on your rug thats because i have to save my strength for when vera sees it spence dodged in time to avoid collision with a fairy princess being chased by a goblin there were squeals from every corner of the room punctuated by the crashing and moaning of the novelty record on the stereo as for the aspirinвђ how long can they keep this up oh a lot longer than we can youre such a comfort well have them play games now youll be surprised how quickly two hours can pass she was right by the time the numbered noses had all been stuck in the vicinity of the pumpkin head when musical chairs was only a fond memory after the costume parade and judging when the last apple bobbed alone and the final clothespin had clunked into a mason jar parents began to trail in to gather up their reluctant frankensteins and ghoulies but the fun wasnt over in groups and clutches trickortreaters canvassed the neighborhood for candy bars and caramel apples the windrushed night and crackling leaves were things they would remember long after the last chocolate drop had been consumed it was nearly ten before spence managed to tuck an exhausted and thrilled freddie into bed it was the best birthday i ever had she told him im glad i got the chicken pox spence rubbed a finger over a smeared orange freckle the cold cream had missed i dont know if id go that far but im glad you had fun can i haveвђ no he kissed her nose if you eat one more piece of candy youll blow up she giggled and because she was too tired to try any strategy snuggled into her pillow memories were already swirling in her head next year i want to be a gypsy like tash okay sure go to sleep now im going to take natasha home but veras here are you going to marry tash soon so she can stay with us spence opened his mouth then closed it again as freddie yawned hugely where do you get these ideas he muttered how long does it take to get a baby sister she asked as she drifted off spence rubbed a hand over his face grateful that she had fallen asleep and saved him from answering downstairs he found natasha cleaning up the worst of the mess she flicked back her hair as he came in when it looks as bad as this you know youve had a successful party something in his expression had her narrowing her eyes is something wrong no no its freddie she has a tummy ache natasha said instantly sympathetic not yet he shrugged it off with a half laugh she always manages to surprise me dont he said and took the trash bag from her youve done enough i dont mind i know before he could take her hand she linked her own i should be going tomorrows saturdayвђour busiest day he wondered what it would be like if they could simply walk upstairs together into his bedroom into his bed ill take you home thats all right you dont have to id like to the tension was back their eyes met and he understood that she felt it as well are you tired no it was time for some truths she knew he had done what shed asked and been only freddies father during the party now the party was over but not the night would you like to walk the corners of her lips turned up then she put her hand into his yes i would it was colder now with a bite in the air warning of winter above the moon was full and chillingly white clouds danced over it sending shadows shifting over the rustle of leaves they heard the echoing shouts and laughter of lingering trickor treaters inevitably the big oak on the corner had been wrapped in bathroom tissue by teenagers i love this time natasha murmured especially at night when theres a little wind you can smell smoke from the chimneys on the main street older children and college students still stalked in fright masks and painted faces a poor imitation of a wolf howl bounced along the storefronts followed by a feminine squeal and laughter a car full of ghouls paused long enough for them to lean out the windows and screech spence watched the car turn a corner its passengers still howling i cant remember being anywhere that halloween was taken so seriously wait until you see what happens at christmas natashas own pumpkin was glowing on her stoop beside a bowl halffilled with candy bars there was a sign on her door take only one or else spence shook his head at it that really does it natasha merely glanced at the sign they know me leaning over spence plucked one can i have a brandy to go with it she hesitated if she let him come in it was inevitable that they would pick up where the earlier kiss had left off it had been two months she thought two months of wondering of stalling of pretending they both knew it had to stop sooner or later of course she opened the door and let him in wound tight she went into the kitchen to pour drinks it was yes or it was no she told herself she had known the answer long before this night even prepared for it but what would it be like with him what would she be like and how when she had shared herself with him in that most private way would she be able to pretend she didnt need more couldnt need more natasha reminded herself whatever her feelings for him and they were deeper much deeper than she dared admit life had to continue as it was no promises no vows no broken hearts he turned when she came back into the room but didnt speak his own thoughts were mixed and confused what did he want her certainly but how much how little could he accept hed been sure hed never feel this way again more than sure that he would never want to yet it seemed so easy to feel every time he looked at her thanks he took the brandy watching her as he sipped you know the first time i lectured i stood at the podium and my mind went completely blank for one terrible moment i couldnt think of anything id planned to say im having exactly the same problem now you dont have to say anything its not as easy as i thought it would be he took her hand surprised to find it cold and unsteady instinctively he lifted it to press his lips to the palm it helped knowing she was as nervous as he i dont want to frighten you this frightens me she could feel sensation spear her sometimes people say i think too much maybe its true if it is its because i feel too much there was a timeвђ she took her hand from his wanting to be strong on her own there was a time she repeated when i let what i felt decide for me there are some mistakes that you pay for until you die this isnt a mistake he set down the brandy to take her face between his hands her fingers curled around his wrists i dont want it to be there cant be any promises spence because id rather not have them than have them broken i dont need or want pretty words theyre too easily said her grip tightened i want to be your lover but i need respect not poetry are you finished i need for you to understand she insisted im beginning to you must have loved him a great deal she dropped her hands but steadied herself before she answered yes it hurt surprising him he could hardly be threatened by someone from her past he had a past as well but he was threatened and he was hurt i dont care who he was and i dont give a damn what happened that was a lie he realized and one hed have to deal with sooner or later but i dont want you thinking of him when youre with me dont not the way you mean not in any way she raised a brow you cant control my thoughts or anything else about me youre wrong fueled by impotent jealousy he pulled her into his arms the kiss was angry demanding possessive and tempting tempting her so close to submission that she struggled away i wont be taken her voice was only more defiant because she was afraid she was wrong your rules natasha yes if theyre fair to whom both of us she pressed her fingers against her temples for a moment we shouldnt be angry she said more quietly im sorry she offered a shrug and a quick smile im afraid its been a long time since ive been with anyoneвђsince ive wanted to be he picked up his brandy staring into it as it swirled you make it hard for me to stay mad id like to think we were friends ive never been friends with a lover and hed never been in love with a friend it was a huge and frightening admission and one he was certain he couldnt make out loud perhaps if he stopped being clumsy he could show her we are friends he held out a hand then curled his fingers around hers friends trust each other natasha yes he looked at their joined hands why dont weвђ a noise at the window had him breaking off and glancing over before he could move natasha tightened her hold it took only a moment to see that she wasnt frightened but amused she brought a finger from her free hand to her lips i think its a good idea to be friends with my professor she said lifting her voice and making a goahead gesture to spence i ah im glad freddie and i have found so many nice people since weve moved puzzled he watched natasha root through a drawer its a nice town of course sometimes there are problems you havent heard about the woman who escaped from the asylum what asylum at her impatient glance he covered himself no i guess not the police are keeping very quiet about it they know shes in the area and dont want people to panic natasha flicked on the flashlight shed uncovered and nodded in approval as the batteries proved strong shes quite insane you know and likes to kidnap small children especially young boys then she tortures them hideously on a night with a full moon she creeps up on them so silently so evilly then before they can scream she grabs them around the throat so saying she whipped up the shade on the window with the flashlight held under her chin she pressed her face against the glass and grinned twin screams echoed there was a crash a shout then the scramble of feet weak from laughter natasha leaned against the windowsill the freedmont boys she explained when shed caught her breath last year they hung a dead rat outside annies door she pressed a hand to her heart as spence came over to peer out the window all he could see was two shadows racing across the lawn i think the tables are wellturned oh you should have seen their faces she dabbed a tear from her lashes i dont think their hearts will start beating again until they pull the covers over their heads this should be a halloween they dont forget every child should have one good scare they remember always still smiling she stuck the light under her chin again what do you think its too late to scare me away he took the flashlight and set it aside closing his hand over hers he drew her to her feet its time to find out how much is illusion how much is reality slowly he pulled the shade down chapter eight contents prev next it was very real painfully real the feel of his mouth against hers left no doubt that she was alive and needy the time the place meant nothing those could have been illusions but he was not desire was not she felt it spring crazily inside her at only a meeting of lips no it wasnt simple she had known since she had first tasted him since she had first allowed herself to touch him that whatever happened between them would never be simple yet that was what she had been so certain shed wanted simplicity a smooth road an easy path not with him and not ever again accepting she twined her arms around him tonight there would be no past no future only one moment taken in both hands gripped hard and enjoyed answer for answer need for need they clung together the low light near the door cast their silhouettes onto the wall one shadow it shifted when they did then stilled when he swept her into his arms she murmured a protest she had said she wouldnt be taken and had meant it yet cradled there she didnt feel weak she felt loved in gratitude and in acceptance she pressed her lips to his throat as he carried her toward the bedroom she allowed herself to yield then there was only moonlight it crept through the thin curtain softly quietly as a lover might creep through the window to find his woman her lover said nothing as he set her on her feet by the bed his silence told her everything hed imagined her like this it seemed impossible yet he had the image had been clear and vivid he had seen her with her hair in wild tangles around her face with her eyes dark and steady her skin gleaming like the gold she wore and in his imaginings hed seen much much more slowly he reached up to slip the scarf from her hair to let it float soundlessly to the floor she waited with his eyes on hers he loosened another and another of the slashes of colorвђsapphire emerald amberвђuntil they lay like jewels at her feet she smiled with his fingertips he drew the dress off her shoulders then pressed his lips to the skin hed bared a sigh and a shudder then she reached for him struggling to breathe while she pulled his shirt over his head his skin was taut and smooth under her palms she could feel the quiver of muscle at the passage of her hands as her eyes stayed on his she could see the flash and fury of passion that darkened them he had to fight every instinct to prevent himself from tearing the dress from her ripping aside the barriers and taking what she was offering she wouldnt stop him he could see it in her eyes part challenge part acknowledgment and all desire but he had promised her something though she claimed she wanted no promises he intended to keep it she would have romance as much as he was capable of giving her fighting for patience he undid the range of buttons down her back her lips were curved when she pressed them to his chest her hands were smooth when she slipped his pants over his hips as the dress slid to the floor he brought her close for a long luxurious kiss she swayed it seemed foolish to her but she was dizzy colors seemed to dance in her head to some frantic symphony she couldnt place her bracelets jingled when he lifted her hand to press a small circle of kisses upon her wrist material rustled more notes to the song when he slipped petticoat after colorful petticoat over her hips he hadnt believed she could be so beautiful but now standing before him in only a thin red chemise and the glitter of gold she was almost more than a man could bear her eyes were nearly closed but her head was upвђa habit of pride that suited her well moonlight swam around her slowly she lifted her arms crossing them in front of her to push the slender straps from her shoulders the material trembled over her breasts then clung for a fleeting instant before it slithered to the floor at their feet now there was only the glitter of gold against her skin exciting erotic exotic she waited then lifted her arms againвђto him i want you she said flesh met flesh drawing twin moans from each of them mouth met mouth sending shock waves of pleasure and pain through both desire met desire driving out reason inevitable it was the only thought that filtered through the chaos in her mind as her hands raced over him no force this strong no need this deep could be anything but inevitable so she met that force met that need with all of her heart patience was forgotten she was a hunger in him already too long denied he wanted all everything she was everything she had before he could demand she was giving when they tumbled onto the bed his hands were already greedily searching to give and to take pleasure could he have known it would be so huge so consuming everything about her was vivid and honed sharp her taste an intoxicating mix of honey and whiskey both heated her skin as lush as a rose petal drenched in evening dew her scent as dark as his own passion her need as sharp as a freshly whetted blade she arched against him offering challenging crying out when he sought and found each secret pleasure arrowed into him as her small agile body pressed against his strong willful she rolled over him to exploit and explore until his breath was a fire in his lungs and his body a mass of sensation halfmad he tumbled with her over the bed and spread a tangle of sheets around them when he lifted himself over her he could see the wild curtain of her hair like a dark cloud the deep rich glow of her eyes as they clung to his her breathing was as hurried as his own her body as willing never before he realized and never again would he find anyone who matched him so perfectly whatever he needed she needed whatever he wanted she wanted before he could ask she was answering for the first time in his life he knew what it was to make love with mind and heart and soul as well as body she thought of no one and of nothing but him when he touched her it was as though shed never been touched before when he said her name it was the first time shed heard it when his mouth sought hers it was a first kiss the one shed been waiting for wishing for all of her life palm to palm their hands met fingers gripping hard like one soul grasping another they watched each other as he filled her and there was a promise felt by both in a moment of panic she shook her head then he was moving in her and she with him again was all he said as he pulled her against him spence again his mouth covered hers waking her out of a half dream and into fresh passion he wanted her just as much now that he knew what they could make between them but with a fire that held steady on slow burn this time though desire was still keen the madness was less intense he could appreciate the subtle curves the soft angles the lazy sighs he could draw out of her with only a touch it was like making love to some primitive goddess naked but for the gold draped over her skin after so long a thirst he quenched himself slowly leisurely after that first greedy gulp how had she ever imagined she had known what it was to love a man or to be loved by one there were pleasures here that as a woman she knew she had never tasted before this was what it was to be steeped to be drowned to be sated she ran her hands over him absorbing the erotic sensations of the flick of his tongue the scrape of his teeth the play of those clever fingertips no these were new pleasures very new and their taste was freedom as the moon soared high into the night so did she i thought i had imagined what it would be like to be with you her head resting on his shoulder spence trailed his fingers up and down her arm i didnt even come close i thought i would never be here with you she smiled into the dark i was very wrong thank god natashaвђ with a quick shake of her head she put a finger to his lips dont say too much its easy to say too much in the moonlight and easy to believe it she added silently though impatient he bit back the words he wanted to say he had made a mistake once before by wanting too much too quickly he was determined not to make mistakes with natasha can i tell you that ill never look at gold chains in quite the same way again with a little chuckle she pressed a kiss to his shoulder yes you can tell me that he toyed with her bracelets can i tell you im happy yes are you she tilted her head to look at him yes happier than i thought i could be you make me feelвђ she smiled making a quick movement with her shoulders like magic tonight was magic i was afraid she murmured of you of this of myself she admitted its been a very long time for me its been a long time for me too at her restless movement he caught her chin in his hand i havent been with anyone since before my wife died did you love her very much im sorry she said quickly and closed her eyes tight i have no business asking that yes you do he kept his fingers firm i loved her once or i loved the idea of her that idea was gone long before she died please tonight isnt the time to talk about things that were when she sat up he went with her cupping her forearms in his hands maybe not but there are things i need to tell you things we will talk about is what happened before so important he heard the trace of desperation in her voice and wished he could find the reason i think it could be this is now she closed her hands over his it was as close to a promise as she dared make now i want to be your friend and your lover then be both she calmed herself with a deliberate effort perhaps i dont want to talk about other women while im in bed with you he could feel that she was braced and ready to argue in a move that threw her off he leaned closer to touch his lips to her brow well let you use that one for now thank you she brushed a hand through his hair id like to spend this night with you all night with a half smile she shook her head you cant stay i know he caught her hand to bring it to his lips freddie would have some very awkward questions for me if i wasnt around for breakfast in the morning shes a very lucky girl i dont like leaving this way she smiled and kissed him i understand as long as the other woman is only six ill see you tomorrow bending closer he deepened the kiss yes on a sigh she wrapped her arms around him once more she murmured drawing him down to the bed just once more in her cramped office at the back of the shop natasha sat at her desk she had come in early to catch up on the practical side of business her ledger was uptodate her invoices had been filled with christmas less than two months away she had completed her orders early merchandise was already stacked wherever room could be found it made her feel good to be surrounded by the wishes of children and to know that on christmas morning what was now stored in boxes would cause cries of delight and wonder but there were practicalities as well she had only begun to think of displays decorations and discounts she would have to decide soon whether she wanted to hire parttime help for the seasonal rush now at midmorning with annie in charge of the shop she had textbooks and notes spread out before business there were studies and she took both very seriously there was to be a test on the baroque era and she intended to show her teacherвђher loverвђthat she could hold her own perhaps it shouldnt have been so important to prove she could learn and retain but there had been times in her life times she was certain spence could never understand when she had been made to feel inadequate even stupid the little girl with broken english the thin teenager whod thought more about dance than schoolbooks the dancer whod fought so hard to make her body bear the insults of training the young woman who had listened to her heart not her head she was none of those people any longer and yet she was all of them she needed spence to respect her intelligence to see her as an equal not just as the woman he desired she was being foolish on a sigh natasha leaned back in her chair to toy with the petals of the red rose that stood at her elbow even more than foolish she was wrong spence was nothing like anthony except for the vaguest of physical similarities those two men were almost opposites true one was a brilliant dancer the other a brilliant musician but anthony had been selfish dishonest and in the end cowardly she had never known a man more generous a man kinder than spence he was compassionate and honest or was that her heart talking to be sure but the heart she thought didnt come with a guarantee like a mechanical toy every day she was with him she fell deeper and deeper in love so much in love she thought that there were moments terrifying moments when she wanted to toss aside everything and tell him she had offered her heart to a man before a heart pure and fragile when it had been given back to her it had been scarred no there were no guarantees how could she dare risk that again even knowing that what was happening to her now was different very different from what had happened to the young girl of seventeen how could she possibly take the chance of leaving herself open again to that kind of pain and humiliation things were better as they were she assured herself they were two adults enjoying each other and they were friends taking the rose out of its vase she stroked it along her cheek it was a pity that she and her friend could only find a few scattered hours to be alone there was a child to consider then there were schedules and responsibilities but in those hours when her friend became her lover she knew the true meaning of bliss bringing herself back she slipped the flower into the vase and shifted her concentration to her studies within five minutes the phone rang good morning fun house good morning business person mama so you are busy or you have a moment to talk to your mother natasha cradled the phone in both hands loving the sound of her mothers voice of course i have a moment all the moments you like i wondered since you have not called me in two weeks im sorry for two weeks a man had been the center of her life but she could hardly tell that to her mother how are you and papa and everyone papa and me and everyone are good papa gets a raise wonderful mikhail doesnt see the italian girl anymore nadia gave thanks in ukrainian and made natasha laugh alex he sees all the girls smart boy my alex and rachel has time for nothing but her studies what of natasha natasha is fine im eating well and getting plenty of sleep she added before nadia could ask good and your store were about to get ready for christmas and i expect a better year than last i want you to stop sending your money i want you to stop worrying about your children nadias sigh made natasha smile it was an old argument you are a very stubborn woman like my mama that was true enough and nadia clearly didnt intend to concede we will talk about this when you come for thanksgiving thanksgiving natasha thought how could she have forgotten clamping the receiver between ear and shoulder she flipped through her calendar it was less than two weeks away i cant argue with my mother on thanksgiving natasha made a note for herself to call the train station ill be up late wednesday evening ill bring the wine you bring yourself myself and the wine natasha scribbled another note to herself it was a difficult time to take off but she had never missedвђand would never missвђa holiday at home ill be so glad to see all of you again maybe you bring a friend it was another old routine but this time for the first time natasha hesitated no she told herself with a shake of her head why would spence want to spend thanksgiving in brooklyn natasha nadias wellhoned instincts had obviously picked up her daughters mental debate you have friend of course i have a lot of friends dont be smart with your mama who is he hes no one then she rolled her eyes as nadia began tossing out questions all right all right hes a professor at the college a widower she added with a little girl i was just thinking they might like company for the holiday thats all ah dont give me that significant ah mama hes a friend and im very fond of the little girl how long you know him they just moved here late this summer im taking one of his courses and the little girl comes in the shop sometimes it was all true she thought not all the truth but all true she hoped her tone was careless if i get around to it i might ask him if hed like to come up the little girl she can sleep with you and rachel yes ifвђ the professor he can take alexs room alex can sleep on the couch he may already have plans you ask all right if it comes up you ask nadia repeated now go back to work yes mama i love you now shed done it natasha thought as she hung up she could almost see her mother standing beside the rickety telephone table and rubbing her hands together what would he think of her family and they of him would he enjoy a big rowdy meal she thought of the first dinner they had shared the elegant table the quiet discreet service he probably has plans anyway natasha decided it just wasnt something she was going to worry about twenty minutes later the phone ran again it was probably her mother natasha thought calling with a dozen questions about this friend braced natasha picked up the receiver good morning fun house natasha spence automatically she checked her watch why arent you at the university are you sick no no i came home between classes ive got about an hour i need you to come to your house there was an urgency in his voice but it had nothing to do with disaster and everything to do with excitement why what is it just come will you its nothing i can explain i have to show you please yes all right are you sure youre not sick no she heard his laugh and relaxed no im not sick ive never felt better hurry up will you ten minutes natasha snatched up her coat hed sounded different happy no elated ecstatic what did a man have to be ecstatic about in the middle of the morning perhaps he was sick pulling on her gloves she dashed into the shop annie i have toвђ she stopped blinked then stared at the image of annie being kissed soundly by terry maynard iвђexcuse me oh tash terry justвђ well heвђ annie blew the hair out of her eyes and grinned foolishly are you going out yes i have to see someone she bit her lip to keep from grinning back i wont be more than an hour can you manage sure annie smoothed down her hair while terry stood beside her turning various shades of red it has been a quiet morning take your time perhaps the world had decided to go crazy today natasha thought as she rushed down the street first her mother calling already preparing to kick alex out of his bed for a stranger spence demanding she come to his house and seeвђ something in the middle of the day and now annie and terry kissing each other beside the cash register well she could only deal with one at a time it looked as though spence was first on the list she took his steps two at time convinced he was suffering from some sort of fever when he pulled open the door before she reached it she was certain of it his eyes were bright his color up his sweater was rumpled and his tie unknotted spence are youвђ before she could get the words out he was snatching her up crushing his mouth to hers as he swung her around and around i thought youd never get here i came as quickly as i could instinctively she put a hand to his cheek then the look in his eyes had her narrowing her own no it wasnt a fever she decided at least it wasnt the kind that required medical attention if you had me run all the way over here for that im going to hit you very hard forвђno he answered on a laugh though its a wonderful idea a really wonderful idea he kissed her again until she thoroughly agreed with him i feel like i could make love with you for hours days weeks they might miss you in class she murmured steadying herself she stepped back you sounded excited did you win the lottery better come here remembering the door he slammed it shut then pulled her into the music room dont say anything just sit she obliged but when he went to the piano she started to stand again spence id enjoy a concert butвђ dont talk he said impatiently just listen and he began to play it took only moments for her to realize it was nothing shed heard before nothing that had been written before a tremor ran through her body she clasped her hands tightly in her lap passion each note swelled with it soared with it wept with it she could only stare seeing the intensity in his eyes and the fluid grace of his fingers on the keys the beauty of it ripped at her digging deep into heart and into soul how could it be that her feelings her most intimate feelings could be put to music as the tempo built her pulse beat thickly she couldnt have spoken could hardly breathe then the music flowed into something sad and strong and alive she closed her eyes as it crashed over her unaware that tears had began to spill onto her cheeks when it ended she sat very still i dont have to ask you what you think spence murmured i can see it she only shook her head she didnt have the words to tell him there were no words when over the last few days the emotion the song had wrenched from him came flooding back rising he went to her to take her hands and pulled her to her feet as their fingers met she could feel the intensity hed poured into his music it came back he pressed her hands to his lips at first it was terrifying i could hear it in my head the way i used to its like being plugged into heaven natasha i cant explain it no you dont have to i heard it she understood he thought somehow hed been sure she would i thought it was just wishful thinking or that when i sat down thereвђ he looked back at the piano that it would vanish but it didnt it flowed god its like being given back your hands or your eyes it was always there she lifted her hands to his face it was just resting no you brought it back i told you once my life had changed when i met you i didnt know how much its for you natasha no its for you very much for you wrapping her arms around him she pressed her mouth to his its just the beginning yes he dragged his hands through her hair so that her face was tilted to his it is his grip only tightened when she would have pulled away if you heard that if you understood that you know what i mean and you know what i feel spence it would be wrong for you to say anything now your emotions are all on the surface what you feel about your music is easily confused with other things thats nonsense you dont want to hear me tell you that i love you no panic skidded up her spine no i dont if you care for me at all you wont its a hell of a position you put me in im sorry i want you to be happy as long as things go on as they areвђ and how long can things go on as they are i dont know i cant give you back the words you want to give to me even feeling them i cant her eyes lifted again to meet his i wish i could am i still competing against someone else no quickly she reached out to take his hands no what i felt forвђbefore she corrected was a fantasy a girls makebelieve this is real im just not strong enough to hold onto it or too strong to give in to it he thought and it was hurting her perhaps because he wanted her so badly his impatience was adding pressure that would break them apart instead of bring them together then i wont tell you that i love you he kissed her brow and that i need you in my life he kissed her lips lightly not yet his fingers curled tightly over hers but therell come a time natasha when i will tell you when youll listen when youll answer me you make it sound like a threat no its one of those promises you dont want to hear he kissed her on both cheeks casually enough to confuse her i have to get back yes so do i she picked up her gloves only to run them restlessly through her hands spence it meant a very great deal that you wanted to share this with me i know what its like to lose part of yourself im very proud of you and for you and im glad that you celebrated this with me come back have dinner with me i havent begun to celebrate she smiled again id like that she didnt often buy champagne but it seemed appropriate even necessary a bottle of wine was little enough to offer for what he had given her that morning the music itself was a gift she would always treasure with it hed given her time and a glimpse of hope perhaps he did love her if she believed it she could allow herself time to let it strengthen if she believed it she would have to tell him everything it was that even more than her own fears that still held her back she needed time for that as he did but tonight was for celebrating she knocked and tried a sober smile for vera good evening miss with this noncommittal greeting vera opened the door wider she kept her thoughts on natasha very much to herself true the woman made the senor happy and seemed very fond of freddie but after more than three years of having them to herself vera was very cautious of sharing dr kimball is in the music room with freddie thank you i brought some wine i will take it with only a little sigh natasha watched vera walk away the more the housekeeper held firm the more determined natasha was to win her over she heard freddies giggles as she approached the music room and others she realized when she reached the door she spotted freddie and jobeth clinging to each other and squealing and why not natasha thought with a grin spence was wearing a ridiculous helmet and aiming a cardboard spool like a weapon stowaways aboard my ship are fed to the beta monster he warned them he has sixfoot teeth and bad breath no eyes wide heart pounding with delight and dread freddie scrambled for cover not the beta monster he likes little girls best with an evil laugh he scooped the squealing jobeth under one arm he swallows little boys whole but he chews and chews and chews when i feed him girls thats gross jobeth covered her mouth with both hands you bet so saying spence made a dive and came up with a squirming freddie say your prayers youre about to be the main course then with a muffled oomph he tumbled onto the couch with both of them we vanquished you freddie announced climbing over him the wonder sisters vanquished you this time but next time its the beta monster as he blew the hair out of his eyes he spotted natasha in the doorway hi she thought his smile was adorably sheepish im a space pirate oh well that explains it before she could step into the room both girls deserted the space pirate to launch themselves at her we always beat him freddie told her always always im glad to hear it i wouldnt want anyone i know to be eaten by the beta monster he just made it up jobeth said wisely dr kimball makes things up real good yes i know jobeths going to stay for dinner too youre going to be daddys guest and shes going to be mine you get to have seconds first thats very polite she bent to kiss freddies cheeks then jobeths how is your mama shes going to have a baby jobeth screwed up her face and shrugged her shoulders i heard natasha smoothed jobeths hair are you taking care of her she doesnt get sick in the mornings anymore but daddy says shell be fat soon miserably envious freddie shifted from one foot to the other lets go up to my room she told jobeth we can play with the kittens you will wash your hands and faces vera told them as she came in with the ice bucket and glasses then you will come down to dinner walking like ladies not running like elephants she nodded to spence miss stanislaski brought champagne thank you vera belatedly he remembered to remove his helmet dinner in fifteen minutes she stated then went out now she knows i have designs on you natasha muttered and is certain im after your great wealth with a laugh he pried the cork free thats all right i know youre only after my body wine frothed to the lip of the glasses then receded i like it very much your body with a smile she accepted the flute of champagne then maybe youd like to enjoy it later he touched the rim of his glass to hers freddie twisted my arm and got me to agree to a sleepover at the rileys so i dont feel left out maybe i can stay with you tonight all night natasha took her first sip of wine letting the taste explode on her tongue yes she said and smiled at him chapter nine contents prev next natasha watched the shadows dancing from the lights the candles tossed around the room soothing they played over the curtains the top rung of the old ladderback chair in the corner over the coxcomb she had impulsively slipped into an empty milk bottle and set on her dresser her room she thought it had always been very much hers untilвђ with a half sigh she let her hand rest on spences heart it was no longer quiet the wind had risen to toss a late cold rain against the panes outside it was a chilled gusty night that promised a chilled frosty morning winter often came early to the little town snuggled in the foothills of the blue ridge but she was warm beautifully warm in spences arms the silence between them was easy as the loving had been curled close they lay still content to let the hours pass one lazy second at a time each of them quietly celebrated the knowledge that in the morning they wouldnt wake atone his hand skimmed over her thigh her hip until it linked with hers there was music playing inside her headвђthe song he had given her that morning she knew she would remember each note each chord for the rest of her life and it was only the beginning for him or a new beginning the idea of that delighted her in the years to come she would hear his music and remember the time they had had together on hearing it she would celebrate again even if his music took him away still she had to ask will you go back to new york he brushed his lips through her hair why youre composing again she could imagine him there in evening dress attending the opening of his own symphony i dont need to be in new york to compose and if i did there are more reasons to stay here freddie yes theres freddie and theres you her restless movement rustled the sheets she could see him after the symphony at some small intimate party the rainbow room perhaps or a private club he would be dancing with a beautiful woman the new york you lived in is different from mine i imagine he wondered why that should matter to her do you ever think of going back to live no but to visit it was silly she thought to be nervous about asking such a simple thing my mother called me today is everything all right yes she only called to remind me about thanksgiving id almost forgotten every year we have a big dinner and eat too much do you go home for the holiday i am home i mean to your family she shifted to watch his face i only have freddie and nina he added she always goes out to the waldorf your parents ive never asked you if you still have them or where they live theyre in cannes or was it monte carlo it occurred to him suddenly that he didnt know for certain the ties there were loose comfortably so for everyone involved wont they come back for the holidays they never come to new york in the winter oh try as she might she couldnt picture the holidays without family we never ate at home on thanksgiving we always went out were usually traveling his memories of his childhood were more of places than people more of music than words when i was married to angela we usually met friends at a restaurant and went to the theater butвђ she caught herself and fell silent but what once you had freddie nothing changed he shifted onto his back to stare at the ceiling hed wanted to tell her about his marriage about himselfвђthe man he had beenвђbut had put it off for too long he reflected how could he expect to build when he had yet to clear away the emotional rubble of his past ive never explained to you about angela its not necessary she took his hand again shed wanted to invite him to a meal not dredge up old ghosts it is for me sitting up he reached for the bottle of champagne they had brought back with them filling both glasses he handed her one i dont need explanations spence but youll listen yes if its important to you he took a moment to gather his thoughts i was twentyfive when i met her on top of the world as far as my music went and to be honest at twentyfive very little else mattered to me i had spent my life traveling doing exactly what i pleased and being successful in what was most important to me i dont believe anyone had ever told me no you cant have that no you cant do that when i saw her i wanted her he paused to sip to look back beside him natasha stared into her glass watching bubbles rise and she wanted you in her way the pity was that her attraction for me was as shallow as mine for her and in the end just as destructive i loved beautiful things with a half laugh he tilted his glass again and i was used to having them she was exquisite like a delicate porcelain doll we moved in the same circles attended the same parties preferred the same literature and music natasha shifted her glass from one hand to the other wishing his words didnt make her feel so miserable its important to have things in common oh we had plenty in common she was as spoiled and as pampered as i as selfabsorbed and as ambitious i dont think we shared any particularly admirable qualities youre too hard on yourself you didnt know me then he found himself profoundly grateful for that i was a very rich young man who took everything i had for granted because i had always had it things change he murmured only people who are born with money can consider it a disadvantage he glanced over to see her sitting crosslegged the glass cupped in both hands her eyes were solemn and direct and made him smile at himself yes youre right i wonder what might have happened if i had met you when i was twentyfive he touched her hair but didnt dwell on the point in any case angela and i were married within a year and bored with each other only months after the ink had dried on the marriage certificate why because at that time we were so much alike when it started to fall apart i wanted badly to fix it id never failed at anything the worst of it was i wanted the marriage to work more for my own ego than because of my feelings for her i was in love with the image of her and the image we made together yes she thought of herself and her feelings for anthony i understand do you the question was only a murmur it took me years to understand it in any case once i did there were other considerations freddie natasha said again yes freddie though we still lived together and went through the motions of marriage angela and i had drifted apart but in public and in private we wereвђ civilized i cant tell you how demeaning and destructive a civilized marriage can be its a cheat natasha to both parties and we were equally to blame then one day she came home furious livid i remember how she stalked over to the bar tossing her mink aside so that it fell on the floor she poured a drink drank it down then threw the glass against the wall and told me she was pregnant her throat dry natasha drank how did you feel stunned rocked wed never planned on having children we were much too much children spoiled children ourselves angela had had a little more time to think it all through and had her answer she wanted to go to europe to a private clinic and have an abortion something tightened inside natasha is that what you wanted he wished how he wished he could have answered unequivocably no at first i didnt know my marriage was falling apart id never given a thought to having children it seemed sensible and then im not sure why but i was furious i guess it was because it was the easy way again the easy way out for both of us she wanted me to snap my fingers and get rid of thisвђ inconvenience natasha stared down at her own balled fist his words were hitting much too close to home what did you do i made a bargain with her she would have the baby and we would give the marriage another shot she would have the abortion and i would divorce her and make certain that she didnt get what she considered her share of the kimball money because you wanted the child no it was a painful admission one that still cost him because i wanted my life to run the way id imagined it would i knew if she had an abortion we would never put the pieces back i thought perhaps if we shared this wed pull it all together again natasha remained silent for a moment absorbing his words and seeing them reflected in her own memories people sometimes think a baby will fix whats broken and it doesnt he finished nor should it have to by the time freddie was born i was already losing my grip on my music i couldnt write angela had delivered freddie then passed her over to vera as though she were no more than a litter of kittens i was little better no she reached out to take his wrist ive seen you with her i know how you love her now what you said to me that night on the steps of the college about not deserving her it hurt because it was true he saw natasha shake her head but went on id made a bargain with angela and for more than a year i kept it i barely saw the child because i was so busy escorting angela to the ballet or the theater id stopped working completely i did nothing i never fed her or bathed her or cuddled her at night sometimes id hear her crying in the other room and wonderвђwhat is that noise then id remember he picked up the bottle to top off his glass sometime before freddie was two i stepped back and looked at what id done with my life and what i hadnt done it made me sick i had a child it took more than a year for it to sink in i had no marriage no wife no music but i had a child i decided i had an obligation a responsibility and it was time to pull myself up and deal with it thats how i thought of freddie at first when i finally began to think of her an obligation he drank again then shook his head that was little better than ignoring her finally i looked really looked at that beautiful little girl and fell in love i picked her up out of her crib scared to death and just held her she screamed for vera he laughed at that then stared once more into his wine it took months before she was comfortable around me by that time id asked angela for a divorce shed snapped up my offer without a blink when i told her i was keeping the child she wished me luck and walked out she never came back to see freddie not once in all the months the lawyers were battling over a settlement then i heard that shed been killed a boating accident in the mediterranean sometimes im afraid freddie remembers what her mother was like more im afraid shell remember what i was like natasha remembered how freddie had spoken of her mother when they had rocked setting aside her glass she took spences face in her hand children forgive she told him forgiveness is easy when youre loved its harder so much harder to forgive yourself but you must i think ive begun to natasha took his glass and set it aside let me love you she said simply and enfolded him it was different now that passion had mellowed slower smoother richer as they knelt on the bed their mouths met dreamilyвђa long lazy exploration of tastes that had become hauntingly familiar she wanted to show him what he meant to her and that what they had together tonight was worlds apart from what had been she wanted to comfort excite and cleanse a sigh then a murmur then a low liquid moan the sounds were followed by a light breezy touch fingertips trailing on flesh she knew his body now as well as her own every angle every plane every vulnerability when his breath caught on a tremble her laughter came quietly watching him in the shifting candlelight she brushed kisses at his temple his cheek the corner of his mouth his throat there a pulse beat for her heavy and fast she was as erotic as any fantasy her body swaying first to then away from his her eyes stayed on him glowing aware and her hair fell in a torrent of dark silk over her naked shoulders when he touched her skimming his hands up and over her head fell back but there was nothing of submission in the gesture it was a demand pleasure me on a groan he lowered his mouth to her throat and felt the need punch like a fist through his gut his open mouth growing greedy he trailed down her pausing to linger at the firm swell of her breast he could feel her heart almost taste it as its beat grew fast and hard against his lips her hands came to his hair gripping tight while she arched like a bow before he could think he reached for her and sent her spiraling over the first crest breathless shuddering she clung managing only a confused murmur as he laid her back on the bed she struggled for inner balance but he was already destroying will and mind and control this was seduction she hadnt asked for it hadnt wanted it now she welcomed it she couldnt move couldnt object helpless drowning in her own pleasure she let him take her where he willed his mouth roamed freely over her damp skin his hands played her as skillfully as they might a finetuned instrument her muscles went lax her breath began to rush through her lips she heard music symphonies cantatas preludes weakness became strength and she reached for him wanting only to feel his body fit against her own slowly tormentingly he slid up her leaving trails of heat and ice of pleasure and pain his own body throbbed as she moved under him he found her mouth diving deep holding back even when her fingers dug into his hips again and again he brought them both shivering to the edge only to retreat prolonging dozens of smaller pleasures her throat was a long white column he could feast on as she rose to him her arms wrapped themselves fast around him like taut silk her breath rushed along his cheek then into his mouth where it formed his own name like a prayer against his lips when he slipped into her even pleasure was shattered natasha awoke to the scent of coffee and soap and the enjoyable sensation of having her neck nuzzled if you dont wake up spence murmured into her ear im going to have to crawl back into bed with you all right she said on a sigh and snuggled closer spence took a long reluctant look at her shoulders which the shifting sheets had bared its tempting but i should be home in an hour why her eyes still closed she reached out its early its nearly nine nine in the morning her eyes flew open she shot up in bed and he wisely moved the cup of coffee out of harms way how can it be nine it comes after eight but i never sleep so late she pushed back her hair with both hands then managed to focus youre dressed unfortunately he agreed even more reluctantly when the sheets pooled around her waist freddies due home at ten i had a shower reaching out he began to toy with her hair i was going to wake you see if you wanted to join me but you looked so terrific sleeping i didnt have the heart he leaned over to nip at her bottom lip ive never watched you sleep before the very idea of it had the blood rushing warm under her skin you should have gotten me up yes with a half smile he offered her the coffee i can see i made a mistake easy with the coffee he warned its really terrible ive never made it before eyeing him she took a sip then grimaced you really should have wakened me but she valiantly took another sip thinking how sweet it was of him to bring it to her do you have time for breakfast ill make you some id like that i was going to grab a doughnut from the bakery down the street i cant make pastries like ye old sweet shoppe but i can fix you eggs laughing she set the cup aside and coffee in ten minutes she was wrapped in a short red robe frying thin slices of ham he liked watching her like this her hair tousled eyes still heavy with sleep she moved competently from stove to counter like a woman who had grown up doing such chores as a matter of course outside a thin november rain was falling from a pewter sky he heard the muffled sound of footsteps from the apartment above then the faint sound of music jazz from the neighbors radio and there was the sizzle of meat grilling the hum of the baseboard heater under the window morning music spence thought i could get used to this he said thinking aloud to what natasha popped two slices of bread into the toaster to waking up with you having breakfast with you her hands fluttered once as if her thoughts had suddenly taken a sharp turn then very deliberately they began to work again and she said nothing at all thats the wrong thing to say again isnt it it isnt right or wrong her movements brisk she brought him a cup of coffee she would have turned away once more but he caught her wrist when she forced herself to look at him she saw that the expression in his eyes was very intense you dont want me to fall in love with you natasha but neither one of us have a choice about it theres always a choice she said carefully its sometimes hard to make the right one or to know the right one then its already been made i am in love with you he saw the change in her face a softening a yielding and something in her eyes something deep and shadowed and incredibly beautiful then it was gone the eggs are going to burn his hand balled into a fist as she walked back to the stove slowly carefully he flexed his fingers i said i love you and youre worried about eggs burning im a practical woman spence ive had to be but it was hard to think very hard when her mind and heart were dragging her in opposing directions she fixed the plates with the care she might have given to a state dinner going over and over the words in her head she set the plates on the table then sat down across from him weve only known each other a short time long enough she moistened her lips what she heard in his voice was more hurt than anger she wanted nothing less than to hurt him there are things about me you dont know things im not ready to tell you they dont matter they do she took a deep breath we have something it would be ridiculous to try to deny it but loveвђthere is no bigger word in the world if we share that word things will change yes i cant let them from the beginning i told you there could be no promises no plans i dont want to move my life beyond what i have now is it because i have a child yes and no for the first time since hed met her nerves showed in the way she linked and unlinked her fingers i would love freddie even if i hated you for herself because i care for you i only love her more but for you and me to take what we have and make something more from this would change even that im not ready to take on the responsibilities of a child under the table she pressed her hand hard against her stomach but with or without freddie i dont want to take the next step with you im sorry and i understand if you dont want to see me again torn between frustration and fury he rose to pace to the window the rain was still falling thinly coldly upon the dying flowers outside she was leaving something out something big and vital she didnt trust him yet spence realized after everything theyd shared she didnt yet trust him not enough you know i cant stop seeing you any more than i can stop loving you you could stop being in love she thought but found herself afraid to tell him it was selfish hideously so but she wanted him to love her spence three months ago i didnt even know you so im rushing things she moved her shoulder and began to poke at her eggs he studied her from behind the way she held herself how her fingers moved restlessly from her fork to her cup then back again he wasnt rushing a damn thing and they both knew it she was afraid he leaned against the window thinking it through some jerk had broken her heart and she was afraid to have it broken again all right he thought he could get around that a little time and the most subtle kind of pressure he would get around it he promised himself for the first part of his life hed thought nothing would ever be as important to him as his music in the last few years hed learned differently a child was infinitely more important more precious and more beautiful now hed been taught in a matter of weeks that a woman could be as important in a different way but just as important freddie had waited for him bless her he would wait for natasha want to go to a matinee shed been braced for anger so only looked blankly over her shoulder what i said would you like to go to a matinee the movies casually he walked back to the table to join her i promised freddie id take her to the movies this afternoon iвђyes a cautious smile bloomed id like to go with you youre not angry with me yes i am but he returned her smile as he began to eat i figured if you came along youd buy the popcorn okay the jumbo size ah now i begin to see the strategy you make me feel guilty so i spend all my money thats right and when youre broke youll have to marry me great eggs he added when her mouth dropped open you should eat yours before they get cold yes she cleared her throat since youve offered me an invitation i have one for you i was going to mention it last night but you kept distracting me i remember he rubbed his foot over hers youre easily distracted natasha perhaps it was about my mothers phone call and thanksgiving she asked me if i wanted to bring someone along she frowned at her eggs i imagine you have plans his smile was slow and satisfied perhaps the wait wouldnt be as long as hed thought are you asking me to thanksgiving dinner at your mothers my mother asked natasha said precisely she always makes too much food and she and papa enjoy company when it came up i thought about you and freddie im glad to know that you think about us its nothing she said annoyed with herself for stringing out what should have been a simple invitation i always take the train up on wednesday after work and come back friday evening since there is no school it occurred to me that you both might enjoy the trip do we get borscht the corners of her lips curved i could ask she pushed her plate aside when she saw the gleam in his eyes he wasnt laughing she thought as much as planning i dont want you to get the wrong idea its simply an invitation from friend to friend right she frowned at him i think freddie would enjoy a big family meal right again his easy agreement had her blowing out a frustrated breath just because its at my parents home doesnt mean im taking you there forвђ she waved her hand as she searched for an appropriate phrase for approval or to show you off you mean your father wont take me into the den and ask me my intentions we dont have a den she muttered and no im a grown woman because spence was grinning she lifted a brow he will perhaps study you discreetly ill be on my best behavior then youll come he sat back sipping his coffee and smiling to himself i wouldnt miss it chapter ten contents prev next freddie sat in the back seat with a blanket tucked up to her chin and clutched her raggedy ann because she wanted to drift with her own daydreams she pretended to sleep and pretended so well that she actually dozed from time to time it was a long drive from west virginia to new york but she was much too excited to be bored there was soft music on the car radio she was enough of her fathers daughter to recognize mozart and child enough to wish there were words to sing along to vera had already been dropped off at her sisters in manhattan where the housekeeper would holiday until sunday now spence was directing the big quiet car through the traffic toward brooklyn freddie was only a little disappointed that they hadnt taken the train but liked snuggling up and listening to her father and natasha talk she didnt pay much attention to what they said their voices were enough she was almost sick with excitement at the idea of meeting natashas family and sharing a big turkey dinner though she didnt like turkey very much natasha had told her that there would be plenty of cranberry sauce and succotash freddie had never eaten succotash but the name was so funny she knew it would be good even if it wasnt even if it was disgusting she was determined to be polite and clean her plate jobeth had told her that her grandmother got upset if jobeth didnt eat all her vegetables so freddie wasnt taking any chances lights flickered over her closed lids her lips curved a little as she heard natashas laugh merging with her fathers in her imaginings they were already a family instead of raggedy ann freddie was carefully tending to her baby sister as they all drove through the night to her grandparents house it was just like the song she thought but she didnt know if they were going over any rivers and she didnt think they would pass through the woods her baby sisters name was katie and she had black curly hair like natasha whenever katie cried freddie was the only one who could make her happy again katie slept in a white crib in freddies room and freddie always made sure she was covered with a pink blanket babies caught colds freddie knew when they did you had to give them medicine out of a little dropper they couldnt blow their noses themselves everyone said that katie took her medicine best from freddie delighted with herself freddie snuggled the doll closer were going to grandmothers she whispered and began to build a whole new fantasy around the visit the trouble was freddie wasnt sure that the people she was pretending were her grandparents would like her not everyone liked kids she thought maybe they wished she wasnt coming to visit when she got there they would want her to sit in a chair with her hands folded on her lap that was the way aunt nina told her young ladies sat freddie hated being a young lady but she would have to sit for just hours not interrupting not talking too loud and never never running in the house they would get mad and frown at her if she spilled something on the floor maybe they would yell shed heard jobeths father yell especially when jobeths big brother who was in third grade already and was supposed to know better had taken one of his fathers golf clubs to hit at rocks in the backyard one of the rocks had crashed right through the kitchen window maybe she would break a window then natasha wouldnt marry her daddy and come to stay with them she wouldnt have a mother or a baby sister and daddy would stop playing his music at night again almost paralyzed by her thoughts freddie shrank against the seat as the car slowed yes turn right here at the sight of her old neighborhood natashas spirits rose even higher its about halfway down on the left you might be able to find a spaceвђ yes there she spotted a parking space behind her fathers ancient pickup obviously the stanislaskis had put out the word that their daughter and friends were coming and the neighbors had cooperated it was like that here she thought the poffenbergers had lived on one side the andersons on the other for as long as natasha could remember one family would bring food when there was illness another would mind a child after school joys and sorrows were shared and gossip abounded mikhail had dated the pretty anderson girl then had ended up as best man at her wedding when shed married one of his friends natashas parents had stood as godparents for one of the poffenberger babies perhaps that was why when natasha had found shed needed a new place and a new start she had picked a town that had reminded her of home not in looks but in ties what are you thinking spence asked her just remembering she turned her head to smile at him its good to be back she stepped onto the curb shivered once in the frosty air then opened the back door for freddie while spence popped the trunk freddie are you asleep freddie kept herself balled tight but squeezed her eyes open no were here its time to get out freddie swallowed clutching the doll to her chest what if they dont like me whats this crouching natasha brushed the hair from freddies cheeks have you been dreaming they might not like me and wish i wasnt here they might think im a pest lots of people think kidsre pests lots of people are stupid then natasha said briskly buttoning up freddies coat maybe but they might not like me anyway what if you dont like them that was something that hadnt occurred to her mulling it over freddie wiped her nose with the back of her hand before natasha could come up with a tissue are they nice i think so after you meet them you can decide okay okay ladies maybe you could pick another time to have a conference spence stood a few feet away loaded down with luggage what was that all about he asked when they joined him on the sidewalk girl talk natasha answered with a wink that made freddie giggle great he started up the worn concrete steps behind natasha nothing i like better than to stand in the brisk wind holding three hundred pounds of luggage what did you pack in here bricks only a few along with some essentials delighted with him she turned and kissed his cheekвђjust as nadia opened the door well pleased nadia folded her arms across her chest i told papa you would come before johnny carson was over mama natasha rushed up the final steps to be enfolded in nadias arms there was the scent she always remembered talc and nutmeg and as always there was the strong sturdy feel of her mothers body nadias dark and sultry looks were just as strong more so perhaps with the lines etched by worry laughter and time nadia murmured an endearment then drew natasha back to kiss her cheeks she could see herself as she had been twenty years before come on you leave our guests standing in the cold natashas father bounded into the hall to pluck her off the floor and toss her into the air he wasnt a tall man but the arms beneath his work shirt were thick as cinder blocks from his years in the construction trade he gave a robust laugh as he kissed her no manners nadia declared as she shut the door yuri natasha brings guests hello yuri thrust out a callused hand and pumped spences welcome this is spence and freddie kimball as she made introductions natasha noticed freddie slip her hand into her fathers we are happy to meet you because warmth was her way nadia greeted them both with kisses i will take your coats and you please come in and sit you will be tired we appreciate you having us spence began then sensing that freddie was nervous he picked her up and carried her into the living room it was small the wallpaper old and the furniture worn but there were lace doilies on the arms of the chairs the woodwork gleamed in the yellow lamplight from vigorous polishing and here and there were exquisitely worked pillows framed family pictures fought for space among the potted plants and knicknacks a husky wheeze had spence glancing down there was an old gray dog in the corner his tail began to thump when he saw natasha with obvious effort he rose and waddled to her sasha she crouched to bury her face in the dogs fur she laughed as he sat down again and leaned against her sasha is a very old man she explained to freddie he likes best now to sleep and eat and drink vodka yuri put in we will all have some except you he added and flicked a finger down freddies nose you would have some champagne huh freddie giggled then bit her lip natashas father didnt look exactly like shed imagined a grandfather he didnt have snowwhite hair and a big belly instead his hair was black and white at the same time and he had no belly at all he talked funny with a deep nimbly kind of voice but he smelled good like cherries and his smile was nice whats vodka russian tradition yuri answered her a drink we make from grain freddie wrinkled her nose that sounds yucky she said then immediately bit her lip again but at yuris burst of laughter she managed a shy smile natasha will tell you that her papa always teases little girls nadia poked an elbow into yuris ribs its because he is really just little boy at heart you would like hot chocolate freddie was torn between the comfort of her fathers hand and one of her favorite treats and nadia was smiling at her not with that goofy look grownups sometimes put on when they had to talk to kids it was a warm smile just like natashas yes maam nadia gave a nod of approval at the childs manners maybe you would like to come with me i show you how to make it with big fat marshmallows forgetting shyness freddie took her hand from spences and put it into nadias i have two cats she told nadia proudly as they walked into the kitchen and i had chicken pox on my birthday sit sit yuri ordered gesturing toward the couch we have a drink where are alex and rachel with a contented sigh natasha sank into the worn cushions alex takes his new girlfriend to the movies very pretty yuri said rolling his bright brown eyes rachel is at lecture bigtime lawyer from washington dc comes to college and how is mikhail very busy they remodel apartment in soho he passed out glasses tapping each before he drank so he said to spence as he settled in his favorite chair you teach music yes natashas one of my best students in music history smart girl my natasha he settled back in his chair and studied spence but not as natasha had hoped discreetly you are good friends yes natasha put in uneasy about the gleam in her fathers eyes we are spence just moved into town this summer he and freddie used to live in new york so this is interesting like fate i like to think so spence agreed enjoying himself it was especially fortunate that i have a little girl and natasha owns a very tempting toy store added to that she signed up for one of my classes it made it difficult for her to avoid me when she was being stubborn she is stubborn yuri agreed sadly her mother is stubborn me i am very agreeable natasha gave a quick snort stubborn and disrespectful women run in my family yuri took another healthy drink it is my curse perhaps one day ill be fortunate enough to say the same spence smiled over the rim of his glass when i convince natasha to marry me natasha sprang up ignoring her fathers grin since the vodkas gone to your head so quickly ill see if mama has any extra hot chocolate yuri pushed himself out of his chair to reach for the bottle as natasha disappeared well leave the chocolate to the women natasha awoke at first light with freddie curled in her arms she was in the bed of her childhood in a room where she and her sister had spent countless hours talking laughing arguing the wallpaper was the same faded roses whenever her mother had threatened to paint it both she and rachel had objected there was something comforting about waking up to the same walls from childhood through adolescence to adulthood turning her head she could see her sisters dark hair against the pillow of the next bed the sheets and blankets were in tangles typical natasha thought with a smile rachel had more energy asleep than most people had fully awake she had come in the night before after midnight bursting with enthusiasm over the lecture she had attended full of hugs and kisses and questions natasha brushed a kiss over freddies hair then carefully shifted her the child snuggled into the pillow without making a sound quietly natasha rose she took a moment to steady herself when the floor tilted four hours sleep she decided was bound to make anyone lightheaded gathering her clothes she went off to shower and dress arriving downstairs she caught the scent of coffee brewing it didnt seem to appeal to her but she followed it into the kitchen mama nadia was already at the counter busily rolling out piecrusts its too early to cook on thanksgiving its never too early she lifted her cheek for a kiss you want coffee natasha pressed a hand to her uneasy stomach no i dont think so i assume that bundle of blankets on the couch is alex he gets in very late nadia pursed her lips briefly in disapproval then shrugged hes not a boy anymore no youll just have to face it mama you have grown childrenвђand you raised them very well not so well that alex learns to pick up his socks but she smiled hoping her youngest son wouldnt deprive her of that last vestige of motherhood too soon did papa and spence stay up very late papa likes talking to your friend hes a nice man nadia laid a circle of dough on a pie plate then took up another chunk to roll out very handsome yes natasha agreed but cautiously he has good job is responsible loves his daughter yes natasha said again why dont you marry him when he wants you to shed figured on this biting back a sigh natasha leaned on the kitchen table there are a lot of nice responsible and handsome men mama should i marry them all not so many as you think smiling to herself nadia started on a third crust you dont love him when natasha didnt answer nadias smile widened ah dont start spence and i have only known each other for a few months theres a lot he doesnt know about me so tell him i dont seem to be able to nadia put down her rolling pin to cup her daughters face in two floury hands he is not like the other one no hes not butвђ impatient nadia shook her head holding on to something thats gone only makes a sickness inside you have a good heart tash trust it i want to she wrapped her arms around her mother and held tight i do love him mama but it still scares me and it still hurts on a long breath she drew back i want to borrow papas truck nadia didnt ask where she was going didnt need to yes i can go with you natasha only kissed her mothers cheek and shook her head shed been gone an hour before spence made his blearyeyed way downstairs he and the gray dog exchanged glances of sympathy yuri had been generous with the vodka the night before to guests and pets at the moment spence felt as though a chain gang were chipping rock in his head operating on automatic he found the kitchen following the scents of baking and blissfully coffee nadia took one look laughed broadly and gestured to the table sit she poured a cup of coffee strong and black drink i fix you breakfast like a dying man spence clutched the cup in both hands thanks i dont want to put you out nadia merely waved a hand as she reached for a castiron skillet i know a man with a hangover yuri poured you too much vodka no i took care of that all on my own he opened the aspirin bottle she set on the table bless you mrs stanislaski nadia you call me nadia when you get drunk in my house i dont remember feeling like this since college so saying he downed three aspirins i cant imagine why i thought it was fun at the time he managed a weak smile something smells wonderful you will like my pies she pushed fat sausages around in the skillet you met alex last night yes spence didnt object when she filled his cup a second time that was cause enough for one more drink you have a beautiful family nadia they make me proud she laughed as the sausage sizzled they make me worry you know you have daughter yes he smiled at her picturing what natasha would look like in a quarter of a century natasha is the only one who moves far away i worry most for her shes very strong nadia only nodded as she added eggs to the pan are you patient spence i think so nadia glanced over her shoulder dont be too patient funny natasha once told me the same thing pleased nadia popped bread into the toaster smart girl the kitchen door swung open alex dark rumpled and heavyeyed grinned i smelled breakfast the first snow was falling small thin flakes that swirled in the wind and vanished before they hit the ground there were some things natasha knew that were beautiful and very precious and here for only such a short time she stood alone bundled against the cold she didnt feel except inside the light was pale gray but not dreary not with the tiny dancing snowflakes she hadnt brought flowers she never did they would look much too sad on such a tiny grave lily closing her eyes she let herself remember how it had felt to hold that small delicate life in her arms her baby milaya her little girl those beautiful blue eyes natasha remembered those exquisite miniature hands like the flower she had been named for lily had been so lovely and had lived such a brief brief time she could see lily small and red and wrinkled her little hands fisted when the nurse had first laid her in natashas arms she could feel even now that sweet ache that tugged when lily had nursed at her breast she remembered the feel of that soft soft skin and the smell of powder and lotion the comfort of rocking late at night with her own baby girl on her shoulder so quickly gone natasha thought a few precious weeks no amount of time no amount of prayer would ever make her understand it accept perhaps but never understand i love you lily always she bent to press her palm against the cold grass rising again she turned and walked away through the lightly dancing snow where had she gone there could be a dozen places spence assured himself it was foolish to be worried but he couldnt help it some instinct was at work here heightened by the certainty that natashas family knew exactly where she was but refused to say the house was already filled with noise laughter and the smells of the celebrational meal to come he tried to shake off the feeling that wherever natasha was she needed him there was so much she hadnt told him that had become crystal clear when he saw the pictures in the living room natasha in tights and dance shoes in ballet skirts and toe shoes natasha with her hair streaming behind her caught at the apex of a grand jetг shed been a dancer quite obviously a professional but had never mentioned it why had she given it up why had she kept something that had been an important part of her life a secret from him coming out of the kitchen rachel saw him with one of the photographs in his hand she kept silent for a moment studying him like her mother she approved of what she saw there was a strength here and a gentleness her sister needed and deserved both its a beautiful picture he turned rachel was taller than natasha more willowy her dark hair was cut short in a sleek cap around her face her eyes more gold than brown dominated how old was she rachel dipped her hands into the pockets of her trousers as she crossed the room sixteen i think she was in the corps de ballet then very dedicated i always envied tash her grace i was a klutz she smiled and gently changed the subject always taller and skinnier than the boys knocking things over with my elbows wheres freddie spence set down the picture without saying it rachel had told him that if he had questions they were for natasha shes upstairs watching the macys parade with yuri he never misses it nothing disappointed him more than when we grew too old to want to sit in his lap and watch the floats a laughing squeal from the second floor had them both turning toward the stairs feet clomped a pink whirlwind in her jumpsuit freddie came dashing down to launch herself at spence daddy papa makes bear noises big bear noises did he rub his beard on your cheek rachel wanted to know its scratchy she giggled then wriggled down to run upstairs once more hoping hed do it again shes having the time of her life spence decided sos papa hows your head better thanks he heard the sound of the truck pulling up outside and glanced toward the window mama needs my help rachel slipped back into the kitchen he was at the door waiting for her natasha looked very pale very tired but she smiled when she saw him good morning because she needed him she slipped her arms around his waist and held tight are you all right yes she was now she realized when he was holding her like this stronger she pulled back i thought you might sleep late no ive been up awhile where have you been she unwound her scarf there was something i needed to do after peeling off her coat she hung it in the narrow closet where is everyone your mother and rachel are in the kitchen the last time i looked alex was on the phone this time the smile came easily sweettalking a girl apparently freddies up with your father watching the parade and putting him in heaven she touched her fingertips to spences cheek will you kiss me there was some need here he thought as he bent toward her some deep private need she still refused to share her lips were cold when his met them but they softened then warmed at last they curved youre very good for me spence i was hoping youd catch on to that he gave her bottom lip a playful nip better much im glad youre here she squeezed his hand how do you feel about some of mamas hot chocolate before he could answer freddie came sprinting down the steps again one shoelace trailing to throw her arms around natashas waist youre back so i am natasha bent to kiss the top of freddies head what have you been up to im watching the parade with papa he can talk just like donald duck and he lets me sit on his lap i see leaning closer natasha took a sniff there was the telltale fragrance of gumdrops lingering on freddies breath does he still hog all the yellow ones freddie giggled casting a quick cautious look at her father spence had a much different view of gumdrops than yuri its okay i like the red ones best how many red ones spence asked her freddie lifted her shoulders and let them fall it was spence noted with some amusement almost a mirror image of natashas habitual gesture not too many will you come up and watch with us she tugged at natashas hand its almost time for santa claus in a little while out of habit natasha crouched to tie freddies shoelace tell papa that i wont mention the gumdrops to mama if he saves me some okay she dashed up the stairs hes made quite an impression on her spence observed papa makes impressions on everyone she started to rise and felt the room spin before she could sink to the floor again spence had her arms what is it nothing she pressed a hand to her head waiting for the dizziness to pass i stood up too fast thats all youre pale come sit down he had an arm hooked around her waist but she shook her head no im fine really just a little tired relieved that the room had steadied she smiled at him blame it on rachel she would have talked through the night if i hadnt fallen asleep on her in selfdefense have you eaten anything i thought you were a doctor of music she smiled again and patted his cheek dont worry the minute i go into the kitchen mama will start feeding me just then the front door opened spence watched natashas face light up mikhail with a laugh she threw herself into the arms of her brother he had the dark blinding good looks that ran in the family the tallest of the brood he had to bend to gather natasha close his hair curled over his ears and collar his coat was worn his boots were scarred his hands as they stroked natashas hair were widepalmed and beautiful it took spence only seconds to see that while natasha loved all of her family deeply there was a separate and special bond here ive missed you she drew back just far enough to kiss his cheeks then hugged him close again ive really missed you then why dont you come more often he pushed her away wanting a good long look he didnt care for the pallor in her cheeks but since her hands were still cold he realized shed been out and he knew where shed spent that morning he murmured something in ukrainian but she only shook her head and squeezed his hands tight with a shrug very like her own he put the subject aside mikhail i want you to meet spence as he took off his coat mikhail turned to study spence unlike alexs friendly acceptance or rachels subtle measuring this was an intense and prolonged stare that left spence in no doubt that if mikhail didnt approve he wouldnt hesitate to say so i know your work he said at length its excellent thank you spence met look for look i can say the same about yours when mikhail lifted one dark brow spence continued ive seen the figures you carved for natasha ah a glimmer of a smile curved mikhails mouth my sister always was fond of fairy tales there was a squeal from upstairs followed by rumbling laughter thats freddie natasha explained spences daughter shes making papas day mikhail slipped a thumb through one belt loop you are a widower thats right and now you teach at college yes mikhail natasha interrupted dont play big brother im older than you but im bigger then with a quick flashing grin he tossed an arm around her shoulder so whats to eat too much spence decided as the family gathered around the table late that afternoon the huge turkey in the center of the handcrocheted tablecloth was only the beginning faithful to her adopted countrys holiday nadia had prepared a meal that was an american tradition from the chestnut dressing to the pumpkin pies wideeyed freddie gawked staring at platter after platter the room was full of noise as everyone talked over and around everyone else the china was mismatched old sasha lay sprawled under the table near her feet hoping for a few unobtrusive handouts she was sitting on a wobbly chair and the new york yellow pages as far as she was concerned it was the best day of her life alex and rachel began to argue over some childhood infraction mikhail joined in to tell them they were both wrong when her opinion was sought natasha just laughed and shook her head then turned to spence and murmuring something into his ear that made him chuckle nadia her cheeks rosy with the pleasure of having her family together slipped a hand into yuris as he lifted his glass enough he said and effectively silenced the table you can argue later about who let white mice loose in science lab now we toast we are thankful for this food that nadia and my girls have fixed for us and more thankful for the friends and family who are here together to enjoy it we give thanks as we did on our first thanksgiving in our country that we are free to freedom mikhail said as he lifted his glass to freedom yuri agreed his eyes misted and he looked around the table and to family chapter eleven contents prev next that evening with freddie dozing in his lap spence listened to yuri tell stories of the old country while the meal had been a noisy competition for conversation this hour was one of quiet and content across the room rachel and alex played a trivia game they argued often but without heat in the corner natasha and mikhail sat close dark heads together spence could hear their murmurs and noted that one often reached to touch the others hand to touch a cheek nadia sat smiling interrupting yuri occasionally to correct or comment as she worked another pillow cover woman yuri pointed at his wife with the stem of his afterdinner pipe i remember like yesterday you remember as you like to remember tak he stuck the pipe back into his mouth and what i remember makes better story when freddie stirred spence shifted her id better put her to bed i will do it nadia set her needlework aside and rose i would like to making soothing noises she lifted freddie sleepy and agreeable freddie snuggled into her neck will you rock me yes touched nadia kissed her hair as she started toward the steps i will rock you in the chair where i rocked all my babies and sing i will sing you a song my mother sang to me you would like that freddie gave a yawn and a drowsy nod you have a beautiful daughter like spence yuri watched them turn up the steps you must bring her back often i think ill have a hard time keeping her away she is always welcome as you are yuri took a puff on his pipe even if you dont marry my daughter that statement brought on ten seconds of humming silence until alex and rachel bent back over their game smothering grins spence didnt bother to smother his own as natasha rose there isnt enough milk for the morning she decided on the spot spence why dont you walk with me to get some sure a few moments later they stepped outside wrapped in coats and scarves the air had a bite that natasha welcomed overhead the sky was clear as black glass and icy with stars he didnt mean to embarrass you spence began yes he did spence didnt bother to hold back the chuckle and draped an arm over her shoulders i suppose he did i like your family so do i most of the time youre lucky to have them watching freddie here has made me realize how important family is i dont suppose ive really tried to get closer to nina or my parents theyre still family perhaps were as close as we are because when we came here we only had each other its true my family never crossed the mountains into hungary in a wagon that made her laugh rachel was always jealous that she hadnt been born yet when she was little she would get back by saying she was more american because shed been born in new york then not long ago someone said to her that if she wanted to be a lawyer she should think of changing or shortening her name with a new laugh natasha looked up at him she became very insulted and very ukrainian its a good name you could always keep it professionally after you marry me dont start must be your fathers influence he glanced at the dark shop where a closed sign hung on the door the stores closed i know she turned into his arms i just wanted to walk now that were standing here in a dark doorway alone i can kiss you good point spence lowered his mouth to hers natasha was annoyed with herself for dozing off and on during the drive home she felt as though shed spent a week mountain climbing rather than less than fortyeight hours in her family home by the time she shook herself awake for the last time they were crossing the maryland border into west virginia already she straightened in her seat and cast an apologetic glance at spence i didnt help you drive its all right you looked like you needed the rest too much food too little sleep she looked back at freddie who was sleeping soundly weve been poor company for you you can make up for it come home with me for a while all right it was the least she could do natasha thought with vera away until sunday she could help him tuck freddie into bed and fix him a light meal when they pulled up in front of the house they managed the suitcases and the sleeping child between them ill take her up he murmured it wont take long natasha waited in the kitchen brewing tea and making sandwiches it was ridiculous she thought she not only was exhausted but starving by the time spence came down again she had veras worktable set shes sleeping like a rock he scanned the table you read my mind with two unconscious passengers you couldnt stop and eat what have we got old ukrainian tradition she pulled back her chair tuna fish wonderful spence decided after the first bite it was more than the sandwich he liked having her there sitting across from him in the glare of the kitchen light with the house quiet around them i guess youll open the shop tomorrow absolutely itll be a madhouse from now until christmas ive hired a college student parttime and he starts tomorrow she lifted her cup and grinned at him over the rim guess who it is melony trainor he said naming one of his most attractive students and earning a punch on the shoulder no shes too busy flirting with men to work terry maynard maynard really yes he can use the money to buy a new muffler for his car andвђ she paused dramatically he and annie are an item no kidding he was grinning as he sat back well he certainly got over having his life shattered quickly natasha lifted a brow it wasnt shattered only shaken theyve been seeing each other almost every night for three weeks sounds serious i think it is but annies worried shes too old for him how much older is she natasha leaned forward and lowered her voice oh very much older nearly an entire year cradle robber with a laugh she leaned back again its nice to see them together i only hope they dont forget to wait on customers because theyre mooning at each other she shrugged and went back to her tea i think ill go in early and start on the decorations youll be tired at the end of the day why dont you come here for dinner curious she tilted her head you cook no he grinned and polished off his sandwich but i do great takeout you can get a whole box of chicken or pizza with the works ive even been known to come up with oriental seafood ill leave the menu to you she rose to clear the table but he took her hand natasha he stood using his free hand to stroke her hair i want to thank you for sharing the last couple of days with me it meant a lot to me too still ive missed being alone with you he bent to brush his lips over hers come upstairs with me i want very much to make love with you in my bed she didnt answer nor did she hesitate slipping an arm around his waist she went with him he left the bedside light on low she could just see the dark masculine colors hed chosen for his room midnight blue forest green an oil painting in a heavy ornate frame dominated one wall she could see the silhouettes of exquisite antiques the bed was big a generous private space covered by a thick soft quilt a special space natasha realized knowing he had never brought another woman to this bed to this room in the mirror over the bureau she caught their reflections as they stood side by side and saw herself smile when he touched a hand to her cheek there was time time to savor the fatigue she had felt earlier had vanished now she felt only the glow that came from loving and being loved words were too difficult but when she kissed him her heart spoke for her slowly they undressed each other she slipped his sweater over his head he undid the buttons of her cardigan then pushed it from her shoulders keeping her eyes on his she unfastened his shirt he slid up the cotton sweater letting his fingers trail until she was free of it she unhooked his trousers he flipped the three snaps that held her slacks at the waist keeping his hands light he drew the teddy down her body as she rugged away the last barrier between them quietly they moved together her palms pressing against his back his skimming up her sides heads tilting first this way then that they experimented with long lingering kisses enjoyment their bodies warming their mouths seeking it seemed so easy here they drew back in unspoken agreement spence pulled down the quilt they slipped under it together intimacy had no rival natasha thought there was nothing to compare with this their bodies rubbed against each other so that the sheets whispered with each movement her sigh answered his murmurs the flavor and fragrance of his skin was familiar personal his touch gentle then persuasive then demanding was everything she wanted she was simply beautiful not just her body not just that exquisite face but her spirit when she moved with him there was a harmony more intense than any he could create with music she was his musicвђher laugh her voice her gestures he knew of no way to tell her only to show her he made love with her as though it were the first and the only time never had she felt so elegant so graceful never had she felt so strong or so sure when he rose over her when she rose to meet him it was perfect id like you to stay natasha turned her face into his throat i cant freddie would ask questions in the morning i dont know how to answer i have a very simple answer ill tell her the truth im in love with you thats not simple it is the truth he shifted so that he could look at her her eyes were shadowed in the dim light i do love you natasha spenceвђ no no logic or excuses were past that tell me if you believe me she looked into his eyes and saw what she already knew yes i believe you then tell me what you feel i need to know he had a right to know she thought though she could all but taste the panic on her tongue i love you and im afraid he brought her hand to his lips to press a kiss firmly against her fingers why because i was in love before and nothing nothing could have ended as badly there was that shadow again he thought impatiently the shadow from her past that he could neither fight nor conquer because it was nameless neither of us have come into this without a few bruises natasha but we have a chance to make something new something important she knew he was right felt he was right yet still held back i wish i were so sure spence there are things you dont know about me that you were a dancer she shifted then to gather the sheets to her breast and sit up yes once why havent you mentioned it because it was over he drew the hair away from her face why did you stop i had a choice to make the ache came back but briefly she turned to him and smiled i was not so good oh i was adequate and perhaps in time i would have been good enough to have been a principal dancer perhapsвђ it was something i wanted very badly once but wanting something doesnt always make it happen will you tell me about it it was a beginning one she knew she had to make its not very exciting she lifted her hands then let them fall onto the sheet i started late after we came here through the church my parents met martina latovia many years ago she was an important soviet dancer who defected she became friends with my mother and offered to give me classes it was good for me the dance i didnt speak english well so it was hard to make friends everything was so different here you see yes i can imagine i was nearly eight by that time it becomes difficult to teach the body the joints to move as they werent meant to move but i worked very hard madame was kind and encouraging my parents were so proud she laughed a little but warmly papa was sure i would be the next pavlova the first time i danced en pointe mama cried dance is obsession and pain and joy its a different world spence i cant explain you have to know it be a part of it you dont have to explain she looked over at him no not to you she murmured because of the music i joined the corps de ballet when i was almost sixteen it was wonderful perhaps i didnt know there were other worlds but i was happy what happened there was another dancer she shut her eyes it was important to take this slowly carefully youve heard of him i imagine anthony marshall yes spence had an immediate picture of a tall blond man with a slender build and incredible grace ive seen him dance many times he was magnificent is she corrected though its been years since ive seen him dance we became involved i was young too young and it was a very big mistake now the shadow had a name you loved him oh yes in a naive and idealistic kind of way the only way a girl can love at seventeen more i thought he loved me he told me he did in words in actions he was very charming romanticвђ and i wanted to believe him he promised me marriage a future a partnership in dance all the things i wanted to hear he broke all those promises and my heart so now you dont want to hear promises from me youre not anthony she murmured then lifted a hand to his cheek her eyes were dark and beautiful her voice only more exotic as emotions crowded believe me i know that and i dont compare not now im not the same woman who built dreams on a few careless words what ive said to you hasnt been careless no she leaned closer to rest her cheek against his over the past months ive come to see that and to understand that what i feel for you is different from anything ive felt before there was more she wanted to tell him but the words clogged her throat please let that be enough for now for now it wont be enough forever she turned her mouth to his just for now how could it be natasha asked herself how could it be that when she was just beginning to trust herself to trust her heart that this should happen how could she face it again it was like a play run backward and started again when her life had changed so drastically and completely she sat back on her bed no longer concerned about dressing for work about starting a normal day how could things be normal now how could she expect them to be normal ever again she held the little vial in her hand she had followed the instructions exactly just a precaution she had told herself but shed known in her heart since the visit to her parents two weeks before shed known and had avoided facing the reality it was not the flu that made her queasy in the mornings it was not overwork or stress that caused her to be so tired or that brought on the occasional dizzy spells the simple test that shed bought over the counter in the drugstore had told her what shed already known and feared she was carrying a child once again she was carrying a child the rush of joy and wonder was totally eclipsed by the bonedeep fear that froze her how could it be she was no longer a foolish girl and had taken precautions romance aside she had been practical enough responsible enough to visit her doctor and begin taking those tiny little pills when she had realized where her relationship with spence was bound to go yet she was pregnant there was no denying it how could she tell him covering her face with her hands natasha rocked back and forth to give herself some small comfort how could she go through all of it again when that time years before was still so painfully etched on her memory she had known anthony no longer loved her if he had ever but when shed learned she was carrying his child she had been thrilled and so certain that he would share her delight when shed gone to him almost bubbling over glowing with the joy of it his cruelty had all but cut her in two how grudgingly hed let her into his apartment natasha remembered how difficult it had been for her to continue to smile when shed seen his table set for two the candles lighted the wine chillingвђas hed so often prepared the stage when hed loved her now hed set that stage for someone else but shed persuaded herself that it didnt matter once shed told him everything would change everything had what the hell are you talking about she remembered the fury in his eyes as hed stared at her i went to the doctor this afternoon im pregnant almost two months she reached out for him anthonyвђ thats an old game tash hed said it casually but perhaps hed been shaken hed stalked to the table to pour a glass of wine its not a game no then how could you be so stupid hed grabbed her arm and given her a quick shake his magnificent mane of hair flying if youve gotten yourself in trouble dont expect to come running to me to fix it dazed shed lifted a hand to rub her arm where his fingers had bit in it was only that he didnt understand shed told herself im having a child your child the doctor says the baby will come in july maybe youre pregnant hed shrugged as hed downed the wine it doesnt concern me it must hed looked at her then his glass held aloft his eyes cool how do i know its mine at that shed paled as shed stood there shed remembered how it had felt when shed almost stepped in front of a bus on her first trip to new york city you know you have to know i dont have to know anything now if youll excuse me im expecting someone in desperation shed reached out for him anthony dont you understand im carrying our baby your baby he corrected your problem if you want some advice get rid of it getвђ she hadnt been so young or so naive that she hadnt understood his meaning you cant mean it you want to dance tash try picking classes back up after taking off nine months to give birth to some brat youre going to end up giving away in any case grow up i have grown up shed laid a hand on her stomach in protection and defense and i will have this child your choice hed gestured with his wineglass dont expect to pull me into it ive got a career to think of youre probably better off he decided talk some loser into marrying you and set up housekeeping youd never be any better than mediocre at dance anyway so she had had the child and loved itвђfor a brief brief time now there was another she couldnt bear to love it couldnt bare to want it not when she knew what it was like to lose frantic she threw the vial across the room and began pulling clothes out of her closet she had to get away she had to think she would get away natasha promised herself then pressed her fingers against her eyes until she calmed but she had to tell him this time she drove to his house struggling for calm as the car brought her closer because it was saturday children were playing in yards and on the sidewalk some called out to her as she passed and she managed to lift a hand in a wave she spotted freddie wrestling with her kittens on the grass tash tash lucy and desi darted for cover but freddie raced to the car did you come to play not today summoning a smile natasha kissed her cheeks is your daddy home hes playing music he plays music a lot since we came here i drew a picture im going to send it to papa and nana natasha struggled to keep the smile in place at freddies names for her parents they will like that very much come on ill show you in a little while i need to speak to your father first by myself freddies bottom lip threatened are you mad at him no she pressed a finger to freddies nose go find your kittens ill talk to you before i go okay reassured freddie raced off sending out whoops that would have the kittens cowering in the bushes natasha reflected it was better to keep her mind a blank she decided as she knocked on the front door then she would take it slowly logically like an adult miss vera opened the door her expression less remote than usual freddies description of the thanksgiving holiday in brooklyn had done a great deal to win her over id like to see dr kimball if hes not busy come in she found herself frowning a bit as she studied natasha are you all right miss youre very pale yes im fine thank you would you like tea noвђno i cant stay long though vera privately thought natasha looked like a cornered rabbit she nodded youll find him in the music room hes been up half the night working thank you clutching her bag natasha started down the hall she could hear the music he was playing something weepy or perhaps it was her own mood she thought she blinked back tears when she saw him she remembered the first time she had walked into that room perhaps she had started to fall in love with him that day when he had sat there with a child on his lap surrounded by sunlight she pulled off her gloves running them through her nervous hands as she watched him he was lost in it both captor and captive of the music now she would change his life he hadnt asked for this and they both knew that loving wasnt always enough spence she murmured his name when the music stopped but he didnt hear she could see the intensity was still on him as he scribbled on staff paper he hadnt shaved it made her want to smile but instead her eyes filled his shirt was rumpled and open at the collar his hair was tousled as she watched he ran a hand through it spence she repeated he looked upannoyed at first then he focused and smiled at her hi i didnt expect to see you today annies watching the shop she knit her hands i needed to see you im glad you did he rose though the music was still filling his head what time is it anyway absently he glanced at his watch too early to ask you for lunch how about some coffee no even the thought of coffee made her stomach roll i dont want anything i needed to tell youвђ her fingers knotted i dont know how i want you to know i never intendedвђthis isnt intended to put you under obligationвђ the words trailed off again he shook his head and started toward her if somethings wrong why dont you tell me im trying to he took her hand to lead her to the couch the best ways often straight out yes she put her hand to her spinning head you see iвђ she saw the concern in his eyes then everything went blackвђ she was lying on the sofa and spence was kneeling beside her chafing her wrists take it easy he murmured just lie still ill call a doctor no theres no need carefully she pushed herself up im all right the hell you are her skin was clammy under his hand youre like ice and pale as a ghost damn it natasha why didnt you tell me you werent well ill take you to the hospital i dont need the hospital or the doctor hysteria was bubbling under her heart she fought it back and forced herself to speak im not sick spence im pregnant chapter twelve contents prev next what it was the best he could do he sank back onto his heels and stared at her what did you say she wanted to be strong had to be he looked as though shed hit him with a blunt instrument im pregnant she repeated then made a helpless gesture im sorry he only shook his head waiting for it to sink in are you sure yes it was best to be matteroffact natasha told herself he was a civilized man there would be no accusations no cruelty this morning i took a test i suspected before for a couple of weeks butвђ suspected his hand curled into a fist on the cushion she didnt look furious as angela had she looked destroyed and you didnt mention it i saw no need until i knew there was no point in upsetting you i see is that what you are natasha upset what i am is pregnant she said briskly and i felt it was only right to tell you im going away for a few days though she still felt shaky she managed to stand away confused afraid she would faint again furious he caught her now just a damn minute you drop in tell me youre pregnant and now you calmly tell me youre going away he felt something sharp punch into his gut its name was fear where just away she heard her own voice snappish and rude and pressed a hand to her head im sorry im not handling this well i need some time i need to go away what you need to do is sit down until we talk this out i cant talk about it she felt the pressure inside her build like floodwaters against a dam not yetвђnot until iвђi only wanted to tell you before i left youre not going anywhere he grabbed her arm to pull her back and you damn well will talk about it what do you want from me am i supposed to say well thats interesting news natasha see you when you get back i dont want anything when her voice rose this time she couldnt control it passions griefs fears poured out even as the tears began i never wanted anything from you i didnt want to fall in love with you i didnt want to need you in my life i didnt want your child inside me thats clear enough his grip tightened and he let his own temper free thats crystal clear but you do have my child inside you and now were going to sit down and talk about what were going to do about it i tell you i need time ive already given you more than enough time natasha apparently fates taken a hand again and youre going to have to face it i cant go through this again i wont again what are you talking about i had a child she jerked away to cover her face with her hands her whole body began to quake i had a child oh god stunned he put a gentle hand upon her shoulder you have a child had the tears seemed to be shooting up hot and painful from the center of her body shes gone come sit down natasha talk to me i cant you dont understand i lost her my baby i cant bear the thought of going through it all again she tore herself away you dont know you cant know how much it hurts no but i can see it he reached for her again i want you to tell me about this so i can understand what would that change well have to see it isnt good for you to get so upset now no she swiped a hand over her cheek it doesnt do any good to be upset im sorry im behaving like this dont apologize sit down ill get you some tea well talk he led her to a chair and she went unresistingly ill only be a minute he was away for less than that he was sure but when he came back she was gone mikhail carved from a block of cherry wood and listened to the blast of rock and roll through his earphones it suited the mood he could feel from the wood whatever was insideвђand he wasnt sure just what that was yetвђwas young and full of energy whenever he carved he listened whether it was to blues or bach or simply the rush and whoosh of traffic four floors below his window it left his mind free to explore whatever medium his hands were working in tonight his mind was too cluttered and he knew he was stalling he glanced over his worktable and across his cramped and cluttered tworoom apartment natasha was curled in the overstuffed badly sprung chair hed scavaged off the street the previous summer she had a book in her hands but mikhail didnt think shed turned a page in more than twenty minutes she too was stalling as annoyed with himself as with her he pulled off the headphones he only had to turn to be in the kitchen saying nothing he put a pot onto one of the two temperamental gas burners and brewed tea natasha made no comment when he brought over two cups setting hers on the scarred surface of a nearby table she glanced up blankly oh dyakuyu its time to tell me whats going on mikhailвђ i mean it he dropped onto the mismatched hassock at her feet youve been here nearly a week tash she managed a small smile ready to kick me out maybe but he put a hand over hers rubbing lightly i havent asked any questions because that was what you wanted i havent told mama and papa that you arrived at my door one evening looking pale and frightened because you asked me to say nothing and i appreciate it well stop appreciating it he made one of his characteristically abrupt gestures talk to me i told you i needed to get away for a little while and i didnt want mama and papa to fuss over me she moved her shoulders then reached for her tea you dont fuss im about to tell me whats wrong he leaned over and cupped her chin in one hand tash tell me im pregnant she blurted out then shakily set the tea down again he opened his mouth but when the words didnt come he simply wrapped his arms around her taking a long labored breath she held on youre all right youre well yes i went to the doctor a couple days ago he says im fine were fine he drew back to study her face the college professor yes there hasnt been anyone but spence mikhails dark eyes kindled if the bastards treated you badlyвђ no she found it odd that she was able to smile and caught mikhails fisted hands in hers no hes never treated me badly so he doesnt want the child when natasha merely looked down at their joined hands mikhail narrowed his eyes natasha i dont know she pulled away to stand and pace through mikhails collection of beatup furniture and blocks of wood and stone you havent told him of course i told him as she moved her hands clasped and unclasped to calm herself she stopped by mikhails christmas treeвђa onefoot evergreen in a pot that shed decorated with bits of colored paper i just didnt give him much of a chance to say anything when i did i was too upset you dont want the child she turned at that her eyes wide how can you say that how could you think that because youre here instead of working things out with the college professor i needed time to think you think too much it wasnt anything he hadnt said before natashas jaw set this isnt a matter of deciding between a blue dress and a red one im having a child tak why dont you sit down and relax before you give it wrinkles i dont want to sit down she began to prowl again shoving a box out of her way with one foot i didnt want to get involved with him in the first place even when i did when he made it impossible for me to do otherwise i knew it was important to keep some distance i wanted to make sure i didnt make the same mistakes again and nowвђ she made a helpless gesture he isnt anthony this baby isnt lily when she turned around her eyes were so drenched with emotion that he rose to go to her i loved her too i know you cant judge by whats gone tash gently he kissed her cheeks it isnt fair to you your professor or the child i dont know what to do do you love him yes i love him does he love you he saysвђ he caught her restless hands in his own dont tell me what he says tell me what you know yes he loves me then stop hiding and go home you should be having this conversation with him not with your brother he was slowly going out of his mind every day spence went by natashas apartment certain that this time she would answer the door when she didnt he stalked over to harass annie in the shop he barely noticed the christmas decorations in shop windows the fat cheerful santas the glittery angels the colored lights strung around the houses when he did it was to scowl at them it had taken all of his efforts to make a show of holiday spirit for freddie hed taken her to pick out a tree spent hours decorating it with her and complimenting her crumbling popcorn strings dutifully hed listened to her evergrowing christmas list and had taken her to the mall to sit in santas lap but his heart wasnt in it it had to stop he told himself and he stared out the window at the first snowfall whatever crisis he was facing whatever chaos his life was in he wouldnt see freddies christmas spoiled she asked about natasha every day it only made it more difficult because he had no answers hed watched freddie play an angel in her schools christmas pageant and wished natasha had been with him and what of their child he could hardly think of anything else even now natasha might be carrying the baby sister freddie so coveted the baby spence had already realized that he desperately wanted unlessвђ he didnt want to think of where she had gone what she had done how could he think of anything else there had to be a way to find her when he did he would beg plead browbeat and threaten until she came back to him shed had a child the fact left him dazed a child she had lost spence remembered but how and when questions that needed answering crowded his mind she had said she loved him and he knew that saying it had been difficult for her even so she had yet to trust him daddy freddie bounced into the room her mind full of the christmas that was only six days away were making cookies he glanced over his shoulder to see freddie grinning her mouth smeared with red and green sugar spence swooped her up to hold her close i love you freddie she giggled then kissed him i love you too can you come make cookies with us in a little while i have to go out first he was going to go to the shop corner annie and find out where natasha had gone no matter what the redhead said spence didnt believe that natasha would have left her assistant without a number where she could be reached freddies lip poked out while she fiddled with spences top button when will you come back soon he kissed her again before he set her down when i come back ill help you bake cookies i promise content freddie rushed back to vera she knew her father always kept his promises natasha stood outside the front door as the snow fell there were lights strung along the roof and around the posts she wondered how they would look when they were lighted there was a fullsize santa on the door his load of presents making him bend from the waist she remembered the witch that had stood there on halloween on that first night she and spence had made love on that night she was certain their child had been conceived for a moment she almost turned back telling herself she should go to her apartment unpack catch her breath but that would only be hiding again shed hidden long enough gathering her courage she knocked the moment freddie opened the door the little girls eyes shone she let out a squeal and all but jumped into natashas arms youre back youre back ive been waiting for you forever natasha held her close swaying back and forth this was what she wanted needed she realized as she buried her face in freddies hair how could she have been such a fool its only been a little while its been days and days we got a tree and lights and i already wrapped your present i bought it myself at the mall dont go away again no natasha murmured i wont she set freddie down to step inside and close out the cold and snow you missed my play i was an angel im sorry we made the halos in school and got to keep them so i can show you how i looked id like that certain everything was back to normal freddie took her hand i tripped once but i remembered all my lines mikey forgot his i said a child is born in bethlehem and peace on earth and sang gloria in selfish deo natasha laughed for the first time in days i wish i had heard that you will sing it for me later okay were baking cookies still holding natashas hand she began to drag her toward the kitchen is your daddy helping you no he had to go out he said hed come back soon and bake some he promised tom between relief and disappointment natasha followed freddie into the kitchen vera tash is back i see vera pursed her lips just when shed thought natasha might be good enough for the senor and her baby the woman had gone off without a word still she knew her duty would you like some coffee or tea miss no thank you i dont want to be in your way you have to stay freddie tugged at natashas hand again look ive made snowmen and reindeers and santas she plucked what she considered one of her best creations from the counter you can have one its beautiful natasha looked down at the snowman with red sugar clumped on his face and the brim of his hat broken off are you going to cry freddie asked no she managed to blink back the mist of tears im just glad to be home as she spoke the kitchen door opened natasha held her breath when spence stepped into the room he didnt speak his hand still on the door he stopped to stare it was as if hed conjured her up out of his own chaotic thoughts there was snow melting in her hair and on the shoulders of her coat her eyes were bright teary daddy tash is home freddie announced running to him shes going to bake cookies with us vera briskly untied her apron whatever doubts shed had about natasha were eclipsed by the look on her face vera knew a woman in love when she saw her we need more flour come freddie we will go buy some but i want toвђ you want to bake we need flour to bake come well get your coat businesslike vera bustled freddie out of the room alone spence and natasha stood where they were the moment stretched out the heat in the kitchen was making her dizzy natasha stripped off her coat and laid it over the back of a chair she wanted to talk to him reasonably that couldnt be done if she fainted at his feet spence the word seemed to echo off the walls and she took a deep breath i was hoping we could talk i see now youve decided talkings a good idea she started to speak then changed her mind when the oven timer went off behind her she turned automatically to take up the hot mitt and remove the latest batch of cookies from the oven she took her time setting them on the cooling rack youre right to be angry with me i behaved very badly toward you now i have to ask you to listen to me and hope you can forgive me he studied her for one long silent moment you certainly know how to defuse an argument i didnt come to argue with you ive had time to think and i realize that i chose a very poor way to tell you about the baby then to leave as i did she looked down at her hands her tightly laced fingers to just run away was inexcusable i can only tell you that i was afraid and confused and too emotional to think clearly one question he interjected then waited until she lifted her head he needed to see her face is there still a baby yes the blank puzzlement in her eyes became awareness awareness became regret oh spence im sorry so sorry to have caused you to think that i might haveвђ she blinked away tears knowing her emotions were still too close to the surface im sorry i went to mikhails to stay with him a few days she let out a shaky breath may i sit he only nodded then moved to the window as she slid behind the table laying his palms upon the counter he looked out at the snow ive been going out of my mind wondering where you were how you were the state you were in when you left i was terrified youd do something rash before we could talk it through i could never do what you thought spence this is our baby you said you didnt want it he turned again you said you wouldnt go through it again i was afraid natasha admitted and its true i hadnt wanted to get pregnant not now not ever id like to tell you everything he wanted badly much too badly just to reach out to her to hold her and tell her that nothing mattered because he knew it did matter he busied himself at the stove do you want some coffee no it makes me sick now she smiled a little when he fumbled with the pot please would you sit down all right he sat down across from her then spread his hands go ahead i told you that i had been in love with anthony while i was with the corps de ballet i was just seventeen when we became lovers he was the first for me theres been no one for me until you why the answer was much easier than shed believed id never loved again until you the love i feel for you is much different from the fantasies i had for anthony with you it isnt dreams and knights and princes with you its real and solid daytoday ordinaryвђordinary in the most beautiful way can you understand he looked at her the room was quiet insulated by the snow it smelled of warm cookies and cinnamon yes i was afraid to feel this strongly for you for anyone because what happened between anthony and meвђ she waited a moment surprised that there was no pain now only sadness i had believed him everything he said everything he promised me when i discovered he made many of the same promises to other women i was crushed we argued and he sent me away like a child who had displeased him a few weeks later i discovered i was pregnant i was thrilled i could only think that i was carrying anthonys child and that when i told him he would see that we belonged together then i told him spence reached for her hand without a word it was not as i had imagined he was angry the things he saidвђ it doesnt matter she went on he didnt want me he didnt want the child in those few moments i grew up years he wasnt the man i had wanted him to be but i had the child i wanted that baby her fingers tightened on his i so desperately wanted that baby what did you do the only thing i could there could be no dancing now i left the company and went home i know it was a burden for my parents but they stood by me i got a job in a department store selling toys she smiled at that it must have been difficult for you he tried to imagine her a teenager pregnant deserted by the father of her child struggling to hold it all together yes it was it was also a wonderful time my body changed after the first month or two when i felt so fragile i began to feel strong so strong i would sit in bed at night and read books on babies and birthing i would ask mama dozens of questions i knitвђbadly she said with a quiet laugh papa built a bassinet and mama sewed a white skirt with pink and blue ribbons it was beautiful she felt the tears well up and shook her head could i have some water he rose and filling a glass from the tap set it beside her take your time natasha because he knew they both needed it he stroked her hair you dont have to tell me everything at once i need to she sipped slowly waiting for him to sit down again i called her lily she murmured she was so lovely so tiny and soft i had no idea it was possible to love anything anyone the way you love a child i would watch her sleep for hours so thrilled so awed that she had come from me the tears were falling now soundlessly one fell onto the back of her hand it was hot that summer and i would take her out in this little carriage to get air and sunshine people would stop to look at her she hardly cried and when i nursed her she would put a hand on my breast and watch me with those big eyes you know what it is you have freddie i know theres nothing like having a child or losing one natasha said softly it was so quick she was only five weeks old i woke up in the morning surprised that she had slept through the night my breasts were full of milk the bassinet was by my bed i reached down for her picked her up at first i didnt understand didnt believeвђ she broke off to press her hands to her eyes i remember screaming and screamingвђrachel rushing up out of the next bed the rest of the family running inвђmama taking her from me the silent tears turned to weeping her face now covered by her hands she let go in a way she usually only allowed herself in private there was nothing he could say nothing to be said instead of searching for meaningless words he rose to crouch beside her and gather her into his arms the passion of her grief held sway then on a half sob she turned and clung to him accepting comfort her hands were fisted against his back gradually they relaxed as he kept her close the hot tears slowed and the pain now shared eased im all right she managed at length pulling away she began to fumble in her bag for a tissue spence took it from her to dry her cheeks himself the doctor called it crib death no reason she said as she closed her eyes once more that was somehow worse not knowing why not being sure if i could have stopped it no he took both her hands and she opened her eyes dont do that listen to me i can only imagine what it would be like to go through what you went through but i know that when truly horrible things happen its usually out of our control it took me a long time to accept what i can never understand she turned over her hands in his a long time to start living again going back to work finally moving here starting my business i think i would have died without my family she gave herself a moment sipping the water to cool her dry throat i didnt want to love anyone again then there was you and freddie we need you natasha and you need us yes she took his hand to press it to her lips i want you to understand spence when i learned i was pregnant it all came flying back at me i tell you i dont think i could survive going through that again im so afraid to love this child and i already do come here he lifted her to her feet keeping her hands locked tight in his i know that you loved lily and that youll always love her and grieve for her so will i now what happened before cant be changed but this is a different place a different time a different child i want you to understand that were going to go through this pregnancy the birth and the rearing together whether you want me or not im afraid then well be afraid together and when this baby is eight and rides a twowheeler for the first time well be afraid together her lips trembled into a smile when you say it i can almost believe it believe it he bent to kiss her because its a promise yes its time for promises her smile grew i love you it was so easy to say it now so easy to feel it will you hold me on one condition he rubbed away a drying tear with his thumb i want to tell freddie shes expecting a baby brother or sister i think it would make a great christmas present for her yes she felt stronger surer i want us to tell her all right youve got five days five days for what to make whatever plans you want to make to arrange to have your family come down buy a dress whatever you need to do to get ready for the wedding butвђ no buts he framed her face with his hands and silenced her i love you i want you youre the best thing to come into my life since freddie and i dont intend to lose you weve made a child natasha watching her he laid a hand on her stomach gently possessive a child i want a child i already love in a gesture of trust she placed her hand on his i wont be afraid if youre with me we have a date here christmas eve im going to wake up christmas morning with my wife she steadied herself by putting her hands on his forearms just like that just like that with a laugh she threw her arms around his neck and said one word yes epilogue contents prev next christmas eve was the most beautiful day in the year as far as natasha was concerned it was a time to celebrate life and love and family the house was quiet when she came in she was drawn to the tree and the light she sent an angel spinning on one branch then turned to study the room on the table there was a papiermгўchг reindeer with only one ear compliments of freddies secondgrade art class beside it stood a pudgy snowman holding a lantern an exquisite porcelain crгёche was displayed on the mantel beneath it hung four stockings a fire crackled in the grate a year before she had stood before the fire and promised to love honor and cherish they had been the easiest promises she had ever had to keep now this was her home home she took a deep breath to draw in the scents of pine and candles it was so good to be home lastminute shoppers had crowded the fun house until late in the afternoon now there was only family mama freddie raced in trailing a bright red ribbon youre home im home laughing natasha scooped her up to spin her around we took vera to the airport so she can spend christmas with her sister then we watched the planes daddy said when you got home wed have dinner then sing christmas carols daddys absolutely right natasha draped the ribbon over freddies shoulder whats this im wrapping a present all by myself its for you for me what is it i cant tell you yes you can watch she dropped onto the couch to run her fingers along freddies ribs itll be easy she said as freddie squealed and squirmed torturing the child again spence commented from the doorway daddy springing up freddie raced to him i didnt tell i knew i could count on you funny face look who woke up he bounced a baby on his hip here brandon madly in love freddie passed up the ribbon so that he could play with it its pretty just like you at six months young brandon kimball was chubby rosycheeked and delighted with the world in general he clutched the ribbon in one hand and reached for freddies hair with the other walking over natasha held out her arms such a big boy she murmured as her son reached for her gathering him close she pressed a kiss to his throat so beautiful he looks just like his mother spence stroked a hand over brandons thick black curls as if he approved of the statement brandon let out a gurgling laugh when he wriggled natasha set him down to crawl on the rug its his first christmas natasha watched him scoot over to torment one of the cats and saw lucy dart under the sofa shes no fool natasha thought happily and our second he turned natasha into his arms happy anniversary natasha kissed him once then twice have i told you today that i love you not since i called you this afternoon much too long ago she slipped her arms around his waist i love you thank you for the most wonderful year of my life youre very welcome he glanced over her head only long enough to see that freddie had prevented brandon from pulling an ornament from a low branch but its only going to get better do you promise he smiled and lowered his mouth to hers again absolutely freddie stopped crawling with brandon to watch them a baby brother had turned out to be nice after all but she was still holding out for that baby sister she smiled as she saw her parents embrace maybe next christmas
