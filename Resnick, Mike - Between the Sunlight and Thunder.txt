between the sunlight and the thunder by mike resnick august between the bright sunlight of east africas safari countries and the ominous thunder coming out of the republic of south africa there exist four nations zimbabwe mozambique malawi and botswana we had originally hoped to visit all four on this extended safari but mozambique is in the throes of a brutal civil war so we confined ourselves to the other three countries where i would be researching purgatory and ophir a pair of novels ill be writing in the next couple of years and hopefully coming up with some more ideas this was a unique safari for us in that we did not arrange to go with a single guide as we always do in kenya nor did we care to join a package tour instead we made a list of all the locations we wanted to see in all three countries then hunted up a travel agency that was able to arrange our itinerary the first step as always was the hour flight to london during which time i did my best not to feel bitter over losing the hugo after leading for the first five ballots i didnt quite pull it off august we landed at gatwick at seven in the morning took a bus to heathrow after clearing customs and waited around the airport for almost hours for our hour flight to zimbabwe to take off i love africa its the process of getting there that i hate august we landed in harare the capital of zimbabwe formerly rhodesia and dragged our exhausted bodies to meikles hotel a large luxury hotel in the city center right across from cecil square while carol took a nap i went out walking and found that there is an enormous difference between harare and its kenyan counterpart nairobi one gets the feeling that if the tourist industry vanished of the people you see in nairobi would find themselves out of work whereas if it vanished from harare no one would know the difference which is a roundabout way of saying that harare is a working city with very little to interest the casual tourist in fact we soon came to realize that zimbabwe is a working country president robert mugabe continually gives lip service to communism but its a capitalist country from top to bottom and unlike most african countries it works the roads are all paved the electricity works around the clock the water is safe to drink there are schools every couple of miles throughout the countryside poachers have made almost no inroads in most of the game parks and unemployment doesnt seem to be much of a problem in fact i would say that zimbabwe is as welldeveloped and runs as smoothly as most eastern european nations i realize that doesnt sound like much but when you compare it to kenya or tanzania or zambia its a quantum leap forward i signed copies of ivory and paradise in a local bookstore then returned to meikles and changed for dinner we ate at the bagatelle a star dining room in the hotel where in a delightful twist the proprietors were black and the piano player was white august when i checked out in the morning i presented meikles with a paid voucher which they refused to accept evidently they had been paid in zimbabwean dollars and because the country is so starved for hard currency they have a law stating that all foreign travelers must pay in their own currency so i very begrudgingly paid for my room for a second time and made a mental note to bill the travel agency we had decided to begin our safari in botswana formerly bechuanaland but because we would be flying around the country in seaters with severe weight limitations we first flew to the victoria falls hotel where we left some of our luggage the hotel itself is an old colonial structure that reminded me of some of the better british hotels in the brighton area we had seen a sign in the victoria falls airport telling us that we must report at least an hour early for international flights or run the risk of having our seats sold our flight to botswana was due to leave at in the afternoon and the bus from the hotel didnt leave until a number of people who were taking the flight panicked and began offering up to to anyone who would drive them to the airport and get them there by since the flight is scheduled three times a week we figured that the hotel hadnt received any complaints about it and waited for the bus it got us there at about and the botswana plane didnt show up for another two hours par for the course the flight attendant later admitted the flight to maun botswana took perhaps an hour and shortly thereafter we were ensconced in rileys hotel which has a long and colorful history from colonial times but has become a rather dull hostelry in the middle of a rather dull town september when i stopped by the desk to hand in my voucher they announced that they had no record of a previous payment and i would have to pay for the room at this point i hit the roof faxed the travel agency in york and raised bloody hell they assured me that we would have no further problems with our vouchers and they were right which is not to say that we had no further problems in other areas we went to the airport maun consists of nothing but the airport three gift shops a few houses a few huts and rileys and took our chartered seater to jedibe island camp in the heart of the okavango delta where after more than days we finally stopped traveling and started vacationing jedibe is a small island with ten tents two ablution blocks a euphemism for bathrooms which consist of a toilet and a shower surrounded by a rather shakey reed fence and no roof a bar and a dining tent its run by tony and pam a second generation kenyan and zambian respectively who migrated down to okavango when their own countries got too civilized and there was only one other guest there when we arrived if there is a better way to decompress after a long trip than riding in a mokoro i dont know what it is the mokoro is a dugout canoe and while you sit up front and watch the okavango go by a strong young man stands at the back and poles you along we went out in mokoros in midmorning and stayed out until dinnertime carol the bird expert in the family tells me it was the best single day of birdwatching shes ever experienced the okavango delta is some square miles of swamp with about miles of very narrow winding channels by the time we were twenty minutes out from camp i figured that left to my own devices i might with luck be able to find my way back in something less than eight months yet our polers always seemed to know exactly where they were and you got the feeling you could set them down anywhere in the okavango and theyd be able to find their way home with no problem i remarked about that to pam who agreed that they were death and taxes in the okavango but added that three of them went to johannesburg for christmas and got hopelessly lost in half an hour september we went out on a powerboat in order to see more of the swamp mokoros are many things but fast isnt one of them packed a box lunch which we ate on a totally uninhabited island and returned to camp in time to meet franco and masimo a pair of italians who work for mondedori my italian publisher and were making a documentary film about the okavango masimo a perfectionist had wanted an overhead shot of the delta and refused to photograph it through the window of the plane so they opened the door and he and his camera hung out upside down while franco held onto his feet the result exceptional footage and an exceptional innerear infection they also wanted footage of a fish eagle swooping down and snaring a fish out of the water tony had trained a local fish eagle to do just that when baited and we went along while the fish eagle went through his paces about a dozen times and we all got some fabulous footage that night i went to the ablution block at about midnight while i was there a hippo came out of the swamp and began rubbing his sides against the reed wall hippos have killed more tourists in africa during the past quarter century than any other animal and the reason is simple they panic when they are cut off from water and the very best time to photograph a hippo is when he goes inland to eat as otherwise all youre likely to see are his eyes ears and nostrils they stay in the water to protect their sensitive skins from the sun all day but at night they leave the water and consume up to pounds of vegetation stand between a hippo and water and his first inclination is to run through not around you to get back to the safety of his pond or river now jedibe is a very small island perhaps yards in diameter so i reasoned it out and concluded that if i left the ablution block all the hippo had to do was turn around and he could make a beeline to the water then i got to thinking and decided that if he was an exceptionally stupid hippo then no matter where i stood he would conclude that i was between him and the water so i stayed another half hour until he want away and promptly bumped into a bushbuck on the way back to the tent bushbucks are much more intelligent than hippos he took one look and me and ran like hell september our bush pilot lee picked us up in midmorning and flew us to tsaro lodge in the moremi reserve pam remarked that lee had stuck it out much longer than most bush pilots something like seven years now because he liked the social life in maun i am still mulling over this remark because to my way of thinking maun is the kind of place you leave in order to have a social life oh well tsaro is a luxurious camp nestled on the khwai river composed of eight large spotlesslyclean chalets each equipped with beds chairs couches fireplaces tiled bathrooms and electricity all rarities in the bush the current manager jack used to be a game warden in zimbabwe and i gather the place has undergone massive renovations since he arrived there were three couples from cape town there when we arrived and they turned out to be the friendliest and most interesting people we met on the entire safari in fact when we go to south africa which we plan to do in a couple of years each of them has insisted that we stay with them and let them show us around we took a game run in the afternoon and were actually charged by an irate cow elephant a hell of an exciting ten seconds that i managed to capture on videotape september after a morning game run carol and i and two of our cape town friends decided to take a walk through the hunting concession that borders the reserve we saw some birds and a herd of red lewche and some bushbuck and then we walked around a heavy stand of trees and damned near bumped into a lone elephant its difficult to say who was more surprised it is not difficult to say who retreated more rapidly a german couple showed up in late afternoon it turns out that this was their th wedding anniversary and they had brought along champagne for the whole camp its amazing what you can have in the bush if your timing is right september we took a morning game run then got picked up by our social lion pilot and flown to the linyanti channel where we were met and driven to linyanti camp another primitive bush camp with tents and outdoor bathrooms this one was run by ron a devoted birder and his wife hillary they had a monthold baby who was so quiet we didnt know he was there until bedtime when ron picked up his rifle and led the way to his rather distant cabin while hillary followed him pushing a baby carriage not quite your everyday african sight we arrived just as a large party well as large a party as a seventent camp can handle anyway was leaving and had the camp all to ourselves for a day in the afternoon we went out on the channel in a doubledecker pontoon drifted into namibia for an hour and saw a bunch of birds and a handful of elephants still the linyanti area was a disappointment the camp backs up to the river and is surrounded on three sides by a hunting concession and the place is pretty much shot out the top of the food chain both in mammals and birds was gone there was just nothing left for them to eat at dinnertime we were joined by derek joubert a national geographic filmmaker who had a permanent camp a few miles away i have a couple of his documentaries on videotape which pleased him no end and i remarked on the similarity of his name to that of keith joubert a renowned wildlife artist whose prints of the big five carol had bought me for my birthday last march it turned out that they were brothers and that keith the only man ever to paint a portrait of the kilimanjaro elephant which he did from the figures in rowland wards record book the elephant itself having died almost a century ago had read and enjoyed ivory which is based on the elephant september we had a very disappointing game run in the morning not much is still alive and moving in linyanti but i made up for it by coming up with a couple of short story ideas that ill be writing in the next few months in the afternoon some more guests showed up including a rather adventuresome american girl who works for a bank with international connections and has spent time representing them in peru chile poland and hong kong how adventuresome well this spring she flew to antarctica for a week as a guest of the chilean air force we also met the ultimate ugly american a new york lady who didnt stop talking for the next six hours had nothing good to say about anyone or anything and made us realize why so many people intensely dislike americans fortunately she came down with a sore throat at dinnertime and we didnt have to listen to her the rest of the night september after a hour walk in search of game that simply didnt exist we happily took our leave of linyanti and went next to the most luxurious hostelry in africa yeah i know ive said in print that that honor belongs to the mount kenya safari club so sue me i was wrong the chobe game lodge has it beat all hollow chobe national park is the crown jewel of botswanas parks it possesses elephants almost three times the total that remain in all of kenya it has buffalo in herds of up to it has hundreds of lions it also has the chobe game lodge we had arranged to stay in the same suite where richard burton and liz taylor honeymooned after their second marriage it was immense elegant airconditioned and it had a foot terrace and its own private swimming pool so private in fact that we never bothered with our swimsuits after all those days of tents and outdoor bathrooms it was so luxurious that it took a real effort of will power to leave long enough to look at animals the food was on a par with the accomodations our first night there dinner consisted of eggs florentine as an appetizer ragout of impala as a main course and trifle with custard sauce for dessert lunch was a buffet that covered five tables with so many delicacies that you could go on tilt trying to pick and choose from among them there were numerous lounges and bars a fabulous outdoor dining terrace the best gift shop wed seen in the country and there was even a room with a largescreen tv and a selection of videotapes each a documentary on some aspect of botswana and its wildlife the chobe lodge is much the largest lodge in botswana though it holds less than people and is at best mediumsized by east african standards the reason for this is that botswana which is kalahari desert and which nobody seemed to want not britain not south africa not anybody suddenly discovered the worlds two largest diamond mines in the early s as a result they have more money than they need and have decided to keep their tourist industry small rather than ecologically degrade their parks by running too many cars and tourists through them we took a boat out on the chobe river in the afternoon and watched as hundreds of elephants and thousands of buffalo came down to drink then picked our way among the hippos and crocs and returned to our suite wondering why we had bothered with all those other locations when we could have spent the entire botswana section of our safari right here september another day of luxury punctuated with a pair of game runs in the morning we managed to find a pride of lions on a kill and to see some cheetahs which are quite rare in these parts in the afternoon we saw literally thousands of elephants as well as or other species of mammals as well as one of the lions from the morning carrying a buffalo leg in her mouth as proudly as a puppy carries a toy its a damned good thing we did too as i deeply resented any time spent away from that suite dinner was freshlycaught bream kudu in cream sauce and good old hot fudge sundaes im a teetotaler but carol tells me the wine was superb september another morning game run and the elephant and buffalo were so numerous than i was beginning to feel jaded then we got into a van and were driven some miles to the victoria falls hotel in zimbabwe where we picked up the luggage we had stored there checked into a room and promptly slept the afternoon away we woke up just in time for their nightly spectacular a lavish pageant of native dances which turned out to be more authentic and less touristoriented that we had feared september we stopped by a native crafts village not knowing quite what to expect and were pleasantly surprised to find that it too was more educational than touristoriented from there we went to the falls truly one of the wonders of the world the zambezi river was the lowest its been in years which actually was to our benefit as when the river is high the falls create such a spray that you cant make out the features let alone photograph them we took the muchhyped sundowner cruise in the afternoon very disappointing if youre not heavily into booze the boat never got near the falls and most of the passengers were three sheets to the wind before the cruise even started september we took a noontime flight to hwange national park where we were escorted to the hwange game lodge perhaps half a star down in luxury from the chobe game lodge though we had requested a room we were given an enormous suite at no extra cost upon leaving i asked the manager why he replied that it was sitting empty he had recognized my name on the guest list he had read ivory and paradise and adventures and since i was obviously on a research trip he hoped that i would remember him kindly when i got around to writing a novel about zimbabwe our guide was a young man named mark who asked what we would like to see that afternoon well i said giving him what i thought would be a totally impossible task we havent yet seen sable roan kudu or rhino within minutes we had seen them all plus a couple of hundred elephants and some exceptionally rare eagles this is some park this hwange its the largest in zimbabwe and has just about every species of mammal you could wish for its also paved something that i thought existed nowhere outside of south africas krueger national park and the rangers have created a number of huge artificial water holes so that the game doesnt migrate the park is immaculate you would swear they mow and rake it every day and except for tanzanias ngorongoro crater we have never seen such a large number and variety of animals in one place dinner eland and impala in exquisite sauces was superb as were all the various services provided by the lodge and it is our conclusion that as luxurious as the block lodges in kenya are the sun chain in zimbabwe consisting of hwange the victoria falls hotel the monomatapa the montclair the troutbeck inn and half a dozen others is even moreso the staffs are courteous and expertlytrained the food is worldclass and the accomodations are usually equal to anything you can find in new york or london for those of you who want to see africa in absolute luxury where the words rough it do not exist just mosey down to zimbabwe and make the circuit of sun hotels september two more fabulous game runs three more fabulous meals and a lot of loafing in our suite after dinner we walked out to a spotlighted waterhole about a quartermile away climbed up to a bar that was perched on stilts overlooking it and spent the next couple of hours watching and photographing an endless procession of animals as they came down to drink september we took a morning game run then stayed around the lodge until our midafternoon flight to lake kariba kariba is a manmade lake more than miles long miles wide and in places feet deep when it was created some years ago it literally put a dent in the earth but unlike most projects of this type it didnt foul up the ecosystem it not only provides power for most of zimbabwe and zambia it is also the biggest damned reservoir you ever saw as well as a huge vacation area bringing in all kinds of hard currency they also stocked the lake with fish left them alone for a few years while they grew fruitful and multiplied and now pull some eight tons of fish per day out of it we knew all this before we got there but until you fly over the lake until you look out both windows of your plane and see that water extending almost to infinity you cant begin to appreciate the magnitude of the project if the victoria falls are an aweinspiring work of god lake kariba is an equally aweinpiring work of man we arrived at the caribbea bay hotel probably the least impressive member of the sun chain in late afternoon and while carol was unpacking i scouted around to find us a restaurant and came up with pedros in the basement of the hotel an authentic mexican restaurant in the heart of africa september in the morning we took a ferry to the sanyati lodge on the far side of the lake the landscape far from being the flat land that usually leads up to a lakeshore was formerly the tops of some mountains and we climbed about steps up to our cabin which had a gorgeous view of the sanyati gorge a channel between two mountain tops that rose up out of the water our hosts were hans a former farmer who carol declares is the best birder shes even met and his new bride diana we asked diana to radio ahead and find out what time we had to catch a charter plane to our next destination chikwenya camp in the mana pools reserve she did so and reported that because of some foul up we had been scheduled to arrive at mana pools on august not september and that chikwenya was sold out we told her to tell them we had paid vouchers and planned to show up anyway and it was their job to find someplace to put us they reluctantly agreed and diana mentioned in passing that sanyati had been unable to reconfirm our arrival but since they had been paid in advance had simply set aside our cabin and assumed we were coming since sanyati is a mountaintop surrounded on all sides by water game drives and walks were out of the question and we selected from among a number of boats that hans had the seascape was positively unearthly tops of thousands of trees poked up out of the water and because it was in the mids the evaporation caused a haze that obscured the horizon certainly no alien world could appear more exotic than this and i will find a way to appropriate it for one of my books we went along the coast of the matusadona national park and saw thousands of animals drinking and walking along the shoreline then went back and climbed all those damned stairs again i had just gotten to sleep when wellington the camp cat decided he would enjoy mousing my toes a processs that continued all night since my own cats nick and nora find endless fascination in keeping me awake i felt right at home september we took two rides in a pontoon a morning ride into the sanyati gorge itself an afternoon ride to matusadona where we got within ten yards of five bull elephants who spent almost an hour bathing and frolicking in the water wellington felt deserted and bit harder than usual during the night september we flew up to mana pools in the zambezi valley where we were driven to chikwenya camp and found out that two couples who were arriving by canoe had run up against a hard current and would be two days late which meant that we got our accomodation after all this was a bush camp to end all bush camps elephants felt free to wander through it at all times of the day and night and while we have frequently had small lizards in our tents actually a beneficial circumstance since they eat insects this was the first time we ever shared our quarters with a snake our hosts were jeff and veronica stutchbury jeff is quite famous in these parts having been the very first game warden at the south luangwa valley national park in zambia and has had numerous articles and photographs published in wildlife journals their three sons also make a living from wildlife one as a photographer one as a painter and one as a documentary filmmaker jeff was probably the most knowledgable guide weve ever been out with he was unquestionably the most eccentric he found beauty in every living thing knew the natural history of everything we saw and had the attention span of a weekold puppy some game runs never got more than yards from camp as jeff would find an exotic tree and explain its workings for hours others would take us far afield and run for four or five hours driving veronica and her kitchen staff crazy jeff and his associate david never went anywhere without their rifles which they explained were never used against game but were reserved for poachers mana pools is the park where most of the rhino wars have occurred so far theyve killed over zambian pochers in two years unfortunately theyre breaking about even one poacher per lost rhino since theyve only got about black rhinos left in the whole country and there are ten million hungry zambians across the zambezi river the mathematics of the situation dont look promising september we took a boat down the zambezi to the one sight carol has always wanted to see a colony of nesting carmine beeeaters even i a nonbirder couldnt help but be impressed by colorful birds flocking and nesting in thousands of holes along the high banks of the river then when it was time to return for breakfast jeff decided to take a little walk around an island a mileincircumference island we ran into buffalo and kudu and elephant and got home just before noon i thought veronica was going to kill him although he does this every three or four days and she really ought to be used to it by now in the states hed be the kind of guy who walked down the driveway to fetch the paper disappeared for three weeks and couldnt understand why everyone was so upset when he finally showed up one of the guests was an elderly lady from texas who had come to zimbabwe to judge a cattle show and decided to see a little of the country before leaving if she was interested in anything beside cattle and barbeque sauce she kept it a secret she continually walked away from camp on her own and this camp was surrounded by more wild animals than any within memory she wore sweaters and pantyhose in degree weather and she complained nonstop finally her longsuffering companion simply locked her in her cabin for the afternoon and a golden silence descended upon the rest of chikwenya september we were a little late arriving at the landing strip elephants blocked our way for half an hour but the plane waited for us dropped us off at lake kariba and from there we caught a flight back to harare where this time meikles hotel honored our voucher it had been excactly three weeks since we were there and the change was electrifying all the jacarandas were in bloom and the whole city was a riot of spring color i celebrated getting away from our snake and our outdoor plumbing by taking two showers donning a coat and tie and having lobster thermidor at the bagatelle september this morning we picked up a car and driver for the remainder of our stay in zimbabwe the car was a seminew mitsubishi the driver was lazarus a somber type who could find something depressing about winning the irish sweepstakes we drove from harare to the inyanga mountains in the east of the country and as we began ascending them the fog closed in around us to the point where we could barely see ten yards ahead we finally reached the montclair hotel at about noon checked in and decided to spend the rest of the day loafing and reading rather than driving on narrow winding mountain roads with almost no visibility the montclair is an elegant englishstyle hotel with a dart room a billiard room a gambling casino a riding stable tennis courts a swimming pool two fine restaurants and the strangestlooking staff youd ever want to see each of them and there were a hell of a lot of them was bald and bearded when we asked about it lazarus explained that they were members of a pentecostal sect that thought shaving their heads but not their faces brought them a bit closer to heaven september we were still socked in with fog when i awoke but i didnt feel like spending another day doing nothing even a highquality nothing such as the hotel offered so i told lazarus to meet me at and wed try to drive around a bit carol took one look out the window and told me that she was staying inside when we got two miles away from the montclair the air became crystal clear and we realized that the mountains werent covered by fog after all what had happened was that a cloud had come to rest exactly atop the montclair we drove back got carol and spent the rest of the day sightseeing in the mountains we saw cecil rhodes mountain home and the rhodes museum and worlds view and a reconstruction of an ancient village and one of the worlds more dangerous golf courses hit the ball in the water and you get eaten by crocs hit it in the trees and you get eaten by leopards overshoot the green and you fall feet to your death we ate lunch at the troutbeck inn then drove to some waterfalls where we had to climb part of a mountain and walk out on a very precarious ledge to see them lazarus pointed the way then locked himself in the car and waited for us convinced we would fall off the precipice and finally returned to the hotel which was still surrounded by its very own cloud september we left the montclair and its cloud behind and drove down the eastern side of the country to mutare easily the prettiest african city weve seen once there we turned off and went to la rochelle the magnificent estate of lord and lady courtauld who had willed it to zimbabwe it contains fourteen acres of the most beautiful gardens ive ever seen with numerous little streams and wooden bridges connecting the various sections from there we drove to a tiny colonial hotel the white horse inn for lunch then stopped by the vumba gardens some hectares worth of meticulouslykept flowers and greenery then we headed south for masvingo and the great zimbabwe ruins picking up a flat tire along the way we drove the final kilometers with no spare and got a second flat just as we were pulling into the great zimbabwe hotel while carol and i slept the sleep of the innocent lazarus earned his salary by hunting up some friends finding an allnight gas station and getting the car in shape before breakfast september carol and i walked a mile from the hotel to great zimbabwe the oldest and most impressive ruins in all of subsaharan africa and the structure that gave southern rhodesia its new name this was a goldtrading society that existed about a millenium ago and built a fortress with walls some feet high i spent about two hours photographing it and taking notes as it will figure prominently in one of the books ill be writing next year then when i thought we were through lazarus showed up and told us that there was an equally impressive ruin we hadnt seen yet where i asked up there he said pointing to a nearby mountain so we spent another hour climbing up to the second ruin and once i caught my breath i had to admit he was right its every bit as impressive as the one most people photograph perhaps even moreso considering that every one of its million or so stones had to be carried up the mountain we drove back to harare in the afternoon checked into meikles again they werent so sure about taking my voucher this time but eventually they relented and we spent our final night in zimbabwe pigging out on a huge tray of food we ordered from room service september we drove to the airport in early afternoon and caught a plane to lilongwe the new capital of malawi upon arriving we found the representative from soche tours which had subcontracted the malawi portion of our safari youd better hurry she said your flight to blantyre is about to leave were not flying there i said showing her our itinerary and voucher youre supplying us with a car and driver so we can see some of the countryside we are she said as the blantyre plane began coasting down the runway nobody told me eventually the ladys boyfriend volunteered to drive us the three and onehalf hours to blantyre it was dark before we left lilongwe so much for sightseeing as we were driving we noticed that there were absolutely no lights on the right side of the road and asked joey our driver about it the answer was chilling in its simplicity the road was the border between malawi and mozambique and if you so much as lit a match on the right side of the road you were likely to get your head blown off by a rebel before you could bring it up to your cigarette so for two hours we hugged the lefthand side of the road and hoped nobody felt like shooting a car you cant imagine the relief we felt when we turned east and finally saw lights on both sides of the road joey left us off at the mount soche hotel our room was on the fourth of its five floors which turned out to be the only floor the idiosyncratic elevator didnt stop at not the most auspicious beginning september soche tours got its act together long enough to introduce us to mike makwakwa a young man who would be our driver for the rest of the safari we decided to start with a little tour around blantyre as we drove through the city we noted that a number of buildings were decorated with red stars mike explained that each star marked the home or business of an indian and that they had been slated for destruction or renovation we also found out that all the indians who form the merchant class in almost every subsaharan country had been forcibly relocated in just three malawiian cities blantyre lilongwe and zomba most of the buildings with red stars were in far better condition that those without and i couldnt help remembering what happened the last time a government decided to mark buildings owned by an ethnic minority with stars the only difference was the color yellow then red now i would not want to be an indian living in malawi in the coming months and years malawi by the way is ruled by a dictator who bears the title of president for life hastings kamuzu banda banda left the country as a child spent more than a half century in england and the usa and was called back in when independence seemed imminent as he was the only malawiian with a college degree and they needed a figurehead president they drafted a model constitution and assumed that once they got the hang of self government banda would step down in a couple of years if he hadnt died of old age all that was a quarter of a century ago banda killed and jailed his enemies had himself proclaimed president for life made sure no foreign entity could start a business in malawi unless he banda owned of the stock and developed what are considered to be the most efficient death squads south of the sahara he is years old speaks no language but english and has become a hideous caricature of the man who came to dinner in other words he aint leaving that having been said i must also point out that tourists are treated with enormous courtesy and deference to the very uncomfortable point of being called master by most of the waiters and porters since we represent a source of hard currency and every effort is made to shield us from what is really going on there i had been warned not to mention i was a writer the government does not differentiate between fiction writers and journalists and in bandas opinion the only good journalist is a journalist who is rotting in a malawi prison the press is as thoroughly controlled as any ive ever seen each days newspaper is the same the front page has two long articles praising banda the next five pages consist of quarterpage ads by major businesses proclaiming long live kamuzu and if youre lucky you can find a paragraph or two about iraq and south africa somewhere on page this is followed by another dozen pages of ads thanking god for president banda the country is physically the most beautiful of all the african nations weve visited and the people are the sweetest and friendliest most of them literally worship banda but that stands to reason of them are under years of age which means theyve been subjected to his propoganda every day of their lives after touring the city we drove through the tea country to mount mulanje the tallest mountain in malawi and drove almost to the top stopping along the way to look at a couple of waterfalls in the afternoon we stopped by the citys zoo which seemed to specialize in american turtles and the museum of malawi which had some interesting relics from the nations recent and distant history the museums guide believes devoutly in witchcraft but that little idiosyncracy aside gave us a thorough and fascinating private tour we returned to the mount soche hotel for dinner in their upscale penthouse restaurant then returned to our room the bathroom was unique most toilets in the world operate by levers this one required you to push a button with about footpounds of force carols comment flushing that damned toilet is the most exercise ive had all week september we drove to the city of zomba the former colonial capital lilongwe is a brandnew city with huge impressive buildings erected with foreign aid that was thrown at banda for opposing communism an easy thing to do since there isnt a communist in the entire country then drove up a long winding road to the top of the zomba plateau from which one could see practically the entire country then it was off to the shire river and a pontoon ride through the liwonde national park finally we drove to club makakola a beach resort on lake malawi where we would be spending the next two nights and where we were informed that our voucher from soche tours was for the nearby nkopola lodge i saw a bunch of keys on the wall and asked if they had any empty rondovals lots they said do you want our money i asked sure they said then get those bastards at soche tours on the phone and let me yell at them for seconds i said they did so and seconds later soche tours transferred our money from nkopola to club makakola everyone in the african travel industry is friendly and polite but efficiency is not their long and strong suit especially in seldomvisited malawi september club makakola was very much like a caribbean beach resort but with different and more bird life in the morning carol and i rented a catamaran and its crew and spent the next three hours on lake malawi we visited the aptlynamed bird island stopped by some fishing villages and cruised by the american embassys superluxury beach house then spent the rest of the day loafing on the beach september we drove through the highlands stopping here and there to take pictures and talk to the locals passed through lilongwe at noon and headed north to our final destination the lifupa lodge at kusungu national park just before reaching it we passed by a fairytale palace a glistening white building which could easily accomodate a worldcon it turned out to be bandas newest home which overlooked a few hundred mud huts occupied by his loyal subjects kasungu was sad the park which as recently as two years ago possessed a truly magnificent selection of game has been almost totally poached out the elephant population estimated at in is less than there are no rhinos left and while the zambian poachers were busy collecting ivory and rhino horns the hungry hordes of malawiians who surround the park poached most of the other animals for meat the death knell was sounding while we were there a crew of six international tsetse fly abatement experts were busy eradicating the last flies from the park at which time nothing on earth will stop the local subsistence farmers and cattle herders from encroaching on the parks boundaries id be surprised if it still exists ten years from now september we took two game runs hiring a local ranger and a fourwheeldrive vehicle and making a note to bill soche tours for it since we had already paid for it months earlier a fact that no one except carol and i seemed aware of in six hours with a guide who knew the park inside out we saw one large herd of buffalo a few roan antelope small herds of impala and zebra and a lone elephant less than we might expect to see five minutes into a game drive in hwange chobe mana pools or moremi our rondoval was quite large and absolutely immaculate until we inspected the shower which was so filthy that we elected to remain dirty until we reached london september we spent the morning watching hippos and birds from the porch of our rondoval then got into the car and drove to lilongwe where we had lunch at the capital hotel the only worldclass accomodation in the country and went to the airport where we were frisked and our luggage was searched the airport bookstore had a huge display of santiago and ivory i was about to mention that i was the author and ask the proprietor if he wanted any copies autographed then i remembered where i was and thought better of it still for all its problems malawi proved to be more fertile ground for story ideas than zimbabwe and botswana and bits and pieces of it will be turning up in my books and stories for some years to come which is not to imply that we didnt both breathe hearty sighs of relief as the plane took off september we landed at heathrow took a bus to gatwick and checked into the gatwick hilton where we spend the rest of the day alternately showering and sleeping october we landed in cincinnati in midafternoon and i immediately bought a newspaper and turned to the sports section the reds had just clinched the national league west and the bengals were unbeaten in their first three games the reds promptly dropped games in the next hours and the bengals lost their first game of the year that night as i write this i am waiting for the management of both teams to phone me and offer to pay my way back to africa so they can start winning again i can hardly wait to take them up on it
