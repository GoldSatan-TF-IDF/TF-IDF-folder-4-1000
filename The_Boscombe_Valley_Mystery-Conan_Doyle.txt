one morning i was having breakfast with my wife when a telegram arrived it was from sherlock holmes it read are you free for a day or two must go to the west of england to help with the boscombe pool murder shall be glad if you can come with me the change will be good for us leaving paddington station on the train will you go said my wife looking across at me i really dont know what to say i answered i have a lot of sick people to visit anstruther can do your work for you you are looking tired and i think a change from your work will be good for you you are always so interested in mr holmess cases as always you are right my dear but if i do go i must get ready immediately because the train leaves in half an hour my early life as a soldier taught me to travel with very few things in a few minutes i was on my way to paddington station there i found my old friend in his long grey coat and his favourite hat he was walking up and down the platform it is really very good of you to come watson he said i need a friend like you at times like this no one can help me as you can please keep two corner places and i shall buy the tickets we were alone during the train journey holmes had a large number of newspapers with him and for much of the time he wrote and thought finally he made the papers into a very large ball and threw them away keeping only one have you heard anything about this case he asked no nothing i have not seen a newspaper for some days the london papers have not written much about it i have read them all because i need to know all the facts it seems to be one of those cases which looks very clear that is why i think it will be difficult isnt that strange oh no cases which seem very easy like this one are often the hardest i find but just now things look very serious for the son of the murdered man so you are sure that it is a murder not yet it seems to be but i must believe nothing until i have studied all the facts now i shall explain in a few words what i have read boscombe valley is near ross in herefordshire a large part of the land there belongs to a mr john turner he made a lot of money in australia and returned to live in england some years ago his neighbour mr charles mccarthy was also in australia and lives at hatherley a farm which belongs to turner the two men first met in australia and it is natural that they have chosen to live in the same neighbourhood turner is the richer man and it seems that mccarthy pays him for the use of his farm they seem to be good friends and spend quite a lot of their time together mccarthy has one son who is eighteen years old and turner has a daughter who is about the same age the wives of both men are dead the two families lived quietly and did not mix much with other people mccarthy had two servants but turner in his big house has several more about six that is all i have been able to find out about these families what about the murder then i asked dont hurry me watson just listen i am coming to that last monday june charles mccarthy went t–æ the town of ross with his servant this was in the morning while he was there he told his servant to hurry because he had an important meeting with someone at three oclock that afternoon they drove back quickly to his house at hatherley just before three oclock mccarthy left the farmhouse and walked down alone to boscombe pool he never came back it is a quarter of a mile from hatherley farm to boscombe pool and two different people saw him as he walked that way one was an old woman but we do not know her name the other was a manservant of mr turner called william crowder both people say that mccarthy was alone the servant also says that a few minutes after he saw mccarthy go past he also saw his son mr james mccarthy going the same way he had a gun under his arm the son could see his father and was following him but crowder the servant thought nothing of this until he heard of mccarthys death later that evening you explain it all so clearly i said i have told you to listen dear doctor when i have finished you can say what you like i shall continue another person saw the two mccarthys after william crowder the land around boscombe pool is full of trees with a little grass in the open parts beside the water a girl of fourteen patience moran was picking flowers among the trees that afternoon she saw mr mccarthy and his son close to the lake they both seemed to be very angry she heard mr mccarthy using strong language to his son she saw the young man lift up his arm he seemed ready to hit his father she felt so frightened that she ran away when she got home she told her mother about the quarrel when i saw them they seemed to be going to have a fight she said just as she was speaking young mr mccarthy came running up to their home i have just found my father by the pool he shouted he is dead we must get help he looked very excited without either his hat or his gun his right hand was red with blood immediately patiences parents went with him to the pool where they found his fathers dead body lying on the grass there were many wounds in his head made by something thick and heavy like the wooden part of the young mans gun they found this gun lying on the grass not far from the dead man the police soon came and immediately held the young man for questioning then locked him up his case will come up in a few weeks time everything points to the fact that the young man is guilty does it not i said the facts are not always what they seem answered holmes we think that they all point to the same thing but if we look at them in another way they can tell quite a different story it is true that the case against the young man is very serious and maybe he is in fact guilty but there are several people who believe that he is innocent one of these is miss turner the daughter of mccarthys neighbour she has asked detective lestrade to take on the case and now lestrade since he cannot really say no has asked me to help him that is why we are hurrying along in a train instead of having a quiet breakfast at home i am afraid that the case is so clear that no one will thank you for showing what happened i said we shall see my friend answered we both know that lestrade is not as clever as he thinks and i am sure that i shall notice some things which he has missed but there is something more to tell you when the police came to hatherley farm and took young mccarthy prisoner he said i am deeply sorry but i am not surprised i was expecting this of course that shows that he is guilty i said in no way in fact he has repeated many times that he is innocent but that is hard to believe dont you think of course not he cannot be so stupid that he does not realize the danger which he is in so he cannot be surprised that he is a prisoner clearly he is sorry that his father is dead and that they had a quarrel his feelings are quite natural i think so what story does this young man have to tell you can read it here in this newspaper said holmes he gave it to me and pointed to the right page this is what i read mr james mccarthy the son of the dead man gave the following story i was away from home for three days because i had business in bristol i came back only last monday in the morning my father was not at home when i arrived a servant told me that he was in ross on business after some time i heard the wheels of his carriage coming back i looked out of the window and saw him walking quickly away from the house i did not know where he was going i then took my gun and went for a walk i wanted to shoot some birds in the trees on the other side of boscombe pool on my way i passed william crowder as he has told you but he is wrong when he says that i was following my father i had no idea that he was in front of me when i was about a hundred yards from the pool i heard someone call cooee my father and i often used this call i hurried towards the pool and found him standing there he seemed very surprised to see me and also quite angry he asked what are you doing here i explained we began to talk and more angry words followed i became angry too i felt ready to hit him but instead i decided to leave i know that my father gets angry very quickly sometimes about things that are not important i then went back towards hatherley farm after only one hundred and fifty yards i heard a terrible scream so i ran back to the pool again i found my father on the ground he was dying there were terrible wounds on his head i dropped my gun and held him in my arms but he died almost immediately i stayed beside him for some minutes and then i made my way to the nearest house to ask for help i saw no one near my father when i returned with mr and mrs moran i have no idea how he got those wounds he was a cold man and not much liked in the neighbourhood but i do not think that he had any enemies that is all i know about this business questioner did your father say anything to you before he died mccarthy his voice was very weak he spoke a few words but i only understood something about a rat questioner what did that mean to you mccarthy it meant nothing i do not think he knew what he was saying questioner what were you talking about with your father that made him so angry mccarthy i prefer not to answer questioner i must ask you to tell us mccarthy it is not possible for me to tell you please understand that it has nothing to do with his murder questioner that is for us to decide if you do not answer you must realize that the case against you will be worse mccarthy i do not want to speak about it questioner is it true that the call of cooee was a call which you and your father used between you mccarthy yes it is questioner then why did he use it before he saw you before he even knew of your return from bristol mccarthy i do not know questioner did you see anything unusual when you ran back to find your father mccarthy nothing very clear questioner what do you mean mccarthy i was so surprised and worried that i could think only of my father but i remember that as i ran towards him i saw something on the ground to the left of me it seemed to be a piece of grey cloth a kind of coat i think when i got up i looked for it again but it was gone questioner do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help mccarthy yes it was gone questioner you cannot say what it was mccarthy no i just had a feeling that there was something there questioner how far from the body mccarthy about fifteen yards away questioner and how far was it from the trees mccarthy about the same questioner so you think that someone took it while you were only fifteen yards away mccarthy yes but i had my back towards it the questioning of mccarthy ended here looking at the newspaper i said i see that the questioner has used hard words about young mccarthy he gives importance to the fact that his father called to him before he saw him and also that he did not want to explain his quarrel with his father he tells us to remember the strange words which the dying man spoke all these things he says are very much against the son holmes laughed softly and made himself comfortable in his corner both you and the questioner have pointed to just those things which help the young mans case most dont you see that you believe him to be at the same time much too clever and not clever enough he is not very clever if he cannot explain the quarrel in some way that makes us feel sorry for him and too clever with his strange story of the rat and the cloth which disappeared no watson i shall study this case with the idea that what the young man says is true we shall see where that path takes us and now i shall not speak another word about the case until we get to ross we shall have lunch at swindon and that will be in twenty minutes then holmes took a book from his pocket and sat silently reading it was nearly four oclock when we arrived at last at the pretty little town of ross a thin man with an ugly face was waiting for us on the platform i knew immediately that this was lestrade of scotland yard we drove with him to an hotel where we took rooms i have asked for a carriage said lestrade as we sat drinking a cup of tea i know mr holmes that you will not rest until you have visited the place of the murder a carriage that was kind of you holmes answered but because of the weather i shall not need one lestrade looked surprised i do not quite understand he said there is no wind and not a cloud in the sky i have a packet of cigarettes to smoke and the chairs in this hotel are unusually comfortable i do not think that i shall need the carriage tonight lestrade gave a laugh i am sure that you have decided how this case will end from your study of the newspapers it is all quite clear and it becomes clearer with every new fact still one has to please a young woman and this one knows what she wants she has heard of you and she decided to ask you to come i told her again and again that there is nothing that you can do which i have not already done but look here is her carriage at the door as he was speaking a young woman hurried into the room she was one of the prettiest girls that i have ever seen in my life her eyes were shining her lips open ready to speak and her face was pink with excitement she looked at each of us carefully and then turned to my friend oh mr sherlock holmes she said she seemed to know immediately who he was i am so glad that you have come i have driven here to tell you this i know that james did not do it i know it and i want you to know it too please be quite sure of that fact before you start your work i have known him since we were both little children and i know his weaknesses better than anyone but he is too softhearted to hurt a fly anyone who really knows him must believe that he is innocent i hope that we can show that to be true miss turner said sherlock holmes believe me i shall do everything possible but you have read the facts you have studied the problem you must see something wrong in what people are thinking some way of escape do you not believe that he is innocent i think that probably he is there now she said throwing back her head and turning to lestrade do you hear that he gives me hope lestrade looked unhappy he clearly thought that holmes was mistaken i am afraid that my friend here is only guessing he said but he is right i know that he is right james and his father had many quarrels about me mr mccarthy wanted us to get married i have always loved james and he loves me but we are like brother and sister he is still young and knows very little about life and and i mean naturally he did not wish to marry just yet so there were quarrels i am sure that this was one of them and your father asked holmes did he also want you to marry james no he was against it too only mr mccarthy wanted it holmes was watching her carefully and we saw that her face suddenly became a deeper pink thank you for this information holmes said can i come and visit your father tomorrow i am afraid that the doctor will say no the doctor yes havent you heard my poor father has not been strong for many years but with his sadness about this murder he has become very ill he is in bed and dr willows says that his case is serious mr mccarthy was the only person left who knew father in the old days in australia when he was in victoria ha in victoria that is important yes at the mines of course i understand that those were the goldmines where mr turner made his money that is right thank you miss turner you have been a very great help to me you will tell me tomorrow if you have any news i expect that you will go to the prison to see james oh mr holmes if you do go please tell him this i know he is innocent i will miss turner i must go home now because my father needs me he is unhappy if i leave him goodbye and god help you in your work she hurried from the room and we heard her carriage moving away down the street i am surprised at you holmes said lestrade after keeping silent for a few minutes why do you give her hope when she is sure to lose it only too soon i am not softhearted as you know but i think you are being unkind i believe that there is a way of saving james mccarthy said holmes have you an order to see him in the prison yes but only for you and me then i shall change my plans and go out we have still got time to take a train to hereford and see him tonight plenty of time then let us go watson i am afraid that you will be bored but i shall only be away for an hour or two i walked with them to the station and then came back alone through the streets of the little town to our hotel there i sat and tried to read a book but the story was so stupid that my thoughts kept returning to the boscombe pool mystery i could not follow the story finally i threw the book across the room and began to think only about the happenings of the day perhaps this unlucky young mans words were really true in that case what terrible thing happened between the time that he left his father and the time that he ran back to the pool hearing his dying screams something very frightening i was sure but what was it maybe the shape of the wounds had something to tell me as a doctor i rang the bell and asked for the weekly newspaper which had a description of them the wounds were in a group on the back part of mccarthys head on the left side clearly the murderer hit him from behind this fact made james mccarthys story easier to believe perhaps they were face to face during their quarrel he said of course it was also possible that james hit him when his father turned his back still i decided to give holmes this information then there was the strange talk of a rat when the old man lay dying it is unusual for a dying man to use words with no meaning probably he was trying to explain how it all happened but what did it mean i thought hard trying to find an answer to the mystery but i could not then there was the grey cloth which young mccarthy saw if this was true then perhaps the murderer dropped it his coat maybe when he was running away but the son was sitting beside his father just a few yards away and saw no one so every part of the case seemed to bring more problems lestrades ideas did not surprise me but i believed strongly in my friend sherlock holmes he will find new facts i thought to myself and i need not lose hope if each new fact points to young mccarthys innocence it was late before sherlock holmes returned he came back alone because lestrade was staying at a different hotel i told him about the head wounds a fact which he seemed to find interesting the weather seems to be staying fine he said we dont want any rain to fall before we can look at the ground but we must rest and be fresh for important work of this kind i did not want to begin it after that long journey i have seen young mccarthy and what did you learn from him nothing couldnt he tell you anything nothing as i have said at first i thought that he must know the name of the murderer he wanted to save him or her that was my idea but now i am sure that he knows as little as we do i must say that he is not a very intelligent young man even if he is goodlooking and also i think goodhearted i do not think much of his taste i said if he really does not want to marry miss turner ah that is a long sad story this boy is deeply in love with her but two years ago he did a very stupid thing miss turner was still at school then and away from home he did not know her very well james became friendly with a woman in bristol who worked in a bar he married her secretly even now no one knows that he is married so think of his feelings when his father told him again and again to marry miss turner he dearly wanted to marry her but he knew that it was impossible his father as we now know was a cold hard man and james could not tell him about his wife he has spent the last three days in bristol with this bar woman and his father of course knew nothing about it remember that fact it is very important but something good has happened at last because his wife has now left him she read in the newspaper about his serious trouble and wants to have nothing more to do with him she has written to say that she has a husband already a sailor and that she and james are not really married this piece of news has made poor james a lot happier but if james is innocent then who did the murder ah who i want you to notice two important facts the first is that the murdered man went to the pool to meet someone this person was not his son because his son was away from home mccarthy did not know when his son was coming back the second fact is that the murdered man called cooee not knowing about his sons return those are the two things which will help to save young james and now let us change the subject we shall talk no more of murders and leave all that business until tomorrow holmes was right there was no rain during the night and the next day was bright and cloudless at nine oclock lestrade came for us with the carnage and we left for hatherley farm and boscombe valley there is serious news this morning said lestrade i hear that mr turner is dangerously ill the doctor thinks that he is dying he is quite an old man then asked holmes about sixty but his health has been bad for some time this business has made him really ill he was an old friend of mccarthys and helped him in a number of ways i have learned that he gave him free use of hatherley farm is that true this is most interesting said holmes oh yes and he has helped him in other ways too everyone round here speaks of his kindness to mccarthy really dont you think it strange then that mccarthy wanted his son to marry turners daughter the turners are rich and the mccarthys seem to be quite poor we know that old mr turner has always been against the idea his daughter told us that dont you find that mccarthys friendliness is a little unusual you are always full of ideas mr holmes said lestrade looking at me with a smile i have come here to study the facts and they are difficult enough your thoughts always fly away from the real problems you are right said holmes quietly you do find it difficult to notice the facts well i have understood one fact which you do not seem to get hold of answered lestrade not very pleased and that is that young mccarthy killed his father any other way of seeing this case is just not possible let us agree to disagree said holmes laughing but if i am not mistaken there is hatherley farm on the left yes that is it it was a long low building made of grey stone and it looked comfortable but the windows were all shut and there was no smoke coming up from the roof it looked empty we knocked on the door and a young servant girl came out she showed us first the boots whi—Åh old mr mccarthy was wearing at the time of his death she also showed us a pair of the sons boots holmes studied their size and shape very carefully he then asked to see the back of the house from there we took the path which went to boscombe pool holmes seemed to change as he hurried towards the place of the murder he stopped being the quiet thinker of baker street his face became redder and darker his eyes shone with a hard light he pressed his lips together and held his face down and his body low studying the ground his thoughts were turned so fully to the case that he did not seem to hear anything that we said if he did he answered only with a short word or two he made his way quickly and silently along the path which went across the fields and then down through the trees to boscombe pool the ground was soft and wet as we got nearer there were the marks of many feet both on the path and on the short grass on each side sometimes holmes hurried on sometimes he suddenly stood still once he walked away from the path into a field lestrade and i walked behind him lestrade seemed bored and uninterested in what holmes was doing but i watched my friend carefully knowing that every movement had a meaning boscombe pool is a small piece of water about one hundred and twenty yards wide it lies at the end of the hatherley farm land where it joins the beautiful park land belonging to mr turner above the trees on the far side of the pool we could see the big red roofs of turners home on the hatherley side of the pool the trees grew thick there was a narrow piece of open ground about forty yards wide between the trees and the water of the lake this open part was covered with short wet grass lestrade showed us the place where the body was lying when they found it in fact the ground was so soft that i could see the marks left by mccarthys fall but looking at holmes i realized from his excited face and the quick movement of his eyes that he was learning many other things from the marks on the grass he ran here and there like a dog which has smelled a wild animal then he turned to the detective why did you go into the pool he asked lestrade i thought that maybe there was a gun or a piece of clothing or something like that in the water but tell me how oh come now lestrade i have no time that left foot of yours is everywhere a child can see it look over there where it disappears into the grass this case was perfectly easy until a crowd of people came and stupidly walked all over the place here is where the morans came and their footmarks have covered the ground for five or six yards around the body but here are three different lines of the same feet he took out a magnifying glass and lay down on top of his coat to see the marks better talking to himself more than to us he said these are young mccarthys feet twice he was walking and once he was running fast because his toes are pressing deeper into the ground that follows his story does it not then here are the fathers footmarks as he walked up and down what is this then ha ha what have we here someone walking on his toes in boots with square toes too quite unusual boots they come they go they come again of course that was for the coat now where did they come from he ran up and down sometimes losing and sometimes finding the line of footmarks soon we were standing in the shadow of a very big tree the largest of them all holmes followed the marks to the far side of the tree then he lay down on his front again with an excited shout for a long time he stayed there turning over the dry leaves until he picked up something small which looked burned he put this into an envelope next he studied both the ground and the sides of the tree with his magnifying glass a big rough stone was lying among the leaves he looked at this too with great interest and kept it then he followed another line of footmarks these went along a path through the trees until they came to a road where the marks disappeared it has been a most interesting case holmes said becoming himself again i think that this little house on the right must be the morans home i will go in and have a word with mr moran perhaps i will write a short letter after that we shall drive back to the town and have lunch please walk to the carriage i shall be with you again in ten minutes ten minutes later we were in the carriage driving back to ross holmes was still carrying with him the stone found among the trees you will be interested in this he said to lestrade holding it out i see no marks on it there are none how do you know that it is important then the grass was growing under it clearly it was lying there for only a day or two i could not find the place that it came from there are too many stones around but it is the right shape to make the wounds in mccarthys head and the murderer he is a tall man lefthanded with a bad right leg he wears thick shooting boots and a grey coat smokes indian cigars uses a cigarholder and carries a pocketknife not a very sharp one there is more information that i can give you but that will be enough for you to find him i think lestrade laughed i am afraid i find all this hard to believe he said this information is all very well but it does not show that a person is guilty of murder we shall see said holmes you work in your way and i shall work in mine i shall be busy this afternoon and i shall probably go back to london on the evening train and leave the case unfinished no finished but the mystery is a mystery no more who was the guilty person then oh god help us the person i have just described of course but who is he that will not be difficult to find out the number of people who live in this neighbourhood is not large lestrade had a hopeless look on his face i am a sensible man he said slowly i really cannot run all over the place looking for a lefthanded man with a bad leg my friends at scotland yard will laugh at me all right said holmes quietly i have given you the information now here we are at your address i believe goodbye i shall send you a few words before i leave we dropped lestrade at his hotel and then drove to ours where we found lunch upon the table look here watson said my friend when the meal was over just sit here in this chair and listen to me for a little i am not sure what to do and your ideas will be useful light a cigar and i shall explain please do well when we first learned about this case there were two things that we both noticed immediately they are both parts of young mccarthys story to me they showed him to be innocent to you they seemed to make him guilty the first thing is that his father called cooee to him before he saw him the second is that he spoke of a rat as he lay dying he said several other words you remember but that was the only word that his son understood now these two facts must be the start of our thinking we shall also begin by believing that the boys story is perfectly true what about this cooee then well clearly the father was not calling to his son the son as far as he knew was in bristol it was just luck that james heard his fathers call the cooee was for the person that old mccarthy was going to meet but cooee is a special call that australians use the person whom mccarthy expected to meet at boscombe pool was probably someone who knew australia what about the rat in that case sherlock holmes took a piece of paper from his pocket and put it on the table this is map of australia he said i sent for it last night he put his hand over part of the map what do you read he asked arat i read and now he lifted his hand ballarat quite right that was the word which the old man spoke but his son only understood the last part of it he was trying to give the name of his murderer mr something of ballarat thats most surprising i said it is perfectly easy said holmes and now you see the number of possible people immediately becomes much smaller someone who has a grey coat or jacket that is another thing we can be sure about if we believe the sons story we have already come from knowing nothing to a picture of an australian from ballarat with a grey coat quite true and this person felt at home in the valley because it is only possible to get to the pool across other peoples land strangers cannot usually go there again you are right then there is our visit today by looking carefully at the ground i was able to describe the wanted man still more fully to that stupid detective lestrade but how did you find out those other facts you know my ways it is the very small things that i always look for you knew that he was tall because the space between the footmarks showed a man with long legs and the marks also told you what kind of boots he wore yes they were unusual boots but his bad leg the mark of his right foot was always less clear than the mark of his left he stood more heavily on the left because his right leg hurt him but you also say that he is lefthanded ah yes it was you dear watson who noticed the kind of head wound which the doctor described the murderer hit mccarthy from behind but on the left side of the head this shows that he was lefthanded try to do it with your right hand if you do not believe me during the quarrel between the father and son he stood behind that big tree he was smoking at the time i found the ash from a cigar which i know to be an indian cigar at the foot of the tree you remember that smoking is one of my favourite subjects and that i have written a paper on the ash from one hundred and forty different kinds of pipes cigars and cigarettes i looked around and soon found the cigar end lying among the leaves it was an indian cigar from a shop in rotterdam and the cigarholder i could see that he did not put the cigar end in his mouth so i know that he uses a cigarholder the end was cut off not bitten off but the cut was not a clean one this showed me that he used an old pocketknife holmes i said you have described this man perfectly now he cannot escape and you have saved an innocent mans life now i see where all these facts are pointing the guilty man is mr john turner called out the hotel waiter opening door of our sittingroom for a visitor the man who came in was strange and frightening to look at he walked slowly and with difficulty he looked sick but his hard face full of deep lines and his heavy arms and legs showed that he was strong both in body and in his feelings his untidy beard thick grey hair and dark eyes gave him a wild proud look but his face was white as ash i noticed the light blue colour of the skin around his nose and lips as a doctor i could see immediately that he was seriously ill please sit down on the sofa said holmes softly so you got my letter yes moran brought it to me it says that you want to see me here because it will make things easier i think that people will talk if they see me going to your house and why do you want to see me he looked at my friend with sad tired eyes he seemed already to know the answer to his question yes said holmes answering his look more than his words it is true i know all about mccarthy the old man hid his face in his hands god help me he shouted i did not want the young man to get hurt if the case goes against him i promise you that i shall tell the police everything i am glad to hear it said holmes in a serious voice i have not spoken yet only because of my dear girl maybe i but no it will break her heart if she hears that i am a prisoner perhaps that need not happen said holmes what i am not a policeman i understand that it was your daughter who asked me to come so i am working for her but and here he looked hard at turner you must save young mccarthy i am a dying man said turner i have had diabetes for years my doctor does not think that i have more than a month to live but naturally i prefer to die under my own roof than in prison holmes stood up crossed to the table and sat down at it with a pen in his hand and some paper in front of him just tell us the true story he said i shall write it all down you will put your name to it and watson here will listen to everything then if i need to save young mccarthys life i can give it to the police i promise you that i shall not use it until i must very well said the old man i do not think that i shall live until the case comes up so it does not matter much to me but i want to save alices feelings if i can it is a terrible thing for her to live with she is so young and now i will explain everything to you it has taken a long time to happen but it will not take me a long time to tell you did not know this dead man mccarthy he was a true criminal bad in every possible way i hope that you never fall into the hands of someone like him he has sat on my back for twenty years and he has made my life impossible i shall tell you first how i met him and became tied to him and his greedy ways it was in the early s at the mines i was a young man then hotblooded and ready to try anything new i made some bad friends began drinking had no luck in finding gold so i left the mines and became what you call here a gangster a robber on the roads there were six of us and we had a wild free life robbing a sheep station sometimes or stopping the carriages on the road to the mines black jack of ballarat was the name i took and in australia people still remember our group as the ballarat boys one day a carriage was carrying gold from ballarat to melbourne so we hid beside the road and took it by surprise there were six guards on horses and six of us so we nearly lost the fight but we shot four of them within a few minutes they killed three of our boys before we got our hands on the gold i put my gun to the head of the driver who was this same man mccarthy i meant to shoot him but decided to let him go i still remember his greedy little eyes looking hard at my face he planned to remember me we rode away with the gold and became rich men i left my old friends and made my way back to england here no one knew me or my past i decided to stop travelling and live a good and quiet life a family wanted to sell that big house at boscombe so i bought it i began to put my money to good uses unlike the way i first got it i also got married my wife died young but she left me dear little alice alice is all the world to me even when she was still a baby her little hand seemed to show me the right way to live she is the first person who has ever done that in a word i changed my selfish ways and did everything i could to become a better person all was going well until mccarthy came along i was in london on business one day and i met him by accident in regent street he was almost without shoes on his feet or a coat on his back here we are at last jack he said touching me on the arm we shall be like a family to you there are two of us me and my son and you can look after us now and if you do not remember that this is england there is always a policeman nearby to tell my story to well they came down to the west country and i could not shake them off they lived without paying in the best farm that i had there was no rest for me now no forgetting everywhere i went his greedy smiling face was at my side he asked for everything that he needed and i gave it to him without question money a house a carriage it got worse as alice grew up he soon realized that i was more afraid of her knowing my past than i was of the police at last he asked for the one thing i could not give he asked for alice his son you see was a young man and alice too was not a child any more he thought it a wonderful idea for his son to have all my land and money when he married alice but of course i could not agree i did not dislike the boy but his fathers blood is in him and that is enough i told mccarthy no never mccarthy was ready to go to the police i told him to do his worst we finally agreed to meet at the pool halfway between our two houses we were going to talk about mccarthys plan one more time when i went down there i saw him talking to his son they were having a quarrel about alice i hid behind a tree and smoked a cigar because i needed to talk to charles alone but as i listened to his words everything inside me that was black and angry seemed to break out he was pressing his son to marry my daughter it didnt seem to matter what my daughters feelings were he spoke of her as if she was a woman of the streets it made me wild to think of my dearest child in the hands of that criminal how could i break the tie i was already a dying man with no hope left my head was clear and my arms were still strong but i did not have long to live but my daughter and the picture she had of her loving father i could save them both i only had to stop that mans tongue from telling my secret so i did it mr holmes i feel able to do it again right or wrong i have done many bad things in my life but i have paid for them i could not stand still and see my innocent daughter so hurt i hit him and he fell to me he seemed nothing more than an animal his screams brought his son running back but by this time i was among the trees of course i had to go back and get my coat which i dropped as i hurried away that is the true story mr holmes the story of everything that happened now show me that paper well it is not for me to speak of right or wrong said holmes as the old man wrote his name at the bottom of the last page i hope that i shall never have to show that you are guilty i hope not sir and what do you mean to do now because of your health i shall do nothing you know too well that you must live with your terrible past holmes pointed to the handwritten pages on the table i will keep this information and if they decide that young mccarthy is guilty of this murder i must of course use it if that does not happen no man alive shall ever see it your secret will be safe with us and the mystery of boscombe pool will stay a mystery for ever goodbye then said the old man in a broken voice when your time comes you will be able to die knowing that you have done a great kindness his great sick body was shaking as he slowly left the room god help us said holmes after keeping silent for some time why is life so hard on poor old men like him every time that i meet a case like this i say to myself there but for the goodness of god goes sherlock holmes james mccarthys case came up some weeks later the decision was not guilty of murder the few facts which holmes gave to the police were enough to free him old turner lived for seven months more but he is now dead it seems that james and alice will soon become husband and wife knowing nothing of that great black cloud that rests over the past
