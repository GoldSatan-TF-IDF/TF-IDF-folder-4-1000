chapter fleecy clouds moved across the sun then suddenly broke up sending glittering sunlight through the dusty library window jill franks squinted against the sudden brightness then laughed as her friend andrea hubbard quickly put on oversize purple sunglasses with heartshaped frames whered you get those jill whispered arent they great exclaimed andrea dont you think they make me look sexy and mysterious will you guys keep it down both jill and andrea turned back in surprise to diane hamilton the only one of the three who actually had a book open the girls were at their favorite study table behind the stacks in the school library what did you say shouted andrea and she and jill cracked up again the glasses look great said diane trying not to laugh but andrea this is a library and were supposed to be studying for the geography quiz relax said jill were the only people in here miss dotson went to lunch fifteen minutes ago besides said andrea stretching like a cat the quiz is two hours away maybe well be captured by aliens before sixth period jill laughed again andrea never took anything seriously jill sometimes wondered if it was just a pose or if andrea really did see everything as a joke its easy for you to say said diane both of you have been in this school system your whole lives but at my old school we never studied geography ooh poor baby said andrea sarcastically and i bet you still think the worlds flat who says it isnt said jill come on you two urged diane i really have to do well this semester a serious look clouded her small heartshaped face as if the geography quiz were the most important thing in her life jill studied diane with a mixture of exasperation and affection the shy petite brownhaired girl contrasted oddly with jill and andrea tall slim jill with her long thick black hair and bouncy muscular andrea with her boyshort red hair were both outgoing and ready to laugh at anything but when diane had joined the gymnastics team at the beginning of the semester the three had hit it off right away anyway maybe jill thought it was because diane was so different she was as calm as andrea was volatile and as serious as jill was bubbly and she was the sweetest person jill had ever known always ready with a compliment or a word of encouragement hey dont worry about the quiz said andrea mrs markham never counts quizzes for the final grade thats not what she said diane protested who cares asked andrea i only care about getting good enough grades to keep my sports eligibility after you win the state gymnastics championship nobody will care what your grades are said jill do you really think i have a chance to win asked andrea who else said jill well how about the twelve other finalists andrea said ill bet none of them is as good as you said diane in fact youre the best ive ever seen on the floor routine thanks for saying so said andrea i shouldnt admit it but i think i do have a chance for a medal i just wish i were a little stronger on the balance beam well help you practice this weekend said jill wont we diane sure said diane her serious face transformed by a smile what i really need help with is picking the music for my floor routine andrea said any ideas how about bolero said jill bolero was one of her favorite pieces no way too many other girls use it said andrea id like to have something really different something no one else would think of using how about some original music said diane suddenly oh sure said andrea what do you have in mind the two of you humming on combs while i do my flips i was just thinking diane said sounding excited i have this friend hes kind of a songwriter i mean he writes his own songs and plays them on the guitar hes really good great maybe hed like to sit on the uneven parallel bars and strum away andrea sighed im serious about this i need something really special im serious too said diane sounding hurt i think dianes idea is great said jill if her friend came up with something neat we could tape it for the competition for sure no one else will be using original music you really think hed do it said andrea you can ask him yourself next week said diane his father just got transferred to shadyside and gabe and his mother will be here in a few days gabe said andrea yeah its short for gabriel said diane like the angel only gabes more of a devil jill and andrea both stared at diane for a moment because that didnt sound like her type of friend at all what do you mean said jill hes not like other boys said diane hes well a little wild and kind of funny and sweet all at once ive known him practically my whole life and i never have any idea what hes going to do sounds interesting said andrea arching one thin dark eyebrow hes also goodlooking diane added as an afterthought hes got the greenest eyes you ever saw i mean really green green not brownish so when do we meet mr perfect asked andrea as i said he and his mom should be here any day now im really excited theyre coming but diane let her thought trail off but said jill whats the but well gabes a little worried about moving to a small town diane said hes lived in the city his whole life well just have to make it interesting for him said andrea first of all well keep him away from nick and max come on andrea said jill theyre not so bad then why wont you go out with them countered andrea everyone knows theyre both crazy about you get real jill said but she knew what andrea meant nick malone and max bogner had been hanging out with the girls ever since the past summer both boys were nice but exciting would be the last word anyone would use to describe either of them officially they were all just friends but jill knew andrea was right both nick and max were interested in her too bad she wasnt interested in either of them maybe this new boy gabe would be someone she could care about she was jolted from her thoughts by a diabolical cackle and a moment later nick his long skinny fingers twisted into claws emerged from behind a tall bookshelf ah zere zey are he said in a terrible dracula accent my favorite leetle morsels maybe we can wrap zem up here and ship zem back to ze castle said max in the same accent he was as stocky and round as nick was long and skinny and his plump reddish face was screwed up into such a ridiculous horrormovie expression that all three girls laughed out loud dont tell me you guys have been renting ancient horror movies again said jill how did you guess said max making the face again we saw three last night said nick sitting on the windowsill by the table they were all cool but the best one was called the torch you ever see it we have better things to do with our iqs said andrea in a bored voice for you two it may be too late nick ignored the insult and went on its about this guy who can make fire come out of the tips of his fingers like a human flame thrower sounds like a handy guy to take on a barbecue said andrea yeah said nick anyway hes a good guy but then he runs across a bad guy who can do the same thing and pretty soon theyre having these big fire duels like this said max suddenly flicking on a disposable butane lighter he turned it on high so that the flame shot up then aimed it in nicks direction hey said nick still laughing he reached into his pocket and pulled out a lighter of his own take that torch scum he said and swiped his lighter at max in the next instant the two boys were faking a duel with the lighters jill and andrea both started laughing because the boys were so ridiculous but then jill became aware of dianes chair suddenly scraping away from them dont diane whispered fiercely dont she repeated more loudly dont jill turned to her friend and saw that dianes pretty face was twisted in fear stop them jill make them stop diane gripped jills arm theyre only fooling around jill said she did talk to the guys though hey chill out will you no keep it up said andrea maybe you can start a fire and get the geography quiz canceled i only use my powers in the service of good said max and geography is hey watch out max stepped aside as nick lunged at him nicks gawky body fell against the side of the stacks knocking several books to the floor before he regained his balance he had landed in andreas lap get off me grunted andrea may i have this dance nick asked he straightened up and leaned against the wall still flicking his lighter cut it out you dweeb said jill she knew the boys were only fooling around but she suddenly realized how many flammable things the library contained nick picked up an empty folder and repeatedly brought the flame close to it then pulled it away no shrieked diane in a panic everyone including nick turned to look at her a second later the edge of the folder burst into flames chapter now youve done it cried diane her face white with fear she jumped up knocking her chair to the floor youve really done it she turned and ran from the room for a moment nobody moved then andrea grabbed the folder from nick and shook it till the flames died out whats with your friend asked max why did she go bananas shes your friend too said jill you know playing with lighters in the library isnt exactly the swiftest thing youve ever done its a good thing miss dotson isnt here added andrea im going to go see if dianes all right ill go with you said jill see you guys in geography as they walked out into the hall andrea dropped the blackened folder into the overflowing trash can by the door they found diane standing by an open window breathing deeply her whole body trembling jill put an arm around her hey diane she said gently what is it diane turned her stricken face to the other girls i hate fire she said i just hate it its okay said andrea but dont you think youre overreacting just the teensiest bit no one was hurt nothing got burned but a crummy folder i guess youre right said diane sorry im all right now but jill saw that she still looked frightened almost haunted a few minutes later jill sat in algebra class trying to answer some sample problems if a train starts out from chicago at fifty miles an hour one problem began and another train starts at the same time from san francisco at sixtyfive miles an hour why would they do that jill thought who takes the train these days it was no use she just couldnt concentrate on the stupid trains her eyes kept turning to the window where pink and creamy white dogwood trees were blossoming and her mind kept going back to the library and the strange way that diane had reacted to the fire diane was what jills mother called highstrung maybe it will be good for her to have an old friend around thought jill and maybe itll be good for me she thought this gabe really sounded interesting shed never known a guy who was really into music nick and max were all right but she couldnt take them seriously as anything more than friends she tried to imagine gabes green eyes as diane had described them and then suddenly she smelled something pungent and sour smoke as she watched the dogwoods were partially obscured by thick black smoke jill felt her heart tighten in her chest an instant later the fire alarm began to ring an instant after that the school intercom crackled and the principals voice came on faint against the wail of the alarm all fire monitors to their stations he said his next words were drowned out by a shriek this is real a girl screamed in a panicky voice just stay calm said mr molitor the math teacher his voice was low and steady but jill thought he looked scared theres plenty of time to get out line up by the door her heart still thudding jill grabbed her backpack and stood up then joined the line and followed the teacher out into the smoky second floor hall and down the stairs to the nearest exit the air filled with the wail of sirens by the time jills class had reached the courtyard fire fighters in heavy black raincoats and hats were swarming into the building jill searched for diane and andrea but they both had classes on the other side of the school ill bet dianes really freaking out jill thought if she was scared of a couple of lighters in the library the library terry ryan one of the boys in her class nudged her just then look he said the fires in the library jill raised her eyes to where he was pointing and saw the smoke billowing out the second floor windows beside the library stacks immediately she realized what must have happened two fire fighters their faces dark with soot were coming outside now dragging a large blackened trash basket the contents of the basket had been doused with water but tendrils of smoke still curled up from the charred mess it was the library trash can the one andrea had dropped the burnt folder into chapter hey i didnt know it was still on fire said andrea she sucked the rest of her root beer through a striped straw then reached for a french fry from the doubleorder sitting in front of nick yuck these are so salty hey nick you ever consider just eating directly from the salt shaker if you dont like them order your own said nick pulling the plate away from her besides i thought you were on a diet he always ordered doubles of everything but stayed as skinny as a stick ive got to keep my strength up cracked andrea in case they arrest me for burning the school down lighten up andrea said max no one knows it was your fault it was nicks fault anyway added jill and maxs admit it guys you planned the whole thing so we wouldnt have the geography quiz it worked too said max well maybe you can do it again next week so i wont have to turn in my research paper said jill thats wednesday at nineforty i couldnt believe all that smoke said andrea just from one little wastebasket fire fires are so frightening said diane in a small voice it was the first time she had spoken except to order a coke since the five friends had gone into petes pizza whats your problem asked max no one was hurt there was no damage there could have been said diane she shuddered you know said jill dianes right fire can be a very scary look said diane suddenly cutting her off look whos here jill glanced up half expecting to see the fire chief the door had just swung open and a tall muscular boy stood framed in it against the setting sun he was dressed in faded jeans and a gray rugby shirt his thick sandy hair curled above a broad handsome face gabe over here diane wriggled out of the booth and ran over to give him a big friendly hug whos the new dude asked max obviously a friend of dianes said nick she wasnt kidding andrea whispered to jill checking out the new arrival that guy is gorgeous diane came back to the booth leading gabe by the arm this is my good friend gabe miller she said beaming her face had turned from serious to sparkling and jill was aware again of how pretty diane was when she smiled smiling herself she felt a little shiver pass through her as her eyes met gabes he was the handsomest boy she had ever seen outside the movies and his eyes were just as green as diane had described a clear bottle green with a sparkling intensity almost like fire gabe held her gaze a moment longer then turned to each of the others an ironic half smile on his lips how you doing he said as diane introduced each in turn why did jill have the feeling that gabe didnt really want to be there hey heres a chair said max he pulled one over from an empty table gabe turned the chair around so that its back was against the table then he straddled it facing the others thanks he said without glancing at max instead he kept staring first at andrea then back at jill a slow secret smile on his face so this is where its all happening he said sarcastically come on gabe said diane shadyside is okay youre going to like it here i promise i dont know about that said gabe with a shrug diane said youre from center city said andrea yeah said gabe what else did she tell you about me she said youre into music said jill that you write your own songs i fool around a little said gabe with the same strange smile really said nick maybe you could help me with the guitar oh get real nick said andrea you only know two chords well thats why i need help said nick you play guitar gabe its one of my instruments said gabe whatre the other ones asked max i play lots of instruments said gabe appearing to lose interest in the conversation for heavens sake max said andrea gabe just got here give him a break what i want to know is how come youre here now diane said to gabe i thought you and your mom werent coming till next week yeah well the people who bought our house wanted to move in early so here i am not as exciting here as in the city i guess said max its different said gabe actually we had quite a bit of excitement today said jill she found herself wanting to defend shadyside for no reason she could think of yeah said gabe gazing at jill with interest what jill means said andrea is that we had a fire at school it was really no big deal hey said nick i call it a pretty big deal since we got geography canceled you mean you started the fire said gabe he sounded more interested well sort of said max nick set a folder on fire it was just a goof and andrea tossed it in a wastebasket before the fire was out thats it said gabe you set a wastebasket fire well yeah said nick and the fire trucks came and everything yeah they did said nick it was awesome for a long moment gabe didnt answer then he shook his head so what youre telling me he said to max is that the most exciting thing thats happened around here is a wastebasket fire that was an accident we told you it was no big deal said andrea but it was a little exciting you know gabe went on almost to himself it takes guts to set a fire deliberately yeah said max you ever set one gabe didnt reply just shrugged a strange smile on his face his green eyes staring into the distance jill stared at him confused what is he talking about she wondered does he set fires deliberately she stared at her friends startled by the excitement on their faces then she turned to diane diane had her serious face on again she was staring at gabe slowly shaking her head as if sending him a message whats going on jill wondered does diane know more about gabe than she wants us to know chapter happy pizza day said nick carefully setting his overloaded tray down on the lunchroom table whoa exclaimed jill nick you have six slices there it was all i could afford nick cracked he opened his mouth and began to shovel in pizza max sitting next to nick and across from jill was staring down at a big salad while the three girls and nick ate pizza im so glad its friday said jill and not just because its pizza day in the cafeteria i second that said andrea she turned to max whats your problem you usually have as many slices as nick im just not too hungry today said max picking at his salad hes trying to lose weight said nick to look more like gabe lay off said max his ruddy face flushing even redder theres nothing wrong with trying to take care of yourself a little if you want to look like gabe its going to take a lot more than a salad said andrea well i think its just fine if max wants to try to lose some weight said diane good for you diane was always coming to the rescue of anyone who got teased too much speaking of gabe andrea went on ignoring her i havent seen him all day is he in school his parents furniture was supposed to be delivered today said diane maybe he stayed home to oh there he is now she stood up and waved so that gabe would see her gabe ambled over to the table and sat down next to jill favoring her with his slow smile jill felt flustered and unsure of what to say i was just in the gym doing some extra crunches and chins gabe said you know the phys ed program here is pathetic they must be trying to turn out couch potatoes thats not true said nick weve got one of the best swimming programs in the state not to mention a great gymnastics program said jill you know andreas going to be allstate this year is that right said gabe he gave andrea an appreciative glance well i dont know if ill actually get to the championship said andrea but that reminds me ive been meaning to ask you lets not talk about that now diane interrupted gabe did your parents stuff get delivered okay yeah the movers came first thing yesterday morning said gabe so i guess that means im stuck here in good old shadyside oh come on said jill suddenly exasperated you havent been here long enough to give shadyside a chance ive been here long enough to know the pizzas terrible gabe said dropping a halfeaten piece onto his tray what do you expect said diane this is the school cafeteria you ought to try the pizza at petes i ordered in from there the other night said gabe definitely secondrate well all right maybe the pizza doesnt live up to your bigcity standards but shadyside has a lot of good things said nick like what well dobies has the best ice cream ive ever tasted said jill i bet even you would agree its excuse the expression firstrate well at least i wont starve here said gabe just probably die of boredom theres lots of stuff to do here too jill went on wondering why she was spending so much effort on defending shadyside weve got red heat a great dance club and the bowling alley and well okay youve probably got things like that in center city but ill bet you dont have as many outdoor places as we do wow i dont know if i can take all the excitement cracked gabe oh gabe said diane and sighed cant you even try to like it here if you just gave it a chance i know youd be happy hey ill try said gabe but its not easy can you name one thing that shadyside has that center city doesnt we have a haunted street said max you have a what fear street said jill with a little shiver but thats not exactly one of the great things about shadyside fear street you have a street called fear street it was named after simon fear one of the first settlers here max added you can still see the ruins of his mansion some of the houses on the street are supposed to be haunted what is it asked gabe some sort of theme park no said andrea for once sounding serious its not a joke at the end of the street theres a creepy old cemetery surrounded by woods weird things have happened around fear street people have disappeared there and thereve been a number of unsolved murders fear street sounds interesting said gabe id like to see it how about this weekend said diane suddenly my parents just bought a cabin on the lake in the fear street woods its really beautiful out there your parents bought a haunted cabin asked gabe of course not said diane the woods are sort of creepy but the cabins cool lets do it we could all go for a picnic nah said gabe id like to di but i promised my folks id help them unpack this weekend the whole weekend asked andrea i think so said gabe too bad we cant just get this afternoon off said max right said jill im sorry mr molitor i cant come to algebra because i have an emergency picnic to go to hey said gabe what if there really was an emergency what do you mean asked jill well remember what you told me last week about starting a wastebasket fire and how it got you out of a geography quiz that was just an accident said jill she had a feeling she didnt want to hear what else gabe had to say yeah well what if we set a real fire one thats bad enough to cancel classes gabe said it as casually as if hed suggested going back for seconds on lunch oh right said max or why dont we call in a bomb threat to the principal or wait ive got it cracked andrea why dont we kidnap the principal right agreed nick and bring him along on the picnic hed probably like the afternoon off too by now everyone was laughing theyre all good ideas said gabe but i vote for the fire me too said max we already know that works yeah but whos going to set it said andrea someone with guts said gabe he was smiling a mocking smile and jill suddenly thought that he might be serious are you serious blurted out max as if reading jills thoughts gabe shrugged didnt you just say youd like to take the afternoon off well yeah but i didnt mean didnt mean what said gabe would you like the afternoon off or not well sure i would but are you saying we should set a real fire max looked dumbfounded not we said gabe you me maxs voice suddenly squeaked why me or nick said gabe casually of course if no one has the guts we can just forget the whole thing are you crazy exclaimed nick we could get kicked out of school for good gabe you cant be serious jill cried youd better not be said diane jill thought she was pleading with gabe with her eyes i dont want to hear any more talk about fires diane said suddenly i i have to go study for geography class she stood up abruptly and walked off diane jill called after her dont worry about diane said gabe shes always been a little jumpy he turned to andrea what do you think about the idea andrea andrea smiled excitedly im just waiting to see if anyone will really do it probably not said gabe this is shadyside land of the wimp he casually pulled a disposable lighter out of his pocket and put it on the table it wouldnt be hard you know he said ive been keeping an eye on the boys room nobodys gone in there for fifteen minutes for a moment nobody said anything they all stared at the lighter as if it were a bomb then suddenly max reached out and grabbed it max said jill suddenly nervous you dont have to do anything you dont want to max didnt answer he seemed to make a sudden decision jumped up and walked into the boys room jill andrea nick and gabe all stared after him hes not really going to set a fire said jill hoping he wouldnt i dont know said gabe he seemed pretty determined to me he probably just had to go said andrea ive known max for three years and he just doesnt her words were cut off by the bell ending lunch hour and the usual mad scramble as kids hurried to dump their trays and head for class jill was just picking up her tray when she heard a sudden whooshing noise then a loud explosion and the door to the boys restroom blew off its hinges an instant later bright orange flames shot into the cafeteria chapter everyones acting like its a big joke jill thought and actually in a way it was nick wearing cutoff jeans and a huge goofylooking straw hat was unpacking picnic things from the back of his fathers old station wagon and tossing them one at a time to andrea and gabe who were both whooping and laughing jill and andrea were both dressed in short beach dresses over their new bathing suits while gabe was wearing black spandex bicycle shorts and a cutoff tshirt that made him look like a finalist in the mr america contest even max was wearing swimming trunks his pudgy body overlapping the waistband only slightly diane was the only one not wearing a bathing suit she had on jeans and a longsleeved tshirt with flowers printed on it i have an allergy to the sun she reminded them but that doesnt mean the rest of you cant go in the water while the others continued to unload the car she helped set things up on the long redwood table jill had never seen her friends so excited but then they had never come close to burning down the school before she still wasnt sure how she felt about it when the flames had erupted into the cafeteria jill had been more frightened than ever before in her life her knees shaking she had followed the others out the door through screams and thick choking smoke max she kept thinking he was in there when it exploded then a moment later max appeared from the side door behind the cafeteria max she cried are you all right we werent sure if you got out before he could answer diane had come running up to them as they stood in a knot in the middle of the soccer field what happened she demanded her face pale we did it thats what said andrea with an exultant whoop or rather max did it hey quiet max said in a strangled voice he looked pale and shaken what a boom exulted gabe but how did you manage to i dont want to talk about it here said max nobody can hear us said andrea wow do you believe this once again fire trucks roared into the school grounds their sirens blaring this time the fire fighters hooked up their hoses and charged into the building with water streaming in front of them cars honked loudly loudspeakers squawked and there were excited shouts and cries it was so noisy jill could hardly think she just turned with the others and silently watched im really glad i wasnt in the cafeteria diane told jill it must have been really scary it was jill agreed are you guys sure i cant get caught max asked nervously relax said gabe exasperated theres no way anyone can know no one was in the rest room and there were a million people coming and going i didnt know it would be such a big fire max went on i never meant to do so much damage so the rest room will be closed for a few days said andrea big deal there was this big can of cleaning solution right next to the wastebasket said max thats what must have exploded i lit some papers in the wastebasket and ran i was lucky the can exploded just seconds after i got out what a sound that was what made it such an awesome fire said gabe dont worry max said diane sympathetically you got carried away by gabes dare i know you didnt mean to do it later after the fire was out the fire marshal had come and questioned some kids who had been in the cafeteria but no one had seen anything unusual because of the smoke damage school had been canceled for the rest of the day all the stuff is out of the car max announced now lets eat weve got to let the coals burn down in the grill said diane why dont you guys go for a swim first i want to see dianes haunted cabin said gabe come on diane let us in my parents havent finished fixing it up yet said diane but i guess we could look inside from the outside it looked like a rustic old cabin but on the inside it was startlingly modern dianes parents were renovating it and the furniture was all chic and sleek looking artwork mobiles paintings and metal sculptures in progress hung everywhere in the single big room dianes father had a workbench set up with his blowtorch and cutting tools my dad plans to use this as his studio on weekends diane explained he likes the light out here her father taught metal sculpture at the junior college and his work had won several local awards i never did understand your fathers sculptures gabe told diane but this place is great too bad its not really haunted havent you had enough excitement for one day asked andrea laughing me said gabe no way come on lets go check out the lake the water was icy a frigid contrast to the warm earlyspring air and jill gave up after a few minutes and joined diane on the dock her arms were covered with goosebumps as she slipped on her beach dress in the center of the lake nick and max were clowning around pushing each other off the float off to the side gabe and andrea were treading water talking animatedly then max materialized next to them there was some shouting and splashing and then andrea swam back to the shore she got out of the water shivering and sat beside her friends i cant believe this andrea said max started telling gabe what a good swimmer nick is so now theyre going to have a race theyre going to swim from the float to here and back and were supposed to watch to make sure both of them touch the dock gabes a good athlete said diane but i dont know if he can swim as well as nick my moneys on nick said jill really said andrea its a bet if nick wins ill let you borrow my red leather jacket whenever you want and if gabe wins you have to do my history homework all next week its a bet said jill laughing the three boys were now standing on the float max raised his hand and the girls could hear him call out on your mark get set go nick and gabe dived into the water and began swimming for the dock with smooth clean strokes jill watched as they streaked through the water come on nick she shouted go gabel yelled andrea go go go screamed diane jill didnt know who diane was rooting for but no matter who won they were all having fun watching when the boys reached the dock nick was ahead of gabe and as they raced back to the float his lead widened go nick go jill yelled then just before they reached the float nick slowed down and gabe won by a head andrea stood and cheered loudly then sat back down wow she said is there anything gabe cant do what were you guys talking about out there diane asked remember your idea that gabe could write some music for my floor routine said andrea well i asked him about it and he said hes interested hes going to watch me practice to get some ideas thats great said jill maybe it will make him feel more involved in things said diane but she didnt sound as happy about it as jill had thought she would especially since it had been her idea in the first place i wouldnt mind getting him a lot more involved said andrea her eyes on the boys as they swam lazily toward the shore diane can i ask you something personal sure said diane i just want to know i mean well would you have any objections if i went out with gabe jill turned to diane with interest she had been wondering the same thing for a moment diane didnt answer then she shrugged why would i have any objections she asked then she quickly added but he isnt really your type dont be too sure about that said andrea i just wanted to make sure that there isnt anything between you and gabe before i were just friends said diane and thats all thats all diane repeated gabes an old family friend jill couldnt see dianes face but the whole conversation was making diane feel uncomfortable jill was trying to figure out why when she was suddenly splashed from head to foot by the boys hey watch out she shouted leaping up whats for supper asked max were starved that was a terrific race said diane you were both great it was like watching the olympics you have a great stroke said andrea staring boldly at gabe what happened nick asked jill i thought for sure you were winning oh i got a cramp and had to slow down excuses excuses said gabe well thats what happened said nick he flashed gabe an angry look hey i was just kidding said gabe terrific race i mean it he clapped nick on the shoulder and offered his hand nick took it but jill knew nick was still unhappy after the six teens stuffed themselves on hot dogs and salad diane went into the cabin and brought out a battered old guitar remember this gabe she asked my first guitar he said laughing i cant believe you still have it gabe gave this to me a long time ago when i was sick diane said i never learned to play it but my father likes it play something for us please oh i dont know said gabe yeah come on gabe nick chimed in lets hear you play gabe shrugged and began to tune the strings it was getting dark and diane and andrea set candles around the patio area adding a warm glow to the deepening dusk gabe finished tuning up and began to strum the guitar and immediately everyone fell silent somehow he made real music come out of that battered old guitar then he began to sing in a husky baritone hes really good jill thought maybe andreas right maybe gabe really can do anything the candles were cheery looking as the trees became black lacy silhouettes against a pale purple sky gabe started playing some old favorites and they all sang jill felt more contented than she had in a long time this is great she thought just hanging out with my best friends singing relaxing things had really changed since gabe had come to shadyside and she decided they had changed for the better he was shaking them out of their old patterns getting them to try new things even if some of them were sort of wild after a while gabe put the guitar down and stretched thats enough for now he said im a little out of practice i thought you sounded great said andrea hey said nick suddenly reading his watch ive got to get the car home diane took the guitar back inside and locked up the cabin weve got to pick up every solitary scrap or my parents will have a fit she told the others and make sure the fires completely out dont give that job to andrea cracked nick remember what happened last week or max added jill the firebug of shadyside high very funny said max thanks for reminding me the cops are probably at my house now oh quit worrying said andrea whats so bad about a little fire added gabe he picked up one of the candles from the picnic table jill thought he was going to blow it out but then she and the others watched in horror and fascination as he brought his other hand down close to the flame and held it there as the flame licked at his hand the expression on his face didnt change chapter what do you think guys asked diane ready to shop till we drop she was gazing eagerly outside the snack bar at the division street mall not me said jill i already spent my entire clothes allowance for the year bummer said diane i have my moms charge card she says i need some new clothes i wish my mom would say that said andrea my mom always goes oh no you dont need that you already have too many things in your closet well im stuffed said diane lets get out of here good idea jill finished her sundae and wiped her face ill bet that had a hundred million calories in it what do you care said andrea youre not on a diet yeah well if im going to stay off one wed better get some exercise anyone want to check out the upper level sure said andrea maybe well run into the guys havent you had enough of them in school well andrea replied i thought maybe i could talk to gabe about the music hes going to do for my program oh yeah said jill hows that going well we havent actually gotten anything together yet he hasnt been able to come to my practice the girls paid for their desserts and left the olde sweete shoppe it was tuesday sale night and the mall was jammed with bargain hunters wow its really crowded said jill even if the boys are here we wouldnt be able to find them i dont think gabe hangs out in malls diane said youre probably right said andrea hes much too cool for that the first shop at the top of the stairs was the shadyside pet shop and diane always had to check out the dogs and cats she wasnt allowed to have a pet of her own because her father was allergic oh look at that one jill diane said pointing to a white kitten it looks just like mittsy jill laughed the little cat did look like mittsy jills goldeneyed persian in a nearby window two very fluffy terrier puppies were playing with each other rolling over and over in the shredded paper jill and diane stood with their noses against the glass oohing and aahing will you guys hurry up asked andrea the mall closes in half an hour oh come on andrea said diane just cause you dont like animals i like them okay said andrea impatiently i just never understand why people make idiots of themselves over them im more interested in animals of another sort boy animals especially one teased jill did you ever see such green eyes andrea exclaimed jill glanced at the puppies in the window then realized andrea was talking about gabe you were absolutely right about his eyes diane andrea said diane didnt answer how did you meet him anyway we lived next door to each other when we were little said diane we went to kindergarten together was he always so wild well said diane gabe was always getting in trouble if thats what you mean his mother always said i was a good influence on him she smiled as she remembered i could never stop him from anything he really wanted to do though i have a feeling nobody could stop gabe if he was after something said andrea hes a guy who seems to know exactly what he wants thats right said diane thats exactly right she spoke very seriously and once again jill had the feeling that diane was keeping something secret about gabe the girls continued to walk along the upper level checking out all the windows the athletes den had a big display of weightlifting equipment gabe told me he lifts weights andrea said how long has he been doing that diane probably since kindergarten said jill honestly andrea what do you think diane is gabes keeper i dont mind said diane after all i know gabe better than anyone she was silent a moment then went on he was always interested in sports she told andrea i think he started lifting weights a couple years ago oh yeah said andrea what sports did he play diane sighed i dont remember everything he was in little league baseball and in middle school he played soccer and basketball ill bet he was good at them wasnt he i guess hes a natural athlete said diane when he and nick were in that race andrea went on i couldnt believe how fast he was i mean nicks a really good swimmer and for gabe to have beaten him dont forget nick got a cramp said jill so he says said andrea it sounded like an excuse to me anyway why are you defending nick arent you the least bit interested in gabe too jill didnt answer for a moment the problem was that she was interested in gabe very interested but she was bothered by him too there was something about him and her feelings for him that made her very uncomfortable i just thought it was weird when he stuck his hand in the candle flame she said at last that was the coolest thing of all said andrea i never saw anyone do anything like that before i couldnt believe it she laughed and did you see the looks on the other guys faces when he did it i thought they were both going to die of jealousy i was afraid max was going to try it next said jill me too said andrea hey diane have you ever seen gabe do anything like that before diane shrugged not exactly like that she said instead of explaining what she meant she abruptly started to cross to the other side of the wide walkway i want to go into bennigers for a minute i need a new shirt jill and andrea followed her across the walkway to the large specialty shop signs hung in every window spring madness sale and all merchandise slashed forty percent you dont want to go in here diane cracked andrea all the merchandise is slashed very funny said diane i wont take long with a little smile she headed for the sportswear racks jill had the feeling that diane was tired of talking about gabe or at least of answering questions about him while diane looked at tops jill fingered through the silk scarves her mothers birthday was coming up and she was looking for an inspiration but instead of concentrating on the scarves she kept thinking back to the picnic to everything that had happened with gabe from when he had goaded max into setting the fire until he had put his hand in the candle flame it must have hurt she thought what had he been trying to prove and who had he been trying to prove it to as she idly looked through the scarves she found one in bright shades of purple and pink her mothers colors she turned to show it to the other girls but they were nowhere in sight probably trying on clothes she thought she held on to the purple scarf and began looking through the rest suddenly a piercing shriek filled the store no a voice screamed in panic and terror go away leave me alone jill froze her heart pounding the anguished voice was dianes chapter dropping the purple scarf jill ran as quickly as she could to the back of the store then through the curtains that hid the dressing room area turning the corner she literally bumped into andrea whoa she said sorry did you hear i couldnt miss it said andrea i was the one she was yelling at what jill looked at her friend in confusion is diane all right whats going on ask her yourself said andrea shrugging all i know is i was going to try this on she held up a limegreen tshirt so i went into what i thought was an empty dressing room only it turned out diane was in it well did she think you were trying to break in on her or what i dont know said andrea she just went berserk and she wasnt even undressed she was just unbuttoning one of the shirts jill frowned well you know how modest she is she said after a moment i mean she always dresses in the stalls in phys ed sure i know that said andrea but this is crazy maybe id better look in and see if shes all right said jill if i were you id leave her alone till shes through in there said andrea anyway i still want to try on this tshirt hold my purse will you she stepped into one of the booths while jill waited in the corridor what in the world could be wrong with diane she wondered andrea returned without the tshirt no luck she reported jill scarcely heard her why is diane taking so long she asked herself maybe i should just go in there and find out but at that moment diane came out of the dressing room holding several blouses on hangers as soon as she spotted her friends she smiled sheepishly im sorry about before andrea she said i just didnt recognize you when you came in the dressing room didnt recognize me said andrea in disbelief whod you think i was freddy kreuger i was thinking about something else diane said i wasnt expecting anyone to come in well no problem said jill but she wasnt sure about it diane still looked upset and despite her sarcasm andrea seemed bothered by the incident jill remembered the sound of dianes scream the sheer terror in it andrea must have done or said something to have frightened diane so badly whether she realized it or not but what pulling into her driveway jill realized that she had forgotten to buy the purple scarf in all the excitement and her mothers birthday was in just a few days her mom said she had everything she wanted but jill still wanted to get her something special maybe if she hung out with her parents for a while shed get some other ideas she went into the kitchen and poured a glass of ginger ale then followed the sounds of the television to the family room her parents were sitting on the sofa watching the tube while mittsy sat on the ottoman grooming her long shiny fur jill smiled to herself when she saw that her parents were holding hands whenever they did that she was a little embarrassed but she also thought it was kind of sweet theyd been married for over twenty years and still did that kind of stuff hi she said hi dear said her mother how was shopping okay she said youll be happy to hear i didnt buy anything jill sat on the ottoman and picked up mittsy were watching a nature show said her father its about the attempts being made to save the amazon forest mittsy seemed to be interested is that right mitts said jill she raised her eyes then to check out the show thick green foliage filled the screen along with the droning voice of an earnestsounding announcer oh look mittsy she told her pet theres one of your little cousins its an ocelot see mittsy wriggled as jill attempted to turn the cats head toward the screen persians jill said in mock disgust they have no interest in culture hal called while you were gone jills mother said hes thinking of bringing a girlfriend home for spring vacation really said jill hal was her older brother and hed been away at college for three years most of the time she didnt miss him but she wasnt sure she liked the idea of his bringing a girl around that sounded serious he wanted to know how youre doing added her father we told him about the good grades youve been getting im sure he was just dying to hear that said jill but that reminds me i want to go over my research paper for tomorrow good night she added kissing both her parents on the cheek jill had finished everything she had to do on the paper that afternoon but for some reason she felt like being alone for a while the trip to the mall had been strangely troubling first andrea had kept going on and on about gabe and then that weird thing had happened in the dressing room between diane and andrea maybe its just spring fever she thought she put her term paper and books into her day pack then changed into her nightgown and washed her face she was just weaving her long hair into a single braid when the phone rang hello she glanced at the clock by her bed it was almost eleven oclock jill said a familiar voice she couldnt quite place i hope its not too late to call i was just getting ready for bed she said annoyed who is this its gabe for a moment she couldnt answer for some reason her heart had started beating really fast jill are you there im here she said hi gabe then as casually as she could say it she added whats up nothing much he said ive been really busy for the past couple of days and havent seen you much whatve you been doing the usual stuff she said you know school gymnastics shopping but you knew that you were at lunch today when andrea and diane and i made plans to go to the mall i guess i wasnt paying attention said gabe besides i wanted to talk to you in private what about she asked oh things he said she imagined she could see his mocking smile what kind of things well for instance he said shadyside things you know youre always telling me what a great place shadyside is well it is so so i was thinking maybe youd like to show me some of those great things up close and personal well sure said jill confused any time whatever you want to see we can borrow nicks fathers car and go not with the other kids he said you and me me and you get it oh said jill she suddenly realized that he was asking her out so what about this weekend he asked saturday night well uh ill have to check said jill whats the matter afraid ill do something crazy jill was too surprised to answer the truth was she was a little afraid of what he might do gabe laughed dont worry i never do anything without a good reason what do you mean said jill totally confused never mind said gabe sounding more serious the things you dont know cant hurt you now what about saturday night or would friday be better saturdays fine jill said making a sudden decision really great he said you be thinking about the best things to do in shadyside on a saturday night ill pick you up at seven gabes voice sounded in her mind long after she hung up the phone a part of her was excited by the thought of going out with him she had felt attracted to him from the first time shed seen him but another part was nervous for one thing andrea was making no secret about how she felt about gabe what would andrea say if she found out for another thing gabe was so unpredictable what had he meant when he said he never did anything without a reason or that what jill didnt know couldnt hurt her what was it she didnt know and how could it hurt her chapter and on the left you see the scenic division street mall with bargain hunters and other exotic life forms up ahead and to the right is historic arnolds gas station open seven days a week max was speaking in a highpitched nasal voice and jill couldnt help laughing he sounded exactly like a bored tour guide just behind us piped up nick also aping a tour guide is mrs mccormack the slowest driver in three counties and over to the left he raised his hand to point and the car suddenly swerved into the next lane nick will you keep your eyes on the road jill tried to sound upset but she was laughing too hard andrea sitting beside her on the seat was laughing too and even diane sitting on jills other side was giggling okay girls whats next max swiveled his head around from the middle of the front seat gabe sitting next to him had his head against the door he seemed to be asleep ask gabe said andrea weve all lived in shadyside forever gabe gabe stretched and yawned elaborately well lets see ive seen the main drag the river drive the mall and a gas station i dont know if i can take much more oh cut it out gabe said diane sounding exasperated it was your idea to cruise by those places in case youve forgotten well yeah okay gabe admitted i mean ive got to be able to find my way around town but what about that weird place you guys told me about fear street we never went on it to get to dianes cabin remember we went a roundabout way fear street coming up said nick swinging the wheel around as nick gunned the car down old mill road toward fear street jill felt a shiver of excitement move down her back you sure youre ready for this gabe cracked max were talking serious stuff here ghosts evil spirits vampires bring em on said gabe then he stuck his head out the window of the car and repeated at the top of his voice bring em on im ready andrea was laughing again her eyes glued to gabe jill thought it was funny too but somehow she wasnt so sure he had the right attitude about fear street after a few minutes the streetlights became more infrequent and nick turned onto fear street slowing the wagon to a crawl this is it max said resuming his tourguide voice fear street end of the line this is it said gabe in obvious disbelief this is your famous haunted street doesnt look like much does it said max but appearances can be deceiving see that house across the street the one with the green shutters yeah well two years ago the police found six human skeletons buried in the backyard over there are the ruins of simon fears old mansion said andrea you can just make it out in the dark im terrified said gabe sounding anything but past the cemetery and through the woods back there said diane see how dark it is a house burned down during a halloween party last year and nearly killed everyone in it and some friends of mine were nearly murdered by a nut with a chain saw at that house on the comer said jill getting into the spirit of things i know a girl whose parents disappeared from here added nick everyone was talking at once now remembering stories about fear street and the terrible things that had happened on it finally gabe put his hands over his ears and started laughing whoa he said youre scaring me to death but all this stuff is real said andrea it all really did happen maybe so said gabe but to me it just looks like a bunch of old houses i want to see something really scary well we could try the cemetery said max doubtfully awesome said andrea ive never been there at night ive never been there at all said diane in a small voice are you sure its safe max there are six of us right said max thats not going to stop the undead said nick doing his awful dracula impersonation the what said gabe the undead said jill thats one of the stories about fear street the undead sometimes come out of their graves in the cemetery and roam through the woods this ive gotta see said gabe he turned again to the backseat you guys dont really believe this stuff do you well im not sure about the undead jill admitted but there is something very creepy about fear street and all those things we told you really happened added andrea well lets check out the cemetery said gabe next stop said nick cutting the engine at the end of the street beyond the turnaround loomed the wall of the graveyard got a flashlight asked diane nervously i dont think so said nick but i dont think we need one look how bright the moon is thats when the undead are supposed to come out said andrea sounding excited when theres a full moon the six teens got out of the car and started toward the crumbling walls of the cemetery jill stood and gazed at it a moment taking in the fresh night air from somewhere she caught a whiff of springtime blossoms and for a moment the cemetery seemed like any other beautiful place in shadyside so why was she suddenly nervous why did she have the feeling something bad was about to happen the others followed gabe up to the gate he knocked on it then yelled yoohoo living dead come out come out wherever you are gabe get real said andrea no one else said anything gabe unlatched the gate it swung open with a groan like a cry of pain the others followed gabe one at a time the ground was a tangle of weeds and overgrown grass and the ancient crumbling tombstones were covered with moss and scraggly vines they dont spend much on the upkeep for this place do they gabe observed no ones been buried here in years jill told him check out the gravestones some of them are really old gabe bent down and brushed moss off the carving on a tall narrow stone it was relatively easy to read the engraving in the bright moonlight dollan he read pretty ancient some of them are wild andrea said hey look at this one jill peered over andreas shoulder to read edwin dunphy born hanged as a thief gosh andrea said he wasnt much older than we are i wonder what he stole said nick it must have been something really valuable for him to get hanged justice was much rougher in those days said max right andrea cracked they probably would have executed you for setting the boys room on fire if they caught me said max calmly since nearly a week had passed and nothing had happened max had stopped worrying about the fire that reminds me said gabe straightening up and dusting off his hands you havent set a fire yet nick what nick gaped at him what are you talking about hey thats right said max its your turn buddy give me a break said nick setting fires is stupid and dangerous and fun said max you forgot fun jill was pretty sure the boys were just fooling around but she remembered how fast things had happened in the cafeteria come on guys she said its getting cold lets go none of the boys paid any attention to her diane standing next to jill was quiet but her eyes were wide with worry max set a fire gabe went on he proved hes got guts good for him said nick i dont have to prove anything then whats the problem said max its just a goof or maybe nick is afraid said gabe deliberately for a moment no one said anything gabes gone too far jill thought but nick just took a deep breath and held it then turned come on he said lets go wait said gabe nick turned back warily maybe youre right nick gabe said with exaggerated kindness maybe its not your turn yet its my turn he scanned the graveyard gabe said jill please dont lets just all get back in the car dont worry jill said gabe turning to her with a smile a little fire wont hurt anything its completely deserted out here it wont even get classes canceled he began to laugh a weird excited laugh what about that shack over there said max pointing to a rundown wooden shack it looks like an old caretakers shack said andrea also sounding excited from the looks of it no one has used it in years said gabe id probably be doing the town a favor by getting rid of it he pulled open the door and peered inside perfect he said its full of old sticks and rags ought to burn great he reached down and pushed the debris into a pile in the center of the tiny room then he reached into his pocket and pulled out a lighter hey man said nick nervously youre not really going to do it are you you dont think so said gabe he clicked on the lighter just watch me chapter for a moment gabe just stood there the flame from the lighter illuminating his face he was deathly calm and was smiling his familiar mocking smile jill sneaked a glance at the others both andrea and max were watching with their mouths half open their eyes sparkling excitedly dianes eyes too were shining but jill couldnt tell if it was from excitement or fear only nick was scowling he shook his head and turned away from gabe as for jill she wasnt sure what she felt a part of her was sympathetic to nick and agreed that fires were dangerous and stupid but another part was excited and waited eagerly to see if gabe would really do it gabe slowly stepped forward then bent down and lit the debris inside the shack instantly it blazed up and he jumped back whoa he said that stuff was dry wed better get out of here said max this shacks going to really burn right said gabe come on laughing like a wild man he led the others back through the cemetery and down to where the car was parked that was awesome said max turning back to watch the shack which was now blazing brightly i didnt think youd really do it said andrea putting her hand on gabes arm i should have known that you mean exactly what you say you bet i do said gabe now theres only one detail that needs to be tied up whats that said andrea nick said gabe hey buddy now its definitely your turn they stood for a moment watching the glow of the fire from behind the cemetery wall jill found herself thinking it wasnt that big a deal as gabe pointed out they hadnt hurt anyone and the shack itself was so rundown it was useless even diane seemed relatively relaxed about what had happened only nick was still uptight he was standing off by himself facing away from the cemetery his hands in his pockets jill was about to walk over to him when a siren began to wail uhoh said andrea someone called the fire department too bad said gabe hey nick youre going to have to drive past the fire trucks now or are you too chicken for that too nick acted as if he hadnt heard gabe but he did head for the car the sirens were louder now they all scrambled quickly into the car jill found herself in the front between max and nick while gabe was in the back between andrea and diane drive carefully nick gabe said sarcastically as they started back down fear street you wouldnt want to do something illegal and get a ticket the others all laughed except for nick jill thought gabe was being too hard on him he didnt realize how sensitive nick was if i could just talk to gabe alone she thought maybe saturday night when we go out she still hadnt told anyone she was going out with gabe and she wondered if he would say anything here they come cried max jubilantly nick pulled over while the fire trucks passed their blaring sirens shattering the quiet of fear street i still havent seen any of the undead complained gabe they were probably afraid of you said max could be said gabe you never know said diane maybe they put a curse on you come to think of it i scraped my hand when i was piling stuff up inside the shack gabe said think thats the curse let me kiss it and take the curse off said andrea while the others whistled and hooted she took gabes hand in hers and put it to her mouth what would she say if she knew gabe asked me out jill wondered hey andrea teased max you never did that for any of us everyone laughed jill had never seen andrea act so flirtatious it was as if the fires brought out a side of her no one knew existed say gabe andrea said huskily when are you going to come watch my gymnastics routine i havent had much time this week said gabe how about saturday night andrea said im busy that night gabe said smoothly how about next thursday youre on said andrea nick turned south on old mill road heading around the woods he switched on a heavymetal tape and cranked it up loud for a few minutes no one spoke as the music reverberated inside the old car jill closed her eyes listening to the beat feeling the wind from the outside rush by her face as nick approached the onramp for the interstate he slowed then turned the car around what now he said switching off the tape lets take a vote said jill its not too late to see a movie or we could go to petes for pizza or there was no immediate answer and max nudged her then pointed to the rearview mirror jill glanced up and felt her heart turn over reflected in the mirror were gabe and andrea locked in a steamy kiss chapter the music died as the credits rolled and andrea clicked the tv off then set the vcr to rewind now that she said was a terrific movie that guy the blondhaired biker was he cute or what he was pretty cute jill agreed but there was something just a little too wild about him for me thats what i liked said andrea she turned to diane who was curled up in a beanbag chair di whatd you think of the movie diane shrugged it was all right she had hardly spoken a word all evening jill looked around andreas room it was small but had everything anyone could want all built in tv vcr cd player everything was in modular cabinets which were closed and neat except when andrea was using the equipment the machine finished rewinding and clicked off andrea pointed at the stack of remaining tapes what do you want to see next whatve we got said jill a dumb comedy and a dumb actionadventure movie said andrea i never heard of either one my dad rented them i vote for the dumb comedy said jill diane i dont care said diane hey miss enthusiasm said andrea if id known you were going to be so much fun tonight id have invited a bowl of oatmeal to sleep over instead sorry said diane she settled deeper in the beanbag for a moment there was an awkward silence jill couldnt imagine what was wrong with diane okay ive got an idea said andrea lets forget the videos for a while and listen to music ive got a couple of new cds sounds good said jill andrea hopped up and popped a cd into the player it was nice of your dad to let us sleep over jill said he just made me promise thered be no get this loud giggling andrea said at that all three girls even diane started to giggle andreas mother had been out of town on business for a week and jill suspected andrea had her father twisted around her little finger i almost forgot ive got to show you what dad got me for an early birthday present said andrea youre not going to believe this she went to the modular desk unit in the corner and opened the door revealing a new laptop computer and printer wow said jill look how little it is its got lots of power said andrea it can do calculations and play games and its got a word processor dad thinks itll help me with my grades turn it on said diane lets see you print something out andrea switched on the computer then put a disk in after a few seconds the disk booted and the cursor blinked ready for input whatll i write said andrea anything said jill a poem said diane are you kidding said andrea well why not she thought a moment then began to tap on the keys after a few minutes she pressed a function key instantly the printer began stuttering and ejected a short message in bright blue ink i hope you wont think im a liar but i love it when gabe plays with fire blue ink said jill my dad got a blue cartridge by mistake said andrea he offered to take it back but i like the way it looks dont you its different said jill im not so sure about the poem though hey what do you expect said andrea im not a writer but i do think its true that computers make you more creative you dont really believe that do you asked diane suddenly believe what what you said in the poem about fire well sure i dont know said andrea it was just something i thought of on the spur of the moment its no big deal i think its a bigger deal than you realize said diane did you two see the article in the paper today you mean the article about all the fires said jill today said andrea i didnt see it it wasnt on the front page or anything said jill but there was an article about how theres been an increase in arson in shadyside it specifically mentioned fires at the school and in the cemetery wow whooped andrea her face suddenly flushed with excitement we made the paper luckily jill went on they dont seem to suspect anyone in particular thats just too much andrea said i wonder if the guys know gabe knows said diane her voice sounded strained and upset hes the one who told me about it what does he think said andrea he feels the same way about it you do said diane her voice suddenly angry he sees it all as some sort of game but its not someone could get in real trouble or get hurt jill and andrea both stared at diane jill knew how much diane feared fire but she never realized until now how serious she was about it it has to stop diane went on the whole fire thing in other words said andrea sarcastically just because sweet little diane doesnt like fire the rest of us have to stop having fun andrea there are plenty of ways to have fun without setting fires said diane maybe so said andrea but i dont know who said you can dictate to the rest of us what we do and dont do fine said diane but if you guys are going to keep setting fires then im not going to hang out with you anymore hey girls come on jill had been listening to the argument with growing concern she had to admit shed been just as excited as everyone else by the fires but she thought diane had a point dianes right andrea she said trying to placate her friend this fire game could get someone in a lot of trouble great said andrea now youre on her side too im not on anyones side but weve been good friends for a long time and i dont want to see anything break that up besides i think the guys are getting too competitive about setting fires you mean gabes the only one with any guts gabe takes it too seriously said jill they all do thats the whole point i think we ought to tell them to stop it theyll listen to you jill said diane i know they will i dont know said andrea she had begun painting her fingernails and seemed bored with the whole discussion jill was trying to think of another argument to use on andrea when the phone rang will one of you get that asked andrea she was holding her hands in front of her face blowing on the nails as they dried jill picked up andreas red trimline phone hello is this miss andrea hubbard said a gruff officialsounding voice shes busy right now said jill may i take a message just tell her said the gruff voice that this is inspector lindsay of the shadyside fire department we want to ask her some questions about a suspected case of arson chapter for a moment jill felt as if her heart had stopped theyve found us she thought jill what is it diane was staring at her with alarm jill waved at her to be quiet who did you say you are she asked hoping she had heard wrong inspector lindsay repeated the voice of the shadyside fire department his voice cracked slightly and jill felt relief flood through her relief and anger max you dork she shouted i dont know any max said max this is inspector i know its you jill cut in and youre very funny as funny as a coffin hows the slumber party girls it was nicks voice on maxs other phone everythings just peachy said jill sarcastically and i dont remember anyone inviting you she hung up the phone before either boy could say more what did max want asked andrea applying a coat of quick dryer he wanted to show how clever he is said jill he said he was a fire inspector but the awful part is for a minute i believed him what a dweeb said andrea maybe said jill but it could have been real now are we going to stop this stupid fire game or not andrea sighed oh all right i guess it wouldnt hurt to cool things awhile especially now that the police are looking into arson thank heaven said diane smiling broadly thanks both of you she quickly hugged each of her friends in turn this is the best thing for all of us youll see she picked up her pink overnight bag and disappeared into the bathroom andrea shook her head i guess i didnt realize before how strongly diane felt about fire i didnt either said jill in fact said andrea its hard to believe she and gabe are such good friends why do you say that theyre just two completely different people said andrea the fire thing is only part of it dianes shy gabes outgoing hes really much more your type or mine its now or never jill thought ive been meaning to talk to you about gabe she said im going out with him tomorrow night really said andrea she didnt seem at all upset well thats very interesting because hes spending next thursday afternoon and evening with me to work on the music for my floor routine well thats great said jill except andrea added im planning to work on a lot more than my routine she looked jill in the eye then flashed her a mischievous smile have a good time tomorrow night jill just keep in mind that im not backing off as they used to say in the movies may the best man or woman win the moon was just past full and all around it a million stars were shining a soft breeze floated the scent of spring flowers and jill thought it was the most romantic evening she had ever spent in her life across from her sitting on a picnic table gabe was softly strumming his guitar his eyes closed as he sang a slow sad song with the moonlight shining on his face he looked very handsome jill thought there wasnt a trace of the wild gabe just the sensitive one when he picked her up she wondered how he would behave around her parents but he had been as her mother would put it a perfect gentleman he had even held the car door open for her which was strange and sweet at the same time what a perfect evening she thought the movie had been great but even better had been gabes idea of going to the park so that he could play music just for her ill never forget this evening she thought gabe finished the song then set the guitar down that was great said jill did you write it im still working on it said gabe with a smile you like it its better than most of the stuff they play on the radio she said gabe crossed to the bench where she was sitting and sat beside her ive had a nice time tonight he said me too she said hanging out with the other kids is fun he went on but ive been wanting to get to know you alone jill couldnt think of what to say she felt the same way but somehow it didnt seem right to say so very casually gabe took her hand so what is the real jill franks like he asked only halfteasing i think she said that im just the way i seem to be he was silent a moment i think thats true a lot of people wear masks or put on an act but you seem to be just you what about you jill said do you have a mask again gabe fell silent what do you think he said at last im not sure said jill but you seem so different now than when were hanging out with the others yeah he asked which me do you like better both of them said jill i like the way you always want to do something exciting but i also like it when you just sit and play music and talk well maybe id better do that more often he said without letting go of her hand he put his other hand on the back of her neck jill felt first as if her heart had stopped and then felt it pounding furiously never had she felt this way about a boy i think im starting to be glad my folks moved to shadyside gabe whispered im glad too said jill very gently gabe kissed her i want to stay here in this park with gabe forever she thought i dont ever want this moment to end gabe kissed her again tumbler called a cracked voice here tumbler a bright light suddenly went on and jill blinked against it turning her head whatre you oops excuse me it was mr morrissey who owned the deli across the street he switched off the flashlight sorry to bother you my dog got out dont suppose youve seen him have you no said gabe but we werent really looking for him i guess not said mr morrissey he chuckled well sorry to disturb you tumbler he called walking off here tumbler on the other hand gabe said laughing shadyside is a very weird place jill laughed too the magic moment had been broken but it didnt seem to matter hey said gabe checking his watch its later than i thought id better get you home dont want to get your folks mad at me on our first date first date jill thought that means he wants to go out with me again gabe packed his guitar into its case then picked it up and taking jills hand began to walk with her out of the park ive had a great time gabe jill said theres just one thing i want to talk to you about she hesitated to bring up the fire game but she and the other girls had agreed besides she was a little worried about nick sure said gabe what is it they were parked near petes pizza which was two blocks away its about the fire the fire game jill said the fire game is that what you call it asked gabe well what about it andrea and diane and i had a serious talk about it and and we want it to stop are you serious gabe stopped walking to turn to her the old mocking smile on his face why because its dangerous and illegal and were afraid someones going to get in trouble besides i think the other boys are taking it too seriously especially nick gabe shook his head no way jill he said smiling at her youre the one whos taking it seriously its just a goof and its not like were running around setting fire to everything we see well but now jill was confused but nothing said gabe if youre so worried about the other guys ask them how they feel about it theyll tell you the same thing i just did come on now chill out oh gabe she said maybe youre right sure i am he said they started walking again the way he put it it didnt seem that serious she and diane were both overreacting they turned the corner onto main street there was a big crowd in front of petes pizza ive never seen a line like that said jill they must be having a sale on pepperoni or something i wish we had time to check it out said gabe but as they got closer jill saw that the crowd wasnt waiting to get into petes at all gabe its a fire someones car is on fire gabe saw it too hey its my car hold this he handed her the guitar and began sprinting down the block gabe she shouted holding the guitar awkwardly at her side she ran after him the car was blazing furiously the interior a mass of red and yellow flames the crowd had started to move back from the intense heat get back someone shouted its going to blow but gabe was running directly toward the fire ive got to do something he cried gabe no jill dropped the guitar and ran after him as fast as she could she threw her arms around him from the back he struggled with her like a crazy person and broke away from her no she shouted stop gabe come back an instant later the fire reached the gas tank with a deafening roar the car exploded chapter jill stood in the crowd holding gabes guitar behind a wooden barrier the fire fighters had set up the ruined hulk of the car continued to smolder and the air was filled with the stench of burned rubber and gasoline in front of the barricade gabe his clothes and face still covered with dust and soot from being blown to the sidewalk when the car exploded was talking to the fire chief and two police officers she couldnt hear what they were saying but gabe was gesturing angrily pacing and shaking his head she had never seen him so upset why did this have to happen she asked herself everything had been so perfect finally the officials finished with gabe and he came back to jill i dont believe it he said they wanted to know if i set the car on fire they probably have to ask questions like that said jill why would i do it he went on and its not even my car its my fathers im so sorry jill said im sure hell understand it wasnt your fault hes only had the car a few months gabe went on i cant believe it he began to pace up and down the sidewalk do you know what the fire chief said he said they wont know for sure till the car cools down but it looks like arson arson jill tried to sound shocked but she wasnt really who would do such a thing and why why is easy said gabe jealousy as for who well i have some ideas about that an hour later jill sat staring at her telephone feeling cold and sick inside the fire game has to stop she said out loud ever since gabe had told her that the fire chief suspected arson jill had known who set the fire it was nick it had to be it was his turn after all gabe hadnt let him forget it for a minute even worse gabe suspected nick too diane must have told him how nick felt about jill but could he really have done such a terrible thing out of jealousy maybe gabe had really pushed nick too far the other night in any case jill meant to find out she picked up the phone and punched in nicks number hello nicks voice sounded groggy nick its jill she said oh yeah how you doing what time is it its a little past midnight she said then she took a deep breath and plunged right in nick how can you possibly sleep after what you did huh i know what you did tonight she went on dont bother to deny it why should i deny it said nick sounding slightly more awake i was home alone all night i watched the fly the old one and the new one you did more than that what are you talking about nick sounded genuinely puzzled nick i know that you set the fire it had to be you what fire are you denying that you set gabes car on fire someone set gabes car on fire said nick then suddenly his voice turned angry of course i deny it how can you accuse me well said jill it was your turn next everyone knows that well youre not supposed to be everyone youre supposed to be my friend nick its okay jill pleaded you can tell me i just called because i think the fires have to stop i didnt set the fire said nick and if you dont believe me thats your problem jill was about to protest again but before she could nick hung up on her suddenly jill was worried about more than just the fire game she was worried about nick too this whole thing had gone much too far she glanced nervously at her bedside clock then decided to call andrea she was never going to be able to sleep anyway and andrea usually stayed up late watching tv hello with relief jill heard andreas wideawake voice hi its jill she said what are you doing home so soon said andrea i thought you had a date with gabe tonight well i did said jill and thats what i want to talk to you about i hope youre not going to ask me to break my date with him said andrea because i wont no no said jill listen to me something terrible happened there was another fire really andrea sounded interested what did he set on fire this time it wasnt gabe who set the fire jill said it was nick at least i think it was he set gabes car on fire it exploded really andrea sounded even more interested that must have been awesome i wish id been there it wasnt awesome it was horrible said jill gabe was so upset i couldnt even talk to him and nick denies that he did it and i just dont know what to do hey calm down you sound really upset i am andrea weve got to make the guys stop setting fires what do you want to do follow them around with a fire extinguisher andrea though come to think of it andrea went on i wouldnt mind following gabe around will you be serious i am serious andrea said but i dont really think its as big a deal as you think it is i mean sure its terrible that gabes car burned up but maybe itll all stop now after all theyve each set one fire true said jill anyway theres nothing we can do about it tonight what id really like to talk about is your excuse the expression hot date except for the fire how was it it was nice jill said suddenly feeling very sad it was nicer than i expected it to be but the fire ruined things is that what youre saying sort of jill admitted well too bad andrea said maybe ill be luckier when i see gabe on thursday yeah maybe jill said well ill talk to you tomorrow after she hung up jill felt worse than ever she got ready for bed then pulled the covers up and closed her eyes she tried to remember how wonderful she had felt with gabe in the park but the memory was already fading when she tried to picture him playing the guitar and singing to her all she could visualize was his angry expression after the car burned what would happen when he went out with andrea she wondered would he sing the same songs to her hold her hand kiss andrea the way he had kissed her and what about the fire game would it really be over now as andrea predicted much later jill was awakened by a familiar and now terrifying smell smoke her heart thudding in her chest she sat straight up in bed no she thought not here it cant be the smell grew stronger and she realized she had to warn her parents she opened her mouth to scream but no sound would come out it was as if the smoke were choking her choking back her voice feeling faint and weak she struggled out of bed and down the hall calling to her parents but the sound that came out was only a feeble squeak more frightened than ever she pulled open their bedroom door and saw their bed empty no she was alone alone with the fire she turned and ran down the hall the reflection of red and orange flames came from somewhere downstairs she stumbled down the stairs fighting for breath with every step feeling as if her body weighed a thousand pounds the glow of the fire was coming from the kitchen terrified yet drawn to it she followed the glow and saw that flames were coming out of the stove frantic she ran for the bucket in the closet then filled it with water and poured it over the stove again and again she filled the bucket and doused the fire finally it sputtered and sizzled out the stove in front of her was blackened with soot terrified of what she would find she opened the oven where the fire seemed to have started oh no no please no there black and charred lay the body of mittsy chapter with her own scream ringing in her ears jill sat bolt upright in bed it had been a nightmare a dreadfully vivid nightmare mittsy was alive and well curled up next to her on the covers she clutched the soft little cat and hugged her close ill never get back to sleep she thought she got up and went downstairs to the kitchen there was no trace of fire not the slightest smell of smoke she opened the refrigerator and poured a glass of milk it was only a dream she thought again a nightmare but part of the nightmare was real the part that had to do with the fire game it had to stop it just had to i hate algebra jill thought staring at a page full of mysterious symbols it was going to take her the entire study period just to get started on these stupid problems i hate it she whispered aloud behind her someone whispered in her ear what do you hate it was nick it was the first thing hed said to her since he hung up on her the other night algebra jill said surprised and relieved i hate algebra its not so bad whispered nick slipping into the empty seat beside her you just have to look at it the right way i bet you were never good at fractions were you no said jill but so what im just missing the part of the brain that does math probably agreed nick he looked up then was silent a moment as mr borden the studyhall monitor walked by when the teacher had gone he resumed whispering hey bet i can show you some things about fractions that will make algebra a snap really jill couldnt help smiling ill believe it when i see it but if it works it would be great itll work said nick why dont you come over to my house tonight and we can get started jill thought a moment sure why not thanks nick driving over to nicks house jill felt optimistic once again not only was she going to get help with her algebra she might also be able to talk to nick about the fire game to get him to promise never to set another fire shed decided that was the best way to do it to get the guys one by one to agree to stop nick really liked her and even if he had set gabes car on fire she was sure he would listen to her she turned the corner onto front street and was about to pull up in front of nicks house when she saw a familiar car backing out of the driveway it was nicks fathers station wagon and nick and max were in the front seat hey she called rolling down the window hey guys either they didnt hear her or they were deliberately ignoring her because the car continued roaring down the street whats going on she wondered had nick forgotten the study date or was he playing some kind of mean trick on her she decided to find out staying behind the brown station wagon but not getting too close to it she started to follow the boys at first she was afraid that they would see her but they were busy talking to each other not paying any attention to who might be behind them for a moment going through the center of town she lost the car but then picked it up again as it turned north on old mill road where are they going she wondered she continued to follow the car until nick signaled for a right turn onto fear street it was a dark cloudy night and the area seemed to be more deserted than ever the street lamp at the corner of old mill road and fear street had burned out and huge shadows grew on every side of her i dont really need to follow them anymore jill thought i know theyve gone to fear street but she still didnt know why and she had an idea it might be important she pulled the car over and checked to make sure all the doors were locked then turned onto fear street there was no sign of the wagon or the boys it was as if they had disappeared into a black hole worried she squinted to see as far down the street as she could they must have pulled into a driveway somewhere she thought the only thing she could do was cruise the street checking out each driveway as she passed driving as slowly as she could jill headed down the deserted street in the direction of the cemetery somehow all alone in the dark it seemed much scarier than it had the other night with her friends she remembered some of the stories theyd been telling about the terrible things that had happened in the different houses and she felt a shiver pass through her she studied each house she came to but there was no sign of the boys they had to be here fear street was a deadend street there was no way out dead end no way out stop it jill told herself she took a deep breath and kept driving suddenly her car started to shudder and then the engine died no jill cried aloud in annoyance again and again she turned the key stepping on the gas but nothing happened somewhere off to the right a large figure came bounding across a yard and disappeared toward the woods it was a dog jill told herself just a dog she felt a trickle of perspiration run down her forehead this is ridiculous she told herself theres nothing to be scared of im in a locked car im only a block from old mill road if the car doesnt start soon i can walk back and phone for help please start she thought turning the key again the engine cranked and cranked but wouldnt catch ive probably flooded it she thought ill just have to wait for a few minutes before i try again a bat fluttered against a dim streetlight across the street and jill gasped now suddenly the deep shadows seemed to have a life of their own she thought she could see things moving at the corner of her vision but whenever she turned to stare directly at them there was nothing there except in her rearview mirror glancing up jill saw a dark figure moving toward her car her heart pounding she turned around she couldnt see any details in the gloom but there was definitely someone there walking up the street toward her car maybe its someone who lives here she thought someone out for an evening stroll maybe but in that case why was he coming directly toward her car wildly she turned the key and tried to get the engine to catch but she had no more luck than she had before a second later something hit hard against her window and she was blinded by a glaring light chapter fighting down choking panic jill tried to think what to do there was no way the car would start but maybe she could find something a weapon of some sort frantically she looked around the front seat and floor then opened the glove compartment there was nothing but the drivers manual and a halfeaten chocolate bar if only the light werent so bright whatever had hit her window hit it again then continued in a rhythmic tattoo suddenly jill realized that it was someone knocking on her window and asking her to open it no way ill do that she thought but she did roll it down a crack just enough to talk through are you all right miss asked the figure he turned his flashlight to his face and jill saw that it was a young police officer relief flooded through her im fine she said in a small voice but my car stalled and i cant get it started let me take a look said the officer can you unlatch the hood jill reached for the hood latch and popped it the police officer disappeared behind the hood a few minutes later he came back everything seems to be fine he said do you mind unlocking the door well said jill he certainly looked like a policeman and he acted like a policeman but shed heard stories of people impersonating cops and then robbing their victims or worse youre right to be cautious the young cop said let me show you my id he reached into his pocket and took out a picture id then slipped it in to her through the window jill scrutinized it comparing it with his face he was definitely a cop she had never felt so relieved in her whole life she unlocked the door then slid over as the cop sat down next to her he turned the key and to jills surprise the car started right up it wouldnt start before honest she said feeling like an idiot probably you flooded it he said while i was checking the engine it had enough time to dry out well thank you very much said jill my pleasure said the officer i hope you get where youre going soon this isnt the best neighborhood to be driving around in alone i know jill agreed thank you officer in her fright jill had almost forgotten why she was there she waited for the officer to get back into his patrol car and drive away then resumed her search for nick and max she had almost reached the cemetery with no sign of them when suddenly she spotted their station wagon parked in the yard of a rundown desertedlooking house just at the edge of the woods what in the world could the guys be doing there she cut the engine and sat watching the house for a few minutes they had to come out sooner or later but then what would she confront them or follow them again she reminded herself that shed followed them to find out what they were up to shed never have a better chance than now she took a deep breath then unlocked the door and climbed out the air was cool and she realized with a start that she wasnt wearing a jacket somewhere off in the woods an animal howled shivering she began to make her way toward the deserted house in the dark it was hard to keep her footing and she had to move slowly to avoid being tripped by a rock or overgrown vine there was no sign of life in the house and as she got closer she could see that most of the windows were broken jagged shards of glass hanging from their frames like icicles what are the boys doing here she wondered again she heard a loud thumping from inside the house and stopped in fright she was about to start moving toward it again when there was a sudden brilliant flash and the house erupted into flames squinting against the sudden brightness she saw nick and max running at top speed toward the car parked out front chapter as jill watched horrified the fire spread until the house seemed to be the center of one large flame she could hear the crackling and popping of burning wood and she felt the heat even out there by the street through the smoke she saw the brown station wagon pull out of the yard and then roar off down the street there was too much smoke for her to see her friends faces but she imagined they both were laughing jill pulled into the garage but didnt make a move to get out of the car in her minds eye she could still see max and nick running away from the fire on fear street the fire they had set she was pretty sure that they hadnt seen her there maybe they didnt care if she had seen them obviously they had gotten out of control as far as the fire game was concerned after nick and max had driven off jill had gone directly to the fire box on old mill road and pulled the alarm then she drove around for a while until she finally decided she had to go home to figure out what to do next part of the reason she was so upset she realized was that the fire game had changed her relationship with all her friends there wasnt even anyone she could discuss it with max and andrea both acted as if there were nothing wrong with setting fires and because of gabe she didnt feel comfortable confiding in andrea anyway diane was completely irrational on the subject of fire and nick nick was the biggest problem of all he had been the one who had seemed completely against the fires from the start now he had just set two fires she locked the car and went in her parents were out so she poured herself a glass of tomato juice then took mittsy up to her room she hugged her pet for a while then decided to study to take her mind off the fire game and her feelings of guilt about it but when she sat down at her desk the first thing she saw was her algebra book which shed brought in from the car it reminded her of nick and how hed gone to set a fire instead of studying with her that night i give up she cried irritably shutting the book she decided to do yoga exercises to calm down she switched on the little portable tv she kept on her dresser then sat on the rug and stretched to the sounds of canned laughter as an old episode of threes company came to an end she was doing a shoulder stand when the news came on the governor vetoes a capital punishment bill said the anchorperson a homeless man dies in a suspicious fire and more warm weather ahead these stories and more coming up on metro news tonight jill continued to stretch halflistening to the news she was just starting a halfforward twist when the anchor said police suspect arson in a fatal fire tonight in shadyside for more on the story we go to tip teppler jill stopped stretching and sat up straight her heart thudding the tv showed a handsome man with styled blond hair holding a microphone in the background could be seen a confusion of fire trucks and the blackened silhouette of a burned house thank you heidi said the reporter im reporting from fear street in shadyside where fire fighters struggled for nearly two hours to contain a fire in an abandoned house fire fighters arriving on the scene found a homeless man unconscious on the front porch efforts to revive him at the scene failed and he was pronounced dead on arrival at mercy hospital the apparent victim of a heart attack with me is lieutenant ed heasly chief fire warden for the shadyside fire department lieutenant is it true that this fire was deliberately set the camera switched to another man this one weary looking with rumpled thinning brown hair it looks that way tip said lieutenant heasly we wont know until we complete our investigation but the fire appears to have been deliberately set isnt it true tip teppler went on that there has been an increase in arson in shadyside in the last few weeks thats true also said heasly were currently pursuing several leads but we cant say more right now i can tell you this since this fire involves a death we arent going to rest until we find the arsonists thank you lieutenant heasly the reporter said this is tip teppler reporting live from shadyside now back to you in the studio heidi feeling dizzy jill switched off the set the reporter had been standing in front of the house she herself had visited earlier that evening the house that nick and max had set on fire the house that wasnt deserted at all but had had a homeless man living in it a homeless man who was now dead the reporter said that the man had died of a heart attack but firemen had found him unconscious that meant that the fire had caused his death directly or indirectly and it meant that max and nick were murderers and she was a witness chapter for a long time jill stared at the blank television screen then she picked up the phone and her heart thudding punched in nicks number hello he sounded sleepy but completely normal maybe he hadnt heard about the homeless man yet hi this is jill she said i i was just calling to find out why you werent home for our study date oh said nick sounding surprised then he quickly went on im sorry but max got lastminute tickets to the basketball game in waynesbridge i tried to call you but your line was busy thats really lame nick she said hey im sorry he said ill make it up to you ill come over tomorrow and i mean your lie is lame she interrupted you didnt go to any basketball game tonight did you sure i did nick said just ask max its bad enough hearing it from you i dont want to hear the same lies from max you didnt go to the basketball game you went to fear street nick didnt answer for a moment when he did he sounded cautious what makes you think so i saw you there she said you saw me there at the house the one that you and max set on fire i dont know what youre talking about nick said jill thought he sounded very nervous did you see the news on tv tonight she asked no but what does that have to do with it so happens that there was a homeless man living in that house jill said and the fire caused his death what nick sounded shocked this is a joke right its no joke jill said sadly i saw it on the news they had a picture of the house it was the same one the one where i saw you and max oh no nick said i cant believe it someone died the fire caused him to have a heart attack jill said and the fire chief said theyre looking for the people who did it you and max we didnt set the fire nick blurted out then you admit you were there we were there said nick but we didnt set any fire what were you doing there asked jill even though she had known nick was lying before for some reason she believed him when he said he hadnt set the fire this is going to sound crazy said nick and if the police ever find us theyll never believe us calm down jill said what were you doing there just before you were supposed to come over and study nick said someone knocked on the front door when i opened it no one was there instead there was a note it was addressed to me and it said to come to the house on fear street for some real action who was it from it wasnt signed said nick and then about five minutes later max came over someone had left the exact same note at his house we both thought it was so weird we decided to check it out right away you should have waited for me said jill then youd be in trouble too said nick gloomily to be honest the note was so strange i forgot all about our study date he sighed this is terrible i dont know what to do dont do anything yet said jill im going to talk to the others maybe we can get together and figure out what is going on i hope so said nick are you sure you heard the tv story right im sure said jill talk to you later after putting down the receiver she sat very still for several minutes if nick was telling the truth and she thought he was then someone else had set the fire the only one it could be was gabe he must be completely out of control now jill thought she should have realized that he would do something drastic after his fathers car was set on fire she remembered how he vowed to get revenge on the person who had set the car fire how twisted and angry his face was it had to be him yet a part of her didnt want to believe it didnt want to believe that gabe was vengeful didnt want to believe he was a murderer even if only by accident there must be another answer she thought and the only way she was going to find it was to talk to the others separately or together talk to them all and find out what was going on her mind made up she picked up the receiver again and punched in andreas number the line was busy she waited a few minutes then hit the redial button but andreas line was still tied up not wanting to wait any longer she punched in dianes number diane picked up on the third ring hello diane its jill she said do you have a minute sure said diane whats wrong you sound upset i am upset she admitted something terrible has happened and our friends are right in the middle of it what diane sounded alarmed there was a fire on fear street tonight jill told her yes i saw it on the news diane suddenly gasped its not it wasnt set by she didnt finish the thought but jill understood what she was going to say im afraid it was nick and max were there nick says they didnt set the fire but that someone sent them a note telling them to go there oh jill how could he tell such an obvious lie im not sure hes lying said jill ive known him a long time if it wasnt them then it had to be gabe oh no said diane it couldnt have been him i mean i just cant believe hed do such a thing i never would have believed nick would set someones car on fire either said jill its the whole fire game its made them all act crazy i knew it said diane her voice trembling i knew it was wrong from the very beginning jill we have to make them stop we have to stop them now yes of course said jill i mean now diane repeated if we wait even one more day who knows what might happen listen my moms asleep ill take her car and pick you up in about ten minutes where are we going over to nicks said diane weve got to talk to him jill after nick well go see max but really diane went on this is the best thing you wouldnt be able to sleep now anyway would you well no jill admitted ill be there in ten minutes said diane and hung up i feel as if im in a dream jill thought it was getting late and she was lightheaded from lack of sleep this cant be happening she told herself i cant be involved in arson and murder but as soon as she saw the brown station wagon in nicks driveway everything that had happened earlier came flooding back into her mind and she realized that she was involved they all were to her surprise max opened the door nick called me as soon as he talked to you he told jill what are we going to do first we have to find out who set the fire said diane did you do it of course not said max i already explained what happened said nick coming in from the other room jill said you got a note diane said she sounded like a lawyer on tv yeah we wouldnt make something like that up said max annoyed nick have you still got yours i think so said nick he went to his room then came back holding a crumpled piece of paper he handed it to jill she held it so diane could read it too it said exactly what nick had reported but what he hadnt told her and what she and diane noticed at once was that it was printed by a computer in blue ink chapter neither girl said a word they just looked at each other both thinking the same thing well said max do you believe us now or do you think that we wrote it ourselves we dont think you wrote it said jill sadly i didnt mean to sound so suspicious diane added but after all jill saw you at the house on fear street yeah well someone else was there too said nick and whoever that person was set the fire did you see anyone diane asked no said nick the house seemed to be completely empty we just hung around for a few minutes and then there was this sort of thumping sound and the fire started we ran away as fast as we could well thanks for showing us the note said jill i guess wed better go now but i thought you wanted to talk the whole thing over said max i thought that was why you came here well we did said jill but its late and were all tired maybe itll be better if we just sleep on it all right said nick but he looked at her as if she were crazy it was andreas computer diane said in a shaky voice once they were back in her car i know it said jill unless unless what said diane unless theres someone else in shadyside with a blueink cartridge who knows all about the fire game i just cant believe she did it said jill me either said diane or i dont want to andreas a little wild sometimes but shes basically okay maybe theres some other explanation there must be jill agreed you dont still think it was gabe do you said diane you dont think gabe and andrea i dont know what to think jill answered all i know is i want to hear what andrea has to say about it said diane diane its awfully late jill objected so what andrea always stays up late besides were only a couple of blocks from her house jill nodded wearily she was exhausted but like diane she did want to hear andreas explanation if she had one well hi guys said andrea with a bright smile she was wearing greenstriped shorty pajamas but was wideawake jill sat on her bed feeling terrible her eyes strayed to andreas desk and the computer how are we going to do this she wondered should we just come out and but her thought was interrupted by diane who surprised her by coming right to the point we were just over at nicks house diane said what is this your night to go visiting andrea laughed listen if you want i can throw some popcorn in the microwave we didnt come here to hang out jill said we came to talk about something something very serious andrea frowned puzzled is she faking jill wondered if so shes very very convincing nick showed us the note you sent him diane said then what note the same one you sent max diane went on what are you talking about asked andrea why would i send them notes andrea we know you sent them they were printed in blue ink so what said andrea starting to sound annoyed what were these notes about they told the boys to go to a certain house on fear street for some real action what now andrea started laughing is this a late april fools joke or what its not a joke jill told her and then quickly she told andrea what she had heard on the latenight news andrea listened until jill finished explaining what nick and max had said then andreas expression changed to anger let me get this straight she said youre saying that there was a fire over on fear street that killed a man and that you think i set that fire its just a possibility said jill quickly were not accusing you of anything well youre doing a pretty good imitation andrea snapped do you really think that id set a house on fire and try to make it look like some of my friends had done it jill didnt answer she really didnt think andrea would do such a thing except that everything pointed to her how can this be happening she thought we dont want to believe it diane said sounding more distressed than ever we thought maybe you could explain about the notes for your information i dont have to explain anything to anybody said andrea her face red i thought you two were my friends we are said jill thats why were here instead instead of what asked andrea instead of at the police station turning me in for something you think i did andrea please jill begged dont think that we only forget it andrea said i know whats really behind this youre jealous of me because your date with gabe was such a disaster youre trying to get me in trouble so i wont go out with him thats not true said jill and somehow andrea went on you got diane to go along with your little game well forget it ill go out with anyone i want this isnt about gabe andrea cried diane i didnt even know he and jill had gone out were here because of what happened on fear street tonight and because of the notes what do you want andrea snapped a full confession well you wont get one because i didnt write any notes and i didnt do anything else wrong all we want to do is stop the fires diane went on her voice trembling and we want you to know that were your friends and well stand by you no matter what some friends said andrea just go away and leave me alone andrea please said jill get out andrea screamed didnt you hear me this is my house and i dont want you in here not now and not ever again andreas face was so distorted with anger that jill felt she hardly knew her she didnt want to believe that andrea had set the fire but she did believe it and from the look on dianes face she knew diane believed it too chapter jill was startled out of a deep sleep by the jangling of her bedside phone it took her a moment to realize she was awake then she picked up the receiver and managed a croaky hello jill the voice spoke in a whisper but jill had no trouble recognizing it andrea listen andrea said im sorry to call so late thats okay i had to get up to answer the phone anyway what time is it quarter past three said andrea but this is serious jill i havent been able to sleep a wink all night i keep thinking about what you and diane said when you came over now the whole evening came rushing back to jill and she knew that she was back in the nightmare of the fire game look andrea she said we werent trying to make you feel bad its just that were both so worried about the fire so you accused me of setting it andrea said her voice sounding teary we didnt mean to accuse you of anything we were just trying to find out whats going on i just want you to know said andrea her voice again under control that i didnt have anything to do with the fire but but ive been thinking and i have some ideas about the fire i think ive got it figured out she went on you mean who set the fire and why andrea agreed tell me said jill not tonight said andrea i need to do some more thinking can you get up early and meet me in the gym before classes tomorrow sure said jill but why cant you tomorrow said andrea but i will tell you this im sure that it has to do with gabe jill walked briskly in the bright spring sunshine glad for the time alone usually her father gave her a ride to school on the way to work but she had left much too early as she walked she kept going over andreas middleofthenight phone call and wondering what it might mean the night before when jill and diane had gone over to andreas house andrea had sounded genuinely angry and upset about their suspicions and over the phone she had still denied setting any fires but would someone who was really innocent get so upset over suspicions wouldnt she just laugh them off and what did andrea mean that she had figured it all out how how could she have figured out anything unless she had been in on the fire or set it herself and most disturbing of all what did she mean that it had to do with gabe the night before andrea had accused jill of being jealous because her date with gabe had gone badly but jill suspected that the opposite might be true that andrea was jealous of jill because gabe had asked her out first was that why she was accusing gabe of setting the fires but wait jill thought andrea hadnt accused gabe of anything she had just said that the fire had to do with him what could it all mean by the time jill reached school she was more confused than ever she wasnt used to being at school so early there were only a few cars in the teachers parking lot and none at all in the students lot the flower beds along the front walk were full of daffodil buds their yellow tips showing the promise of flowers just about to bloom at the end of the driveway mr peterson the head custodian was hosing off the sidewalk no one else was in view jill knew that andrea often came to school early to practice gymnastics andrea said she liked it because it was peaceful and she didnt have to worry about anyone watching her she did it so often that she had her own key to the gym jill went up the familiar front steps into the main hall her footsteps echoed in the quiet as she walked toward the gym the door was open a crack and she slipped into the huge woodpaneled gym the lights werent on but enough sunlight filtered through the windows to show all the equipment in relief at first glance the room seemed empty andrea she called andrea im here there was no answer she looked around more carefully but obviously no one was there frowning jill crossed the polished wooden floor toward the girls locker room maybe she overslept she thought after all when andrea had called shed said that she hadnt been able to sleep a wink the whole night or maybe jill suddenly thought this is just a practical joke to get back at me for what diane and i said last night or maybe andrea was talking in her sleep or maybe shes in the locker room she opened the blue door and stepped into the locker room even empty it held the familiar scent of sneakers dirty socks and sweaty bodies andrea she called andrea are you in here jill a voice called to her from the far corner where the stalls were diane jill was startled hi said diane putting down a magazine she was wearing one of her longsleeved leotards this one a brilliant blue that matched her eyes what are you doing here jill asked i could ask you the same thing said diane i got a call from andrea in the middle of the night she said she was sorry she blew up at me and asked if id come spot her this morning while she practiced her routine youre kidding said jill i thought it was a little strange diane admitted especially since she called so late but i thought maybe it would be a good way of getting her to talk about well you know so where is she asked jill home asleep is my guess said diane she asked me to be here at sixthirty so ive been waiting around ever since but no andrea she called me too said jill do you suppose this is just a trick to get even with us for last night maybe said diane doubtfully but it doesnt seem like something andrea would do besides we didnt really do anything to her last night we were just trying to help except she didnt see it that way said jill she frowned as she glanced around i guess she must have just wait a minute what diane followed jills gaze to the locker area she is here said jill look her lockers empty the girls went over to the locker bank and sure enough andreas lock was missing from her locker which was open and empty a lock presumably andreas hung on the nearest large wardrobe locker so she is here diane said maybe shes out jogging sometimes she does that for a warmup i dont think so said jill i was just outside lets go back to the gym maybe she just stepped out for a minute the two friends went back into the gymnasium half expecting to see andrea practicing on the mat the big room was still empty well shes here somewhere said diane we might as well just wait right said jill i think ill practice a little while we do she walked over to the tumbling mat and warmed up with a couple of cartwheels she was about to practice a forward roll when she saw something that didnt belong next to the balance beam something red and crumpled diane she called her heart going to her throat both girls ran over to the beam the flash of red that jill had seen was andreas leotard lying just to the side of the balance beam her arms twisted under her was andrea her body motionless her face white as paste i dont believe it diane cried shes dead chapter andrea jill felt as if her own heart had stopped beating andrea her friend didnt move or respond in any way the faint outline of a blue bruise was beginning to form on her pale forehead shes dead diane repeated her voice a frightened whisper i dont know said jill she placed her head to her friends chest and relaxed when she heard the even steady beating of andreas heart i hear her heart she said with relief and shes shes breathing thank god cried diane dont move her ill go call an ambulance the wail of the siren died away in the distance and jill sat shakily on one of the benches in the locker room looking totally drained diane slumped down next to her shes going to be okay jill said shes got to be she was so pale diane said breathily and that bruise i know said jill the ambulance had come almost immediately a few minutes later the gym had been filled with people paramedics police officers the principal and eventually miss mercer the gymnastics coach all of them had wanted to know what had happened but neither diane nor jill could tell them more than that andrea had asked them both to meet her before school because of the bruise on her forehead and because of where andrea had been found everyone assumed that she must have lost her balance and fallen off the beam how could she have done such a stupid thing diane asked echoing jills thought for the hundredth time i told her id be here to spot her why couldnt she have waited for me it doesnt make any sense said jill even miss mercer agrees andrea is simply too experienced to try a difficult routine without a spotter unless maybe she wanted to fall said diane what i dont mean consciously said diane but maybe deep inside andrea felt guilty about the fire maybe this was some sort of unconscious way for her to punish herself thats too deep for me said jill andreas not like that and you know she isnt shes the most straightforward person we know guilt does strange things to people diane said it can muddle their thinking jill it can make them do things they wouldnt ordinarily do maybe said jill but i i dont believe it in fact im not sure that andreas fall was an accident what do you mean diane asked her blue eyes suddenly wide with horror i dont know jill said almost as if they had been spoken inside her head she remembered again andreas words that the fires had to do with gabe if she had been right and gabe knew that andrea suspected him it was almost too horrible to consider but could gabe have had something to do with andreas accident i dont know jill repeated but i mean to find out youre probably wondering why i called this meeting cracked max standing at the front of the room sit down you nerd said nick anyway you didnt call it jill did and to tell the truth i am wondering why i think its obvious said jill she was sitting in an overstuffed tweed chair in the tv room at dianes house once she had figured out what she had to do and explained it to diane it had been easy to set in motion she had spoken to nick and max and diane had asked gabe gabe the last to arrive was now sitting on the rug in front of the fireplace a sarcastic smile on his face diane sat across from him in an easy chair her eyes big serious and sad looking while max and nick both slouched on the leather sofa jill had expected to feel nervous but instead she felt very much in control at last were going to find out whats going on she thought she cleared her throat and continued its obvious why were here all of you know what happened to andrea this morning and i thought we should get together to talk about it and discuss everything thats happened discuss who set the fire you mean said nick already sounding angry thats part of it said jill but also discuss what happened to andrea and why who knows why someone has an accident said max i feel really bad for andrea but i dont see what it has to do with the fire it might have everything to do with it said diane especially if andrea is the one who set the fear street fire quickly she explained about the blue ribbon in andreas printer jill and i know she did it diane went on and she knows we know what if her guilt got to be too much and she let the thought trail off and she jumped off the balance beam deliberately asked max his face full of disbelief tell us another one diane i dont know said nick it makes a little sense except i cant believe andrea was the one who set the fire what about the notes said diane im sure theres more than one person in shadyside with a blue printer ribbon said nick besides what reason would she have the competition to set fires was between us guys so youre saying one of you did it said jill i think its obvious said nick just as its obvious which one it was he directed his gaze at gabe and gabe returned the look casually are you accusing me gabe challenged hey man said nick youre the one whos in love with fire the rest of us just went along with it is that what you believe said gabe he was still smiling but it wasnt a friendly smile and his voice had acquired a hard edge that jill found frightening it had to be andrea diane protested quickly she was into the fire game from the beginning and in spite of what nick says we know that she has a blue printer ribbon we cant be sure andrea wrote the notes said jill in fact we cant be sure of anything but now that something has happened to andrea i think our trouble is only beginning what are you talking about said nick i mean what if it wasnt one of us what if it was someone else someone who found out about the fire game and knows that the fire department is investigating what do you think this is a james bond movie asked gabe im serious jill protested she hadnt actually considered it before but now that she was talking about it she realized that this had been in the back of her mind all day anyone could have found out about the fire game and what if that person wants to use it against us blackmail us or threaten us in some way and what if they first went to andrea pathetic said gabe jill realized he was speaking to her and she was suddenly filled with a sick anger whats pathetic she demanded furiously you all of you your complicated plots trying to explain something thats actually very simple oh really jill said if its so simple suppose you explain it to us she was so angry that her voice was shaking and for a moment she thought gabe looked hurt then his face changed and once again he was smiling that infuriating superior smile face it jill he said shrugging all of you enjoyed the fire game even you di it gave you a few moments of excitement for the first time in years maybe the first time ever you even got to read about yourselves in the paper so what said jill so nothing said gabe theres no mysterious stranger who wants to blackmail us theres no one mysterious at all the fear street fire the notes its obvious who did it it had to be one of us chapter a sudden spring wind had come up and jill kept her head down against the chill it was as dark as the inside of a cave and she began to imagine she saw shapes moving in every shadow maybe she should have accepted gabes offer of a ride home but then she remembered his smug sarcastic look when hed said her idea was pathetic right after gabe had said one of the group must have set the fire the meeting had completely broken down with everyone accusing everyone else nick was so angry that his usually pale face had turned red and no one had taken jills idea seriously that it might have been someone outside the group someone who wanted to get the friends in trouble or worse but what if it was some stranger jill thought what would that person possibly want with them a car turned the far corner of the street and began to slow down as it approached her why had she decided to walk it was still nearly six blocks to her house the car was barely rolling now as it drew nearer she sneaked a glance back a white taurus she had never seen the car before in her life her heart pounding furiously jill began to walk faster staring straight ahead she heard the car pull alongside her and continue to roll at the same pace she was walking wildly jill glanced around there was a house just ahead with its lights on she started to turn into the walk pretending she lived there and then the car stopped the engine cut off and the door slammed not even thinking jill ran up the walk then stumbled sprawling on the front porch she heard steps coming up the walk behind her nearly frozen in terror she opened her mouth to scream hey jill no she cried jill hey jill its me she looked up and nearly melted with relief it was gabe his expression a mixture of confusion and amusement who did you think i was he said one of the undead gabe she said i i didnt recognize your car its the rental my dad just got he said he held out a hand and pulled her to her feet then led her to the car come on get in he said okay she said in a small voice thanks she climbed into the front seat beside him he was looking at her almost tenderly the way he had on their date it had been only saturday but so much had happened it seemed like years ago gabe didnt start the car again he kept looking at her his handsome face very serious but also very kind im sorry for what i said before he said i didnt mean to come down so hard on you she didnt know what to answer jill you didnt even listen to my idea she said you just said it was pathetic bad choice of words gabe said but your idea seems a little unlikely dont you think no said jill i dont think so i mean i cant believe any one of us could have done such a terrible thing any one of us but you she thought you mean you dont want to believe it said gabe you dont want to face the fact that one of your very best friends might be an arsonist or worse isnt that right of course i dont want to believe it said jill so its easier to think that its some mysterious stranger gabe said i can get behind that no one wants to believe something bad about someone they care about he said it so seriously that jill had a sudden eerie feeling that he knew more than he was telling who do you think it was she whispered i dont want to make an accusation he said not now jill couldnt think what to say after a moment gabe sighed and started the car up again id better get you home he said he drove in silence for a moment then said almost to himself it would be better if id never come here dont say that said jill why he almost smiled are you glad im here you know i am she said but but im not glad about some of the things that have happened neither am i gabe said again serious i should have known better what do you mean never mind he said but jill i think the best thing for you to do is forget all about that fire on fear street i have a feeling the fires are over if you keep investigating you might find out that youre really playing with fire in more ways than one is that a warning she wondered or a threat she looked over at him as he drove his clear green eyes fixed on the road there was a strange expression on his face almost sad whats he trying to tell me she wondered that he set the fire himself and hes not going to do it anymore gabe pulled the car into jills driveway and cut the engine ill walk you to the door he said i can manage to be a true gentleman about two or three times a year he came around and opened her door then gently put his arm around her as he walked her to the porch once again jill felt herself melting if only she could trust him at her door he leaned down and kissed her on the cheek this has all gotten too heavy he said what do you say we forget about fires and accusations and catch a movie friday tomorrow night i i dont know said jill you dont know if youre free or you dont know if you want to go out with me there was no trace of his sarcastic smile only a look of gentleness i guess said jill im wondering if you really want to go out with me gabe understood because of andrea she nodded i like her a lot jill and im hoping she recovers from her accident soon but the other night was just one of those things she was all over me what could i do i just wanted to make sure she said that there wasnt something more going on does this mean were on for friday night sure said jill why not good he said he kissed her again this time on the lips then waited while she opened the door see you later he said jill shut the door and leaned against it her heart pounding oh gabe she thought what am i going to do about you the real question of course was what was she going to do about her feelings for him she went into the family room and found mittsy curled up on the sofa the tv playing softly in the background she switched it off her parents were out playing bridge with some friends and the house felt empty she sat petting the cat staring at the tv without seeing it and thinking about andrea gabe and the fires but mostly she was thinking about gabe maybe he was right that the best thing for her to do was just forget about the fear street fire even if he set it or knew who did he seemed to be telling her that there wouldnt be any more fires she stretched then decided to work on her algebra homework she was just heading up the stairs when the doorbell rang maybe its gabe she thought she pulled open the door and was surprised to see two men in suits standing there im detective frazier the taller one told her holding out his id this is my partner detective monroe are you jill franks yes she said do you mind if we come in we want to ask you some questions about a fire on fear street chapter come on in she said hoping that her voice wasnt shaking be casual she told herself you havent done anything wrong were sorry to bother you at this hour said detective frazier can you tell us where you were last night the twentieth last night i was out driving around jill said yes said frazier he seemed friendly and not at all suspicious our records indicate that one of our officers saw you on fear street last night just before a fire killed a homeless man he said you had some sort of car trouble thats right said jill my car stalled out do you mind telling us what you were doing on fear street asked detective monroe jill thought fast i i had a fight with my boyfriend i didnt want to be home if he called so i thought id just drive around i didnt realize i was on fear street until my car stalled detective frazier raised one eyebrow while you were on fear street did you see anything suspicious i didnt see anything at all jill said i was too busy trying to start my car she was amazed at how easily the lies came to her but what else could she do she was almost certain that max and nick hadnt started the fire and if she told about them they would be in terrible trouble but what if they did start the fire another part of her wanted to tell the policemen everything to get it all out in the open you didnt see any other people asked monroe did you see the fire no really officer she said i didnt see anything our records indicate that the fire was called in from a fire box at the corner of old mill road and fear street around the time you were there he said it must have been someone else said jill she looked at both detectives intently but their faces seemed relaxed and free of suspicion well i guess thats about it said frazier cheerfully closing his notebook we wont take up any more of your time they dont suspect me jill thought with relief if you think of anything that might help our investigation detective monroe added please get in touch he handed jill a card with his number on it and then both men lumbered out the door they were about to start down the front steps when detective frazier suddenly turned by the way he said and this time his face was not friendly if we need you we know where you are chapter jill peered through the living room curtain until the officers had driven away then feeling shaken went to her room and got ready for bed she felt sad guilty and on the verge of tears what i did was wrong she told herself lying to the police is a crime but what else could i have done she wondered if shed told about max and nick they would have been prime suspects and she was sure they hadnt set the fire even worse the whole thing about the fire game would have come out including the computer notes and andrea was already in enough trouble thinking about andrea made her feel even worse had her fall really been an accident if not what had happened and who was responsible she punched in the hospital number and asked for patient information andrea hubbard she said she was admitted this morning i just wondered how she was doing there was silence while the woman on the other end looked through her records theres no change she reported at last jill thanked her and hung up no change that meant that andrea was still unconscious she remembered how pale and broken andrea had looked that morning what if she never woke up suddenly jill realized that she couldnt go on lying that none of them could the police might not suspect her now but they knew that she had been on fear street that night someone might have seen nicks fathers car as well there was only one answer they all of them had to go to the police and tell what they knew with a great feeling of relief jill punched in dianes number diane sympathetic as ever listened to jill seriously you say the police didnt suspect you she asked no said jill but it doesnt matter i just realized this whole thing has gone too far we have to tell what we know i want you to help me convince the guys thats not going to be easy diane said doubtfully i mean nick and max were there when the fire started but they said they didnt do it and i believe them said jill the one whos going to be hard to convince is gabe he told me i should just forget about the whole thing that he doesnt think therell be any more fires when did he tell you that said diane after the meeting said jill he picked me up while i was walking home thats a surprise said diane by the end of the meeting you two werent even speaking i know said jill no offense since hes your friend but gabe is strange first he was talking really seriously about the fire and about five minutes later he completely cheered up and asked me out really said diane youre not going are you i said i would said jill but after the police came over i dont know i dont know if i want to go out with anyone until this whole thing is resolved i think youre right said diane gabes always been terribly moody and thats what i was thinking jill said i have an idea said diane why not just forget about gabe and all the others you and i can go to my parents cabin this weekend just get away from everything that sounds great said jill but what about the police i agree we should tell them what we know said diane but jill youre too upset to think straight now if we go to the cabin well have time to figure out what to tell them besides maybe by the time we get back theyll have found the person responsible and we wont have to say anything jill thought a moment it would only be for a couple of days and diane was right she was too upset to think straight gabe might be angry that she was breaking the date but the way she felt now she didnt see how she could just go out and act as if nothing had happened youre on for the weekend she told her friend in fact it sounds like just what i need chapter this was the best idea diane jill leaned against the cushions and stretched her legs out toward the fireplace it was great of your folks to let us have the cabin my dad had to work this weekend so they werent going to use it anyway said diane some of his sculptures are pretty wild said jill admiring the freeform metal sculptures that sat on nearly every fiat surface a small metal mobile hanging from the center of the room swayed noisily with every breeze that ones my favorite said diane following the direction of jills gaze dad said hell give it to me when i have a place of my own someday she stretched and yawned want more pizza im stuffed said jill instead of cooking out theyd microwaved frozen pizzas me too said diane its so nice here so peaceful said jill i told you wed be able to relax this weekend diane agreed what did gabe say when you broke your date with him for tonight he didnt get mad or anything said jill still feeling strange about the conversation i told him my parents wanted me to stay in he said he understood you know he can be nice sometimes i know said diane and at other times hes so wild if it werent for him there would never have been any fires hes always been that way said diane always wanting to do something different even if its crazy somehow jill went on i cant help feeling that gabes the key to the whole thing even if he didnt set the fire on fear street weve got to talk to him diane as soon as we get back home we will said diane but for now lets just forget everything and take it easy but i thought we agreed wed figure out what to do about the fires this weekend jill pressed dont worry said diane we will but we dont have to talk about it every single minute she yawned again im going to go take a shower now you want the bathroom first no thanks i think ill just sit here and read for a while jill picked up a historical novel shed been reading after a few minutes she realized shed read the same page over and over its no good she thought putting the book down im not going to be able to concentrate on anything till we get the whole thing about the fire settled once and for all diane didnt seem to want to talk about it and jill couldnt blame her it had been on all their minds too much but it would be better to talk it out and get it over with as soon as diane gets out of the shower jill thought im going to insist her thought was broken by the ringing of the telephone it took jill a moment to find it on a bench with dianes fathers sculpting tools hello she said hi said a wonderfully familiar voice andrea cried jill how are you recovering said andrea the doctors say im going to be fine sort of blows your little plan to pieces doesnt it what are you talking about said jill im so happy youre all right ill bet you are said andrea but you can quit pretending i know it was you when you didnt show up i started warming up on the beam probably just as you thought i would the next thing i knew someone hit me from behind it had to be you jill felt a jolt of fear run down her spine andrea she said carefully youre not making any sense youve had a bad head injury maybe you ought to get a good nights sleep and we can talk in the morning andrea laughed i may have a head injury she said but i dont have amnesia and ive had a lot of time to think i know you printed the notes too the day you came over to my house i know everything diane diane gasped jill andrea this is me jill jill andrea sounded shocked i i didnt recognize your voice i didnt know you were there diane invited me to spend the weekend jill said but what did you mean about jill listen to me said andrea urgently youve got to get out of there right away dianes dangerous i think shes the one who set the fire i know she hit me over the head but andrea that doesnt make any sense dianes terrified of fires and why would she want to hurt you to keep me away from gabe said andrea shes in love with him jill and shes crazy gabe with a sinking feeling jill began to understand but andrea she protested if what you say is true diane needs help of course she does said andrea thats what i was going to tell her i i was even going to offer to help her give herself up but jill we can talk about it later she knows youre dating gabe now youve got to get out of there please do it now but she invited me here so we could talk thats even worse please jill please just leave promise me youll leave now we can figure out what to do later jill was about to protest again but andreas urgency and fright were very real and jill began to feel a rising panic if what andrea said was true that meant diane was a murderer and she had tried to kill andrea now jill was alone in the cabin with her okay andrea she told her friend ill leave now ill call you as soon as i get back home she quickly hung up the phone then grabbed her overnight bag she could still hear the water running in the bathroom for a moment she considered telling diane that she felt sick and was going home but she remembered the urgency in andreas voice so she slipped out the cabin door and shut it behind her sliding into her car she opened her purse and fished around for her keys she usually kept them in the side zipper compartment but there was nothing there but a lipstick and a small pack of tissues switching on the car light she dumped the contents of her purse onto the bucket seat beside her no keys she shuffled through the clutter of stuff again no keys had diane taken them if so it meant that she wanted to make sure jill stayed there maybe for good chapter jill felt cold unreasoning fear move through her body ive got to get out of here she thought she slid out of the car and looked around frantically a path led through the woods away from the lake if she followed it she was bound to come to a road or maybe even another cabin one with a phone where she could call for help there was no moon and the woods were dark and forbidding she remembered hearing somewhere that the fear street woods were much darker than woods anywhere else she didnt even want to think about the other things shed heard about the woods such as the stories about the living dead who roamed through them at night or the fact that some people who had ventured into the woods had never been seen again at the edge of the path she forced herself to stop and take three deep breaths to calm down she glanced back at the cabin and saw the bathroom light go out diane knows im gone now she realized without another thought she began to follow the path straight into the dark thicket of trees and shrubs in a very short time jill found herself in total darkness the light from dianes cabin was a memory she was walking as quickly as she could but had to be careful to stay on the path ouch she walked into a thick bush something yelped then skittered off behind her a raccoon she thought or maybe a bird she kept walking more careful than ever to stay on the path and then she became aware of a sound behind her the sound of someone walking of dry twigs breaking in a regular rhythm someones after me she thought or something her heart was pounding so hard she could hardly breathe just ahead she saw a break in the trees she deliberately stepped off the path then froze behind a large oak waiting for the thing that was stalking her to pass the sounds of footsteps continued but she couldnt see anything a moment later the sound faded away into the distance maybe it was just the wind she thought maybe in any case she didnt dare follow the path any longer instead she struck out through the trees trying to keep herself oriented away from the lake theres got to be a cabin out here she thought lots of people have places in the woods but there was no sign of a light only woods and more woods with sudden horror she realized she was no longer sure where the lake was or even the path it was so dark she couldnt be sure what direction she had come from this cant be happening she thought i cant be out in the middle of the fear street woods at night and alone i cant be lost but she was she forced herself to stop and catch her breath maybe she could just wait here where she was until daylight sure jill she told herself just wait here in the dark with the living dead walking around and a murderer after you she felt so frightened she wanted to laugh or cry more slowly now she began to walk again back toward the lake she realized now that she should have done that in the first place if she followed the lake around she would surely run into other cabins there was even a little grocery store on the side of the lake across from dianes parents cabin thats it she told herself find the lake she kept going in what she hoped was the right direction after what seemed a very long time but was probably only minutes she saw a light in the distance the light was moving its a flashlight she thought its someone who can help me weak with relief she began to stumble toward the light hello she called im lost can you help me of course i can said the person holding the light the figure stepped closer and jill felt her heart sink to the bottom of her feet it was diane chapter what are you doing out here diane asked her blue eyes wide with surprise above the flashlight jill i was so worried about you she was wearing a jacket over her robe and her hair was still wrapped in a towel from the shower for a moment jill couldnt think of a single thing to say how had diane found her diane answered as if she had read her thoughts when i saw you werent in the cabin i thought i dont know what i thought but i was scared then i found your car keys lying on the porch i was lost jill said bewildered how did you find me i followed your footsteps said diane you walked in a circle the cabins right over there jill turned to face where diane was pointing sure enough the glow from the cabin lights was visible through the trees but what in the world are you doing out here diane repeated its not safe in the woods at night i know said jill i just just wanted to get some fresh air well its cold said diane look at you youre shivering here take my jacket she slipped out of her jacket and put it over jills shoulders poor jill you must really be upset to do such a foolish thing come on back in the cabin we can talk about it if you want jill didnt know what to think diane seemed just like herself always worried about other people how could the things andrea had accused her of be true on the other hand the panic in andreas voice had been real but even if it was true even if diane had set the fire what could diane do to her jill was bigger than diane and if she had set the fires maybe she did want to talk about it maybe if jill just went inside and played it cool she could find out what was going on the cabin was warm and cheery after the terrifying moments out in the woods and jill stood close to the fireplace trying to get warm ill make some tea said diane itll just take a minute why dont you wrap up in that blanket and sit close to the fire jill did as diane suggested and sat by the hearth shivering she watched as diane heated water her pretty face lined with worry how could diane have possibly done the things andrea accused her of she wondered shes so sweet and so caring maybe andreas accident had somehow affected her mind thanks jill said as diane brought her the tea just sip it slowly said diane she sat on a worn leather ottoman across from jill how am i going to bring up what i want to talk about jill wondered but diane saved her the trouble i thought i heard the phone ring while i was in the shower diane said who was it jill took a deep breath it was andrea really said diane surprised but i thought she was still unconscious she came out of it said jill shes going to be all right but diane she had some things to say that were really upsetting things about you me what do you mean said diane i mean said jill swallowing that andrea thinks you were the one who wrote the notes the notes said diane you mean the ones printed in blue ink andrea thinks i did that yes said jill but thats ridiculous said diane it was her computer we all knew that the only person who was so sure it was andreas computer was you said jill suddenly realizing that was true the rest of us kept saying it could have been another computer with blue ink are you saying you think i wrote the notes said diane she sounded shocked i dont know what i think said jill truthfully what else did andrea say diane demanded she said she said you hit her from behind while she was practicing on the balance beam she told you that diane repeated it wasnt a question yes and i suppose you believed her about that too said diane her face had changed and her expression was no longer sweet and concerned she looked angry and determined but determined about what i told you jill said i dont know what i believe diane sighed and then she smiled very strangely all right jill i guess its time to tell you the truth i was the one who wrote the notes and yes i did hit andrea but why jill was horrified why diane laughed thats easy because she knew the truth and now im sorry to say you know it too chapter for a moment jill just stared at diane shocked despite what andrea had told her in spite of dianes own confession she couldnt believe it was this really her friend diane sweet considerate diane who only a few minutes ago had lovingly made her a cup of hot tea she almost didnt recognize the girl who sat across from her now her usually sweet and pretty face transformed by a mocking cruel smile diane unwrapped the towel from around her head and shook her damp curly hair loose whats the matter jill she said cat got your tongue i just just cant believe it jill said oh really said diane well its true there are a lot of things you dont know jill you live in such a dream world with everything always going your way with boys falling all over you you think you can have any boy you want dont you i never thought that didnt you said diane what about gabe ive only been out with him once jill said in a small voice her feelings of shock beginning to give way to horror but you had big plans for him didnt you diane went on probably thought you could add him to your string along with nick and max then with sudden fury she added but you cant have him jill continued to stare at diane sickened and horrified by the look of hatred she saw on her face you said yourself you didnt care about him she protested you told andrea he was only an old family friend what was i supposed to say diane sneered that ive loved him since i was a little girl that theres no way gabe and i can ever be together a real friend would have figured it out diane im sorry jill spoke quickly trying to get through to her friend i never meant to hurt you i never would have dated gabe if id known how you felt and i promise i promise ill never see him again its too late diane said coldly jill felt a sudden chill what do you mean what do you think said diane i mean youll never have another chance she paused then went on almost matteroffactly for a while i thought you were different not like andrea when i saw her kissing gabe i knew i had to get rid of her but it was your idea for gabe to write music for her routine i didnt think it would go any further than that diane said thats why you hit her jill said no diane sounded annoyed i already told you i hit her because she found out that i was the one who framed her for the fire on fear street you set the fire jill asked astonished fires said diane thats plural i also set gabes car on fire but why the things that diane was telling jill seemed crazier and crazier i saw gabe with a girl in the park that night diane told her he was singing to her singing a song he wrote for me i didnt know it was you i thought it was andrea because of the way she was coming on to him so you set his car on fire jill asked in disbelief i thought it might keep him from going out with her again diane said sounding calm and reasonable anyway i didnt want him to see me and then when i spotted his dads car it was easy he never locks it but how could you have done that youre terrified of fire dianes expression changed again to one of amusement that used to be true but did you ever hear of a lovehate relationship for a long time i thought fire was my enemy but now that i know what it can do fire is my friend shes crazy jill realized how could i have known her all these months and not realized but maybe she thought maybe i helped to push her over the edge if we hadnt all gotten into the fire game maybe none of this would have happened diane she said gently again trying to break through to her friend i feel so sorry about all this and i can see that that my being here is upsetting you so if youll just give me my car keys ill go on home and we can talk about all this next week go home said diane why should i let you go home i planned this weekend jill i got rid of andrea and now its time to get rid of you shes smaller than i am jill reminded herself she cant hurt me she stood up where are my car keys diane diane smiled again and reached into the pocket of her robe you mean these she said jingling a set of keys in a black leather key case give them to me jill said if you really want them diane said get them yourself she threw the key case into the fireplace where it disappeared behind a blazing log all right then ill walk jill said starting for the door the thought of facing the fear street woods again was less frightening than staying with diane another minute oh no you wont cried diane running after her she tackled jill from behind jill felt herself falling forward she hit the floor hard the breath rushed out of her diane had her hands in jills hair and began pulling stop it jill shrieked leave me alone she twisted and struggled and finally managed to turn over but diane was on top of her again scratching and hitting her you always thought i was harmless diane gasped between blows sweet harmless little diane well what do you think now diane please stop dont jill had her arms up trying to fend off the blows but diane was amazingly strong and quick i took a selfdefense course last summer diane said smugly desperately jill grabbed at dianes robe to try to pull diane off her diane didnt move but the robe fell from dianes shoulders jill stared at diane and then screamed in horror crisscrossing dianes body from her hips to her shoulders were long ropy red scars chapter her body weak with shock and horror jill continued to stare at diane diane stood up then turned around almost as if she were modeling a new dress the horrible scars continued on her back and the backs of her arms jill couldnt even imagine the pain that had produced such hideous scars seen enough diane asked this is what happened to me four years ago i was visiting my grandmother when her kerosene heater exploded oh diane jill could hardly talk how horrible it was horrible all right said diane more than you could imagine in a hundred years there arent words for the kind of pain i felt i had no idea jill went on its hard to believe youre alive i nearly died diane said almost proudly the doctors all said i didnt have a chance but i lived jill and do you know why no jill whispered unable to tear her eyes from the horrifying sight of dianes scarred torso it was because of gabe diane said intensely he came to see me every day he brought me assignments from school he played his guitar and sang songs just for me he talked to me he gave me a reason to go on a reason to want to fight the pain and live youve been in love with him ever since yes diane said simply he is my true soulmate he gave me life for a moment her eyes filled with tears then she blinked them away i know gabe loved me too but of course he never said anything to me how could he im sure he cares for you said jill suddenly realizing that her friend was living in a fantasy world where gabe was her knight in shining armor i know but we can never be together my body is ruined it can never be it cant be diane shouted her face twisted with rage ive told him that a hundred times had she really jill wondered or was this something she had made up in her madness i know what youre thinking diane went on you think im just imagining that gabe loves me that im jealous of you and andrea well youre partly right she fixed her blue eyes on jill and spoke slowly and intently i cant ever be gabes girlfriend as i told you but if i cant have him neither can anyone else not andrea and not you miss perfect bracing for another attack jill rolled away as far as she could but diane didnt rush at her again instead she went on talking and jill listened at once horrified and fascinated by the things she was hearing oh jill diane said youre so innocent almost a baby really you dont know anything at all and you wont until you have experienced real pain diane jill said gently its not too late for you you can still get help ill go with you to a counselor maybe theres a plastic surgeon in new york or someplace diane laughed bitterly dont try to kid me jill nobody can fix this she looked down at her body with obvious loathing when the boys started their little competition with the fire you thought it was just fun and games didnt you when jill didnt answer she pressed didnt you yes jill admitted but you didnt realize diane went on that fire is a very serious thing well now im going to show you just how serious it can be with a sudden motion diane slipped her robe back on and then before jill could move or say anything she reached back to her fathers workbench and grabbed his blowtorch no jill cried pulling herself to her feet in panic but diane ran past her and stood directly in front of the cabin door this is how i started the fire on fear street it was a beautiful fire she smiled in a dreamy way as she switched the torch on then she aimed it directly at jill chapter no jill screamed again she twisted away from diane and stumbled into the couch no diane stop but diane was right behind her the couch burst into flames choking on the acrid smoke jill ran across the room she tried to open the window but it was painted shut the curtains began to blaze she twisted away from the searing heat diane was just behind her laughing maniacally touching the flame to every object jill came near everything in the cabin was smoldering now gasping from the smoke and superheated air jill tried again to reach the cabin door dianes jacket which she was still wearing caught fire and she ripped it off in panic not that way jill said diane aiming the blowtorch in her path jill broke away and rushed for the kitchen area in the sink sat a big pan full of soapy water without even thinking jill grabbed the pan and threw it at diane it hit her in the shoulder and drenched her robe but it didnt even touch the glowing flame of the blowtorch nice try jill sneered diane but youll never get away from me now again she aimed the torch at jill and again jill spun away feel the pain jill diane cried feel the pain jill could feel the blowtorch singe her hair she screamed and lunged forward tripping over the ottoman she fell hard and lay there trying to catch her breath diane was standing above her now her face blank with madness everything in the cabin blazing around her she brought the torch down slowly directly at jills face jill shut her eyes in terror feeling the scorching heat move closer and closer im gone she thought im gone then suddenly the cabin door burst open a blast of cool cool air blew through the cabin thats enough cried a strong masculine voice it was gabe do you hear me he shouted stop diane stop now dazed jill watched through the smoke as he grabbed for the torch diane pulled away surprisingly quick and gabe let out a cry of pain as the flame burned his hand for an endless moment they struggled gabe and diane then finally gabe wrestled the torch from her hand and threw it down nooo diane wailed noooo gabe took diane by the shoulders and pushed her through the flames and smoke out the door an instant later he returned and pulled jill outside he rolled her over and over on the ground extinguishing the flames that had begun to catch onto her clothes are you all right he asked at last his eyebrows were singed and thick sooty smoke covered his handsome face i think so jill whispered without another word gabe turned to diane who was kneeling on the cabin lawn her body shaking with silent sobs tenderly gabe put his arms around her and held her giant flames poured out of the cabin now and jill could hear the faint sound of sirens in the distance still holding diane gabe stared at the fire he began to speak almost as if to himself andrea called me he said she told me where you were jill she was afraid you wouldnt believe her i almost didnt jill admitted his face unbearably sad gabe went on now stroking dianes hair as he held her close poor diane that fire was so long ago i guess i didnt really want to remember how scared and sick she was i used to bring her her homework her parents said i helped her so i came but now my stupid fire game has caused this jill continued to look at gabe and diane silhouetted by the fire gabe was still talking but not to jill instead he was tenderly speaking to diane telling her again and again its over diane the fire game is over its over for good
