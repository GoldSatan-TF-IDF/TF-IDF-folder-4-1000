sartor resartus and on heroes heroworship and the heroic in history introduction one of the most vital and pregnant books in our modern literature sartor resartus is also in structure and form one of the most daringly original it defies exact classification it is not a philosophic treatise it is not an autobiography it is not a romance yet in a sense it is all these combined its underlying purpose is to expound in broad outline certain ideas which lay at the root of carlyles whole reading of life but he does not elect to set these forth in regular methodic fashion after the manner of one writing a systematic essay he presents his philosophy in dramatic form and in a picturesque human setting he invents a certain herr diogenes teufelsdrckh an erudite german professor of allerleywissenschaft or things in general in the university of weissnichtwo of whose colossal work die kleider ihr werden und wirken on clothes their origin and influence he represents himself as being only the student and interpreter with infinite humour he explains how this prodigious volume came into his hands how he was struck with amazement by its encyclopdic learning and the depth and suggestiveness of its thought and how he determined that it was his special mission to introduce its ideas to the british public but how was this to be done as a mere bald abstract of the original would never do the wouldbe apostle was for a time in despair but at length the happy thought occurred to him of combining a condensed statement of the main principles of the new philosophy with some account of the philosophers life and character thus the work took the form of a life and opinions of herr teufelsdrckh and as such it was offered to the world here of course we reach the explanation of its fantastic title sartor resartus or the tailor patched the tailor being the great german clothesphilosopher and the patching being done by carlyle as his english editor as a piece of literary mystification teufelsdrckh and his treatise enjoyed a measure of the success which nearly twenty years before had been scored by dietrich knickerbocker and his history of new york the question of the professors existence was solemnly discussed in at least one important review carlyle was gravely taken to task for attempting to mislead the public a certain interested reader actually wrote to inquire where the original german work was to be obtained all this seems to us surprising the more so as we are now able to understand the purposes which carlyle had in view in devising his dramatic scheme in the first place by associating the clothesphilosophy with the personality of its alleged author himself one of carlyles splendidly living pieces of characterisation and by presenting it as the product and expression of his spiritual experiences he made the mystical creed intensely human stated in the abstract it would have been a mere blank ism developed in its intimate relations with teufelsdrckhs character and career it is filled with the hot lifeblood of natural thought and feeling secondly by fathering his own philosophy upon a german professor carlyle indicates his own indebtedness to german idealism the ultimate source of much of his own teaching yet deep as that indebtedness was and anxious as he might be to acknowledge it he was as a humourist keenly alive to certain glaring defects of the great german writers to their frequent tendency to lose themselves among the mere minuti of erudition and thus to confuse the unimportant and the important to their habit of rising at times into the clouds rather than above the clouds and of there disporting themselves in regions closebordering on the impalpable inane to their too conspicuous want of order system perspective the dramatic machinery of sartor resartus is therefore turned to a third service it is made the vehicle of much goodhumoured satire upon these and similar characteristics of teutonic scholarship and speculation as in the many amusing criticisms which are passed upon teufelsdrckhs volume as a sort of mad banquet wherein all courses have been confounded in the burlesque parade of the professors omniverous reading eg book i chap v and in the whole amazing episode of the six considerable paper bags out of the chaotic contents of which the distracted editor in search of biographic documents has to make what he can nor is this quite all teufelsdrckh is further utilised as the mouthpiece of some of carlyles more extravagant speculations and of such ideas as he wished to throw out as it were tentatively and without himself being necessarily held responsible for them there is thus much point as well as humour in those sudden turns of the argument when after some exceptionally wild outburst on his eidolons part carlyle sedately reproves him for the fantastic character or dangerous tendency of his opinions it is in connection with the dramatic scheme of the book that the third element that of autobiography enters into its texture for the story of teufelsdrckh is very largely a transfigured version of the story of carlyle himself in saying this i am not of course thinking mainly of carlyles outer life this indeed is in places freely drawn upon as the outer lives of dickens george eliot tolstoi are drawn upon in david copperfield the mill on the floss anna karnina entepfuhl is only another name for ecclefechan the picture of little diogenes eating his supper outofdoors on fine summer evenings and meanwhile watching the sun sink behind the western hills is clearly a loving transcript from memory even the idyllic episode of blumine may be safely traced back to a romance of carlyles youth but to investigate the connection at these and other points between the mere externals of the two careers is a matter of little more than curious interest it is because it incorporates and reproduces so much of carlyles inner history that the story of teufelsdrckh is really important spiritually considered the whole narrative is in fact a symbolic myth in which the writers personal trials and conflicts are depicted with little change save in setting and accessories like teufelsdrckh carlyle while still a young man had broken away from the old religious creed in which he had been bred like teufelsdrckh he had thereupon passed into the howling desert of infidelity like teufelsdrckh he had known all the agonies and anguish of a long period of blank scepticism and insurgent despair during which turn whither he would life responded with nothing but negations to every question and appeal and as to teufelsdrckh in the rue saintthomas de lenfer in paris so to carlyle in leith walk edinburgh there had come a moment of sudden and marvellous illumination a mystical crisis from which he had emerged a different man the parallelism is so obvious and so close as to leave no room for doubt that the story of teufelsdrckh is substantially a piece of spiritual autobiography this admitted the question arises whether carlyle had any purpose beyond that of selfexpression in thus utilising his own experiences for the human setting of his philosophy it seems evident that he had as he conceived them these experiences possessed far more than a merely personal interest and meaning he wrote of himself because he saw in himself a type of his restless and muchtroubled epoch because he knew that in a broad sense his history was the history of thousands of other young men in the generation to which he belonged the age which followed upon the vast upheaval of the revolution was one of widespread turmoil and perplexity men felt themselves to be wandering aimlessly between two worlds one dead the other powerless to be born the old order had collapsed in shapeless ruin but the promised utopia had not been realised to take its place in many directions the forces of reaction were at work religion striving to maintain itself upon the dogmatic creeds of the past was rapidly petrifying into a mere dead letter of religion from which all the living spirit had fled and those who could not nourish themselves on hearsay and inherited formula knew not where to look for the renewal of faith and hope the generous ardour and the splendid humanitarian enthusiasms which had been stirred by the opening phases of the revolutionary movement had now ebbed away revulsion had followed and with it the mood of disillusion and despair the spirit of doubt and denial was felt as a paralysing power in every department of life and thought and the shadow of unbelief lay heavy on many hearts it was for the men of this sad time that carlyle wrote teufelsdrckhs story and he wrote it not merely to depict the farreaching consequences of their pessimism but also to make plain to them their true path out of it he desired to exhibit to his age the real nature of the strange malady from which it was suffering in order that he might thereupon proclaim the remedy what then is the moral significance of carlyles symbolic myth what are the supreme lessons which he uses it to convey we must begin by understanding his diagnosis for him all the evils of the time could ultimately be traced back to their common source in what may be briefly described as its want of real religion of churches and creeds there were plenty of living faith little or nothing was left men had lost all vital sense of god in the world and because of this they had taken up a fatally wrong attitude to life they looked at it wholly from the mechanical point of view and judged it by merely utilitarian standards the bodypolitic was no longer inspired by any soulpolitic men individually and in the mass cared only for material prosperity sought only outward success made the pursuit of happiness the end and aim of their being the divine meaning of virtue the infinite nature of duty had been forgotten and morality had been turned into a sort of ledgerphilosophy based upon calculations of profit and loss it was thus that carlyle read the signs of the times in such circumstances what was needed nothing less than a spiritual rebirth men must abandon their wrong attitude to life and take up the right attitude everything hinged on that and that they might take up this right attitude it was necessary first that they should be convinced of lifes essential spirituality and cease in consequence to seek its meaning and test its value on the plane of merely material things carlyle thus throws passionate emphasis upon religion as the only saving power but it must be noted that he does not suggest a return to any of the dogmatic creeds of the past though once the expression of a living faith these were now for him mere lifeless formulas nor has he any new dogmatic creed to offer in their place that mystical crisis which had broken the spell of the everlasting no was in a strict sense he uses the word himself a conversion but it was not a conversion in the theological sense for it did not involve the acceptance of any specific articles of faith it was simply a complete change of front the protest of his whole nature in a suddenly aroused mood of indignation and defiance against the spirit which denies the assertion of his manhood against the cowardice which had so long kept him trembling and whimpering before the facts of existence but from that change of front came presently the vivid apprehension of certain great truths which his former mood had thus far concealed from him and in these truths he found the secret of that right attitude to life in the discovery of which lay mens only hope of salvation from the unrest and melancholy of their time from this point of view the burden of carlyles message to his generation will be readily understood men were going wrong because they started with the thought of self and made satisfaction of self the law of their lives because in consequence they regarded happiness as the chief object of pursuit and the one thing worth striving for because under the influence of the current rationalism they tried to escape from their spiritual perplexities through logic and speculation they had therefore to set themselves right upon all these matters they had to learn that not selfsatisfaction but selfrenunciation is the key to life and its true law that we have no prescriptive claim to happiness and no business to quarrel with the universe if it withholds it from us that the way out of pessimism lies not through reason but through honest work steady adherence to the simple duty which each day brings fidelity to the right as we know it such in broad statement is the substance of carlyles religious convictions and moral teaching like kant he takes his stand on the principles of ethical idealism god is to be sought not through speculation or syllogism or the learning of the schools but through the moral nature it is the soul in action that alone finds god and the finding of god means not happiness as the world conceives it but blessedness or the inward peace which passes understanding the connection between the transfigured autobiography which serves to introduce the directly didactic element of the book and that element itself will now be clear stripped of its whimsicalities of phraseology and its humorous extravagances carlyles philosophy stands revealed as essentially idealistic in character spirit is the only reality visible things are but the manifestations emblems or clothings of spirit the material universe itself is only the vesture or symbol of god man is a spirit though he wears the wrappings of the flesh and in everything that man creates for himself he merely attempts to give body or expression to thought the science of carlyles time was busy proclaiming that since the universe is governed by natural laws miracles are impossible and the supernatural is a myth carlyle replies that the natural laws are themselves only the manifestation of spiritual force and that thus miracle is everywhere and all nature supernatural we who are the creatures of time and space can indeed apprehend the absolute only when he weaves about him the visible garments of time and space thus god reveals himself to sense through symbols but it is as we regard these symbols in one or other of two possible ways that we class ourselves with the foolish man or with the wise the foolish man sees only the symbol thinks it exists for itself takes it for the ultimate fact and therefore rests in it the wise man sees the symbol knows that it is only a symbol and penetrates into it for the ultimate fact or spiritual reality which it symbolises remote as such a doctrine may at first sight seem to be from the questions with which men are commonly concerned it has none the less many important practical bearings since all forms whereby spirit manifests itself to sense whether outwardly or in the imagination are clothes civilisation and everything belonging to it our languages literatures and arts our governments social machinery and institutions our philosophies creeds and rituals are but so many vestments woven for itself by the shaping spirit of man indispensable these vestments are for without them society would collapse in anarchy and humanity sink to the level of the brute yet here again we must emphasise the difference already noted between the foolish man and the wise the foolish man once more assumes that the vestments exist for themselves as ultimate facts and that they have a value of their own he therefore confuses the life with its clothing is even willing to sacrifice the life for the sake of the clothing the wise man while he too recognises the necessity of the vestments and indeed insists upon it knows that they have no independent importance that they derive all their potency and value from the inner reality which they were fashioned to represent and embody but which they often misrepresent and obscure he therefore never confuses the life with the clothing and well understands how often the clothing has to be sacrificed for the sake of the life thus while the utility of clothes has to be recognised to the full it is still of the essence of wisdom to press hard upon the vital distinction between the outer wrappings of mans life and that inner reality which they more or less adequately enfold the use which carlyle makes of this doctrine in his interpretation of the religious history of the world and of the crisis in thought of his own day will be anticipated all dogmas forms and ceremonials he teaches are but religious vestments symbols expressing mans deepest sense of the divine mystery of the universe and the hunger and thirst of his soul for god it is in response to the imperative necessities of his nature that he moulds for himself these outward emblems of his ideas and aspirations yet they are only emblems and since like all other human things they partake of the ignorance and weakness of the times in which they were framed it is inevitable that with the growth of knowledge and the expansion of thought they must presently be outgrown when this happens there follows what carlyle calls the superannuation of symbols men wake to the fact that the creeds and formulas which have come down to them from the past are no longer living for them no longer what they need for the embodiment of their spiritual life two mistakes are now possible and these are indeed commonly made together on the one hand men may try to ignore the growth of knowledge and the expansion of thought and to cling to the outgrown symbols as things having in themselves some mysterious sanctity and power on the other hand they may recklessly endeavour to cast aside the reality symbolised along with the discredited symbol itself given such a condition of things and we shall find religion degenerating into formalism and the worship of the dead letter and side by side with this the impatient rejection of all religion and the spread of a crude and debasing materialism religious symbols then must be renewed but their renewal can come only from within form to have any real value must grow out of life and be fed by it the revolutionary quality in the philosophy of sartor resartus cannot of course be overlooked everything that man has woven for himself must in time become merely old clothes the work of his thought like that of his hands is perishable his very highest symbols have no permanence or finality carlyle cuts down to the essential reality beneath all shows and forms and emblems witness his amazing vision of a naked house of lords under his penetrating gaze the earthly hulls and garnitures of existence melt away mens habit is to rest in symbols but to rest in symbols is fatal since they are at best but the adventitious wrappages of life clothes have made men of us true but now so great has their influence become that they are threatening to make clothesscreens of us hence the beginning of all wisdom is to look fixedly on clothes till they become transparent the logical tendency of such teaching may seem to be towards utter nihilism but that tendency is checked and qualified by the strong conservative element which is everywhere prominent in carlyles thought upon the absolute need of clothes the stress is again and again thrown they have made men of us by symbols alone man lives and works by symbols alone can he make life and work effective thus even the worlds old clothes its discarded forms and creeds should be treated with the reverence due to whatever has once played a part in human development thus moreover we must be on our guard against the impetuosity of the revolutionary spirit and all rash rupture with the past to cast old clothes aside before new clothes are ready this does not mean progress but sansculottism or a lapse into nakedness and anarchy the lectures on heroes and heroworship here printed with sartor resartus contain little more than an amplification through a series of brilliant characterstudies of those fundamental ideas of history which had already figured among teufelsdrckhs social speculations simple in statement and clear in doctrine this second work needs no formal introduction it may however be of service just to indicate one or two points at which apart from its set theses it expresses or implies certain underlying principles of all carlyles thought in the first place his philosophy of history rests entirely on the great man theory universal history the history of what man has accomplished in the world is for him at bottom the history of the great men who have worked here this conception of course brings him into sharp conflict with that scientific view of history which was already gaining ground when heroes and heroworship was written and which since then has become even more popular under the powerful influence of the modern doctrine of evolution a scientific historian like buckle or taine seeks to explain all changes in thought all movements in politics and society in terms of general laws his habit is therefore to subordinate if not quite to eliminate the individual the greatest man is treated as in a large measure the product and expression of the spirit of the time for carlyle individuality is everything while as he is bound to admit no one works save under conditions external circumstances and influences count little the great man is supreme he is not the creature of his age but its creator not its servant but its master the history of the world is but the biography of great men antiscientific in his reading of history carlyle is also antidemocratic in the practical lessons he deduces from it he teaches that our right relations with the hero are discipular relations that we should honestly acknowledge his superiority look up to him reverence him thus on the personal side he challenges that tendency to level down which he believed to be one alarming result of the fastspreading spirit of the new democracy but more than this he insists that the one hope for our distracted world of today lies in the strength and wisdom of the few not in the organised unwisdom of the many the masses of the people can never be safely trusted to solve for themselves the intricate problems of their own welfare they need to be guided disciplined at times even driven by those great leaders of men who see more deeply than they see into the reality of things and know much better than they can ever know what is good for them and how that good is to be attained political machinery in which the modern world had come to put so much faith is only another delusion of a mechanical age the burden of history is for him always the need of the able man i say find me the true knning king able man and he has a divine right over me carlyle thus throws down the gauntlet at once to the scientific and to the democratic movements of his time his pronounced antagonism to the modern spirit in these two most important manifestations must be kept steadily in mind in our study of him finally we have to remember that in the whole tone and temper of his teaching carlyle is fundamentally the puritan the dogmas of puritanism he had indeed outgrown but he never outgrew its ethics his thought was dominated and pervaded to the end as froude rightly says by the spirit of the creed he had dismissed by reference to this one fact we may account for much of his strength and also for most of his limitations in outlook and sympathy those limitations the reader will not fail to notice for himself but whatever allowance has to be made for them the strength remains it is perhaps the secret of carlyles imperishable greatness as a stimulating and uplifting power that beyond any other modern writer he makes us feel with him the supreme claims of the moral life the meaning of our own responsibilities the essential spirituality of things the indestructible reality of religion if he had thus a special message for his own generation that message has surely not lost any of its value for ours put

less effect for fivethousand years and upwards how in these times especially not only the torch still burns and perhaps more fiercely than ever but innumerable rushlights and sulphurmatches kindled thereat are also glancing in every direction so that not the smallest cranny or doghole in nature or art can remain unilluminated it might strike the reflective mind with some surprise that hitherto little or nothing of a fundamental character whether in the way of philosophy or history has been written on the subject of clothes our theory of gravitation is as good as perfect lagrange it is well known has proved that the planetary system on this scheme will endure forever laplace still more cunningly even guesses that it could not have been made on any other scheme whereby at least our nautical logbooks can be better kept and watertransport of all kinds has grown more commodious of geology and geognosy we know enough what with the labours of our werners and huttons what with the ardent genius of their disciples it has come about that now to many a royal society the creation of a world is little more mysterious than the cooking of a dumpling concerning which last indeed there have been minds to whom the question how the apples were got in presented difficulties why mention our disquisitions on the social contract on the standard of taste on the migrations of the herring then have we not a doctrine of rent a theory of value philosophies of language of history of pottery of apparitions of intoxicating liquors mans whole life and environment have been laid open and elucidated scarcely a fragment or fibre of his soul body and possessions but has been probed dissected distilled desiccated and scientifically decomposed our spiritual faculties of which it appears there are not a few have their stewarts cousins royer collards every cellular vascular muscular tissue glories in its lawrences majendies bichts how then comes it may the reflective mind repeat that the grand tissue of all tissues the only real tissue should have been quite overlooked by science the vestural tissue namely of woollen or other cloth which mans soul wears as its outmost wrappage and overall wherein his whole other tissues are included and screened his whole faculties work his whole self lives moves and has its being for if now and then some straggling brokenwinged thinker has cast an owlsglance into this obscure region the most have soared over it altogether heedless regarding clothes as a property not an accident as quite natural and spontaneous like the leaves of trees like the plumage of birds in all speculations they have tacitly figured man as a clothed animal whereas he is by nature a naked animal and only in certain circumstances by purpose and device masks himself in clothes shakespeare says we are creatures that look before and after the more surprising that we do not look round a little and see what is passing under our very eyes but here as in so many other cases germany learned indefatigable deepthinking germany comes to our aid it is after all a blessing that in these revolutionary times there should be one country where abstract thought can still take shelter that while the din and frenzy of catholic emancipations and rotten boroughs and revolts of paris deafen every french and every english ear the german can stand peaceful on his scientific watchtower and to the raging struggling multitude here and elsewhere solemnly from hour to hour with preparatory blast of cowhorn emit his hret ihr herren und lassets euch sagen in other words tell the universe which so often forgets that fact what oclock it really is not unfrequently the germans have been blamed for an unprofitable diligence as if they struck into devious courses where nothing was to be had but the toil of a rough journey as if forsaking the goldmines of finance and that political slaughter of fat oxen whereby a man himself grows fat they were apt to run goosehunting into regions of bilberries and crowberries and be swallowed up at last in remote peatbogs of that unwise science which as our humorist expresses it by geometric scale doth take the size of pots of ale still more of that altogether misdirected industry which is seen vigorously thrashing mere straw there can nothing defensive be said in so far as the germans are chargeable with such let them take the consequence nevertheless be it remarked that even a russian steppe has tumuli and gold ornaments also many a scene that looks desert and rockbound from the distance will unfold itself when visited into rare valleys nay in any case would criticism erect not only fingerposts and turnpikes but spiked gates and impassable barriers for the mind of man it is written many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased surely the plain rule is let each considerate person have his way and see what it will lead to for not this man and that man but all men make up mankind and their united tasks the task of mankind how often have we seen some such adventurous and perhaps muchcensured wanderer light on some outlying neglected yet vitallymomentous province the hidden treasures of which he first discovered and kept proclaiming till the general eye and effort were directed thither and the conquest was completed thereby in these his seemingly so aimless rambles planting new standards founding new habitable colonies in the immeasurable circumambient realm of nothingness and night wise man was he who counselled that speculation should have free course and look fearlessly towards all the thirtytwo points of the compass whithersoever and howsoever it listed perhaps it is proof of the stunted condition in which pure science especially pure moral science languishes among us english and how our mercantile greatness and invaluable constitution impressing a political or other immediately practical tendency on all english culture and endeavour cramps the free flight of thought that this not philosophy of clothes but recognition even that we have no such philosophy stands here for the first time published in our language what english intellect could have chosen such a topic or by chance stumbled on it but for that same unshackled and even sequestered condition of the german learned which permits and induces them to fish in all manner of waters with all manner of nets it seems probable enough this abstruse inquiry might in spite of the results it leads to have continued dormant for indefinite periods the editor of these sheets though otherwise boasting himself a man of confirmed speculative habits and perhaps discursive enough is free to confess that never till these last months did the above very plain considerations on our total want of a philosophy of clothes occur to him and then by quite foreign suggestion by the arrival namely of a new book from professor teufelsdrckh of weissnichtwo treating expressly of this subject and in a style which whether understood or not could not even by the blindest be overlooked in the present editors way of thought this remarkable treatise with its doctrines whether as judicially acceded to or judicially denied has not remained without effect die kleider ihr werden und wirken clothes their origin and influence von diog teufelsdrckh jud etc stillschweigen und cognie weissnichtwo here says the weissnichtwosche anzeiger comes a volume of that extensive closeprinted closemeditated sort which be it spoken with pride is seen only in germany perhaps only in weissnichtwo issuing from the hitherto irreproachable firm of stillschweigen and company with every external furtherance it is of such internal quality as to set neglect at defiance a work concludes the wellnigh enthusiastic reviewer interesting alike to the antiquary the historian and the philosophic thinker a masterpiece of boldness lynxeyed acuteness and rugged independent germanism and philanthropy derber kerndeutschheit und menschenliebe which will not assuredly pass current without opposition in high places but must and will exalt the almost new name of teufelsdrckh to the first ranks of philosophy in our german temple of honour mindful of old friendship the distinguished professor in this the first blaze of his fame which however does not dazzle him sends hither a presentationcopy of his book with compliments and encomiums which modesty forbids the present editor to rehearse yet without indicated wish or hope of any kind except what may be implied in the concluding phrase mchte es this remarkable treatise auch im brittischen boden gedeihen chapter ii editorial difficulties if for a speculative man whose seedfield in the sublime words of the poet is time no conquest is important but that of new ideas then might the arrival of professor teufelsdrckhs book be marked with chalk in the editors calendar it is indeed an extensive volume of boundless almost formless contents a very sea of thought neither calm nor clear if you will yet wherein the toughest pearldiver may dive to his utmost depth and return not only with seawreck but with true orients directly on the first perusal almost on the first deliberate inspection it became apparent that here a quite new branch of philosophy leading to as yet undescried ulterior results was disclosed farther what seemed scarcely less interesting a quite new human individuality an almost unexampled personal character that namely of professor teufelsdrckh the discloser of both which novelties as far as might be possible we resolved to master the significance but as man is emphatically a proselytising creature no sooner was such mastery even fairly attempted than the new question arose how might this acquired good be imparted to others perhaps in equal need thereof how could the philosophy of clothes and the author of such philosophy be brought home in any measure to the business and bosoms of our own english nation for if newgot gold is said to burn the pockets till it be cast forth into circulation much more may new truth here however difficulties occurred the first thought naturally was to publish article after article on this remarkable volume in such widelycirculating critical journals as the editor might stand connected with or by money or love procure access to but on the other hand was it not clear that such matter as must here be revealed and treated of might endanger the circulation of any journal extant if indeed all partydivisions in the state could have been abolished whig tory and radical embracing in discrepant union and all the journals of the nation could have been jumbled into one journal and the philosophy of clothes poured forth in incessant torrents therefrom the attempt had seemed possible but alas what vehicle of that sort have we except frasers magazine a vehicle all strewed figuratively speaking with the maddest waterloocrackers exploding distractively and destructively wheresoever the mystified passenger stands or sits nay in any case understood to be of late years a vehicle full to overflowing and inexorably shut besides to state the philosophy of clothes without the philosopher the ideas of teufelsdrckh without something of his personality was it not to insure both of entire misapprehension now for biography had it been otherwise admissible there were no adequate documents no hope of obtaining such but rather owing to circumstances a special despair thus did the editor see himself for the while shut out from all public utterance of these extraordinary doctrines and constrained to revolve them not without disquietude in the dark depths of his own mind so had it lasted for some months and now the volume on clothes read and again read was in several points becoming lucid and lucent the personality of its author more and more surprising but in spite of all that memory and conjecture could do more and more enigmatic whereby the old disquietude seemed fast settling into fixed discontent when altogether unexpectedly arrives a letter from herr hofrath heuschrecke our professors chief friend and associate in weissnichtwo with whom we had not previously corresponded the hofrath after much quite extraneous matter began dilating largely on the agitation and attention which the philosophy of clothes was exciting in its own german republic of letters on the deep significance and tendency of his friends volume and then at length with great circumlocution hinted at the practicability of conveying some knowledge of it and of him to england and through england to the distant west a work on professor teufelsdrckh were undoubtedly welcome to the family the national or any other of those patriotic libraries at present the glory of british literature might work revolutions in thought and so forth in conclusion intimating not obscurely that should the present editor feel disposed to undertake a biography of teufelsdrckh he hofrath heuschrecke had it in his power to furnish the requisite documents as in some chemical mixture that has stood long evaporating but would not crystallise instantly when the wire or other fixed substance is introduced crystallisation commences and rapidly proceeds till the whole is finished so was it with the editors mind and this offer of heuschreckes form rose out of void solution and discontinuity like united itself with like in definite arrangement and soon either in actual vision and possession or in fixed reasonable hope the image of the whole enterprise had shaped itself so to speak into a solid mass cautiously yet courageously through the twopenny post application to the famed redoubtable oliver yorke was now made an interview interviews with that singular man have taken place with more of assurance on our side with less of satire at least of open satire on his than we anticipated for the rest with such issue as is now visible as to those same patriotic libraries the hofraths counsel could only be viewed with silent amazement but with his offer of documents we joyfully and almost instantaneously closed thus too in the sure expectation of these we already see our task begun and this our sartor resartus which is properly a life and opinions of herr teufelsdrckh hourly advancing of our fitness for the enterprise to which we have such title and vocation it were perhaps uninteresting to say more let the british reader study and enjoy in simplicity of heart what is here presented him and with whatever metaphysical acumen and talent for meditation he is possessed of let him strive to keep a free open sense cleared from the mists of prejudice above all from the paralysis of cant and directed rather to the book itself than to the editor of the book who or what such editor may be must remain conjectural and even insignificant it is a voice publishing tidings of the philosophy of clothes undoubtedly a spirit addressing spirits whoso hath ears let him hear with us even he still communicates in some sort of mask or muffler and we have reason to think under a feigned name o y on one other point the editor thinks it needful to give warning namely that he is animated with a true though perhaps a feeble attachment to the institutions of our ancestors and minded to defend these according to ability at all hazards nay it was partly with a view to such defence that he engaged in this undertaking to stem or if that be impossible profitably to divert the current of innovation such a volume as teufelsdrckhs if cunningly planted down were no despicable pile or floodgate in the logical wear for the rest be it nowise apprehended that any personal connexion of ours with teufelsdrckh heuschrecke or this philosophy of clothes can pervert our judgment or sway us to extenuate or exaggerate powerless we venture to promise are those private compliments themselves grateful they may well be as generous illusions of friendship as fair mementos of bygone unions of those nights and suppers of the gods when lapped in the symphonies and harmonies of philosophic eloquence though with baser accompaniments the present editor revelled in that feast of reason never since vouchsafed him in so full measure but what then amicus plato magis amica veritas teufelsdrckh is our friend truth is our divinity in our historical and critical capacity we hope we are strangers to all the world have feud or favour with no one save indeed the devil with whom as with the prince of lies and darkness we do at all times wage internecine war this assurance at an epoch when puffery and quackery have reached a height unexampled in the annals of mankind and even english editors like chinese shopkeepers must write on their doorlintels no cheating here we thought it good to premise chapter iii reminiscences to the authors private circle the appearance of this singular work on clothes must have occasioned little less surprise than it has to the rest of the world for ourselves at least few things have been more unexpected professor teufelsdrckh at the period of our acquaintance with him seemed to lead a quite still and selfcontained life a man devoted to the higher philosophies indeed yet more likely if he published at all to publish a refutation of hegel and bardili both of whom strangely enough he included under a common ban than to descend as he has here done into the angry noisy forum with an argument that cannot but exasperate and divide not that we can remember the philosophy of clothes once touched upon between us if through the high silent meditative transcendentalism of our friend we detected any practical tendency whatever it was at most political and towards a certain prospective and for the present quite speculative radicalism as indeed some correspondence on his part with herr oken of jena was now and then suspected though his special contribution to the isis could never be more than surmised at but at all events nothing moral still less anything didacticoreligious was looked for from him well do we recollect the last words he spoke in our hearing which indeed with the night they were uttered in are to be forever remembered lifting his huge tumbler of gukguk and for a moment lowering his tobaccopipe he stood up in full coffeehouse it was zur grnen gans the largest in weissnichtwo where all the virtuosity and nearly all the intellect of the place assembled of an evening and there with low soulstirring tone and the look truly of an angel though whether of a white or of a black one might be dubious proposed this toast die sache der armen in gottes und teufels namen the cause of the poor in heavens name and s one full shout breaking the leaden silence then a gurgle of innumerable emptying bumpers again followed by universal cheering returned him loud acclaim it was the finale of the night resuming their pipes in the highest enthusiasm amid volumes of tobaccosmoke triumphant cloudcapt without and within the assembly broke up each to his thoughtful pillow bleibt doch ein echter spass und galgenvogel said several meaning thereby that one day he would probably be hanged for his democratic sentiments wo steckt doch der schalk added they looking round but teufelsdrckh had retired by private alleys and the compiler of these pages beheld him no more gukguk is unhappily only an academicalbeer in such scenes has it been our lot to live with this philosopher such estimate to form of his purposes and powers and yet thou brave teufelsdrckh who could tell what lurked in thee under those thick locks of thine so long and lank overlapping roofwise the gravest face we ever in this world saw there dwelt a most busy brain in thy eyes too deep under their shaggy brows and looking out so still and dreamy have we not noticed gleams of an ethereal or else a diabolic fire and halffancied that their stillness was but the rest of infinite motion the sleep of a spinningtop thy little figure there as in loose illbrushed threadbare habiliments thou sattest amid litter and lumber whole days to think and smoke tobacco held in it a mighty heart the secrets of mans life were laid open to thee thou sawest into the mystery of the universe farther than another thou hadst in petto thy remarkable volume on clothes nay was there not in that clear logicallyfounded transcendentalism of thine still more in thy meek silent deepseated sansculottism combined with a true princely courtesy of inward nature the visible rudiments of such speculation but great men are too often unknown or what is worse misknown already when we dreamed not of it the warp of thy remarkable volume lay on the loom and silently mysterious shuttles were putting in the woof how the hofrath heuschrecke is to furnish biographical data in this case may be a curious question the answer of which however is happily not our concern but his to us it appeared after repeated trial that in weissnichtwo from the archives or memories of the bestinformed classes no biography of teufelsdrckh was to be gathered not so much as a false one he was a stranger there wafted thither by what is called the course of circumstances concerning whose parentage birthplace prospects or pursuits curiosity had indeed made inquiries but satisfied herself with the most indistinct replies for himself he was a man so still and altogether unparticipating that to question him even afar off on such particulars was a thing of more than usual delicacy besides in his sly way he had ever some quaint turn not without its satirical edge wherewith to divert such intrusions and deter you from the like wits spoke of him secretly as if he were a kind of melchizedek without father or mother of any kind sometimes with reference to his great historic and statistic knowledge and the vivid way he had of expressing himself like an eyewitness of distant transactions and scenes they called him the ewige jude everlasting or as we say wandering jew to the most indeed he had become not so much a man as a thing which thing doubtless they were accustomed to see and with satisfaction but no more thought of accounting for than for the fabrication of their daily allgemeine zeitung or the domestic habits of the sun both were there and welcome the world enjoyed what good was in them and thought no more of the matter the man teufelsdrckh passed and repassed in his little circle as one of those originals and nondescripts more frequent in german universities than elsewhere of whom though you see them alive and feel certain enough that they must have a history no history seems to be discoverable or only such as men give of mountain rocks and antediluvian ruins that they may have been created by unknown agencies are in a state of gradual decay and for the present reflect light and resist pressure that is are visible and tangible objects in this phantasm world where so much other mystery is it was to be remarked that though by title and diploma professor der allerleywissenschaft or as we should say in english professor of things in general he had never delivered any course perhaps never been incited thereto by any public furtherance or requisition to all appearance the enlightened government of weissnichtwo in founding their new university imagined they had done enough if in times like ours as the halfofficial program expressed it when all things are rapidly or slowly resolving themselves into chaos a professorship of this kind had been established whereby as occasion called the task of bodying somewhat forth again from such chaos might be even slightly facilitated that actual lectures should be held and public classes for the science of things in general they doubtless considered premature on which ground too they had only established the professorship nowise endowed it so that teufelsdrckh recommended by the highest names had been promoted thereby to a name merely great among the more enlightened classes was the admiration of this new professorship how an enlightened government had seen into the want of the age zeitbedrfniss how at length instead of denial and destruction we were to have a science of affirmation and reconstruction and germany and weissnichtwo were where they should be in the vanguard of the world considerable also was the wonder at the new professor dropt opportunely enough into the nascent university so able to lecture should occasion call so ready to hold his peace for indefinite periods should an enlightened government consider that occasion did not call but such admiration and such wonder being followed by no act to keep them living could last only nine days and long before our visit to that scene had quite died away the more cunning heads thought it was all an expiring clutch at popularity on the part of a minister whom domestic embarrassments court intrigues old age and dropsy soon afterwards finally drove from the helm as for teufelsdrckh except by his nightly appearances at the grne gans weissnichtwo saw little of him felt little of him here over his tumbler of gukguk he sat reading journals sometimes contemplatively looking into the clouds of his tobaccopipe without other visible employment always from his mild ways an agreeable phenomenon there more especially when he opened his lips for speech on which occasions the whole coffeehouse would hush itself into silence as if sure to hear something noteworthy nay perhaps to hear a whole series and river of the most memorable utterances such as when once thawed he would for hours indulge in with fit audience and the more memorable as issuing from a head apparently not more interested in them not more conscious of them than is the sculptured stone head of some public fountain which through its brass mouthtube emits water to the worthy and the unworthy careless whether it be for cooking victuals or quenching conflagrations indeed maintains the same earnest assiduous look whether any water be flowing or not to the editor of these sheets as to a young enthusiastic englishman however unworthy teufelsdrckh opened himself perhaps more than to the most pity only that we could not then half guess his importance and scrutinise him with due power of vision we enjoyed what not three men in weissnichtwo could boast of a certain degree of access to the professors private domicile it was the attic floor of the highest house in the wahngasse and might truly be called the pinnacle of weissnichtwo for it rose sheer up above the contiguous roofs themselves rising from elevated ground moreover with its windows it looked towards all the four orte or as the scotch say and we ought to say airts the sittingroom itself commanded three another came to view in the schlafgemach bedroom at the opposite end to say nothing of the kitchen which offered two as it were duplicates and showing nothing new so that it was in fact the speculum or watchtower of teufelsdrckh wherefrom sitting at ease he might see the whole lifecirculation of that considerable city the streets and lanes of which with all their doing and driving thun und treiben were for the most part visible there i look down into all that waspnest or beehive have we heard him say and witness their waxlaying and honeymaking and poisonbrewing and choking by sulphur from the palace esplanade where music plays while serene highness is pleased to eat his victuals down to the low lane where in her doorsill the aged widow knitting for a thin livelihood sits to feel the

knowest thou whence it is coming whither it is going aus der ewigkeit zu der ewigkeit hin from eternity onwards to eternity these are apparitions what else are they not souls rendered visible in

when we had returned from the coffeehouse in rather earnest talk it is a true sublimity to dwell here these fringes of lamplight struggling up through smoke and thousandfold exhalation some fathoms into the ancient reign of night what thinks botes of them as he leads his huntingdogs over the zenith in their leash of sidereal fire that stifled hum of midnight when traffic has lain down to rest and the chariotwheels of vanity still rolling here and there through distant streets are bearing her to halls roofedin and lighted to the due pitch for her and only vice and misery to prowl or to moan like nightbirds are abroad that hum i say like the stertorous unquiet slumber of sick life is heard in heaven oh under that hideous covelet of vapours and putrefactions and unimaginable gases what a fermentingvat lies simmering and hid the joyful and the sorrowful are there men are dying there men are being born men are praying on the other side of a brick partition men are cursing and around them all is the vast void night the proud grandee still lingers in his perfumed saloons or reposes within damask curtains wretchedness cowers into trucklebeds or shivers hungerstricken into its lair of straw in obscure cellars rougeetnoir languidly emits its voiceofdestiny to haggard hungry villains while councillors of state sit plotting and playing their high chessgame whereof the pawns are men the lover whispers his mistress that the coach is ready and she full of hope and fear glides down to fly with him over the borders the thief still more silently setsto his picklocks and crowbars or lurks in wait till the watchmen first snore in their boxes gay mansions with supperrooms and dancingrooms are full of light and music and highswelling hearts but in the condemned cells the pulse of life beats tremulous and faint and bloodshot eyes lookout through the darkness which is around and within for the light of a stern last morning six men are to be hanged on the morrow comes no hammering from the rabenstein their gallows must even now be o building upwards of fivehundredthousand twolegged animals without feathers lie round us in horizontal positions their heads all in nightcaps and full of the foolishest dreams riot cries aloud and staggers and swaggers in his rank dens of shame and the mother with streaming hair kneels over her pallid dying infant whose cracked lips only her tears now moisten all these heaped and huddled together with nothing but a little carpentry and masonry between them crammed in like salted fish in their barrel or weltering shall i say like an egyptian pitcher of tamed vipers each struggling to get its head above the others such work goes on under that smokecounterpane but i mein werther sit above it all i am alone with the stars we looked in his face to see whether in the utterance of such extraordinary nightthoughts no feeling might be traced there but with the light we had which indeed was only a single tallowlight and far enough from the window nothing save that old calmness and fixedness was visible these were the professors talking seasons most commonly he spoke in mere monosyllables or sat altogether silent and smoked while the visitor had liberty either to say what he listed receiving for answer an occasional grunt or to look round for a space and then take himself away it was a strange apartment full of books and tattered papers and miscellaneous shreds of all conceivable substances united in a common element of dust books lay on tables and below tables here fluttered a sheet of manuscript there a torn handkerchief or nightcap hastily thrown aside inkbottles alternated with breadcrusts coffeepots tobaccoboxes periodical literature and blcher boots old lieschen lisekin liza who was his bedmaker and stovelighter his washer and wringer cook errandmaid and general lionsprovider and for the rest a very orderly creature had no sovereign authority in this last citadel of teufelsdrckh only some once in the month she halfforcibly made her may thither with broom and duster and teufelsdrckh hastily saving his manuscripts effected a partial clearance a jaildelivery of such lumber as was not literary these were her erdbeben earthquakes which teufelsdrckh dreaded worse than the pestilence nevertheless to such length he had been forced to comply glad would he have been to sit here philosophising forever or till the litter by accumulation drove him out of doors but lieschen was his rightarm and spoon and necessary of life and would not be flatly gainsayed we can still remember the ancient woman so silent that some thought her dumb deaf also you would often have supposed her for teufelsdrckh and teufelsdrckh only would she serve or give heed to and with him she seemed to communicate chiefly by signs if it were not rather by some secret divination that she guessed all his wants and supplied them assiduous old dame she scoured and sorted and swept in her kitchen with the least possible violence to the ear yet all was tight and right there hot and black came the coffee ever at the due moment and the speechless lieschen herself looked out on you from under her clean white coif with its lappets through her clean withered face and wrinkles with a look of helpful intelligence almost of benevolence few strangers as above hinted had admittance hither the only one we ever saw there ourselves excepted was the hofrath heuschrecke already known by name and expectation to the readers of these pages to us at that period herr heuschrecke seemed one of those pursemouthed cranenecked cleanbrushed pacific individuals perhaps sufficiently distinguished in society by this fact that in dry weather or in wet they never appear without their umbrella had we not known with what little wisdom the world is governed and how in germany as elsewhere the ninetyandnine public men can for most part be but mute trainbearers to the hundredth perhaps but stalkinghorses and willing or unwilling dupes it might have seemed wonderful how herr heuschrecke should be named a rath or councillor and counsellor even in weissnichtwo what counsel to any man or to any woman could this particular hofrath give in whose loose zigzag figure in whose thin visage as it went jerking to and fro in minute incessant fluctuation you traced rather confusion worse confounded at most timidity and physical cold some indeed said withal he was the very spirit of love embodied blue earnest eyes full of sadness and kindness purse ever open and so forth the whole of which we shall now hope for many reasons was not quite groundless nevertheless friend teufelsdrckhs outline who indeed handled the burin like few in these cases was probably the best er hat gemth und geist hat wenigstens gehabt doch ohne organ ohne schicksalsgunst ist gegenwrtig aber halbzerrttet halberstarrt he has heart and talent at least has had such yet without fit mode of utterance or favour of fortune and so is now halfcracked halfcongealed what the hofrath shall think of this when he sees it readers may wonder we safe in the stronghold of historical fidelity are careless the main point doubtless for us all is his love of teufelsdrckh which indeed was also by far the most decisive feature of heuschrecke himself we are enabled to assert that he hung on the professor with the fondness of a boswell for his johnson and perhaps with the like return for teufelsdrckh treated his gaunt admirer with little outward regard as some halfrational or altogether irrational friend and at best loved him out of gratitude and by habit on the other hand it was curious to observe with what reverent kindness and a sort of fatherly protection our hofrath being the elder richer and as he fondly imagined far more practically influential of the two looked and tended on his little sage whom he seemed to consider as a living oracle let but teufelsdrckh open his mouth heuschreckes also unpuckered itself into a free doorway besides his being all eye and all ear so that nothing might be lost and then at every pause in the harangue he gurgledout his pursy chuckle of a coughlaugh for the machinery of laughter took some time to get in motion and seemed crank and slack or else his twanging nasal bravo das glaub ich in either case by way of heartiest approval in short if teufelsdrckh was dalailama of which except perhaps in his selfseclusion and godlike indifference there was no symptom then might heuschrecke pass for his chief talapoin to whom no doughpill he could knead and publish was other than medicinal and sacred in such environment social domestic physical did teufelsdrckh at the time of our acquaintance and most likely does he still live and meditate here perchedup in his high wahngasse watchtower and often in solitude outwatching the bear it was that the indomitable inquirer fought all his battles with dulness and darkness here in all probability that he wrote this surprising volume on clothes additional particulars of his age which was of that standing middle sort you could only guess at of his wide surtout the colour of his trousers fashion of his broadbrimmed steeplehat and so forth we might report but do not the wisest truly is in these times the greatest so that an enlightened curiosity leaving kings and suchlike to rest very much on their own basis turns more and more to the philosophic class nevertheless what reader expects that with all our writing and reporting teufelsdrckh could be brought home to him till once the documents arrive his life fortunes and bodily presence are as yet hidden from us or matter only of faint conjecture but on the other hand does not his soul lie enclosed in this remarkable volume much more truly than pedro garcias did in the buried bag of doubloons to the soul of diogenes teufelsdrckh to his opinions namely on the origin and influence of clothes we for the present gladly return chapter iv characteristics it were a piece of vain flattery to pretend that this work on clothes entirely contents us that it is not like all works of genius like the very sun which though the highest published creation or work of genius has nevertheless black spots and troubled nebulosities amid its effulgence a mixture of insight inspiration with dulness doublevision and even utter blindness without committing ourselves to those enthusiastic praises and prophesyings of the weissnichtwosche anzeiger we admitted that the book had in a high degree excited us to selfactivity which is the best effect of any book that it had even operated changes in our way of thought nay that it promised to prove as it were the opening of a new mineshaft wherein the whole world of speculation might henceforth dig to unknown depths more especially it may now be declared that professor teufelsdrckhs acquirements patience of research philosophic and even poetic vigour are here made indisputably manifest and unhappily no less his prolixity and tortuosity and manifold ineptitude that on the whole as in opening new mineshafts is not unreasonable there is much rubbish in his book though likewise specimens of almost invaluable ore a paramount popularity in england we cannot promise him apart from the choice of such a topic as clothes too often the manner of treating it betokens in the author a rusticity and academic seclusion unblamable indeed inevitable in a german but fatal to his success with our public of good society teufelsdrckh appears to have seen little or has mostly forgotten what he saw he speaksout with a strange plainness calls many things by their mere dictionary names to him the upholsterer is no pontiff neither is any drawingroom a temple were it never so begilt and overhung a whole immensity of brussels carpets and pierglasses and ormolu as he himself expresses it cannot hide from me that such drawingroom is simply a section of infinite space where so many godcreated souls do for the time meet together to teufelsdrckh the highest duchess is respectable is venerable but nowise for her pearl bracelets and malines laces in his eyes the star of a lord is little less and little more than the broad button of birmingham spelter in a clowns smock each is an implement he says in its kind a tag for hookingtogether and for the rest was dug from the earth and hammered on a smithy before smiths fingers thus does the professor look in mens faces with a strange impartiality a strange scientific freedom like a man unversed in the higher circles like a man dropped thither from the moon rightly considered it is in this peculiarity running through his whole system of thought that all these shortcomings overshootings and multiform perversities take rise if indeed they have not a second source also natural enough in his transcendental philosophies and humour of looking at all matter and material things as spirit whereby truly his case were but the more hopeless the more lamentable to the thinkers of this nation however of which class it is firmly believed there are individuals yet extant we can safely recommend the work nay who knows but among the fashionable ranks too if it be true as teufelsdrckh maintains that within the most starched cravat there passes a windpipe and weasand and under the thickliest embroidered waistcoat beats a heart the force of that rapt earnestness may be felt and here and there an arrow of the soul pierce through in our wild seer shaggy unkempt like a baptist living on locusts and wild honey there is an untutored energy a silent as it were unconscious strength which except in the higher walks of literature must be rare many a deep glance and often with unspeakable precision has he cast into mysterious nature and the still more mysterious life of man wonderful it is with what cutting words now and then he severs asunder the confusion shears down were it furlongs deep into the true centre of the matter and there not only hits the nail on the head but with crushing force smites it home and buries it on the other hand let us be free to admit he is the most unequal writer breathing often after some such feat he will play truant for long pages and go dawdling and dreaming and mumbling and maundering the merest commonplaces as if he were asleep with eyes open which indeed he is of his boundless learning and how all reading and literature in most known tongues from sanchoniathon to dr lingard from your oriental shasters and talmuds and korans with cassinis siamese tables and laplaces mcanique cleste down to robinson crusoe and the belfast town and country almanack are familiar to him we shall say nothing for unexampled as it is with us to the germans such universality of study passes without wonder as a thing commendable indeed but natural indispensable and there of course a man that devotes his life to learning shall he not be learned in respect of style our author manifests the same genial capability marred too often by the same rudeness inequality and apparent want of intercourse with the higher classes occasionally as above hinted we find consummate vigour a true inspiration his burning thoughts step forth in fit burning words like so many fullformed minervas issuing amid flame and splendour from joves head a rich idiomatic diction picturesque allusions fiery poetic emphasis or quaint tricksy turns all the graces and terrors of a wild imagination wedded to the clearest intellect alternate in beautiful vicissitude were it not that sheer sleeping and soporific passages circumlocutions repetitions touches even of pure doting jargon so often intervene on the whole professor teufelsdrckh is not a cultivated writer of his sentences perhaps not more than ninetenths stand straight on their legs the remainder are in quite angular attitudes buttressedup by props of parentheses and dashes and ever with this or the other tagrag hanging from them a few even sprawlout helplessly on all sides quite brokenbacked and dismembered nevertheless in almost his very worst moods there lies in him a singular attraction a wild tone pervades the whole utterance of the man like its keynote and regulator now screwing itself aloft as into the song of spirits or else the shrill mockery of fiends now sinking in cadences not without melodious heartiness though sometimes abrupt enough into the common pitch when we hear it only as a monotonous hum of which hum the true character is extremely difficult to fix up to this hour we have never fully satisfied ourselves whether it is a tone and hum of real humour which we reckon among the very highest qualities of genius or some echo of mere insanity and inanity which doubtless ranks below the very lowest under a like difficulty in spite even of our personal intercourse do we still lie with regard to the professors moral feeling gleams of an ethereal love burst forth from him soft wailings of infinite pity he could clasp the whole universe into his bosom and keep it warm it seems as if under that rude exterior there dwelt a very seraph then again he is so sly and still so imperturbably saturnine shows such indifference malign coolness towards all that men strive after and ever with some halfvisible wrinkle of a bitter sardonic humour if indeed it be not mere stolid callousness that you look on him almost with a shudder as on some incarnate mephistopheles to whom this great terrestrial and celestial round after all were but some huge foolish whirligig where kings and beggars and angels and demons and stars and streetsweepings were chaotically whirled in which only children could take interest his look as we mentioned is probably the gravest ever seen yet it is not of that castiron gravity frequent enough among our own chancery suitors but rather the gravity as of some silent highencircled mountainpool perhaps the crater of an extinct volcano into whose black deeps you fear to gaze those eyes those lights that sparkle in it may indeed be reflexes of the heavenly stars but perhaps also glances from the region of nether fire certainly a most involved selfsecluded altogether enigmatic nature this of teufelsdrckh here however we gladly recall to mind that once we saw him laugh once only perhaps it was the first and last time in his life but then such a peal of laughter enough to have awakened the seven sleepers it was of jean pauls doing some single billow in that vast worldmahlstrom of humour with its heavenkissing coruscations which is now alas all congealed in the frost of death the largebodied poet and the small both large enough in soul sat talking miscellaneously together the present editor being privileged to listen and now paul in his serious way was giving one of those inimitable extraharangues and as it chanced on the proposal for a castmetal king gradually a light kindled in our professors eyes and face a beaming mantling loveliest light through those murky features a radiant everyoung apollo looked and he burst forth like the neighing of all tattersalls tears streaming down his cheeks pipe held aloft foot clutched into the air loud longcontinuing uncontrollable a laugh not of the face and diaphragm only but of the whole man from head to heel the present editor who laughed indeed yet with measure began to fear all was not right however teufelsdrckh composed himself and sank into his old stillness on his inscrutable countenance there was if anything a slight look of shame and richter himself could not rouse him again readers who have any tincture of psychology know how much is to be inferred from this and that no man who has once heartily and wholly laughed can be altogether irreclaimably bad how much lies in laughter the cipherkey wherewith we decipher the whole man some men wear an everlasting barren simper in the smile of others lies a cold glitter as of ice the fewest are able to laugh what can be called laughing but only sniff and titter and snigger from the throat outwards or at best produce some whiffling husky cachinnation as if they were laughing through wool of none such comes good the man who cannot laugh is not only fit for treasons stratagems and spoils but his whole life is already a treason and a stratagem considered as an author herr teufelsdrckh has one scarcely pardonable fault doubtless his worst an almost total want of arrangement in this remarkable volume it is true his adherence to the mere course of time produces through the narrative portions a certain show of outward method but of true logical method and sequence there is too little apart from its multifarious sections and subdivisions the work naturally falls into two parts a historicaldescriptive and a philosophicalspeculative but falls unhappily by no firm line of demarcation in that labyrinthic combination each part overlaps and indents and indeed runs quite through the other many sections are of a debatable rubric or even quite nondescript and unnameable whereby the book not only loses in accessibility but too often distresses us like some mad banquet wherein all courses had been confounded and fish and flesh soup and solid oystersauce lettuces rhinewine and french mustard were hurled into one huge tureen or trough and the hungry public invited to help itself to bring what order we can out of this chaos shall be part of our endeavour chapter v the world in clothes as montesquieu wrote a spirit of laws observes our professor so could i write a spirit of clothes thus with an esprit des lois properly an esprit de coutumes we should have an esprit de costumes for neither in tailoring nor in legislating does man proceed by mere accident but the hand is ever guided on by mysterious operations of the mind in all his modes and habilatory endeavours an architectural idea will be found lurking his body and the cloth are the site and materials whereon and whereby his beautified edifice of a person is to be built whether he flow gracefully out in folded mantles based on light sandals towerup in high headgear from amid peaks spangles and bellgirdles swellout in starched ruffs buckram stuffings and monstrous tuberosities or girth himself into separate sections and front the world an agglomeration of four limbs will depend on the nature of such architectural idea whether grecian gothic latergothic or altogether modern and parisian or anglodandiacal again what meaning lies in colour from the soberest drab to the highflaming scarlet spiritual idiosyncrasies unfold themselves in choice of colour if the cut betoken intellect and talent so does the colour betoken temper and heart in all which among nations as among individuals there is an incessant indubitable though infinitely complex working of cause and effect every snip of the scissors has been regulated and prescribed by everactive influences which doubtless to intelligences of a superior order are neither invisible nor illegible for such superior intelligences a causeandeffect philosophy of clothes as of laws were probably a comfortable winterevening entertainment nevertheless for inferior intelligences like men such philosophies have always seemed to me uninstructive enough nay what is your montesquieu himself but a clever infant spelling letters from a hieroglyphical prophetic book the lexicon of which lies in eternity in heaven let any causeandeffect philosopher explain not why i wear such and such a garment obey such and such a law but even why i am here to wear and obey anything much therefore if not the whole of that same spirit of clothes i shall suppress as hypothetical ineffectual and even impertinent naked facts and deductions drawn therefrom in quite another than that omniscient style are my humbler and proper province acting on which prudent restriction teufelsdrckh has nevertheless contrived to takein a wellnigh boundless extent of field at least the boundaries too often lie quite beyond our horizon selection being indispensable we shall here glanceover his first part only in the most cursory manner this first part is no doubt distinguished by omnivorous learning and utmost patience and fairness at the same time in its results and delineations it is much more likely to interest the compilers of some library of general entertaining useful or even useless knowledge than the miscellaneous readers of these pages was it this part of the book which heuschrecke had in view when he recommended us to that jointstock vehicle of publication at present the glory of british literature if so the library editors are welcome to dig in it for their own behoof to the first chapter which turns on paradise and figleaves and leads us into interminable disquisitions of a mythological metaphorical cabalisticosartorial and quite antediluvian cast we shall content ourselves with giving an unconcerned approval still less have we to do with lilis adams first wife whom according to the talmudists he had before eve and who bore him in that wedlock the whole progeny of aerial aquatic and terrestrial devils very needlessly we think on this portion of the work with its profound glances into the adamkadmon or primeval element here strangely brought into relation with the nifl and muspel darkness and light of the antique north it may be enough to say that its correctness of deduction and depth of talmudic and rabbinical lore have filled perhaps not the worst hebraist in britain with something like astonishment but quitting this twilight region teufelsdrckh hastens from the tower of babel to follow the dispersion of mankind over the whole habitable and habilable globe walking by the light of oriental pelasgic scandinavian egyptian otaheitean ancient and modern researches of every conceivable kind he strives to give us in compressed shape as the nrnbergers give an orbis pictus an orbis vestitus or view of the costumes of all mankind in all countries in all times it is here that to the antiquarian to the historian we can triumphantly say fall to here is learning an irregular treasury if you will but inexhaustible as the hoard of king nibelung which twelve wagons in twelve days at the rate of three journeys a day could not carry off sheepskin cloaks and wampum belts phylacteries stoles albs chlamydes togas chinese silks afghaun shawls trunkhose leather breeches celtic philibegs though breeches as the name gallia braccata indicates are the more ancient hussar cloaks vandyke tippets ruffs fardingales are brought vividly before us even the kilmarnock nightcap is not forgotten for most part too we must admit that the learning heterogeneous as it is and tumbleddown quite pellmell is true concentrated and purified learning the drossy parts smelted out and thrown aside philosophical reflections intervene and sometimes touching pictures of human life of this sort the following has surprised us the first purpose of clothes as our professor imagines was not warmth or decency but ornament miserable indeed says he was the condition of the aboriginal savage glaring fiercely from under his fleece of hair which with the beard reached down to his loins and hung round him like a matted cloak the rest of his body sheeted in its thick natural fell he loitered in the sunny glades of the forest living on wildfruits or as the ancient caledonian squatted himself in morasses lurking for his bestial or human prey without implements without arms save the ball of heavy flint to which that his sole possession and defence might not be lost he had attached a long cord of plaited thongs thereby recovering as well as hurling it with deadly unerring skill nevertheless the pains of hunger and revenge once satisfied his next care was not comfort but decoration putz warmth he found in the toils of the chase or amid dried leaves in his hollow tree in his bark shed or natural grotto but for decoration he must have clothes nay among wild people we find tattooing and painting even prior to clothes the first spiritual want of a barbarous man is decoration as indeed we still see among the barbarous classes in civilised countries reader the heaveninspired melodious singer loftiest serene highness nay thy own amberlocked snowandrosebloom maiden worthy to glide sylphlike almost on air whom thou lovest worshippest as a divine presence which indeed symbolically taken she is has descended like thyself from that same hairmantled flinthurling aboriginal anthropophagus out of the eater cometh forth meat out of the strong cometh forth sweetness what changes are wrought not by time yet in time for not mankind only but all that mankind does or beholds is in continual growth regenesis and selfperfecting vitality cast forth thy act thy word into the everliving everworking universe it is a seedgrain that cannot die unnoticed today says one it will be found flourishing as a banyangrove perhaps alas as a hemlockforest after a thousand years he who first shortened the labour of copyists by device of movable types was disbanding hired armies and cashiering most kings and senates and creating a whole new democratic world he had invented the art of printing the first ground handful of nitre sulphur and charcoal drove monk schwartzs pestle through the ceiling what will the last do achieve the final undisputed prostration of force under thought of animal courage under spiritual a simple invention it was in the oldworld grazier sick of lugging his slow ox about the country till he got it bartered for corn or oil to take a piece of leather and thereon scratch or stamp the mere figure of an ox or pecus put it in his pocket and call it pecunia money yet hereby did barter grow sale the leather money is now golden and paper and all miracles have been outmiracled for there are rothschilds and english national debts and whoso has sixpence is sovereign to the length of sixpence over all men commands cooks to feed him philosophers to teach him kings to mount guard over him to the length of sixpence clothes too which began in foolishest love of ornament what have they not become increased security and pleasurable heat soon followed but what of these shame divine shame schaam modesty as yet a stranger to the anthropophagous bosom arose there mysteriously under clothes a mystic groveencircled shrine for the holy in man clothes gave us individuality distinctions social polity clothes have made men of us they are threatening to make clothesscreens of us but on the whole continues our eloquent professor man is a toolusing animal handthierendes thier weak in himself and of small stature he stands on a basis at most for the flattestsoled of some halfsquare foot insecurely enough has to straddle out his legs lest the very wind supplant him feeblest of bipeds three quintals are a crushing load for him the steer of the meadow tosses him aloft like a waste rag nevertheless he can use tools can devise tools with these the granite mountain melts into light dust before him he kneads glowing iron as if it were soft paste seas are his smooth highway winds and fire his unwearying steeds nowhere do you find him without tools without tools he is nothing with tools he is all here may we not for a moment interrupt the stream of oratory with a remark that this definition of the toolusing animal appears to us of all that animalsort considerably the precisest and best man is called a laughing animal but do not the apes also laugh or attempt to do it and is the manliest man the greatest and oftenest laugher teufelsdrckh himself as we said laughed only once still less do we make of that other french definition of the cooking animal which indeed for rigorous scientific purposes is as good as useless can a tartar be said to cook when he only readies his steak by riding on it again what cookery does the greenlander use beyond stowingup his whaleblubber as a marmot in the like case might do or how would monsieur ude prosper among those orinocco indians who according to humboldt lodge in crownests on the branches of trees and for half the year have no victuals but pipeclay the whole country being under water but on the other hand show us the human being of any period or climate without his tools those very caledonians as we saw had their flintball and thong to it such as no brute has or can have man is a toolusing animal concludes teufelsdrckh in his abrupt way of which truth clothes are but one example and surely if we consider the interval between the first wooden dibble fashioned by man and those liverpool steamcarriages or the british house of commons we shall note what progress he has made he digs up certain black stones from the bosom of the earth and says to them transport me and this luggage at the rate of fiveandthirty miles an hour and they do it he collects apparently by lot sixhundred and fiftyeight miscellaneous individuals and says to them make this nation toil for us bleed for us hunger and sorrow and sin for us and they do it chapter vi aprons one of the most unsatisfactory sections in the whole volume is that on aprons what though stout old gao the persian blacksmith whose apron now indeed hidden under jewels because raised in revolt which proved successful is still the royal standard of that country what though john knoxs daughter who threatened sovereign majesty that she would catch her husbands head in her apron rather than he should lie and be a bishop what though the landgravine elizabeth with many other apron worthies figure here an idle wiredrawing spirit sometimes even a tone of levity approaching to conventional satire is too clearly discernible what for example are we to make of such sentences as the following aprons are defences against injury to cleanliness to safety to modesty sometimes to roguery from the thin slip of notched silk as it were the emblem and beatified ghost of an apron which some highestbred housewife sitting at nrnberg workboxes and toyboxes has gracefully fastened on to the thicktanned hide girt round him with thongs wherein the builder builds and at evening sticks his trowel or to those jingling sheetiron aprons wherein your otherwise halfnaked vulcans hammer and smelt in their smeltfurnace is there not range enough in the fashion and uses of this vestment how much has been concealed how much has been defended in aprons nay rightly considered what is your whole military and police establishment charged at uncalculated millions but a huge scarletcoloured ironfastened apron wherein society works uneasily enough guarding itself from some soil and stithysparks in this devilssmithy teufelsschmiede of a world but of all aprons the most puzzling to me hitherto has been the episcopal or cassock wherein consists the usefulness of this apron the overseer episcopus of souls i notice has tuckedin the corner of it as if his days work were done what does he shadow forth thereby c c or again has it often been the lot of our readers to read such stuff as we shall now quote i consider those printed paper aprons worn by the parisian cooks as a new vent though a slight one for typography therefore as an encouragement to modern literature and deserving of approval nor is it without satisfaction that i hear of a celebrated london firm having in view to introduce the same fashion with important extensions in england we who are on the spot hear of no such thing and indeed have reason to be thankful that hitherto there are other vents for our literature exuberant as it is teufelsdrckh continues if such supply of printed paper should rise so far as to chokeup the highways and public thoroughfares new means must of necessity be had recourse to in a world existing by industry we grudge to employ fire as a destroying element and not as a creating one however heaven is omnipotent and will find us an outlet in the mean while is it not beautiful to see fivemillion quintals of rags picked annually from the laystall and annually after being macerated hotpressed printedon and sold returned thither filling so many hungry mouths by the way thus is the laystall especially with its rags or clothesrubbish the grand electric battery and fountainofmotion from which and to which the social activities like vitreous and resinous electricities circulate in larger or smaller circles through the mighty billowy stormtost chaos of life which they keep alive such passages fill us who love the man and partly esteem him with a very mixed feeling farther down we meet with this the journalists are now the true kings and clergy henceforth historians unless they are fools must write not of bourbon dynasties and tudors and hapsburgs but of stamped broadsheet dynasties and quite new successive names according as this or the other able editor or combination of able editors gains the worlds ear of the british newspaper press perhaps the most important of all and wonderful enough in its secret constitution and procedure a valuable descriptive history already exists in that language under the title of satans invisible world displayed which however by search in all the weissnichtwo libraries i have not yet succeeded in procuring vermchte nicht aufzutreiben thus does the good homer not only nod but snore thus does teufelsdrckh wandering in regions where he had little business confound the old authentic presbyterian witchfinder with a new spurious imaginary historian of the brittische journalistik and so stumble on perhaps the most egregious blunder in modern literature chapter vii miscellaneoushistorical happier is our professor and more purely scientific and historic when he reaches the middle ages in europe and down to the end of the seventeenth century the true era of extravagance in costume it is here that the antiquary and student of modes comes upon his richest harvest fantastic garbs beggaring all fancy of a teniers or a callot succeed each other like monster devouring monster in a dream the whole too in brief authentic strokes and touched not seldom with that breath of genius which makes even old raiment live indeed so learned precise graphical and everyway interesting have we found these chapters that it may be thrownout as a pertinent question for parties concerned whether or not a good english translation thereof might henceforth be profitably incorporated with mr merricks valuable work on ancient armour take by way of example the following sketch as authority for which paulinuss zeitkrzende lust ii is with seeming confidence referred to did we behold the german fashionable dress of the fifteenth century we might smile as perhaps those bygone germans were they to rise again and see our haberdashery would cross themselves and invoke the virgin but happily no bygone german or man rises again thus the present is not needlessly trammelled with the past and only grows out of it like a tree whose roots are not intertangled with its branches but lie peaceably underground nay it is very mournful yet not useless to see and know how the greatest and dearest in a short while would find his place quite filledup here and no room for him the very napoleon the very byron in some seven years has become obsolete and were now a foreigner to his europe thus is the law of progress secured and in clothes as in all other external things whatsoever no fashion will continue of the military classes in those old times whose buffbelts complicated chains and gorgets huge churnboots and other riding and fighting gear have been bepainted in modern romance till the whole has acquired somewhat of a signpost character i shall here say nothing the civil and pacific classes less touched upon are wonderful enough for us rich men i find have teusinke a perhaps untranslateable article also a silver girdle whereat hang little bells so that when a man walks it is with continual jingling some few of musical turn have a whole chime of bells glockenspiel fastened there which especially in sudden whirls and the other accidents of walking has a grateful effect observe too how fond they are of peaks and gothicarch intersections the male world wears peaked caps an ell long which hang bobbing over the side schief their shoes are peaked in front also to the length of an ell and laced on the side with tags even the wooden shoes have their elllong noses some also clap bells on the peak further according to my authority the men have breeches without seat ohne gesss these they fasten peakwise to their shirts and the long round doublet must overlap them rich maidens again flit abroad in gowns scolloped out behind and before so that back and breast are almost bare wives of quality on the other hand have traingowns four or five ells in length which trains there are boys to carry brave cleopatras sailing in their silkcloth galley with a cupid for steersman consider their welts a handbreadth thick which waver round them by way of hem the long flood of silver buttons or rather silver shells from throat to shoe wherewith these same weltgowns are buttoned the maidens have bound silver snoods about their hair with gold spangles and pendent flames flammen that is sparkling hairdrops but of their mothers headgear who shall speak neither in love of grace is comfort forgotten in winter weather you behold the whole fair creation that can afford it in long mantles with skirts wide below and for hem not one but two sufficient handbroad welts all ending atop in a thick wellstarched ruff some twenty inches broad these are their ruffmantles kragenmntel as yet among the womankind hooppetticoats are not but the men have doublets of fustian under which lie multiple ruffs of cloth pasted together with batter mit teig zusammengekleistert which create protuberance enough thus do the two sexes vie with each other in the art of decoration and as usual the stronger carries it our professor whether he hath humour himself or not manifests a certain feeling of the ludicrous a sly observance of it which could emotion of any kind be confidently predicated of so still a man we might call a real love none of those bellgirdles bushelbreeches cornuted shoes or other the like phenomena of which the history of dress offers so many escape him more especially the mischances or striking adventures incident to the wearers of such are noticed with due fidelity sir walter raleighs fine mantle which he spread in the mud under queen elizabeths feet appears to provoke little enthusiasm in him he merely asks whether at that period the maiden queen was redpainted on the nose and whitepainted on the cheeks as her tirewomen when from spleen and wrinkles she would no longer look in any glass were wont to serve her we can answer that sir walter knew well what he was doing and had the maiden queen been stuffed parchment dyed in verdigris would have done the same thus too treating of those enormous habiliments that were not only slashed and galooned but artificially swollenout on the broader parts of the body by introduction of bran our professor fails not to comment on that luckless courtier who having seated himself on a chair with some projecting nail on it and therefrom rising to pay his devoir on the entrance of majesty instantaneously emitted several pecks of dry wheatdust and stood there diminished to a spindle his galoons and slashes dangling sorrowful and flabby round him whereupon the professor publishes this reflection by what strange chances do we live in history erostratus by a torch milo by a bullock henry darnley an unfledged booby and bustard by his limbs most kings and queens by being born under such and such a bedtester boileau despraux according to helvetius by the peck of a turkey and this illstarred individual by a rent in his breeches for no memoirist of kaiser ottos court omits him vain was the prayer of themistocles for a talent of forgetting my friends yield cheerfully to destiny and read since it is written has teufelsdrckh to be put in mind that nearly related to the impossible talent of forgetting stands that talent of silence which even travelling englishmen manifest the simplest costume observes our professor which i anywhere find alluded to in history is that used as regimental by bolivars cavalry in the late columbian wars a square blanket twelve feet in diagonal is provided some were wont to cutoff the corners and make it circular in the centre a slit is effected eighteen inches long through this the mothernaked trooper introduces his head and neck and so rides shielded from all weather and in battle from many strokes for he rolls it about his left arm and not only dressed but harnessed and draperied with which picture of a state of nature affecting by its singularity and oldroman contempt of the superfluous we shall quit this part of our subject chapter viii the world out of clothes if in the descriptivehistorical portion of this volume teufelsdrckh discussing merely the werden origin and successive improvement of clothes has astonished many a reader much more will he in the speculativephilosophical portion which treats of their wirken or influences it is here that the present editor first feels the pressure of his task for here properly the higher and new philosophy of clothes commences an untried almost inconceivable region or chaos in venturing upon which how difficult yet how unspeakably important is it to know what course of survey and conquest is the true one where the footing is firm substance and will bear us where it is hollow or mere cloud and may engulf us teufelsdrckh undertakes no less than to expound the moral political even religious influences of clothes he undertakes to make manifest in its thousandfold bearings this grand proposition that mans earthly interests are all hooked and buttoned together and held up by clothes he says in so many words society is founded upon cloth and again society sails through the infinitude on cloth as on a fausts mantle or rather like the sheet of clean and unclean beasts in the apostles dream and without such sheet or mantle would sink to endless depths or mount to inane limboes and in either case be no more by what chains or indeed infinitely complected tissues of meditation this grand theorem is here unfolded and innumerable practical corollaries are drawn therefrom it were perhaps a mad ambition to attempt exhibiting our professors method is not in any case that of common school logic where the truths all stand in a row each holding by the skirts of the other but at best that of practical reason proceeding by large intuition over whole systematic groups and kingdoms whereby we might say a noble complexity almost like that of nature reigns in his philosophy or spiritual picture of nature a mighty maze yet as faith whispers not without a plan nay we complained above that a certain ignoble complexity what we must call mere confusion was also discernible often also we have to exclaim would to heaven those same biographical documents were come for it seems as if the demonstration lay much in the authors individuality as if it were not argument that had taught him but experience at present it is only in local glimpses and by significant fragments picked often at wideenough intervals from the original volume and carefully collated that we can hope to impart some outline or foreshadow of this doctrine readers of any intelligence are once more invited to favour us with their most concentrated attention let these after intense consideration and not till then pronounce whether on the utmost verge of our actual horizon there is not a looming as of land a promise of new fortunate islands perhaps whole undiscovered americas for such as have canvas to sail thither as exordium to the whole stand here the following long citation with men of a speculative turn writes teufelsdrckh there come seasons meditative sweet yet awful hours when in wonder and fear you ask yourself that unanswerable question who am i the thing that can say i das wesen das sich ich nennt the world with its loud trafficking retires into the distance and through the paperhangings and stonewalls and thickplied tissues of commerce and polity and all the living and lifeless integuments of society and a body wherewith your existence sits surrounded the sight reaches forth into the void deep and you are alone with the universe and silently commune with it as one mysterious presence with another who am i what is this me a voice a motion an appearance some embodied visualised idea in the eternal mind cogito ergo sum alas poor cogitator this takes us but a little way sure enough i am and lately was not but whence how whereto the answer lies around written in all colours and motions uttered in all tones of jubilee and wail in thousandfigured thousandvoiced harmonious nature but where is the cunning eye and ear to whom that godwritten apocalypse will yield articulate meaning we sit as in a boundless phantasmagoria and dreamgrotto boundless for the faintest star the remotest century lies not even nearer the verge thereof sounds and manycoloured visions flit round our sense but him the unslumbering whose work both dream and dreamer are we see not except in rare halfwaking moments suspect not creation says one lies before us like a glorious rainbow but the sun that made it lies behind us hidden from us then in that strange dream how we clutch at shadows as if they were substances and sleep deepest while fancying ourselves most awake which of your philosophical systems is other than a dreamtheorem a net quotient confidently given out where divisor and dividend are both unknown what are all your national wars with their moscow retreats and sanguinary hatefilled revolutions but the somnambulism of uneasy sleepers this dreaming this somnambulism is what we on earth call life wherein the most indeed undoubtingly wander as if they knew right hand from left yet they only are wise who know that they know nothing pity that all metaphysics had hitherto proved so inexpressibly unproductive the secret of mans being is still like the sphinxs secret a riddle that he cannot rede and for ignorance of which he suffers death the worst death a spiritual what are your axioms and categories and systems and aphorisms words words high aircastles are cunningly built of words the words well bedded also in good logicmortar wherein however no knowledge will come to lodge the whole is greater than the part how exceedingly true nature abhors a vacuum how exceedingly false and calumnious again nothing can act but where it is with all my heart only where is it be not the slave of words is not the distant the dead while i love it and long for it and mourn for it here in the genuine sense as truly as the floor i stand on but that same where with its brother when are from the first the mastercolours of our dreamgrotto say rather the canvas the warp and woof thereof whereon all our dreams and lifevisions are painted nevertheless has not a deeper meditation taught certain of every climate and age that the where and when so mysteriously inseparable from all our thoughts are but superficial terrestrial adhesions to thought that the seer may discern them where they mount up out of the celestial everywhere and forever have not all nations conceived their god as omnipresent and eternal as existing in a universal here an everlasting now think well thou too wilt find that space is but a mode of our human sense so likewise time there is no space and no time we are we know not what lightsparkles floating in the ther of deity so that this so solidseeming world after all were but an airimage our me the only reality and nature with its thousandfold production and destruction but the reflex of our own inward force the phantasy of our dream or what the earthspirit in faust names it the living visible garment of god in beings floods in actions storm i walk and work above beneath work and weave in endless motion birth and death an infinite ocean a seizing and giving the fire of living tis thus at the roaring loom of time i ply and weave for god the garment thou seest him by of twenty millions that have read and spouted this thunderspeech of the erdgeist are there yet twenty units of us that have learned the meaning thereof it was in some such mood when wearied and fordone with these high speculations that i first came upon the question of clothes strange enough it strikes me is this same fact of there being tailors and tailored the horse i ride has his own whole fell strip him of the girths and flaps and extraneous tags i have fastened round him and the noble creature is his own sempster and weaver and spinner nay his own bootmaker jeweller and manmilliner he bounds free through the valleys with a perennial rainproof courtsuit on his body wherein warmth and easiness of fit have reached perfection nay the graces also have been considered and frills and fringes with gay variety of colour featly appended and ever in the right place are not wanting while i good heaven have thatched myself over with the dead fleeces of sheep the bark of vegetables the entrails of worms the hides of oxen or seals the felt of furred beasts and walk abroad a moving ragscreen overheaped with shreds and tatters raked from the charnelhouse of nature where they would have rotted to rot on me more slowly day after day i must thatch myself anew day after day this despicable thatch must lose some film of its thickness some film of it frayed away by tear and wear must be brushedoff into the ashpit into the laystall till by degrees the whole has been brushed thither and i the dustmaking patent raggrinder get new material to grind down o subterbrutish vile most vile for have not i too a compact allenclosing skin whiter or dingier am i a botched mass of tailors and cobblers shreds then or a tightlyarticulated homogeneous little figure automatic nay alive strange enough how creatures of the humankind shut their eyes to plainest facts and by the mere inertia of oblivion and stupidity live at ease in the midst of wonders and terrors but indeed man is and was always a blockhead and dullard much readier to feel and digest than to think and consider prejudice which he pretends to hate is his absolute lawgiver mere useandwont everywhere leads him by the nose thus let but a rising of the sun let but a creation of the world happen twice and it ceases to be marvellous to be noteworthy or noticeable perhaps not once in a lifetime does it occur to your ordinary biped of any country or generation be he goldmantled prince or russetjerkined peasant that his vestments and his self are not one and indivisible that he is naked without vestments till he buy or steal such and by forethought sew and button them for my own part these considerations of our clothesthatch and how reaching inwards even to our heart of hearts it tailorises and demoralises us fill me with a certain horror at myself and mankind almost as one feels at those dutch cows which during the wet season you see grazing deliberately with jackets and petticoats of striped sacking in the meadows of gouda nevertheless there is something great in the moment when a man first strips himself of adventitious wrappages and sees indeed that he is naked and as swift has it a forked straddling animal with bandy legs yet also a spirit and unutterable mystery of mysteries chapter ix adamitism let no courteous reader take offence at the opinions broached in the conclusion of the last chapter the editor himself on first glancing over that singular passage was inclined to exclaim what have we got not only a sansculottist but an enemy to clothes in the abstract a new adamite in this century which flatters itself that it is the nineteenth and destructive both to superstition and enthusiasm consider thou foolish teufelsdrckh what benefits unspeakable all ages and sexes derive from clothes for example when thou thyself a watery pulpy slobbery freshman and newcomer in this planet sattest muling and puking in thy nurses arms sucking thy coral and looking forth into the world in the blankest manner what hadst thou been without thy blankets and bibs and other nameless hulls a terror to thyself and mankind or hast thou forgotten the day when thou first receivedst breeches and thy long clothes became short the village where thou livedst was all apprised of the fact and neighbour after neighbour kissed thy puddingcheek and gave thee as handsel silver or copper coins on that the first galaday of thy existence again wert not thou at one period of life a buck or blood or macaroni or incroyable or dandy or by whatever name according to year and place such phenomenon is distinguished in that one word lie included mysterious volumes nay now when the reign of folly is over or altered and thy clothes are not for triumph but for defence hast thou always worn them perforce and as a consequence of mans fall never rejoiced in them as in a warm movable house a body round thy body wherein that strange thee of thine sat snug defying all variations of climate girt with thick doublemilled kerseys halfburied under shawls and broadbrims and overalls and mudboots thy very fingers cased in doeskin and mittens thou hast bestrode that horse i ride and though it were in wild winter dashed through the world glorying in it as if thou wert its lord in vain did the sleet beat round thy temples it lighted only on thy impenetrable felted or woven case of wool in vain did the winds howl forests sounding and creaking deep calling unto deep and the storms heap themselves together into one huge arctic whirlpool thou flewest through the middle thereof striking fire from the highway wild music hummed in thy ears thou too wert as a sailor of the air the wreck of matter and the crash of worlds was thy element and propitiously wafting tide without clothes without bit or saddle what hadst thou been what had thy fleet quadruped been nature is good but she is not the best here truly was the victory of art over nature a thunderbolt indeed might have pierced thee all short of this thou couldst defy or cries the courteous reader has your teufelsdrckh forgotten what he said lately about aboriginal savages and their condition miserable indeed would he have all this unsaid and us betake ourselves again to the matted cloak and go sheeted in a thick natural fell nowise courteous reader the professor knows full well what he is saying and both thou and we in our haste do him wrong if clothes in these times so tailorise and demoralise us have they no redeeming value can they not be altered to serve better must they of necessity be thrown to the dogs the truth is teufelsdrckh though a sansculottist is no adamite and much perhaps as he might wish to go forth before this degenerate age as a sign would nowise wish to do it as those old adamites did in a state of nakedness the utility of clothes is altogether apparent to him nay perhaps he has an insight into their more recondite and almost mystic qualities what we might call the omnipotent virtue of clothes such as was never before vouchsafed to any man for example you see two individuals he writes one dressed in fine red the other in coarse threadbare blue red says to blue be hanged and anatomised blue hears with a shudder and o wonder of wonders marches sorrowfully to the gallows is there noosedup vibrates his hour and the surgeons dissect him and fit his bones into a skeleton for medical purposes how is this or what make ye of your nothing can act but where it is red has no physical hold of blue no clutch of him is nowise in contact with him neither are those ministering sheriffs and lordlieutenants and hangmen and tipstaves so related to commanding red that he can tug them hither and thither but each stands distinct within his own skin nevertheless as it is spoken so is it done the articulated word sets all hands in action and rope and improveddrop perform their work thinking reader the reason seems to me twofold first that man is a spirit and bound by invisible bonds to all men secondly that he wears clothes which are the visible emblems of that fact has not your red hangingindividual a horsehair wig squirrelskins and a plushgown whereby all mortals know that he is a judge society which the more i think of it astonishes me the more is founded upon cloth often in my atrabiliarmoods when i read of pompous ceremonials frankfort coronations royal drawingrooms levees couchees and how the ushers and macers and pursuivants are all in waiting how duke this is presented by archduke that and colonel a by general b and innumerable bishops admirals and miscellaneous functionaries are advancing gallantly to the anointed presence and i strive in my remote privacy to form a clear picture of that solemnity on a sudden as by some enchanters wand the shall i speak it the clothes flyoff the whole dramatic corps and dukes grandees bishops generals anointed presence itself every mothers son of them stand straddling there not a shirt on them and i know not whether to laugh or weep this physical or psychical infirmity in which perhaps i am not singular i have after hesitation thought right to publish for the solace of those afflicted with the like would to heaven say we thou hadst thought right to keep it secret who is there now that can read the five columns of presentations in his morning newspaper without a shudder hypochondriac men and all men are to a certain extent hypochondriac should be more gently treated with what readiness our fancy in this shattered state of the nerves follows out the consequences which teufelsdrckh with a devilish coolness goes on to draw what would majesty do could such an accident befall in reality should the buttons all simultaneously start and the solid wool evaporate in very deed as here in dream ach gott how each skulks into the nearest hidingplace their high state tragedy haupt und staatsaction becomes a pickleherringfarce to weep at which is the worst kind of farce the tables according to horace and with them the whole fabric of government legislation property police and civilised society are dissolved in wails and howls lives the man that can figure a naked duke of windlestraw addressing a naked house of lords imagination choked as in mephitic air recoils on itself and will not forward with the picture the woolsack the ministerial the opposition benches infandum infandum and yet why is the thing impossible was not every soul or rather every body of these guardians of our liberties naked or nearly so last night a forked radish with a head fantastically carved and why might he not did our stern fate so order it walk out to st stephens as well as into bed in that nofashion and there with other similar radishes hold a bed of justice solace of those afflicted with the like unhappy teufelsdrckh had man ever such a physical or psychical infirmity before and now how many perhaps may thy unparalleled confession which we even to the sounder british world and goadedon by critical and biographical duty grudge to reimpart incurably infect therewith art thou the malignest of sansculottists or only the maddest it will remain to be examined adds the inexorable teufelsdrckh in how far the scarecrow as a clothed person is not also entitled to benefit of clergy and english trial by jury nay perhaps considering his high function for is not he too a defender of property and sovereign armed with the terrors of the law to a certain royal immunity and inviolability which however misers and the meaner class of persons are not always voluntarily disposed to grant him o my friends we are in yorick sternes words but as turkeys driven with a stick and red clout to the market or if some drivers as they do in norfolk take a dried bladder and put peas in it the rattle thereof terrifies the boldest chapter x pure reason it must now be apparent enough that our professor as above hinted is a speculative radical and of the very darkest tinge acknowledging for most part in the solemnities and paraphernalia of civilised life which we make so much of nothing but so many clothrags turkeypoles and bladders with dried peas to linger among such speculations longer than mere science requires a discerning public can have no wish for our purposes the simple fact that such a naked world is possible nay actually exists under the clothed one will be sufficient much therefore we omit about kings wrestling naked on the green with carmen and the kings being thrown dissect them with scalpels says teufelsdrckh the same viscera tissues livers lights and other

the laws of unstable and stable equilibrium with other branches of wagonscience and has actually put forth his hand and operated on nature is the more cunningly gifted of the two whence then their so unspeakable difference from clothes much also we shall omit about confusion of ranks and joan and my lady and how it would be everywhere hail fellow well met and chaos were come again all which to any one that has once fairly picturedout the grand motheridea society in a state of nakedness will spontaneously suggest itself should some sceptical individual still entertain doubts whether in a world without clothes the smallest politeness polity or even police could exist let him turn to the original volume and view there the boundless serbonian bog of sansculottism stretching sour and pestilential over which we have lightly flown where not only whole armies but whole nations might sink if indeed the following argument in its brief riveting emphasis be not of itself incontrovertible and final are we opossums have we natural pouches like the kangaroo or how without clothes could we possess the masterorgan souls seat and true pineal gland of the body social i mean a purse nevertheless it is impossible to hate professor teufelsdrckh at worst one knows not whether to hate or to love him for though in looking at the fair tapestry of human life with its royal and even sacred figures he dwells not on the obverse alone but here chiefly on the reverse and indeed turns out the rough seams tatters and manifold thrums of that unsightly wrongside with an almost diabolic patience and indifference which must have sunk him in the estimation of most readers there is that within which unspeakably distinguishes him from all other past and present sansculottists the grand unparalleled peculiarity of teufelsdrckh is that with all this descendentalism he combines a transcendentalism no less superlative whereby if on the one hand he degrade man below most animals except those jacketed gouda cows he on the other exalts him beyond the visible heavens almost to an equality with the gods to the eye of vulgar logic says he what is man an omnivorous biped that wears breeches to the eye of pure reason what is he a soul a spirit and divine apparition round his mysterious me there lies under all those woolrags a garment of flesh or of senses contextured in the loom of heaven whereby he is revealed to his like and dwells with them in union and division and sees and fashions for himself a universe with azure starry spaces and long thousands of years deephidden is he under that strange garment amid sounds and colours and forms as it were swathedin and inextricably overshrouded yet it is skywoven and worthy of a god stands he not thereby in the centre of immensities in the conflux of eternities he feels power has been given him to know to believe nay does not the spirit of love free in its celestial primeval brightness even here though but for moments look through well said saint chrysostom with his lips of gold the true shekinah is man where else is the godspresence manifested not to our eyes only but to our hearts as in our fellowman in such passages unhappily too rare the high platonic mysticism of our author which is perhaps the fundamental element of his nature bursts forth as it were in full flood and through all the vapour and tarnish of what is often so perverse so mean in his exterior and environment we seem to look into a whole inward sea of light and love though alas the grim coppery clouds soon roll together again and hide it from view such tendency to mysticism is everywhere traceable in this man and indeed to attentive readers must have been long ago apparent nothing that he sees but has more than a common meaning but has two meanings thus if in the highest imperial sceptre and charlemagnemantle as well as in the poorest oxgoad and gipsyblanket he finds prose decay contemptibility there is in each sort poetry also and a reverend worth for matter were it never so despicable is spirit the manifestation of spirit were it never so honourable can it be more the thing visible nay the thing imagined the thing in any way conceived as visible what is it but a garment a clothing of the higher celestial invisible unimaginable formless dark with excess of bright under which point of view the following passage so strange in purport so strange in phrase seems characteristic enough the beginning of all wisdom is to look fixedly on clothes or even with armed eyesight till they become transparent the philosopher says the wisest of this age must station himself in the middle how true the philosopher is he to whom the highest has descended and the lowest has mounted up who is the equal and kindly brother of all shall we tremble before clothwebs and cobwebs whether woven in arkwright looms or by the silent arachnes that weave unrestingly in our imagination or on the other hand what is there that we cannot love since all was created by god happy he who can look through the clothes of a man the woollen and fleshly and official bankpaper and statepaper clothes into the man himself and discern it may be in this or the other dread potentate a more or less incompetent digestiveapparatus yet also an inscrutable venerable mystery in the meanest tinker that sees with eyes for the rest as is natural to a man of this kind he deals much in the feeling of wonder insists on the necessity and high worth of universal wonder which he holds to be the only reasonable temper for the denizen of so singular a planet as ours wonder says he is the basis of worship the reign of wonder is perennial indestructible in man only at certain stages as the present it is for some short season a reign in partibus infidelium that progress of science which is to destroy wonder and in its stead substitute mensuration and numeration finds small favour with teufelsdrckh much as he otherwise venerates these two latter processes shall your science exclaims he proceed in the small chinklighted or even oillighted underground workshop of logic alone and mans mind become an arithmetical mill whereof memory is the hopper and mere tables of sines and tangents codification and treatises of what you call political economy are the meal and what is that science which the scientific head alone were it screwed off and like the doctors in the arabian tale set in a basin to keep it alive could prosecute without shadow of a heart but one other of the mechanical and menial handicrafts for which the scientific head having a soul in it is too noble an organ i mean that thought without reverence is barren perhaps poisonous at best dies like cookery with the day that called it forth does not live like sowing in successive tilths and widerspreading harvests bringing food and plenteous increase to all time in such wise does teufelsdrckh deal hits harder or softer according to ability yet ever as we would fain persuade ourselves with charitable intent above all that class of logicchoppers and treblepipe scoffers and professed enemies to wonder who in these days so numerously patrol as nightconstables about the mechanics institute of science and cackle like true oldroman geese and goslings round their capitol on any alarm or on none nay who often as illuminated sceptics walk abroad into peaceable society in full daylight with rattle and lantern and insist on guiding you and guarding you therewith though the sun is shining and the street populous with mere justiceloving men that whole class is inexpressibly wearisome to him hear with what uncommon animation he perorates the man who cannot wonder who does not habitually wonder and worship were he president of innumerable royal societies and carried the whole mcanique cleste and hegels philosophy and the epitome of all laboratories and observatories with their results in his single head is but a pair of spectacles behind which there is no eye let those who have eyes look through him then he may be useful thou wilt have no mystery and mysticism wilt walk through thy world by the sunshine of what thou callest truth or even by the handlamp of what i call attorneylogic and explain all account for all or believe nothing of it nay thou wilt attempt laughter whoso recognises the unfathomable allpervading domain of mystery which is everywhere under our feet and among our hands to whom the universe is an oracle and temple as well as a kitchen and cattlestall he shall be a delirious mystic to him thou with sniffing charity wilt protrusively proffer thy handlamp and shriek as one injured when he kicks his foot through it armer teufel doth not thy cow calve doth not thy bull gender thou thyself wert thou not born wilt thou not die explain me all this or do one of two things retire into private places with thy foolish cackle or what were better give it up and weep not that the reign of wonder is done and gods world all disembellished and prosaic but that thou hitherto art a dilettante and sandblind pedant chapter xi prospective the philosophy of clothes is now to all readers as we predicted it would do unfolding itself into new boundless expansions of a cloudclapt almost chimerical aspect yet not without azure loomings in the far distance and streaks as of an elysian brightness the highly questionable purport and promise of which it is becoming more and more important for us to ascertain is that a real elysian brightness cries many a timid wayfarer or the reflex of pandemonian lava is it of a truth leading us into beatific asphodel meadows or the yellowburning marl of a hellonearth our professor like other mystics whether delirious or inspired gives an editor enough to do ever higher and dizzier are the heights he leads us to more piercing allcomprehending allconfounding are his views and glances for example this of nature being not an aggregate but a whole well sang the hebrew psalmist if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the universe god is there thou thyself o cultivated reader who too probably art no psalmist but a prosaist knowing god only by tradition knowest thou any corner of the world where at least force is not the drop which thou shakest from thy wet hand rests not where it falls but tomorrow thou findest it swept away already on the wings of the northwind it is nearing the tropic of cancer how came it to evaporate and not lie motionless thinkest thou there is aught motionless without force and utterly dead as i rode through the schwarzwald i said to myself that little fire which grows starlike across the darkgrowing nachtende moor where the sooty smith bends over his anvil and thou hopest to replace thy lost horseshoe is it a detached separated speck cutoff from the whole universe or indissolubly joined to the whole thou fool that smithyfire was primarily kindled at the sun is fed by air that circulates from before noahs deluge from beyond the dogstar therein with iron force and coal force and the far stranger force of man are cunning affinities and battles and victories of force brought about it is a little ganglion or nervous centre in the great vital system of immensity call it if thou wilt an unconscious altar kindled on the bosom of the all whose iron sacrifice whose iron smoke and influence reach quite through the all whose dingy priest not by word yet by brain and sinew preaches forth the mystery of force nay preaches forth exoterically enough one little textlet from the gospel of freedom the gospel of mans force commanding and one day to be allcommanding detached separated i say there is no such separation nothing hitherto was ever stranded cast aside but all were it only a withered leaf works together with all is borne forward on the bottomless shoreless flood of action and lives through perpetual metamorphoses the withered leaf is not dead and lost there are forces in it and around it though working in inverse order else how could it rot despise not the rag from which man makes paper or the litter from which the earth makes corn rightly viewed no meanest object is insignificant all objects are as windows through which the philosophic eye looks into infinitude itself again leaving that wondrous schwarzwald smithyaltar what vacant highsailing airships are these and whither will they sail with us all visible things are emblems what thou seest is not there on its own account strictly taken is not there at all matter exists only spiritually and to represent some idea and body it forth hence clothes as despicable as we think them are so unspeakably significant clothes from the kings mantle downwards are emblematic not of want only but of a manifold cunning victory over want on the other hand all emblematic things are properly clothes thoughtwoven or handwoven must not the imagination weave garments visible bodies wherein the else invisible creations and inspirations of our reason are like spirits revealed and first become allpowerful the rather if as we often see the hand too aid her and by wool clothes or otherwise reveal such even to the outward eye men are properly said to be clothed with authority clothed with beauty with curses and the like nay if you consider it what is man himself and his whole terrestrial life but an emblem a clothing or visible garment for that divine me of his cast hither like a lightparticle down from heaven thus is he said also to be clothed with a body language is called the garment of thought however it should rather be language is the fleshgarment the body of thought i said that imagination wove this fleshgarment and does not she metaphors are her stuff examine language what if you except some few primitive elements of natural sound what is it all but metaphors recognised as such or no longer recognised still fluid and florid or now solidgrown and colourless if those same primitive elements are the osseous fixtures in the fleshgarment language then are metaphors its muscles and tissues and living integuments an unmetaphorical style you shall in vain seek for is not your very attention a stretchingto the difference lies here some styles are lean adust wiry the muscle itself seems osseous some are even quite pallid hungerbitten and deadlooking while others again glow in the flush of health and vigorous selfgrowth sometimes as in my own case not without an apoplectic tendency moreover there are sham metaphors which overhanging that same thoughtsbody best naked and deceptively bedizening or bolstering it out may be called its false stuffings superfluous showcloaks putzmntel and tawdry woollen rags whereof he that runs and reads may gather whole hampers and burn them than which paragraph on metaphors did the reader ever chance to see a more surprisingly metaphorical however that is not our chief grievance the professor continues why multiply instances it is written the heavens and the earth shall fade away like a vesture which indeed they are the timevesture of the eternal whatsoever sensibly exists whatsoever represents spirit to spirit is properly a clothing a suit of raiment put on for a season and to be laid off thus in this one pregnant subject of clothes rightly understood is included all that men have thought dreamed done and been the whole external universe and what it holds is but clothing and the essence of all science lies in the philosophy of clothes towards these dim infinitelyexpanded regions closebordering on the impalpable inane it is not without apprehension and perpetual difficulties that the editor sees himself journeying and struggling till lately a cheerful daystar of hope hung before him in the expected aid of hofrath heuschrecke which daystar however melts now not into the red of morning but into a vague gray halflight uncertain whether dawn of day or dusk of utter darkness for the last week these socalled biographical documents are in his hand by the kindness of a scottish hamburg merchant whose name known to the whole mercantile world he must not mention but whose honourable courtesy now and often before spontaneously manifested to him a mere literary stranger he cannot soon forget the bulky weissnichtwo packet with all its customhouse seals foreign hieroglyphs and miscellaneous tokens of travel arrived here in perfect safety and free of cost the reader shall now fancy with what hot haste it was broken up with what breathless expectation glanced over and alas with what unquiet disappointment it has since then been often thrown down and again taken up hofrath heuschrecke in a too longwinded letter full of compliments weissnichtwo politics dinners dining repartees and other ephemeral trivialities proceeds to remind us of what we know well already that however it may be with metaphysics and other abstract science originating in the head verstand alone no lifephilosophy lebensphilosophie such as this of clothes pretends to be which originates equally in the character gemth and equally speaks thereto can attain its significance till the character itself is known and seen till the authors view of the world weltansicht and how he actively and passively came by such view are clear in short till a biography of him has been philosophicopoetically written and philosophicopoetically read nay adds he were the speculative scientific truth even known you still in this inquiring age ask yourself whence came it and why and how and rest not till if no better may be fancy have shapedout an answer and either in the authentic lineaments of fact or the forged ones of fiction a complete picture and genetical history of the man and his spiritual endeavour lies before you but why says the hofrath and indeed say we do i dilate on the uses of our teufelsdrckhs biography the great herr minister von goethe has penetratingly remarked that man is properly the only object that interests man thus i too have noted that in weissnichtwo our whole conversation is little or nothing else but biography or autobiography ever humanoanecdotical menschlichanekdotisch biography is by nature the most universally profitable universally pleasant of all things especially biography of distinguished individuals by this time mein verehrtester my most esteemed continues he with an eloquence which unless the words be purloined from teufelsdrckh or some trick of his as we suspect is wellnigh unaccountable by this time you are fairly plunged vertieft in that mighty forest of clothesphilosophy and looking round as all readers do with astonishment enough such portions and passages as you have already mastered and brought to paper could not but awaken a strange curiosity touching the mind they issued from the perhaps unparalleled psychical mechanism which manufactured such matter and emitted it to the light of day had teufelsdrckh also a father and mother did he at one time wear drivelbibs and live on spoonmeat did he ever in rapture and tears clasp a friends bosom to his looks he also wistfully into the long burialaisle of the past where only winds and their low harsh moan give inarticulate answer has he fought duels good heaven how did he comport himself when in love by what singular stairsteps in short and subterranean passages and sloughs of despair and steep pisgah hills has he reached this wonderful prophetic hebron a true oldclothes jewry where he now dwells to all these natural questions the voice of public history is as yet silent certain only that he has been and is a pilgrim and traveller from a far country more or less footsore and travelsoiled has parted with roadcompanions fallen among thieves been poisoned by bad cookery blistered with bugbites nevertheless at every stage for they have let him pass has had the bill to discharge but the whole particulars of his route his weatherobservations the picturesque sketches he took though all regularly jotted down in indelible sympatheticink by an invisible interior penman are these nowhere forthcoming perhaps quite lost one other leaf of that mighty volume of human memory left to fly abroad unprinted unpublished unbound up as waste paper and to rot the sport of rainy winds no verehrtester herr herausgeber in no wise i here by the unexampled favour you stand in with our sage send not a biography only but an autobiography at least the materials for such wherefrom if i misreckon not your perspicacity will draw fullest insight and so the whole philosophy and philosopher of clothes will stand clear to the wondering eyes of england nay thence through america through hindostan and the antipodal new holland finally conquer einnehmen great part of this terrestrial planet and now let the sympathising reader judge of our feeling when in place of this same autobiography with fullest insight we find six considerable paperbags carefully sealed and marked successively in gilt chinaink with the symbols of the six southern zodiacal signs beginning at libra in the inside of which sealed bags lie miscellaneous masses of sheets and oftener shreds and snips written in professor teufelsdrckhs scarce legible cursivschrift and treating of all imaginable things under the zodiac and above it but of his own personal history only at rare intervals and then in the most enigmatic manner whole fascicles there are wherein the professor or as he here speaking in the third person calls himself the wanderer is not once named then again amidst what seems to be a metaphysicotheological disquisition detached thoughts on the steamengine or the continued possibility of prophecy we shall meet with some quite private not unimportant biographical fact on certain sheets stand dreams authentic or not while the circumjacent waking actions are omitted anecdotes oftenest without date of place or time fly loosely on separate slips like sibylline leaves interspersed also are long purely autobiographical delineations yet without connexion without recognisable coherence so unimportant so superfluously minute they almost remind us of pp clerk of this parish thus does famine of intelligence alternate with waste selection order appears to be unknown to the professor in all bags the same imbroglio only perhaps in the bag capricorn and those near it the confusion a little worse confounded close by a rather eloquent oration on receiving the doctorshat lie washbills marked bezahlt settled his travels are indicated by the streetadvertisements of the various cities he has visited of which streetadvertisements in most living tongues here is perhaps the completest collection extant so that if the clothesvolume itself was too like a chaos we have now instead of the solar luminary that should still it the airy limbo which by intermixture will farther volatilise and discompose it as we shall perhaps see it our duty ultimately to deposit these six paperbags in the british museum farther description and all vituperation of them may be spared biography or autobiography of teufelsdrckh there is clearly enough none to be gleaned here at most some sketchy shadowy fugitive likeness of him may by unheardof efforts partly of intellect partly of imagination on the side of editor and of reader rise up between them only as a gaseouschaotic appendix to that aqueouschaotic volume can the contents of the six bags hover round us and portions thereof be incorporated with our delineation of it daily and nightly does the editor sit with green spectacles deciphering these unimaginable documents from their perplexed cursivschrift collating them with the almost equally unimaginable volume which stands in legible print over such a universal medley of high and low of hot cold moist and dry is he here struggling by union of like with like which is method to build a firm bridge for british travellers never perhaps since our first bridgebuilders sin and death built that stupendous arch from hellgate to the earth did any pontifex or pontiff undertake such a task as the present editor for in this arch too leading as we humbly presume far otherwards than that grand primeval one the materials are to be fishedup from the weltering deep and down from the simmering air here one mass there another and cunningly cemented while the elements boil beneath nor is there any supernatural force to do it with but simply the diligence and feeble thinking faculty of an english editor endeavouring to evolve printed creation out of a german printed and written chaos wherein as he shoots to and fro in it gathering clutching piercing the why to the fardistant wherefore his whole faculty and self are like to be swallowed up patiently under these incessant toils and agitations does the editor dismissing all anger see his otherwise robust health declining some fraction of his allotted natural sleep nightly leaving him and little but an inflamed nervoussystem to be looked for what is the use of health or of life if not to do some work therewith and what work nobler than transplanting foreign thought into the barren domestic soil except indeed planting thought of your own which the fewest are privileged to do wild as it looks this philosophy of clothes can we ever reach its real meaning promises to reveal newcoming eras the first dim rudiments and alreadybudding germs of a nobler era in universal history is not such a prize worth some striving forward with us courageous reader be it towards failure or towards success the latter thou sharest with us the former also is not all our own book second chapter i genesis in a psychological point of view it is perhaps questionable whether from birth and genealogy how closely scrutinised soever much insight is to be gained nevertheless as in every phenomenon the beginning remains always the most notable moment so with regard to any great man we rest not till for our scientific profit or not the whole circumstances of his first appearance in this planet and what manner of public entry he made are with utmost completeness rendered manifest to the genesis of our clothesphilosopher then be this first chapter consecrated unhappily indeed he seems to be of quite obscure extraction uncertain we might almost say whether of any so that this genesis of his can properly be nothing but an exodus or transit out of invisibility into visibility whereof the preliminary portion is nowhere forthcoming in the village of entepfuhl thus writes he in the bag libra on various papers which we arrange with difficulty dwelt andreas futteral and his wife childless in still seclusion and cheerful though now verging towards old age andreas had been grenadier sergeant and even regimental schoolmaster under frederick the great but now quitting the halbert and ferule for the spade and pruninghook cultivated a little orchard on the produce of which he cincinnatuslike lived not without dignity fruits the peach the apple the grape with other varieties came in their season all which andreas knew how to sell on evenings he smoked largely or read as beseemed a regimental schoolmaster and talked to neighbours that would listen about the victory of rossbach and how fritz the only der einzige had once with his own royal lips spoken to him had been pleased to say when andreas as campsentinel demanded the password schweig hund peace hound before any of his staffadjutants could answer das nenn ich mir einen knig there is what i call a king would andreas exclaim but the smoke of kunersdorf was still smarting his eyes gretchen the housewife won like desdemona by the deeds rather than the looks of her now veteran othello lived not in altogether military subordination for as andreas said the womankind will not drill wer kann die weiberchen dressiren nevertheless she at heart loved him both for valour and wisdom to her a prussian grenadier sergeant and regiments schoolmaster was little other than a cicero and cid what you see yet cannot see over is as good as infinite nay was not andreas in very deed a man of order courage downrightness geradheit that understood bschings geography had been in the victory of rossbach and left for dead in the camisade of hochkirch the good gretchen for all her fretting watched over him and hovered round him as only a true housemother can assiduously she cooked and sewed and scoured for him so that not only his old regimental sword and grenadiercap but the whole habitation and environment where on pegs of honour they hung looked ever trim and gay a roomy painted cottage embowered in fruittrees and foresttrees evergreens and honeysuckles rising manycoloured from amid shaven grassplots flowers strugglingin through the very windows under its long projecting eaves nothing but gardentools in methodic piles to screen them from rain and seats where especially on summer nights a king might have wished to sit and smoke and call it his such a bauergut copyhold had gretchen given her veteran whose sinewy arms and longdisused gardening talent had made it what you saw into this umbrageous mansnest one meek yellow evening or dusk when the sun hidden indeed from terrestrial entepfuhl did nevertheless journey visible and radiant along the celestial balance libra it was that a stranger of reverend aspect entered and with grave salutation stood before the two rather astonished housemates he was closemuffled in a wide mantle which without further parley unfolding he deposited therefrom what seemed some basket overhung with green persian silk saying only ihr lieben leute hier bringe ein unschtzbares verleihen nehmt es in aller acht sorgfltigst bentzt es mit hohem lohn oder wohl mit schweren zinsen wirds einst zurckgefordert good christian people here lies for you an invaluable loan take all heed thereof in all carefulness employ it with high recompense or else with heavy penalty will it one day be required back uttering which singular words in a clear belllike forever memorable tone the stranger gracefully withdrew and before andreas or his wife gazing in expectant wonder had time to fashion either question or answer was clean gone neither out of doors could aught of him be seen or heard he had vanished in the thickets in the dusk the orchardgate stood quietly closed the stranger was gone once and always so sudden had the whole transaction been in the autumn stillness and twilight so gentle noiseless that the futterals could have fancied it all a trick of imagination or some visit from an authentic spirit only that the greensilk basket such as neither imagination nor authentic spirits are wont to carry still stood visible and tangible on their little parlourtable towards this the astonished couple now with lit candle hastily turned their attention lifting the green veil to see what invaluable it hid they descried there amid down and rich white wrappages no pitt diamond or hapsburg regalia but in the softest sleep a little redcoloured infant beside it lay a roll of gold friedrichs the exact amount of which was never publicly known also a taufschein baptismal certificate wherein unfortunately nothing but the name was decipherable other document or indication none whatever to wonder and conjecture was unavailing then and always thenceforth nowhere in entepfuhl on the morrow or next day did tidings transpire of any such figure as the stranger nor could the traveller who had passed through the neighbouring town in coachandfour be connected with this apparition except in the way of gratuitous surmise meanwhile for andreas and his wife the grand practical problem was what to do with this little sleeping redcoloured infant amid amazements and curiosities which had to die away without external satisfying they resolved as in such circumstances charitable prudent people needs must on nursing it though with spoonmeat into whiteness and if possible into manhood the heavens smiled on their endeavour thus has that same mysterious individual ever since had a status for himself in this visible universe some modicum of victual and lodging and paradeground and now expanded in bulk faculty and knowledge of good and evil he as herr diogenes teufelsdrckh professes or is ready to profess perhaps not altogether without effect in the new university of weissnichtwo the new science of things in general our philosopher declares here as indeed we should think he well might that these facts first communicated by the good gretchen futteral in his twelfth year produced on the boyish heart and fancy a quite indelible impression who this reverend personage he says that glided into the orchard cottage when the sun was in libra and then as on spirits wings glided out again might be an inexpressible desire full of love and of sadness has often since struggled within me to shape an answer ever in my distresses and my loneliness has fantasy turned full of longing sehnsuchtsvoll to that unknown father who perhaps far from me perhaps near either way invisible might have taken me to his paternal bosom there to lie screened from many a woe thou beloved father dost thou still shut out from me only by thin penetrable curtains of earthly space wend to and fro among the crowd of the living or art thou hidden by those far thicker curtains of the everlasting night or rather of the everlasting day through which my mortal eye and outstretched arms need not strive to reach alas i know not and in vain vex myself to know more than once heartdeluded have i taken for thee this and the other noblelooking stranger and approached him wistfully with infinite regard but he too had to repel me he too was not thou and yet o man born of woman cries the autobiographer with one of his sudden whirls wherein is my case peculiar hadst thou any more than i a father whom thou knowest the andreas and gretchen or the adam and eve who led thee into life and for a time suckled and papfed thee there whom thou namest father and mother these were like mine but thy nursingfather and nursingmother thy true beginning and father is in heaven whom with the bodily eye thou shalt never behold but only with the spiritual the little green veil adds he among much similar moralising and embroiled discoursing i yet keep still more inseparably the name diogenes teufelsdrckh from the veil can nothing be inferred a piece of now quite faded persian silk like thousands of others on the name i have many times meditated and conjectured but neither in this lay there any clue that it was my unknown fathers name i must hesitate to believe to no purpose have i searched through all the heralds books in and without the german empire and through all manner of subscriberlists prnumeranten militiarolls and other namecatalogues extraordinary names as we have in germany the name teufelsdrckh except as appended to my own person nowhere occurs again what may the unchristian rather than christian diogenes mean did that reverend basketbearer intend by such designation to shadowforth my future destiny or his own present malign humour perhaps the latter perhaps both thou illstarred parent who like an ostrich hadst to leave thy illstarred offspring to be hatched into selfsupport by the mere skyinfluences of chance can thy pilgrimage have been a smooth one beset by misfortune thou doubtless hast been or indeed by the worst figure of misfortune by misconduct often have i fancied how in thy hard lifebattle thou wert shot at and slung at wounded handfettered hamstrung browbeaten and bedevilled by the timespirit zeitgeist in thyself and others till the good soul first given thee was seared into grim rage and thou hadst nothing for it but to leave in me an indignant appeal to the future and living speaking protest against the devil as that same spirit not of the time only but of time itself is well named which appeal and protest may i now modestly add was not perhaps quite lost in air for indeed as walter shandy often insisted there is much nay almost all in names the name is the earliest garment you wrap round the earthvisiting me to which it thenceforth cleaves more tenaciously for there are names that have lasted nigh thirty centuries than the very skin and now from without what mystic influences does it not send inwards even to the centre especially in those plastic firsttimes when the whole soul is yet infantine soft and the invisible seedgrain will grow to be an all overshadowing tree names could i unfold the influence of names which are the most important of all clothings i were a second greater trismegistus not only all common speech but science poetry itself is no other if thou consider it than a right naming adams first task was giving names to natural appearances what is ours still but a continuation of the same be the appearances exoticvegetable organic mechanic stars or starry movements as in science or as in poetry passions virtues calamities godattributes gods in a very plain sense the proverb says call one a thief and he will steal in an almost similar sense may we not perhaps say call one diogenes teufelsdrckh and he will open the philosophy of clothes meanwhile the incipient diogenes like others all ignorant of his why his how or whereabout was opening his eyes to the kind light sprawlingout his ten fingers and toes listening tasting feeling in a word by all his five senses still more by his sixth sense of hunger and a whole infinitude of inward spiritual halfawakened senses endeavouring daily to acquire for himself some knowledge of this strange universe where he had arrived be his task therein what it might infinite was his progress thus in some fifteen months he could perform the miracle of speech to breed a fresh soul is it not like brooding a fresh celestial egg wherein as yet all is formless powerless yet by degrees organic elements and fibres shoot through the watery albumen and out of vague sensation grows thought grows fantasy and force and we have philosophies dynasties nay poetries and religions young diogenes or rather young gneschen for by such diminutive had they in their fondness named him travelled forward to those high consummations by quick yet easy stages the futterals to avoid vain talk and moreover keep the roll of gold friedrichs safe gaveout that he was a grandnephew the orphan of some sisters daughter suddenly deceased in andreass distant prussian birthland of whom as of her indigent sorrowing widower little enough was known at entepfuhl heedless of all which the nurseling took to his spoonmeat and throve i have heard him noted as a still infant that kept his mind much to himself above all that seldom or never cried he already felt that time was precious that he had other work cutout for him than whimpering such after utmost painful search and collation among these miscellaneous papermasses is all the notice we can gather of herr teufelsdrckhs genealogy more imperfect more enigmatic it can seem to few readers than to us the professor in whom truly we more and more discern a certain satirical turn and deep undercurrents of roguish whim for the present stands pledged in honour so we will not doubt him but seems it not conceivable that by the good gretchen futteral or some other perhaps interested party he has himself been deceived should these sheets translated or not ever reach the entepfuhl circulating library some cultivated native of that district might feel called to afford explanation nay since books like invisible scouts permeate the whole habitable globe and timbuctoo itself is not safe from british literature may not some copy find out even the mysterious basketbearing stranger who in a state of extreme senility perhaps still exists and gently force even him to disclose himself to claim openly a son in whom any father may feel pride chapter ii idyllic happy season of childhood exclaims teufelsdrckh kind nature that art to all a bountiful mother that visitest the poor mans hut with auroral radiance and for thy nurseling hast provided a soft swathing of love and infinite hope wherein he waxes and slumbers dancedround umgaukelt by sweetest dreams if the paternal cottage still shuts us in its roof still screens us with a father we have as yet a prophet priest and king and an obedience that makes us free the young

that slower or quicker decay and ceaseless downrushing of the universal worldfabric from the granite mountain to the man or daymoth is yet unknown and in a motionless universe we taste what afterwards in this quickwhirling universe is forever denied us the balm of rest sleep on thou fair child for thy long rough journey is at hand a little while and thou too shalt sleep no more but thy very dreams shall be mimic battles thou too with old arnauld wilt have to say in stern patience rest rest shall i not have all eternity to rest in celestial nepenthe though a pyrrhus conquer empires and an alexander sack the world he finds thee not and thou hast once fallen gently of thy own accord on the eyelids on the heart of every mothers child for as yet sleep and waking are one the fair lifegarden rustles infinite around and everywhere is dewy fragrance and the budding of hope which budding if in youth too frostnipt it grow to flowers will in manhood yield no fruit but a prickly bitterrinded stonefruit of which the fewest can find the kernel in such rosecoloured light does our professor as poets are wont look back on his childhood the historical details of which to say nothing of much other vague oratorical matter he accordingly dwells on with an almost wearisome minuteness we hear of entepfuhl standing in trustful derangement among the woody slopes the paternal orchard flanking it as extreme outpost from below the little kuhbach gushing kindly by among beechrows through river after river into the donau into the black sea into the atmosphere and universe and how the brave old linden stretching like a parasol of twenty ells in radius overtopping all other rows and clumps toweredup from the central agora and campus martius of the village like its sacred tree and how the old men sat talking under its shadow gneschen often greedily listening and the wearied labourers reclined and the unwearied children sported and the young men and maidens often danced to flutemusic glorious summer twilights cries teufelsdrckh when the sun like a proud conqueror and imperial taskmaster turned his back with his goldpurple emblazonry and all his fireclad bodyguard of prismatic colours and the tired brickmakers of this clay earth might steal a little frolic and those few meek stars would not tell of them then we have long details of the weinlesen vintage the harvesthome christmas and so forth with a whole cycle of the entepfuhl childrensgames differing apparently by mere superficial shades from those of other countries concerning all which we shall here for obvious reasons say nothing what cares the world for our as yet miniature philosophers achievements under that brave old linden or even where is the use of such practical reflections as the following in all the sports of children were it only in their wanton breakages and defacements you shall discern a creative instinct schaffenden trieb the mankin feels that he is a born man that his vocation is to work the choicest present you can make him is a tool be it knife or pengun for construction or for destruction either way it is for work for change in gregarious sports of skill or strength the boy trains himself to coperation for war or peace as governor or governed the little maid again provident of her domestic destiny takes with preference to dolls perhaps however we may give this anecdote considering who it is that relates it my first shortclothes were of yellow serge or rather i should say my first shortcloth for the vesture was one and indivisible reaching from neck to ankle a mere body with four limbs of which fashion how little could i then divine the architectural how much less the moral significance more graceful is the following little picture on fine evenings i was wont to carryforth my supper breadcrumb boiled in milk and eat it outofdoors on the coping of the orchardwall which i could reach by climbing or still more easily if father andreas would setup the pruningladder my porringer was placed there many a sunset have i looking at the distant western mountains consumed not without relish my evening meal those hues of gold and azure that hush of worlds expectation as day died were still a hebrew speech for me nevertheless i was looking at the fair illuminated letters and had an eye for their gilding with the little ones friendship for cattle and poultry we shall not much intermeddle it may be that hereby he acquired a certain deeper sympathy with animated nature but when we would ask saw any man in a collection of biographical documents such a piece as this impressive enough bedeutungsvoll was it to hear in early morning the swineherds horn and know that so many hungry happy quadrupeds were on all sides starting in hot haste to join him for breakfast on the heath or to see them at eventide all marchingin again with short squeak almost in military order and each topographically correct trottingoff in succession to the right or left through its own lane to its own dwelling till old kunz at the villagehead now left alone blew his last blast and retired for the night we are wont to love the hog chiefly in the form of ham yet did not these bristly thickskinned beings here manifest intelligence perhaps humour of character at any rate a touching trustful submissiveness to man who were he but a swineherd in darned gabardine and leather breeches more resembling slate or discolouredtin breeches is still the hierarch of this lower world it is maintained by helvetius and his set that an infant of genius is quite the same as any other infant only that certain surprisingly favourable influences accompany him through life especially through childhood and expand him while others lie closefolded and continue dunces herein say they consists the whole difference between an inspired prophet and a doublebarrelled gamepreserver the inner man of the one has been fostered into generous development that of the other crusheddown perhaps by vigour of animal digestion and the like has exuded and evaporated or at best sleeps now irresuscitably stagnant at the bottom of his stomach with which opinion cries teufelsdrckh i should as soon agree as with this other that an acorn might by favourable or unfavourable influences of soil and climate be nursed into a cabbage or the cabbageseed into an oak nevertheless continues he i too acknowledge the allbut omnipotence of early culture and nurture hereby we have either a doddered dwarf bush or a hightowering wideshadowing tree either a sick yellow cabbage or an edible luxuriant green one of a truth it is the duty of all men especially of all philosophers to notedown with accuracy the characteristic circumstances of their education what furthered what hindered what in any way modified it to which duty nowadays so pressing for many a german autobiographer i also zealously address myself thou rogue is it by shortclothes of yellow serge and swineherd horns that an infant of genius is educated and yet as usual it ever remains doubtful whether he is laughing in his sleeve at these autobiographical times of ours or writing from the abundance of his own fond ineptitude for he continues if among the everstreaming currents of sights hearings feelings for pain or pleasure whereby as in a magic hall young gneschen went about environed i might venture to select and specify perhaps these following were also of the number doubtless as childish sports call forth intellect activity so the young creatures imagination was stirred up and a historical tendency given him by the narrative habits of father andreas who with his battlereminiscences and gay austere yet hearty patriarchal aspect could not but appear another ulysses and muchenduring man eagerly i hung upon his tales when listening neighbours enlivened the hearth from these perils and these travels wild and far almost as hades itself a dim world of adventure expanded itself within me incalculable also was the knowledge i acquired in standing by the old men under the lindentree the whole of immensity was yet new to me and had not these reverend seniors talkative enough been employed in partial surveys thereof for nigh fourscore years with amazement i began to discover that entepfuhl stood in the middle of a country of a world that there was such a thing as history as biography to which i also one day by hand and tongue might contribute in a like sense worked the postwagen stagecoach which slowrolling under its mountains of men and luggage wended through our village northwards truly in the dead of night yet southwards visibly at eventide not till my eighth year did i reflect that this postwagen could be other than some terrestrial moon rising and setting by mere law of nature like the heavenly one that it came on made highways from far cities towards far cities weaving them like a monstrous shuttle into closer and closer union it was then that independently of schillers wilhelm tell i made this not quite insignificant reflection so true also in spiritual things any road this simple entepfuhl road will lead you to the end of the world why mention our swallows which out of far africa as i learned threading their way over seas and mountains corporate cities and belligerent nations yearly found themselves with the month of may snuglodged in our cottage lobby the hospitable father for cleanliness sake had fixed a little bracket plumb under their nest there they built and caught flies and twittered and bred and all i chiefly from the heart loved them bright nimble creatures who taught you the masoncraft nay stranger still gave you a masonic incorporation almost social police for if by ill chance and when time pressed your house fell have i not seen five neighbourly helpers appear next day and swashing to and fro with animated loud longdrawn chirpings and activity almost superhirundine complete it again before nightfall but undoubtedly the grand summary of entepfuhl childsculture where as in a funnel its manifold influences were concentrated and simultaneously poureddown on us was the annual cattlefair here assembling from all the four winds came the elements of an unspeakable hurlyburly nutbrown maids and nutbrown men all clearwashed loudlaughing bedizened and beribanded who came for dancing for treating and if possible for happiness topbooted graziers from the north swiss brokers italian drovers also topbooted from the south these with their subalterns in leather jerkins leather skullcaps and long oxgoads shouting in halfarticulate speech amid the inarticulate barking and bellowing apart stood potters from far saxony with their crockery in fair rows nrnberg pedlars in booths that to me seemed richer than ormuz bazaars showmen from the lago maggiore detachments of the wiener schub offscourings of vienna vociferously superintending games of chance balladsingers brayed auctioneers grew hoarse cheap new wine heuriger flowed like water still worse confounding the confusion and high over all vaulted in groundandlofty tumbling a particoloured merryandrew like the genius of the place and of life itself thus encircled by the mystery of existence under the deep heavenly firmament waitedon by the four golden seasons with their vicissitudes of contribution for even grim winter brought its skatingmatches and shootingmatches its snowstorms and christmascarols did the child sit and learn these things were the alphabet whereby in aftertime he was to syllable and partly read the grand volume of the world what matters it whether such alphabet be in large gilt letters or in small ungilt ones so you have an eye to read it for gneschen eager to learn the very act of looking thereon was a blessedness that gilded all his existence was a bright soft element of joy out of which as in prosperos island wonder after wonder bodied itself forth to teach by charming nevertheless i were but a vain dreamer to say that even then my felicity was perfect i had once for all come down from heaven into the earth among the rainbow colours that glowed on my horizon lay even in childhood a dark ring of care as yet no thicker than a thread and often quite overshone yet always it reappeared nay ever waxing broader and broader till in afteryears it almost overshadowed my whole canopy and threatened to engulf me in final night it was the ring of necessity whereby we are all begirt happy he for whom a kind heavenly sun brightens it into a ring of duty and plays round it with beautiful prismatic diffractions yet ever as basis and as bourne for our whole being it is there for the first few years of our terrestrial apprenticeship we have not much work to do but boarded and lodged gratis are set down mostly to look about us over the workshop and see others work till we have understood the tools a little and can handle this and that if good passivity alone and not good passivity and good activity together were the thing wanted then was my early position favourable beyond the most in all that respects openness of sense affectionate temper ingenuous curiosity and the fostering of these what more could i have wished on the other side however things went not so well my active power thatkraft was unfavourably hemmedin of which misfortune how many traces yet abide with me in an orderly house where the litter of childrens sports is hateful enough your training is too stoical rather to bear and forbear than to make and do i was forbid much wishes in any measure bold i had to renounce everywhere a strait bond of obedience inflexibly held me down thus already freewill often came in painful collision with necessity so that my tears flowed and at seasons the child itself might taste that root of bitterness wherewith the whole fruitage of our life is mingled and tempered in which habituation to obedience truly it was beyond measure safer to err by excess than by defect obedience is our universal duty and destiny wherein whoso will not bend must break too early and too thoroughly we cannot be trained to know that would in this world of ours is as mere zero to should and for most part as the smallest of fractions even to shall hereby was laid for me the basis of worldly discretion nay of morality itself let me not quarrel with my upbringing it was rigorous too frugal compressively secluded everyway unscientific yet in that very strictness and domestic solitude might there not lie the root of deeper earnestness of the stem from which all noble fruit must grow above all how unskilful soever it was loving it was wellmeant honest whereby every deficiency was helped my kind mother for as such i must ever love the good gretchen did me one altogether invaluable service she taught me less indeed by word than by act and daily reverent look and habitude her own simple version of the christian faith andreas too attended church yet more like a paradeduty for which he in the other world expected pay with arrears as i trust he has received but my mother with a true womans heart and fine though uncultivated sense was in the strictest acceptation religious how indestructibly the good grows and propagates itself even among the weedy entanglements of evil the highest whom i knew on earth i here saw bowed down with awe unspeakable before a higher in heaven such things especially in infancy reach inwards to the very core of your being mysteriously does a holy of holies build itself into visibility in the mysterious deeps and reverence the divinest in man springs forth undying from its mean envelopment of fear wouldst thou rather be a peasants son that knew were it never so rudely there was a god in heaven and in man or a dukes son that only knew there were twoandthirty quarters on the familycoach to which last question we must answer beware o teufelsdrckh of spiritual pride chapter iii pedagogy hitherto we see young gneschen in his indivisible case of yellow serge borne forward mostly on the arms of kind nature alone seated indeed and much to his mind in the terrestrial workshop but except his soft hazel eyes which we doubt not already gleamed with a still intelligence called upon for little voluntary movement there hitherto accordingly his aspect is rather generic that of an incipient philosopher and poet in the abstract perhaps it would trouble herr heuschrecke himself to say wherein the special doctrine of clothes is as yet foreshadowed or betokened for with gneschen as with others the man may indeed stand pictured in the boy at least all the pigments are there yet only some half of the man stands in the child or young boy namely his passive endowment not his active the more impatient are we to discover what figure he cuts in this latter capacity how when to use his own words he understands the tools a little and can handle this or that he will proceed to handle it here however may be the place to state that in much of our philosophers history there is something of an almost hindoo character nay perhaps in that so wellfostered and everyway excellent passivity of his which with no free development of the antagonist activity distinguished his childhood we may detect the rudiments of much that in after days and still in these present days astonishes the world for the shallowsighted teufelsdrckh is oftenest a man without activity of any kind a noman for the deepsighted again a man with activity almost superabundant yet so spiritual closehidden enigmatic that no mortal can foresee its explosions or even when it has exploded so much as ascertain its significance a dangerous difficult temper for the modern european above all disadvantageous in the hero of a biography now as heretofore it will behove the editor of these pages were it never so unsuccessfully to do his endeavour among the earliest tools of any complicacy which a man especially a man of letters gets to handle are his classbooks on this portion of his history teufelsdrckh looks down professedly as indifferent reading he cannot remember ever to have learned so perhaps had it by nature he says generally of the insignificant portion of my education which depended on schools there need almost no notice be taken i learned what others learn and kept it storedby in a corner of my head seeing as yet no manner of use in it my schoolmaster a downbent brokenhearted underfoot martyr as others of that guild are did little for me except discover that he could do little he good soul pronounced me a genius fit for the learned professions and that i must be sent to the gymnasium and one day to the university meanwhile what printed thing soever i could meet with i read my very copper pocketmoney i laidout on stallliterature which as it accumulated i with my own hands sewed into volumes by this means was the young head furnished with a considerable miscellany of things and shadows of things history in authentic fragments lay mingled with fabulous chimeras wherein also was reality and the whole not as dead stuff but as living pabulum tolerably nutritive for a mind as yet so peptic that the entepfuhl schoolmaster judged well we now know indeed already in the youthful gneschen with all his outward stillness there may have been manifest an inward vivacity that promised much symptoms of a spirit singularly open thoughtful almost poetical thus to say nothing of his suppers on the orchardwall and other phenomena of that earlier period have many readers of these pages stumbled in their twelfth year on such reflections as the following it struck me much as i sat by the kuhbach one silent noontide and watched it flowing gurgling to think how this same streamlet had flowed and gurgled through all changes of weather and of fortune from beyond the earliest date of history yes probably on the morning when joshua forded jordan even as at the midday when csar doubtless with difficulty swam the nile yet kept his commentaries dry this little kuhbach assiduous as tiber eurotas or siloa was murmuring on across the wilderness as yet unnamed unseen here too as in the euphrates and the ganges is a vein or veinlet of the grand worldcirculation of waters which with its atmospheric arteries has lasted and lasts simply with the world thou fool nature alone is antique and the oldest art a mushroom that idle crag thou sittest on is sixthousand years of age in which little thought as in a little fountain may there not lie the beginning of those wellnigh unutterable meditations on the grandeur and mystery of time and its relation to eternity which play such a part in this philosophy of clothes over his gymnasic and academic years the professor by no means lingers so lyrical and joyful as over his childhood green sunny tracts there are still but intersected by bitter rivulets of tears here and there stagnating into sour marshes of discontent with my first view of the hinterschlag gymnasium writes he my evil days began well do i still remember the red sunny whitsuntide morning when trotting full of hope by the side of father andreas i entered the main street of the place and saw its steepleclock then striking eight and schuldthurm jail and the aproned or disaproned burghers movingin to breakfast a little dog in mad terror was rushing past for some human imps had tied a tinkettle to its tail thus did the agonised creature loudjingling career through the whole length of the borough and become notable enough fit emblem of many a conquering hero to whom fate wedding fantasy to sense as it often elsewhere does has malignantly appended a tinkettle of ambition to chase him on which the faster he runs urges him the faster the more loudly and more foolishly fit emblem also of much that awaited myself in that mischievous den as in the world whereof it was a portion and epitome alas the kind beechrows of entepfuhl were hidden in the distance i was among strangers harshly at best indifferently disposed towards me the young heart felt for the first time quite orphaned and alone his schoolfellows as is usual persecuted him they were boys he says mostly rude boys and obeyed the impulse of rude nature which bids the deerherd fall upon any stricken hart the duckflock put to death any brokenwinged brother or sister and on all hands the strong tyrannise over the weak he admits that though perhaps in an unusual degree morally courageous he succeeded ill in battle and would fain have avoided it a result as would appear owing less to his small personal stature for in passionate seasons he was incredibly nimble than to his virtuous principles if it was disgraceful to be beaten says he it was only a shade less disgraceful to have so much as fought thus was i drawn two ways at once and in this important element of schoolhistory the warelement had little but sorrow on the whole that same excellent passivity so notable in teufelsdrckhs childhood is here visibly enough again getting nourishment he wept often indeed to such a degree that he was nicknamed der weinende the tearful which epithet till towards his thirteenth year was indeed not quite unmerited only at rare intervals did the young soul burstforth into fireeyed rage and with a stormfulness ungestm under which the boldest quailed assert that he too had rights of man or at least of mankin in all which who does not discern a fine flowertree and cinnamontree of genius nigh choked among pumpkins reedgrass and ignoble shrubs and forced if it would live to struggle upwards only and not outwards into a height quite sickly and disproportioned to its breadth we find moreover that his greek and latin were mechanically taught hebrew scarce even mechanically much else which they called history cosmography philosophy and so forth no better than not at all so that except inasmuch as nature was still busy and he himself went about as was of old his wont among the craftsmens workshops there learning many things and farther lighted on some small store of curious reading in hans wachtel the coopers house where he lodged his time it would appear was utterly wasted which facts the professor has not yet learned to look upon with any contentment indeed throughout the whole of this bag scorpio where we now are and often in the following bag he shows himself unusually animated on the matter of education and not without some touch of what we might presume to be anger my teachers says he were hidebound pedants without knowledge of mans nature or of boys or of aught save their lexicons and quarterly accountbooks innumerable dead vocables no dead language for they themselves knew no language they crammed into us and called it fostering the growth of mind how can an inanimate mechanical gerundgrinder the like of whom will in a subsequent century be manufactured at nrnberg out of wood and leather foster the growth of anything much more of mind which grows not like a vegetable by having its roots littered with etymological compost but like a spirit by mysterious contact of spirit thought kindling itself at the fire of living thought how shall he give kindling in whose own inward man there is no live coal but all is burntout to a dead grammatical cinder the hinterschlag professors knew syntax enough and of the human soul thus much that it had a faculty called memory and could be actedon through the muscular integument by appliance of birchrods alas so is it everywhere so will it ever be till the hodman is discharged or reduced to hodbearing and an architect is hired and on all hands fitly encouraged till communities and individuals discover not without surprise that fashioning the souls of a generation by knowledge can rank on a level with blowing their bodies to pieces by gunpowder that with generals and fieldmarshals for killing there should be worldhonoured dignitaries and were it possible true godordained priests for teaching but as yet though the soldier wears openly and even parades his butcheringtool nowhere far as i have travelled did the schoolmaster make show of his instructingtool nay were he to walk abroad with birch girt on thigh as if he therefrom expected honour would there not among the idler class perhaps a certain levity be excited in the third year of this gymnasic period father andreas seems to have died the young scholar otherwise so maltreated saw himself for the first time clad outwardly in sables and inwardly in quite inexpressible melancholy the dark bottomless abyss that lies under our feet had yawned open the pale kingdoms of death with all their innumerable silent nations and generations stood before him the inexorable word never now first showed its meaning my mother wept and her sorrow got vent but in my heart there lay a whole lake of tears pentup in silent desolation nevertheless the unworn spirit is strong life is so healthful that it even finds nourishment in death these stern experiences planted down by memory in my imagination rose there to a whole cypressforest sad but beautiful waving with not unmelodious sighs in dark luxuriance in the hottest sunshine through long years of youth as in manhood also it does and will do for i have now pitched my tent under a cypresstree the tomb is now my inexpugnable fortress ever close by the gate of which i look upon the hostile armaments and pains and penalties of tyrannous life placidly enough and listen to its loudest threatenings with a still smile o ye loved ones that already sleep in the noiseless bed of rest whom in life i could only weep for and never help and ye who widescattered still toil lonely in the monsterbearing desert dyeing the flinty ground with your blood yet a little while and we shall all meet there and our mothers bosom will screen us all and oppressions harness and sorrows firewhip and all the gehenna bailiffs that patrol and inhabit evervexed time cannot thenceforth harm us any more close by which rather beautiful apostrophe lies a laboured character of the deceased andreas futteral of his natural ability his deserts in life as prussian sergeant with long historical inquiries into the genealogy of the futteral family here traced back as far as henry the fowler the whole of which we pass over not without astonishment it only concerns us to add that now was the time when mother gretchen revealed to her fosterson that he was not at all of this kindred or indeed of any kindred having come into historical existence in the way already known to us thus was i doubly orphaned says he bereft not only of possession but even of remembrance sorrow and wonder here suddenly united could not but produce abundant fruit such a disclosure in such a season struck its roots through my whole nature ever till the years of mature manhood it mingled with my whole thoughts was as the stem whereon all my daydreams and nightdreams grew a certain poetic elevation yet also a corresponding civic depression it naturally imparted i was like no other in which fixedidea leading sometimes to highest and oftener to frightfullest results may there not lie the first spring of tendencies which in my life have become remarkable enough as in birth so in action speculation and social position my fellows are perhaps not numerous in the bag sagittarius as we at length discover teufelsdrckh has become a university man though how when or of what quality will nowhere disclose itself with the smallest certainty few things in the way of confusion and capricious indistinctness can now surprise our readers not even the total want of dates almost without parallel in a biographical work so enigmatic so chaotic we have always found and must always look to find these scattered leaves in sagittarius however teufelsdrckh begins to show himself even more than usually sibylline fragments of all sorts scraps of regular memoir collegeexercises programs professional testimoniums milkscores torn billets sometimes to appearance of an amatory cast all blown together as if by merest chance henceforth bewilder the sane historian to combine any picture of these university and the subsequent years much more to decipher therein any illustrative primordial elements of the clothesphilosophy becomes such a problem as the reader may imagine so much we can see darkly as through the foliage of some wavering thicket a youth of no common endowment who has passed happily through childhood less happily yet still vigorously through boyhood now at length perfect in dead vocables and set down as he hopes by the living fountain there to superadd ideas and capabilities from such fountain he draws diligently thirstily yet never or seldom with his whole heart for the water nowise suits his palate discouragements entanglements aberrations are discoverable or supposable nor perhaps are even pecuniary distresses wanting for the good gretchen who in spite of advices from not disinterested relatives has sent him hither must after a time withdraw her willing but too feeble hand nevertheless in an atmosphere of poverty and manifold chagrin the humour of that young soul what character is in him first decisively reveals itself and like strong sunshine in weeping skies gives out variety of colours some of which are prismatic thus with the aid of time and of what time brings has the stripling diogenes teufelsdrckh waxed into manly stature and into so questionable an aspect that we ask with new eagerness how he specially came by it and regret anew that there is no more explicit answer certain of the intelligible and partially significant fragments which are few in number shall be extracted from that limbo of a paperbag and presented with the usual preparation as if in the bag scorpio teufelsdrckh had not already expectorated his antipedagogic spleen as if from the name sagittarius he had thought himself called upon to shoot arrows we here again fallin with such matter as this the university where i was educated still stands vivid enough in my remembrance and i know its name well which name however i from tenderness to existing interests and persons shall in nowise divulge it is my painful duty to say that out of england and spain ours was the worst of all hitherto discovered universities this is indeed a time when right education is as nearly as may be impossible however in degrees of wrongness there is no limit nay i can conceive a worse system than that of the nameless itself as poisoned victual may be worse than absolute hunger it is written when the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch wherefore in such circumstances may it not sometimes be safer if both leader and led simply sit still had you anywhere in crim tartary walledin a square enclosure furnished it with a small illchosen library and then turned loose into it elevenhundred christian striplings to tumble about as they listed from three to seven years certain persons under the title of professors being stationed at the gates to declare aloud that it was a university and exact considerable admissionfees you had not indeed in mechanical structure yet in spirit and result some imperfect resemblance of our high seminary i say imperfect for if our mechanical structure was quite other so neither was our result altogether the same unhappily we were not in crim tartary but in a corrupt european city full of smoke and sin moreover in the middle of a public which without far costlier apparatus than that of the square enclosure and declaration aloud you could not be sure of gulling gullible however by fit apparatus all publics are and gulled with the most surprising profit towards anything like a statistics of imposture indeed little as yet has been done with a strange indifference our economists nigh buried under tables for minor branches of industry have altogether overlooked the grand allovertopping hypocrisy branch as if our whole arts of puffery of quackery priestcraft kingcraft and the innumerable other crafts and mysteries of that genus had not ranked in productive industry at all can any one for example so much as say what moneys in literature and shoeblacking are realised by actual instruction and actual jet polish what by fictitiouspersuasive proclamation of such specifying in distinct items the distributions circulations disbursements incomings of said moneys with the smallest approach to accuracy but to ask how far in all the several infinitelycomplected departments of social business in government education in manual commercial intellectual fabrication of every sort mans want is supplied by true ware how far by the mere appearance of true ware in other words to what extent by what methods with what effects in various times and countries deception takes the place of wages of performance here truly is an inquiry big with results for the future time but to which hitherto only the vaguest answer can be given if for the present in our europe we estimate the ratio of ware to appearance of ware so high even as at one to a hundred which considering the wages of a pope russian autocrat or english gamepreserver is probably not far from the mark what almost prodigious saving may there not be anticipated as the statistics of imposture advances and so the manufacturing of shams that of realities rising into clearer and clearer distinction therefrom gradually declines and at length becomes all but wholly unnecessary this for the coming golden ages what i had to remark for the present brazen one is that in several provinces as in education polity religion where so much is wanted and indispensable and so little can as yet be furnished probably imposture is of sanative anodyne nature and mans gullibility not his worst blessing suppose your sinews of war quite broken i mean your military chest insolvent forage all but exhausted and that the whole army is about to mutiny disband and cut your and each others throat then were it not well could you as if by miracle pay them in any sort of fairymoney feed them on coagulated water or mere imagination of meat whereby till the real supply came up they might be kept together and quiet such perhaps was the aim of nature who does nothing without aim in furnishing her favourite man with this his so omnipotent or rather omnipatient talent of being gulled how beautifully it works with a little mechanism nay almost makes mechanism for itself these professors in the nameless lived with ease with safety by a mere reputation constructed in past times and then too with no great effort by quite another class of persons which reputation like a strong briskgoing undershot wheel sunk into the general current bade fair with only a little annual repainting on their part to hold long together and of its own accord assiduously grind for them happy that it was so for the millers they themselves needed not to work their attempts at working at what they called educating now when i look back on it filled me with a certain mute admiration besides all this we boasted ourselves a rational university in the highest degree hostile to mysticism thus was the young vacant mind furnished with much talk about progress of the species dark ages prejudice and the like so that all were quickly enough blown out into a state of windy argumentativeness whereby the better sort had soon to end in sick impotent scepticism the worser sort explode crepiren in finished selfconceit and to all spiritual intents become dead but this too is portion of mankinds lot if our era is the era of unbelief why murmur under it is there not a better coming nay come as in longdrawn systole and longdrawn diastole must the period of faith alternate with the period of denial must the vernal growth the summer luxuriance of all opinions spiritual representations and creations be followed by and again follow the autumnal decay the winter dissolution for man lives in time has his whole earthly being endeavour and destiny shaped for him by time only in the transitory timesymbol is the evermotionless eternity we stand on made manifest and yet in such winterseasons of denial it is for the noblerminded perhaps a comparative misery to have been born and to be awake and work and for the duller a felicity if like hibernating animals safelodged in some salamanca university or sybaris city or other superstitious or voluptuous castle of indolence they can slumberthrough in stupid dreams and only awaken when the loudroaring hailstorms have all done their work and to our prayers and martyrdoms the new spring has been vouchsafed that in the environment here mysteriously enough shadowed forth teufelsdrckh must have felt ill at ease cannot be doubtful the hungry young he says looked up to their spiritual nurses and for food were bidden eat the eastwind what vain jargon of controversial metaphysic etymology and mechanical manipulation falsely named science was current there i indeed learned better perhaps than the most among elevenhundred christian youths there will not be wanting some eleven eager to learn by collision with such a certain warmth a certain polish was communicated by instinct and happy accident i took less to rioting renommiren than to thinking and reading which latter also i was free to do nay from the chaos of that library i succeeded in fishingup more books perhaps than had been known to the very keepers thereof the foundation of a literary life was hereby laid i learned on my own strength to read fluently in almost all cultivated languages on almost all subjects and sciences farther as man is ever the prime object to man already it was my favourite employment to read character in speculation and from the writing to construe the writer a certain groundplan of human nature and life began to fashion itself in me wondrous enough now when i look back on it for my whole universe physical and spiritual was as yet a machine however such a conscious recognised groundplan the truest i had was beginning to be there and by additional experiments might be corrected and indefinitely extended thus from poverty does the strong educe nobler wealth thus in the destitution of the wild desert does our young ishmael acquire for himself the highest of all possessions that of selfhelp nevertheless a desert this was waste and howling with savage monsters teufelsdrckh gives us long details of his feverparoxysms of doubt his inquiries concerning miracles and the evidences of religious faith and how in the silent nightwatches still darker in his heart than over sky and earth he has cast himself before the allseeing and with audible prayers cried vehemently for light for deliverance from death and the grave not till after long years and unspeakable agonies did the believing heart surrender sink into spellbound sleep under the nightmare unbelief and in this hagridden dream mistake gods fair living world for a pallid vacant hades and extinct pandemonium but through such purgatory pain continues he it is appointed us to pass first must the dead letter of religion own itself dead and drop piecemeal into dust if the living spirit of religion freed from this its charnelhouse is to arise on us newborn of heaven and with new healing under its wings to which purgatory pains seemingly severe enough if we add a liberal measure of earthly distresses want of practical guidance want of sympathy want of money want of hope and all this in the fervid season of youth so exaggerated in imagining so boundless in desires yet here so poor in means do we not see a strong incipient spirit oppressed and overloaded from without and from within the fire of genius strugglingup among fuelwood of the greenest and as yet with more of bitter vapour than of clear flame from various fragments of letters and other documentary scraps it is to be inferred that teufelsdrckh isolated shy retiring as he was had not altogether escaped notice certain established men are aware of his existence and if stretchingout no helpful hand have at least their eyes on him he appears though in dreary enough humour to be addressing himself to the profession of law whereof indeed the world has since seen him a public graduate but omitting these broken unsatisfactory thrums of economical relation let us present rather the following small thread of moral relation and therewith the reader for himself weaving it in at the right place conclude our dim arraspicture of these university years here also it was that i formed acquaintance with herr towgood or as it is perhaps better written herr toughgut a young person of quality von adel from the interior parts of england he stood connected by blood and hospitality with the counts von zhdarm in this quarter of germany to which noble family i likewise was by his means with all friendliness brought near towgood had a fair talent unspeakably illcultivated with considerable humour of character and bating his total ignorance for he knew nothing except boxing and a little grammar showed less of that aristocratic impassivity and silent fury than for most part belongs to travellers of his nation to him i owe my first practical knowledge of the english and their ways perhaps also something of the partiality with which i have ever since regarded that singular people towgood was not without an eye could he have come at any light invited doubtless by the presence of the zhdarm family he had travelled hither in the almost frantic hope of perfecting his studies he whose studies had as yet been those of infancy hither to a university where so much as the notion of perfection not to say the effort after it no longer existed often we would condole over the hard destiny of the young in this era how after all our toil we were to be turnedout into the world with beards on our chins indeed but with few other attributes of manhood no existing thing that we were trained to act on nothing that we could so much as believe how has our head on the outside a polished hat would towgood exclaim and in the inside vacancy or a froth of vocables and attorneylogic at a small cost men are educated to make leather into shoes but at a great cost what am i educated to make by heaven brother what i have already eaten and worn as i came thus far would endow a considerable hospital of incurables man indeed i would answer has a digestive faculty which must be kept working were it even partly by stealth but as for our miseducation make not bad worse waste not the time yet ours in trampling on thistles because they have yielded us no figs frisch zu bruder here are books and we have brains to read them here is a whole earth and a whole heaven and we have eyes to look on them frisch zu often also our talk was gay not without brilliancy and even fire we lookedout on life with its strange scaffolding where all at once harlequins dance and men are beheaded and quartered motley not unterrific was the aspect but we looked on it like brave youths for myself these were perhaps my most genial hours towards this young warmhearted strongheaded and wrongheaded herr towgood i was even near experiencing the now obsolete sentiment of friendship yes foolish heathen that i was i felt that under certain conditions i could have loved this man and taken him to my bosom and been his brother once and always by degrees however i understood the new time and its wants if mans soul is indeed as in the finnish language and utilitarian philosophy a kind of stomach what else is the true meaning of spiritual union but an eating together thus we instead of friends are dinnerguests and here as elsewhere have cast away chimeras so ends abruptly as is usual and enigmatically this little incipient romance what henceforth becomes of the brave herr towgood or toughgut he has divedunder in the autobiographical chaos and swims we see not where does any reader in the interior parts of england know of such a man chapter iv getting under way thus nevertheless writes our autobiographer apparently as quitting college was there realised somewhat namely i diogenes teufelsdrckh a visible temporary figure zeitbild occupying some cubic feet of space and containing within it forces both physical and spiritual hopes passions thoughts the whole wondrous furniture in more or less perfection belonging to that mystery a man capabilities there were in me to give battle in some small degree against the great empire of darkness does not the very ditcher and delver with his spade extinguish many a thistle and puddle and so leave a little order where he found the opposite nay your very daymoth has capabilities in this kind and ever organises something into its own body if no otherwise which was before inorganic and of mute dead air makes living music though only of the faintest by humming how much more one whose capabilities are spiritual who has learned or begun learning the grand thaumaturgic art of thought thaumaturgic i name it for hitherto all miracles have been wrought thereby and henceforth innumerable will be wrought whereof we even in these days witness some of the poets and prophets inspired message and how it makes and unmakes whole worlds i shall forbear mention but cannot the dullest hear steamengines clanking around him has he not seen the scottish brassmiths idea and this but a mechanical one travelling on firewings round the cape and across two oceans and stronger than any other enchanters familiar on all hands unweariedly fetching and carrying at home not only weaving cloth but rapidly enough overturning the whole old system of society and for feudalism and preservation of the game preparing us by indirect but sure methods industrialism and the government of the wisest truly a thinking man is the worst enemy the prince of darkness can have every time such a one announces himself i doubt not there runs a shudder through the nether empire and new emissaries are trained with new tactics to if possible entrap him and hoodwink and handcuff him with such high vocation had i too as denizen of the universe been called unhappy it is however that though born to the amplest sovereignty in this way with no less than sovereign right of peace and war against the timeprince zeitfrst or devil and all his dominions your coronationceremony costs such trouble your sceptre is so difficult to get at or even to get eye on by which last wiredrawn similitude does teufelsdrckh mean no more than that young men find obstacles in what we call getting under way not what i have continues he but what i do is my kingdom to each is given a certain inward talent a certain outward environment of fortune to each by wisest combination of these two a certain maximum of capability but the hardest problem were ever this first to find by study of yourself and of the ground you stand on what your combined inward and outward capability specially is for alas our young soul is all budding with capabilities and we see not yet which is the main and true one always too the new man is in a new time under new conditions his course can be the facsimile of no prior one but is by its nature original and then how seldom will the outward capability fit the inward though talented wonderfully enough we are poor unfriended dyspeptical bashful nay what is worse than all we are foolish thus in a whole imbroglio of capabilities we go stupidly groping about to grope which is ours and often clutch the wrong one in this mad work must several years of our small term be spent till the purblind youth by practice acquire notions of distance and become a seeing man nay many so spend their whole term and in evernew expectation evernew disappointment shift from enterprise to enterprise and from side to side till at length as exasperated striplings of threescoreandten they shift into their last enterprise that of getting buried such since the most of us are too ophthalmic would be the general fate were it not that one thing saves us our hunger for on this ground as the prompt nature of hunger is well known must a prompt choice be made hence have we with wise foresight indentures and apprenticeships for our irrational young whereby in due season the vague universality of a man shall find himself readymoulded into a specific craftsman and so thenceforth work with much or with little waste of capability as it may be yet not with the worst waste that of time nay even in matters spiritual since the spiritual artist too is born blind and does not like certain other creatures receive sight in nine days but far later sometimes never is it not well that there should be what we call professions or breadstudies brodzwecke preappointed us here circling like the ginhorse for whom partial or total blindness is no evil the breadartist can travel contentedly round and round still fancying that it is forward and forward and realise much for himself victual for the world an additional horses power in the grand cornmill or hempmill of economic society for me too had such a leadingstring been provided only that it proved a neckhalter and had nigh throttled me till i broke it off then in the words of ancient pistol did the world generally become mine oyster which i by strength or cunning was to open as i would and could almost had i deceased fast wr ich umgekommen so obstinately did it continue shut we see here significantly foreshadowed the spirit of much that was to befall our autobiographer the historical embodiment of which as it painfully takes shape in his life lies scattered in dim disastrous details through this bag pisces and those that follow a young man of high talent and high though still temper like a young mettled colt breaksoff his neckhalter and bounds forth from his peculiar manger into the wide world which alas he finds all rigorously fencedin richest cloverfields tempt his eye but to him they are forbidden pasture either pining in progressive starvation he must stand or in mad exasperation must rush to and fro leaping against sheer stonewalls which he cannot leap over which only lacerate and lame him till at last after thousand attempts and endurances he as if by miracle clears his way not indeed into luxuriant and luxurious clover yet into a certain bosky wilderness where existence is still possible and freedom though waited on by scarcity is not without sweetness in a word teufelsdrckh having thrownup his legal profession finds himself without landmark of outward guidance whereby his previous want of decided belief or inward guidance is frightfully aggravated necessity urges him on time will not stop neither can he a son of time wild passions without solacement wild faculties without employment ever vex and agitate him he too must enact that stern monodrama no object and no rest must front its successive destinies work through to its catastrophe and deduce therefrom what moral he can yet let us be just to him let us admit that his neckhalter sat nowise easy on him that he was in some degree forced to break it off if we look at the young mans civic position in this nameless capital as he emerges from its nameless university we can discern well that it was far from enviable his first lawexamination he has come through triumphantly and can even boast that the examen rigorosum need not have frightened him but though he is hereby an auscultator of respectability what avails it there is next to no employment to be had neither for a youth without connexions is the process of expectation very hopeful in itself nor for one of his disposition much cheered from without my fellow auscultators he says were auscultators they dressed and digested and talked articulate words other vitality showed they almost none small speculation in those eyes that they did glare withal sense neither for the high nor for the deep nor for aught human or divine save only for the faintest scent of coming preferment in which words indicating a total estrangement on the part of teufelsdrckh may there not also lurk traces of a bitterness as from wounded vanity doubtless these prosaic auscultators may have sniffed at him with his strange ways and tried to hate and what was much more impossible to despise him friendly communion in any case there could not be already has the young teufelsdrckh left the other young geese and swims apart though as yet uncertain whether he himself is cygnet or gosling perhaps too what little employment he had was performed ill at best unpleasantly great practical method and expertness he may brag of but is there not also great practical pride though deephidden only the deeperseated so shy a man can never have been popular we figure to ourselves how in those days he may have played strange freaks with his independence and so forth do not his own words betoken as much like a very young person i imagined it was with work alone and not also with folly and sin in myself and others that i had been appointed to struggle be this as it may his progress from the passive auscultatorship towards any active assessorship is evidently of the slowest by degrees those same established men once partially inclined to patronise him seem to withdraw their countenance and give him up as a man of genius against which procedure he in these papers loudly protests as if says he the higher did not presuppose the lower as if he who can fly into heaven could not also walk post if he resolved on it but the world is an old woman and mistakes any gilt farthing for a gold coin whereby being often cheated she will thenceforth trust nothing but the common copper how our winged skymessenger unaccepted as a terrestrial runner contrived in the mean while to keep himself from flying skyward without return is not too clear from these documents good old gretchen seems to have vanished from the scene perhaps from the earth other horn of plenty or even of parsimony nowhere flows for him so that the prompt nature of hunger being well known we are not without our anxiety from private tuition in never so many languages and sciences the aid derivable is small neither to use his own words does the young adventurer hitherto suspect in himself any literary gift but at best earns breadandwater wages by his wide faculty of translation nevertheless continues he that i subsisted is clear for you find me even now alive which fact however except upon the principle of our truehearted kind old proverb that there is always life for a living one we must profess ourselves unable to explain certain landlords bills and other economic documents bearing the mark of settlement indicate that he was not without money but like an independent hearthholder if not householder paid his way here also occur among many others two little mutilated notes which perhaps throw light on his condition the first has now no date or writers name but a huge blot and runs to this effect the inkblot tieddown by previous promise cannot except by best wishes forward the herr teufelsdrckhs views on the assessorship in question and sees himself under the cruel necessity of forbearing for the present what were otherwise his duty and joy to assist in opening the career for a man of genius on whom far higher triumphs are yet waiting the other is on gilt paper and interests us like a sort of epistolary mummy now dead yet which once lived and beneficently worked we give it in the original herr teufelsdrckh wird von der frau grfinn auf donnerstag zum sthetischen thee schnstens eingeladen thus in answer to a cry for solid pudding whereof there is the most urgent need comes epigrammatically enough the invitation to a wash of quite fluid sthetic tea how teufelsdrckh now at actual handgrips with destiny herself may have comported himself among these musical and literary dilettanti of both sexes like a hungry lion invited to a feast of chickenweed we can only conjecture perhaps in expressive silence and abstinence otherwise if the lion in such case is to feast at all it cannot be on the chickenweed but only on the chickens for the rest as this frau grfinn dates from the zhdarm house she can be no other than the countess and mistress of the same whose intellectual tendencies and goodwill to teufelsdrckh whether on the footing of herr towgood or on his own footing are hereby manifest that some sort of relation indeed continued for a time to connect our autobiographer though perhaps feebly enough with this noble house we have elsewhere express evidence doubtless if he expected patronage it was in vain enough for him if he here obtained occasional glimpses of the great world from which we at one time fancied him to have been always excluded the zhdarms says he lived in the soft sumptuous garniture of aristocracy whereto literature and art attracted and attached from without were to serve as the handsomest fringing it was to the gndigen frau her ladyship that this latter improvement was due assiduously she gathered dextrously she fittedon what fringing was to be had lace or cobweb as the place yielded was teufelsdrckh also a fringe of lace or cobweb or promising to be such with his excellenz the count continues he i have more than once had the honour to converse chiefly on general affairs and the aspect of the world which he though now past middle life viewed in no unfavourable light finding indeed except the outrooting of journalism die auszurottende journalistik little to desiderate therein on some points as his excellenz was not uncholeric i found it more pleasant to keep silence besides his occupation being that of owning land there might be faculties enough which as superfluous for such use were little developed in him that to teufelsdrckh the aspect of the world was nowise so faultless and many things besides the outrooting of journalism might have seemed improvements we can readily conjecture with nothing but a barren auscultatorship from without and so many mutinous thoughts and wishes from within his position was no easy one the universe he says was as a mighty sphinxriddle which i knew so little of yet must rede or be devoured in red streaks of unspeakable grandeur yet also in the blackness of darkness was life to my toounfurnished thought unfolding itself a strange contradiction lay in me and i as yet knew not the solution of it knew not that spiritual music can spring only from discords set in harmony that but for evil there were no good as victory is only possible by battle i have heard affirmed surely in jest observes he elsewhere by not unphilanthropic persons that it were a real increase of human happiness could all young men from the age of nineteen be covered under barrels or rendered otherwise invisible and there left to follow their lawful studies and callings till they emerged sadder and wiser at the age of twentyfive with which suggestion at least as considered in the light of a practical scheme i need scarcely say that i nowise coincide nevertheless it is plausibly urged that as young ladies mdchen are to mankind precisely the most delightful in those years so young gentlemen bbchen do then attain their maximum of detestability such gawks gecken are they and foolish peacocks and yet with such a vulturous hunger for selfindulgence so obstinate obstreperous vainglorious in all senses so froward and so forward no mortals endeavour or attainment will in the smallest content the as yet unendeavouring unattaining young gentleman but he could make it all infinitely better were it worthy of him life everywhere is the most manageable matter simple as a

has not yet foundout by any trial that do what one will there is ever a cursed fraction oftenest a decimal repeater and no net integer quotient so much as to be thought of in which passage does not there lie an implied confession that teufelsdrckh himself besides his outward obstructions had an inward still greater to contend with namely a certain temporary youthful yet still afflictive derangement of head alas on the former side alone his case was hard enough it continues ever true says he that saturn or chronos or what we call time devours all his children only by incessant running by incessant working may you for some threescoreandten years escape him and you too he devours at last can any sovereign or holy alliance of sovereigns bid time stand still even in thought shake themselves free of time our whole terrestrial being is based on time and built of time it is wholly a movement a timeimpulse time is the author of it the material of it hence also our whole duty which is to move to work in the right direction are not our bodies and our souls in continual movement whether we will or not in a continual waste requiring a continual repair utmost satisfaction of our whole outward and inward wants were but satisfaction for a space of time thus whatso we have done is done and for us annihilated and ever must we go and do anew o timespirit how hast thou environed and imprisoned us and sunk us so deep in thy troublous dim timeelement that only in lucid moments can so much as glimpses of our upper azure home be revealed to us me however as a son of time unhappier than some others was time threatening to eat quite prematurely for strive as i might there was no good running so obstructed was the path so gyved were the feet that is to say we presume speaking in the dialect of this lower world that teufelsdrckhs whole duty and necessity was like other mens to work in the right direction and that no work was to be had whereby he became wretched enough as was natural with haggard scarcity threatening him in the distance and so vehement a soul languishing in restless inaction and forced thereby like sir hudibrass sword by rust to eat into itself for lack of something else to hew and hack but on the whole that same excellent passivity as it has all along done is here again vigorously flourishing in which circumstance may we not trace the beginnings of much that now characterises our professor and perhaps in faint rudiments the origin of the clothesphilosophy itself already the attitude he has assumed towards the world is too defensive not as would have been desirable a bold attitude of attack so far hitherto he says as i had mingled with mankind i was notable if for anything for a certain stillness of manner which as my friends often rebukingly declared did but ill express the keen ardour of my feelings i in truth regarded men with an excess both of love and of fear the mystery of a person indeed is ever divine to him that has a sense for the godlike often notwithstanding was i blamed and by halfstrangers hated for my socalled hardness hrte my indifferentism towards men and the seemingly ironic tone i had adopted as my favourite dialect in conversation alas the panoply of sarcasm was but as a buckram case wherein i had striven to envelop myself that so my own poor person might live safe there and in all friendliness being no longer exasperated by wounds sarcasm i now see to be in general the language of the devil for which reason i have long since as good as renounced it but how many individuals did i in those days provoke into some degree of hostility thereby an ironic man with his sly stillness and ambuscading ways more especially an ironic young man from whom it is least expected may be viewed as a pest to society have we not seen persons of weight and name coming forward with gentlest indifference to tread such a one out of sight as an insignificancy and worm start ceilinghigh balkenhoch and thence fall shattered and supine to be borne home on shutters not without indignation when he proved electric and a torpedo alas how can a man with this devilishness of temper make way for himself in life where the first problem as teufelsdrckh too admits is to unite yourself with some one and with somewhat sich anzuschliessen division not union is written on most part of his procedure let us add too that in no great length of time the only important connexion he had ever succeeded in forming his connexion with the zhdarm family seems to have been paralysed for all practical uses by the death of the not uncholeric old count this fact stands recorded quite incidentally in a certain discourse on epitaphs huddled into the present bag among so much else of which essay the learning and curious penetration are more to be approved of than the spirit his grand principle is that lapidary inscriptions of what sort soever should be historical rather than lyrical by request of that worthy noblemans survivors says he i undertook to compose his epitaph and not unmindful of my own rules produced the following which however for an alleged defect of latinity a defect never yet fully visible to myself still remains unengraven wherein we may predict there is more than the latinity that will surprise an english reader hic jacet philippus zaehdarm cognomine magnus zaehdarmi comes ex imperii concilio velleris aurei periscelidis necnon vulturis nigri eques qui dum sub luna agebat quinquies mille perdices plumbo confecit varii cibi centumpondia millies centena

dejecit sub dato postremum sub dato chapter v romance for long years writes teufelsdrckh had the poor hebrew in this egypt of an auscultatorship painfully toiled baking bricks without stubble before ever the question once struck him with entire force for what beym himmel for food and warmth and are food and warmth nowhere else in the whole wide universe discoverable come of it what might i resolved to try thus then are we to see him in a new independent capacity though perhaps far from an improved one teufelsdrckh is now a man without profession quitting the common fleet of herringbusses and whalers where indeed his leeward laggard condition was painful enough he desperately steersoff on a course of his own by sextant and compass of his own unhappy teufelsdrckh though neither fleet nor traffic nor commodores pleased thee still was it not a fleet sailing in prescribed track for fixed objects above all in combination wherein by mutual guidance by all manner of loans and borrowings each could manifoldly aid the other how wilt thou sail in unknown seas and for thyself find that shorter northwest passage to thy fair spicecountry of a nowhere a solitary rover on such a voyage with such nautical tactics will meet with adventures nay as we forthwith discover a certain calypsoisland detains him at the very outset and as it were falsifies and oversets his whole reckoning if in youth writes he once the universe is majestically unveiling and everywhere heaven revealing itself on earth nowhere to the young man does this heaven on earth so immediately reveal itself as in the young maiden strangely enough in this strange life of ours it has been so appointed on the whole as i have often said a person persnlichkeit is ever holy to us a certain orthodox anthropomorphism connects my me with all thees in bonds of love but it is in this approximation of the like and unlike that such heavenly attraction as between negative and positive first burnsout into a flame is the pitifullest mortal person think you indifferent to us is it not rather our heartfelt wish to be made one with him to unite him to us by gratitude by admiration even by fear or failing all these unite ourselves to him but how much more in this case of the likeunlike here is conceded us the higher mystic possibility of such a union the highest in our earth thus in the conducting medium of fantasy flamesforth that firedevelopment of the universal spiritual electricity which as unfolded between man and woman we first emphatically denominate love in every wellconditioned stripling as i conjecture there already blooms a certain prospective paradise cheered by some fairest eve nor in the stately vistas and flowerage and foliage of that garden is a tree of knowledge beautiful and awful in the midst thereof wanting perhaps too the whole is but the lovelier if cherubim and a flaming sword divide it from all footsteps of men and grant him the imaginative stripling only the view not the entrance happy season of virtuous youth when shame is still an impassable celestial barrier and the sacred aircities of hope have not shrunk into the mean clayhamlets of reality and man by his nature is yet infinite and free as for our young forlorn continues teufelsdrckh evidently meaning himself in his secluded way of life and with his glowing fantasy the more fiery that it burnt under cover as in a reverberating furnace his feeling towards the queens of this earth was and indeed is altogether unspeakable a visible divinity dwelt in them to our young friend all women were holy were heavenly as yet he but saw them flitting past in their manycoloured angelplumage or hovering mute and inaccessible on the outskirts of sthetic tea all of air they were all soul and form so lovely like mysterious priestesses in whose hand was the invisible jacobsladder whereby man might mount into very heaven that he our poor friend should ever win for himself one of these gracefuls holden ach gott how could he hope it should he not have died under it there was a certain delirious vertigo in the thought thus was the young man if allsceptical of demons and angels such as the vulgar had once believed in nevertheless not unvisited by hosts of true skyborn who visibly and audibly hovered round him whereso he went and they had that religious worship in his thought though as yet it was by their mere earthly and trivial name that he named them but now if on a soul so circumstanced some actual airmaiden incorporated into tangibility and reality should cast any electric glance of kind eyes saying thereby thou too mayest love and be loved and so kindle him good heaven what a volcanic earthquakebringing allconsuming fire were probably kindled such a fire it afterwards appears did actually burstforth with explosions more or less vesuvian in the inner man of herr diogenes as indeed how could it fail a nature which in his own figurative style we might say had now not a little carbonised tinder of irritability with so much nitre of latent passion and sulphurous humour enough the whole lying in such hot neighbourhood close by a reverberating furnace of fantasy have we not here the components of driest gunpowder ready on occasion of the smallest spark to blazeup neither in this our lifeelement are sparks anywhere wanting without doubt some angel whereof so many hovered round would one day leaving the outskirts of sthetic tea flit nigher and by electric promethean glance kindle no despicable firework happy if it indeed proved a firework and flamedoff rocketwise in successive beautiful bursts of splendour each growing naturally from the other through the several stages of a happy youthful love till the whole were safely burntout and the young soul relieved with little damage happy if it did not rather prove a conflagration and mad explosion painfully lacerating the heart itself nay perhaps bursting the heart in pieces which were death or at best bursting the thin walls of your reverberating furnace so that it rage thenceforth all unchecked among the contiguous combustibles which were madness till of the so fair and manifold internal world of our diogenes there remained nothing or only the crater of an extinct volcano from multifarious documents in this bag capricornus and in the adjacent ones on both sides thereof it becomes manifest that our philosopher as stoical and cynical as he now looks was heartily and even frantically in love here therefore may our old doubts whether his heart were of stone or of flesh give way he loved once not wisely but too well and once only for as your congreve needs a new case or wrappage for every new rocket so each human heart can properly exhibit but one love if even one the first love which is infinite can be followed by no second like unto it in more recent years accordingly the editor of these sheets was led to regard teufelsdrckh as a man not only who would never wed but who would never even flirt whom the grandclimacteric itself and st martins summer of incipient dotage would crown with no new myrtlegarland to the professor women are henceforth pieces of art of celestial art indeed which celestial pieces he glories to survey in galleries but has lost thought of purchasing psychological readers are not without curiosity to see how teufelsdrckh in this for him unexampled predicament demeans himself with what specialties of successive configuration splendour and colour his firework blazesoff small as usual is the satisfaction that such can meet with here from amid these confused masses of eulogy and elegy with their mad petrarchan and werterean ware lying madly scattered among all sorts of quite extraneous matter not so much as the fair ones name can be deciphered for without doubt the title blumine whereby she is here designated and which means simply goddess of flowers must be fictitious was her real name flora then but what was her surname or had she none of what station in life was she of what parentage fortune aspect specially by what preestablished harmony of occurrences did the lover and the loved meet one another in so wide a world how did they behave in such meeting to all which questions not unessential in a biographic work mere conjecture must for most part return answer it was appointed says our philosopher that the high celestial orbit of blumine should intersect the low sublunary one of our forlorn that he looking in her empyrean eyes should fancy the upper sphere of light was come down into this nether sphere of shadows and finding himself mistaken make noise enough we seem to gather that she was young hazeleyed beautiful and some ones cousin highborn and of high spirit but unhappily dependent and insolvent living perhaps on the nottoogracious bounty of monied relatives but how came the wanderer into her circle was it by the humid vehicle of sthetic tea or by the arid one of mere business was it on the hand of herr towgood or of the gndige frau who as ornamental artist might sometimes like to promote flirtation especially for young cynical nondescripts to all appearance it was chiefly by accident and the grace of nature thou fair waldschloss writes our autobiographer what stranger ever saw thee were it even an absolved auscultator officially bearing in his pocket the last relatio ex actis he would ever write but must have paused to wonder noble mansion there stoodest thou in deep mountain amphitheatre on umbrageous lawns in thy serene solitude stately massive all of granite glittering in the western sunbeams like a palace of el dorado overlaid with precious metal beautiful rose up in wavy curvature the slope of thy guardian hills of the greenest was their sward embossed with its darkbrown frets of crag or spotted by some spreading solitary tree and its shadow to the unconscious wayfarer thou wert also as an ammons temple in the libyan waste where for joy and woe the tablet of his destiny lay written well might he pause and gaze in that glance of his were prophecy and nameless forebodings but now let us conjecture that the so presentient auscultator has handedin his relatio ex actis been invited to a glass of rhinewine and so instead of returning dispirited and athirst to his dusty townhome is ushered into the gardenhouse where sit the choicest party of dames and cavaliers if not engaged in sthetic tea yet in trustful evening conversation and perhaps musical coffee for we hear of harps and pure voices making the stillness live scarcely it would seem is the gardenhouse inferior in respectability to the noble mansion itself embowered amid rich foliage roseclusters and the hues and odours of thousand flowers here sat that brave company in front from the wideopened doors fair outlook over blossom and bush over grove and velvet green stretching undulating onwards to the remote mountain peaks so bright so mild and everywhere the melody of birds and happy creatures it was all as if man had stolen a shelter from the sun in the bosomvesture of summer herself how came it that the wanderer advanced thither with such forecasting heart ahndungsvoll by the side of his gay host did he feel that to these soft influences his hard bosom ought to be shut that here once more fate had it in view to try him to mock him and see whether there were humour in him next moment he finds himself presented to the party and especially by name to blumine peculiar among all dames and damosels glanced blumine there in her modesty like a star among earthly lights noblest maiden whom he bent to in body and in soul yet scarcely dared look at for the presence filled him with painful yet sweetest embarrassment blumines was a name well known to him far and wide was the fair one heard of for her gifts her graces her caprices from all which vague colourings of rumour from the censures no less than from the praises had our friend painted for himself a certain imperious queen of hearts and blooming warm earthangel much more enchanting than your mere white heavenangels of women in whose placid veins circulates too little naphthafire herself also he had seen in public places that light yet so stately form those dark tresses shading a face where smiles and sunlight played over earnest deeps but all this he had seen only as a magic vision for him inaccessible almost without reality her sphere was too far from his how should she ever think of him o heaven how should they so much as once meet together and now that rosegoddess sits in the same circle with him the light of her eyes has smiled on him if he speak she will hear it nay who knows since the heavenly sun looks into lowest valleys but blumine herself might have aforetime noted the so unnotable perhaps from his very gainsayers as he had from hers gathered wonder gathered favour for him was the attraction the agitation mutual then pole and pole trembling towards contact when once brought into neighbourhood say rather heart swelling in presence of the queen of hearts like the sea swelling when once near its moon with the wanderer it was even so as in heavenward gravitation suddenly as at the touch of a seraphs wand his whole soul is roused from its deepest recesses and all that was painful and that was blissful there dim images vague feelings of a whole past and a whole future are heaving in unquiet eddies within him often in far less agitating scenes had our still friend shrunk forcibly together and shroudedup his tremors and flutterings of what sort soever in a safe cover of silence and perhaps of seeming stolidity how was it then that here when trembling to the core of his heart he did not sink into swoons but rose into strength into fearlessness and clearness it was his guiding genius dmon that inspired him he must go forth and meet his destiny show thyself now whispered it or be forever hid thus sometimes it is even when your anxiety becomes transcendental that the soul first feels herself able to transcend it that she rises above it in fiery victory and borne on newfound wings of victory moves so calmly even because so rapidly so irresistibly always must the wanderer remember with a certain satisfaction and surprise how in this case he sat not silent but struck adroitly into the stream of conversation which thenceforth to speak with an apparent not a real vanity he may say that he continued to lead surely in those hours a certain inspiration was imparted him such inspiration as is still possible in our late era the selfsecluded unfolds himself in noble thoughts in free glowing words his soul is as one sea of light the peculiar home of truth and intellect wherein also fantasy bodiesforth form after form radiant with all prismatic hues it appears in this otherwise so happy meeting there talked one philistine who even now to the general weariness was dominantly pouringforth philistinism philistriositten little witting what hero was here entering to demolish him we omit the series of socratic or rather diogenic utterances not unhappy in their way whereby the monster persuaded into silence seems soon after to have withdrawn for the night of which dialectic marauder writes our hero the discomfiture was visibly felt as a benefit by most but what were all applauses to the glad smile threatening every moment to become a laugh wherewith blumine herself repaid the victor he ventured to address her she answered with attention nay what if there were a slight tremor in that silver voice what if the red glow of evening were hiding a transient blush the conversation took a higher tone one fine thought called forth another it was one of those rare seasons when the soul expands with full freedom and man feels himself brought near to man gaily in light graceful abandonment the friendly talk played round that circle for the burden was rolled from every heart the barriers of ceremony which are indeed the laws of polite living had melted as into vapour and the poor claims of me and thee no longer parted by rigid fences now flowed softly into one another and life lay all harmonious manytinted like some fair royal champaign the sovereign and owner of which were love only such music springs from kind hearts in a kind environment of place and time and yet as the light grew more arial on the mountaintops and the shadows fell longer over the valley some faint tone of sadness may have breathed through the heart and in whispers more or less audible reminded every one that as this bright day was drawing towards its close so likewise must the day of mans existence decline into dust and darkness and with all its sick toilings and joyful and mournful noises sink in the still eternity to our friend the hours seemed moments holy was he and happy the words from those sweetest lips came over him like dew on thirsty grass all better feelings in his soul seemed to whisper it is good for us to be here at parting the blumines hand was in his in the balmy twilight with the kind stars above them he spoke something of meeting again which was not contradicted he pressed gently those small soft fingers and it seemed as if they were not hastily not angrily withdrawn poor teufelsdrckh it is clear to demonstration thou art smit the queen of hearts would see a man of genius also sigh for her and there by artmagic in that preternatural hour has she bound and spellbound thee love is not altogether a delirium says he elsewhere yet has it many points in common therewith i call it rather a discerning of the infinite in the finite of the idea made real which discerning again may be either true or false either seraphic or demoniac inspiration or insanity but in the former case too as in common madness it is fantasy that superadds itself to sight on the so petty domain of the actual plants its archimedeslever whereby to move at will the infinite spiritual fantasy i might call the true heavengate and hellgate of man his sensuous life is but the small temporary stage zeitbhne whereon thickstreaming influences from both these far yet near regions meet visibly and act tragedy and melodrama sense can support herself handsomely in most countries for some eighteenpence a day but for fantasy planets and solarsystems will not suffice witness your pyrrhus conquering the world yet drinking no better red wine than he had before alas witness also your diogenes flameclad scaling the upper heaven and verging towards insanity for prize of a highsouled brunette as if the earth held but one and not several of these he says that in town they met again day after day like his hearts sun the blooming blumine shone on him ah a little while ago and he was yet in all darkness him what graceful holde would ever love disbelieving all things the poor youth had never learned to believe in himself withdrawn in proud timidity within his own fastnesses solitary from men yet baited by nightspectres enough he saw himself with a sad indignation constrained to renounce the fairest hopes of existence and now o now she looks on thee cried he she the fairest noblest do not her dark eyes tell thee thou art not despised the heavensmessenger all heavens blessings be hers thus did soft melodies flow through his heart tones of an infinite gratitude sweetest intimations that he also was a man that for him also unutterable joys had been provided in free speech earnest or gay amid lambent glances laughter tears and often with the inarticulate mystic speech of music such was the element they now lived in in such a manytinted radiant aurora and by this fairest of orient lightbringers must our friend be blandished and the new apocalypse of nature unrolled to him fairest blumine and even as a star all fire and humid softness a very lightray incarnate was there so much as a fault a caprice he could have dispensed with was she not to him in very deed a morningstar did not her presence bring with it airs from heaven as from olian harps in the breath of dawn as from the memnons statue struck by the rosy finger of aurora unearthly music was around him and lapped him into untried balmy rest pale doubt fled away to the distance life bloomedup with happiness and hope the past then was all a haggard dream he had been in the garden of eden then and could not discern it but lo now the black walls of his prison melt away the captive is alive is free if he loved his disenchantress ach gott his whole heart and soul and life were hers but never had he named it love existence was all a feeling not yet shaped into a thought nevertheless into a thought nay into an action it must be shaped for neither disenchanter nor disenchantress mere children of time can abide by feeling alone the professor knows not to this day how in her soft fervid bosom the lovely found determination even on hest of necessity to cutasunder these so blissful bonds he even appears surprised at the duenna cousin whoever she may have been in whose meagre hungerbitten philosophy the religion of young hearts was from the first faintly approved of we even at such distance can explain it without necromancy let the philosopher answer this one question what figure at that period was a mrs teufelsdrckh likely to make in polished society could she have driven so much as a brassbound gig or even a simple ironspring one thou foolish absolved auscultator before whom lies no prospect of capital will any yet known religion of young hearts keep the human kitchen warm pshaw thy divine blumine when she resigned herself to wed some richer shows more philosophy though but a woman of genius than thou a pretended man our readers have witnessed the origin of this lovemania and with what royal splendour it waxes and rises let no one ask us to unfold the glories of its dominant state much less the horrors of its almost instantaneous dissolution how from such inorganic masses henceforth madder than ever as lie in these bags can even fragments of a living delineation be organised besides of what profit were it we view with a lively pleasure the gay silk montgolfier start from the ground and shoot upwards cleaving the liquid deeps till it dwindle to a luminous star but what is there to look longer on when once by natural elasticity or accident of fire it has exploded a hapless airnavigator plunging amid torn parachutes sandbags and confused wreck fast enough into the jaws of the devil suffice it to know that teufelsdrckh rose into the highest regions of the empyrean by a natural parabolic track and returned thence in a quick perpendicular one for the rest let any feeling reader who has been unhappy enough to do the like paint it out for himself considering only that if he for his perhaps comparatively insignificant mistress underwent such agonies and frenzies what must teufelsdrckhs have been with a fireheart and for a nonpareil blumine we glance merely at the final scene one morning he found his morningstar all dimmed and duskyred the fair creature was silent absent she seemed to have been weeping alas no longer a morningstar but a troublous skyey portent announcing that the doomsday had dawned she said in a tremulous voice they were to meet no more the thunderstruck airsailor is not wanting to himself in this dread hour but what avails it we omit the passionate expostulations entreaties indignations since all was vain and not even an explanation was conceded him and hasten to the catastrophe farewell then madam said he not without sternness for his stung pride helped him she put her hand in his she looked in his face tears started to her eyes in wild audacity he clasped her to his bosom their lips were joined their two souls like two dewdrops rushed into one for the first time and for the last thus was teufelsdrckh made immortal by a kiss and then why then thick curtains of night rushed over his soul as rose the immeasurable crash of doom and through the ruins as of a shivered universe was he falling falling towards the abyss chapter vi sorrows of teufelsdrckh we have long felt that with a man like our professor matters must often be expected to take a course of their own that in so multiplex intricate a nature there might be channels both for admitting and emitting such as the psychologist had seldom noted in short that on no grand occasion and convulsion neither in the joystorm nor in the woestorm could you predict his demeanour to our less philosophical readers for example it is now clear that the so passionate teufelsdrckh precipitated through a shivered universe in this extraordinary way has only one of three things which he can next do establish himself in bedlam begin writing satanic poetry or blowout his brains in the progress towards any of which consummations do not such readers anticipate extravagance enough breastbeating browbeating against walls lionbellowings of blasphemy and the like stampings smitings breakages of furniture if not arson itself nowise so does teufelsdrckh deport him he quietly lifts his pilgerstab pilgrimstaff old business being soon woundup and begins a perambulation and circumambulation of the terraqueous globe curious it is indeed how with such vivacity of conception such intensity of feeling above all with these unconscionable habits of exaggeration in speech he combines that wonderful stillness of his that stoicism in external procedure thus if his sudden bereavement in this matter of the flowergoddess is talked of as a real doomsday and dissolution of nature in which light doubtless it partly appeared to himself his own nature is nowise dissolved thereby but rather is compressed closer for once as we might say a blumine by magic appliances has unlocked that shut heart of his and its hidden things rushout tumultuous boundless like genii enfranchised from their glass phial but no sooner are your magic appliances withdrawn than the strange casket of a heart springsto again and perhaps there is now no key extant that will open it for a teufelsdrckh as we remarked will not love a second time singular diogenes no sooner has that heartrending occurrence fairly taken place than he affects to regard it as a thing natural of which there is nothing more to be said one highest hope seemingly legible in the eyes of an angel had recalled him as out of deathshadows into celestial life but a gleam of tophet passedover the face of his angel he was rapt away in whirlwinds and heard the laughter of demons it was a calenture adds he whereby the youth saw green paradisegroves in the waste oceanwaters a lying vision yet not wholly a lie for he saw it but what things soever passed in him when he ceased to see it what ragings and despairings soever teufelsdrckhs soul was the scene of he has the goodness to conceal under a quite opaque cover of silence we know it well the first mad paroxysm past our brave gneschen collected his dismembered philosophies and buttoned himself together he was meek silent or spoke of the weather and the journals only by a transient knitting of those shaggy brows by some deep flash of those eyes glancing one knew not whether with teardew or with fierce fire might you have guessed what a gehenna was within that a whole satanic school were spouting though inaudibly there to consume your own choler as some chimneys consume their own smoke to keep a whole satanic school spouting if it must spout inaudibly is a negative yet no slight virtue nor one of the commonest in these times nevertheless we will not take upon us to say that in the strange measure he fell upon there was not a touch of latent insanity whereof indeed the actual condition of these documents in capricornus and aquarius is no bad emblem his so unlimited wanderings toilsome enough are without assigned or perhaps assignable aim internal unrest seems his sole guidance he wanders wanders as if that curse of the prophet had fallen on him and he were made like unto a wheel doubtless too the chaotic nature of these paperbags aggravates our obscurity quite without note of preparation for example we come upon the following slip a peculiar feeling it is that will rise in the traveller when turning some hillrange in his desert road he descries lying far below embosomed among its groves and green natural bulwarks and all diminished to a toybox the fair town where so many souls as it were seen and yet unseen are driving their multifarious traffic its white steeple is then truly a starwardpointing finger the canopy of blue smoke seems like a sort of lifebreath for always of its own unity the soul gives unity to whatsoever it looks on with love thus does the little dwelling place of men in itself a congeries of houses and huts become for us an individual almost a person but what thousand other thoughts unite thereto if the place has to ourselves been the arena of joyous or mournful experiences if perhaps the cradle we were rocked in still stands there if our loving ones still dwell there if our buried ones there slumber does teufelsdrckh as the wounded eagle is said to make for its own eyrie and indeed military deserters and all hunted outcast creatures turn as if by instinct in the direction of their birthland fly first in this extremity towards his native entepfuhl but reflecting that there no help awaits him take but one wistful look from the distance and then wend elsewhither little happier seems to be his next flight into the wilds of nature as if in her motherbosom he would seek healing so at least we incline to interpret the following notice separated from the former by some considerable space wherein however is nothing noteworthy mountains were not new to him but rarely are mountains seen in such combined majesty and grace as here the rocks are of that sort called primitive by the mineralogists which always arrange themselves in masses of a rugged gigantic character which ruggedness however is here tempered by a singular airiness of form and softness of environment in a climate favourable to vegetation the gray cliff itself covered with lichens shootsup through a garment of foliage or verdure and white bright cottages treeshaded cluster round the everlasting granite in fine vicissitude beauty alternates with grandeur you ride through stony hollows along straight passes traversed by torrents overhung by high walls of rock now winding amid broken shaggy chasms and huge fragments now suddenly emerging into some emerald valley where the streamlet collects itself into a lake and man has again found a fair dwelling and it seems as if peace had established herself in the bosom of strength to peace however in this vortex of existence can the son of time not pretend still less if some spectre haunt him from the past and the future is wholly a stygian darkness spectrebearing reasonably might the wanderer exclaim to himself are not the gates of this worlds happiness inexorably shut against thee hast thou a hope that is not mad nevertheless one may still murmur audibly or in the original greek if that suit better whoso can look on death will start at no shadows from such meditations is the wanderers attention called outwards for now the valley closesin abruptly intersected by a huge mountain mass the stony waterworn ascent of which is not to be accomplished on horseback arrived aloft he finds himself again lifted into the evening sunset light and cannot but pause and gaze round him some moments there an upland irregular expanse of wold where valleys in complex branchings are suddenly or slowly arranging their descent towards every quarter of the sky the mountainranges are beneath your feet and folded together only the loftier summits look down here and there as on a second plain lakes also lie clear and earnest in their solitude no trace of man now visible unless indeed it were he who fashioned that little visible link of highway here as would seem scaling the inaccessible to unite province with province but sunwards lo you how it towers sheer up a world of mountains the diadem and centre of the mountain region a hundred and a hundred savage peaks in the last light of day all glowing of gold and amethyst like giant spirits of the wilderness there in their silence in their solitude even as on the night when noahs deluge first dried beautiful nay solemn was the sudden aspect to our wanderer he gazed over those stupendous masses with wonder almost with longing desire never till this hour had he known nature that she was one that she was his mother and divine and as the ruddy glow was fading into clearness in the sky and the sun had now departed a murmur of eternity and immensity of death and of life stole through his soul and he felt as if death and life were one as if the earth were not dead as if the spirit of the earth had its throne in that splendour and his own spirit were therewith holding communion the spell was broken by a sound of carriagewheels emerging from the hidden northward to sink soon into the hidden southward came a gay baroucheandfour it was open servants and postillions wore weddingfavours that happy pair then had found each other it was their marriage evening few moments brought them near du himmel it was herr towgood and blumine with slight unrecognising salutation they passed me plunged down amid the neighbouring thickets onwards to heaven and to england and i in my friend richters words i remained alone behind them with the night were it not cruel in these circumstances here might be the place to insert an observation gleaned long ago from the great clothesvolume where it stands with quite other intent some time before smallpox was extirpated says the professor there came a new malady of the spiritual sort on europe i mean the epidemic now endemical of viewhunting poets of old date being privileged with senses had also enjoyed external nature but chiefly as we enjoy the crystal cup which holds good or bad liquor for us that is to say in silence or with slight incidental commentary never as i compute till after the sorrows of werter was there man found who would say come let us make a description having drunk the liquor come let us eat the glass of which endemic the jenner is unhappily still to seek too true we reckon it more important to remark that the professors wanderings so far as his stoical and cynical envelopment admits us to clear insight here first take their permanent character fatuous or not that basiliskglance of the baroucheandfour seems to have witheredup what little remnant of a purpose may have still lurked in him life has become wholly a dark labyrinth wherein through long years our friend flying from spectres has to stumble about at random and naturally with more haste than progress foolish were it in us to attempt following him even from afar in this extraordinary worldpilgrimage of his the simplest record of which were clear record possible would fill volumes hopeless is the obscurity unspeakable the confusion he glides from country to country from condition to condition vanishing and reappearing no man can calculate how or where through all quarters of the world he wanders and apparently through all circles of society if in any scene perhaps difficult to fix geographically he settles for a time and forms connexions be sure he will snap them abruptly asunder let him sink out of sight as private scholar privatisirender living by the grace of god in some european capital you may next find him as hadjee in the neighbourhood of mecca it is an inexplicable phantasmagoria capricious quickchanging as if our traveller instead of limbs and highways had transported himself by some wishingcarpet or fortunatus hat the whole too imparted emblematically in dim multifarious tokens as that collection of streetadvertisements with only some touch of direct historical notice sparingly interspersed little lightislets in the world of haze so that from this point the professor is more of an enigma than ever in figurative language we might say he becomes not indeed a spirit yet spiritualised vaporised fact unparalleled in biography the river of his history which we have traced from its tiniest fountains and hoped to see flow onward with increasing current into the ocean here dashes itself over that terrific lovers leap and as a madfoaming cataract flies wholly into tumultuous clouds of spray low down it indeed collects again into pools and plashes yet only at a great distance and with difficulty if at all into a general stream to cast a glance into certain of those pools and plashes and trace whither they run must for a chapter or two form the limit of our endeavour for which end doubtless those direct historical notices where they can be met with are the best nevertheless of this sort too there occurs much which with our present light it were questionable to emit teufelsdrckh vibrating everywhere between the highest and the lowest levels comes into contact with public history itself for example those conversations and relations with illustrious persons as sultan mahmoud the emperor napoleon and others are they not as yet rather of a diplomatic character than of a biographic the editor appreciating the sacredness of crowned heads nay perhaps suspecting the possible trickeries of a clothesphilosopher will eschew this province for the present a new time may bring new insight and a different duty if we ask now not indeed with what ulterior purpose for there was none yet with what immediate outlooks at all events in what mood of mind the professor undertook and prosecuted this worldpilgrimage the answer is more distinct than favourable a nameless unrest says he urged me forward to which the outward motion was some momentary lying solace whither should i go my loadstars were blotted out in that canopy of grim fire shone no star yet forward must i the ground burnt under me there was no rest for the sole of my foot i was alone alone ever too the strong inward longing shaped fantasms for itself towards these one after the other must i fruitlessly wander a feeling i had that for my feverthirst there was and must be somewhere a healing fountain to many fondly imagined fountains the saints wells of these days did i pilgrim to great men to great cities to great events but found there no healing in strange countries as in the wellknown in savage deserts as in the press of corrupt civilisation it was ever the same how could your wanderer escape from his own shadow nevertheless still forward i felt as if in great haste to do i saw not what from the depths of my own heart it called to me forwards the winds and the streams and all nature sounded to me forwards ach gott i was even once for all a son of time from which is it not clear that the internal satanic school was still active enough he says elsewhere the enchiridion of epictetus i had ever with me often as my sole rational companion and regret to mention that the nourishment it yielded was trifling thou foolish teufelsdrckh how could it else hadst thou not greek enough to understand thus much the end of man is an action and not a thought though it were the noblest how i lived writes he once friend hast thou considered the rugged allnourishing earth as sophocles well names her how she feeds the sparrow on the housetop much more her darling man while thou stirrest and livest thou hast a probability of victual my breakfast of tea has been cooked by a tartar woman with water of the amur who wiped her earthen kettle with a horsetail i have roasted wildeggs in the sand of sahara i have awakened in paris estrapades and vienna malzleins with no prospect of breakfast beyond elemental liquid that i had my living to seek saved me from dying by suicide in our busy europe is there not an everlasting demand for intellect in the chemical mechanical political religious educational commercial departments in pagan countries cannot one write fetishes living little knowest thou what alchemy is in an inventive soul how as with its little finger it can create provision enough for the body of a philosopher and then as with both hands create quite other than provision namely spectres to torment itself withal poor teufelsdrckh flying with hunger always parallel to him and a whole infernal chase in his rear so that the countenance of hunger is comparatively a friends thus must he in the temper of ancient cain or of the modern wandering jew save only that he feels himself not guilty and but suffering the pains of guilt wend to and fro with aimless speed thus must he over the whole surface of the earth by footprints write his sorrows of teufelsdrckh even as the great goethe in passionate words had to write his sorrows of werter before the spirit freed herself and he could become a man vain truly is the hope of your swiftest runner to escape from his own shadow nevertheless in these sick days when the born of heaven first descries himself about the age of twenty in a world such as ours richer than usual in two things in truths grown obsolete and trades grown obsolete what can the fool think but that it is all a den of lies wherein whoso will not speak lies and act lies must stand idle and despair whereby it happens that for your nobler minds the publishing of some such work of art in one or the other dialect becomes almost a necessity for what is it properly but an altercation with the devil before you begin honestly fighting him your byron publishes his sorrows of lord george in verse and in prose and copiously otherwise your bonaparte represents his sorrows of napoleon opera in an alltoo stupendous style with music of cannonvolleys and murdershrieks of a world his stagelights are the fires of conflagration his rhyme and recitative are the tramp of embattled hosts and the sound of falling cities happier is he who like our clothesphilosopher can write such matter since it must be written on the insensible earth with his shoesoles only and also survive the writing thereof chapter vii the everlasting no under the strange nebulous envelopment wherein our professor has now shrouded himself no doubt but his spiritual nature is nevertheless progressive and growing for how can the son of time in any case stand still we behold him through those dim years in a state of crisis of transition his mad pilgrimings and general solution into aimless discontinuity what is all this but a mad fermentation wherefrom the fiercer it is the clearer product will one day evolve itself such transitions are ever full of pain thus the eagle when he moults is sickly and to attain his new beak must harshly dashoff the old one upon rocks what stoicism soever our wanderer in his individual acts and motions may affect it is clear that there is a hot fever of anarchy and misery raging within coruscations of which flash out as indeed how could there be other have we not seen him disappointed bemocked of destiny through long years all that the young heart might desire and pray for has been denied nay as in the last worst instance offered and then snatched away ever an excellent passivity but of useful reasonable activity essential to the former as food to hunger nothing granted till at length in this wild pilgrimage he must forcibly seize for himself an activity though useless unreasonable alas his cup of bitterness which had been filling drop by drop ever since that first ruddy morning in the hinterschlag gymnasium was at the very lip and then with that poisondrop of the towgoodandblumine business it runs over and even hisses over in a deluge of foam he himself says once with more justice than originality man is properly speaking based upon hope he has no other possession but hope this world of his is emphatically the place of hope what then was our professors possession we see him for the present quite shutout from hope looking not into the golden orient but vaguely all round into a dim copper firmament pregnant with earthquake and tornado alas shutout from hope in a deeper sense than we yet dream of for as he wanders wearisomely through this world he has now lost all tidings of another and higher full of religion or at least of religiosity as our friend has since exhibited himself he hides not that in those days he was wholly irreligious doubt had darkened into unbelief says he shade after shade goes grimly over your soul till you have the fixed starless tartarean black to such readers as have reflected what can be called reflecting on mans life and happily discovered in contradiction to much profitandloss philosophy speculative and practical that soul is not synonymous with stomach who understand therefore in our friends words that for mans wellbeing faith is properly the one thing needful how with it martyrs otherwise weak can cheerfully endure the shame and the cross and without it worldlings pukeup their sick existence by suicide in the midst of luxury to such it will be clear that for a pure moral nature the loss of his religious belief was the loss of everything unhappy young man all wounds the crush of longcontinued destitution the stab of false friendship and of false love all wounds in thy so genial heart would have healed again had not its lifewarmth been withdrawn well might he exclaim in his wild way is there no god then but at best an absentee god sitting idle ever since the first sabbath at the outside of his universe and seeing it go has the word duty no meaning is what we call duty no divine messenger and guide but a false earthly fantasm madeup of desire and fear of emanations from the gallows and from dr grahams celestialbed happiness of an approving conscience did not paul of tarsus whom admiring men have since named saint feel that he was the chief of sinners and nero of rome jocund in spirit wohlgemuth spend much of his time in fiddling foolish wordmonger and motivegrinder who in thy logicmill hast an earthly mechanism for the godlike itself and wouldst fain grind me out virtue from the husks of pleasure i tell thee nay to the unregenerate prometheus vinctus of a man it is ever the bitterest aggravation of his wretchedness that he is conscious of virtue that he feels himself the victim not of suffering only but of injustice what then is the heroic inspiration we name virtue but some passion some bubble of the blood bubbling in the direction others profit by i know not only this i know if what thou namest happiness be our true aim then are we all astray with stupidity and sound digestion man may front much but what in these dull unimaginative days are the terrors of conscience to the diseases of the liver not on morality but on cookery let us build our stronghold there brandishing our fryingpan as censer let us offer sweet incense to the devil and live at ease on the fat things he has provided for his elect thus has the bewildered wanderer to stand as so many have done shouting question after question into the sibylcave of destiny and receive no answer but an echo it is all a grim desert this oncefair world of his wherein is heard only the howling of wildbeasts or the shrieks of despairing hatefilled men and no pillar of cloud by day and no pillar of fire by night any longer guides the pilgrim to such length has the spirit of inquiry carried him but what boots it was thuts cries he it is but the common lot in this era not having come to spiritual majority prior to the sicle de louis quinze and not being born purely a loghead dummkopf thou hadst no other outlook the whole world is like thee sold to unbelief their old temples of the godhead which for long have not been rainproof crumble down and men ask now where is the godhead our eyes never saw him pitiful enough were it for all these wild utterances to call our diogenes wicked unprofitable servants as we all are perhaps at no era of his life was he more decisively the servant of goodness the servant of god than even now when doubting gods existence one circumstance i note says he after all the nameless woe that inquiry which for me what it is not always was genuine love of truth had wrought me i nevertheless still loved truth and would bate no jot of my allegiance to her truth i cried though the heavens crush me for following her no falsehood though a whole celestial lubberland were the price of apostasy in conduct it was the same had a divine messenger from the clouds or miraculous handwriting on the wall convincingly proclaimed to me this thou shalt do with what passionate readiness as i often thought would i have done it had it been leaping into the infernal fire thus in spite of all motivegrinders and mechanical profitandloss philosophies with the sick ophthalmia and hallucination they had brought on was the infinite nature of duty still dimly present to me living without god in the world of gods light i was not utterly bereft if my as yet sealed eyes with their unspeakable longing could nowhere see him nevertheless in my heart he was present and his heavenwritten law still stood legible and sacred there meanwhile under all these tribulations and temporal and spiritual destitutions what must the wanderer in his silent soul have endured the painfullest feeling writes he is that of your own feebleness unkraft ever as the english milton says to be weak is the true misery and yet of your strength there is and can be no clear feeling save by what you have prospered in by what you have done between vague wavering capability and fixed indubitable performance what a difference a certain inarticulate selfconsciousness dwells dimly in us which only our works can render articulate and decisively discernible our works are the mirror wherein the spirit first sees its natural lineaments hence too the folly of that impossible precept know thyself till it be translated into this partially possible one know what thou canst workat but for me so strangely unprosperous had i been the netresult of my workings amounted as yet simply to nothing how then could i believe in my strength when there was as yet no mirror to see it in ever did this agitating yet as i now perceive quite frivolous question remain to me insoluble hast thou a certain faculty a certain worth such even as the most have not or art thou the completest dullard of these modern times alas the fearful unbelief is unbelief in yourself and how could i believe had not my first last faith in myself when even to me the heavens seemed laid open and i dared to love been alltoo cruelly belied the speculative mystery of life grew ever more mysterious to me neither in the practical mystery had i made the slightest progress but been everywhere buffeted foiled and contemptuously castout a feeble unit in the middle of a threatening infinitude i seemed to have nothing given me but eyes whereby to discern my own wretchedness invisible yet impenetrable walls as of enchantment divided me from all living was there in the wide world any true bosom i could press trustfully to mine o heaven no there was none i kept a lock upon my lips why should i speak much with that shifting variety of socalled friends in whose withered vain and toohungry souls friendship was but an incredible tradition in such cases your resource is to talk little and that little mostly from the newspapers now when i look back it was a strange isolation i then lived in the men and women around me even speaking with me were but figures i had practically forgotten that they were alive that they were not merely automatic in midst of their crowded streets and assemblages i walked solitary and except as it was my own heart not anothers that i kept devouring savage also as the tiger in his jungle some comfort it would have been could i like a faust have fancied myself tempted and tormented of the devil for a hell as i imagine without life though only diabolic life were more frightful but in our age of downpulling and disbelief the very devil has been pulled down you cannot so much as believe in a devil to me the universe was all void of life of purpose of volition even of hostility it was one huge dead immeasurable steamengine rolling on in its dead indifference to grind me limb from limb o the vast gloomy solitary golgotha and mill of death why was the living banished thither companionless conscious why if there is no devil nay unless the devil is your god a prey incessantly to such corrosions might not moreover as the worst aggravation to them the iron constitution even of a teufelsdrckh threaten to fail we conjecture that he has known sickness and in spite of his locomotive habits perhaps sickness of the chronic sort hear this for example how beautiful to die of brokenheart on paper quite another thing in practice every window of your feeling even of your intellect as it were begrimed and mudbespattered so that no pure ray can enter a whole drugshop in your inwards the fordone soul drowning slowly in quagmires of disgust putting all which external and internal miseries together may we not find in the following sentences quite in our professors still vein significance enough from suicide a certain aftershine nachschein of christianity withheld me perhaps also a certain indolence of character for was not that a remedy i had at any time within reach often however was there a question present to me should some one now at the turning of that corner blow thee suddenly out of space into the other world or other noworld by pistolshot how were it on which ground too i have often in seastorms and sieged cities and other deathscenes exhibited an imperturbability which passed falsely enough for courage so had it lasted concludes the wanderer so had it lasted as in bitter protracted deathagony through long years the heart within me unvisited by any heavenly dewdrop was smouldering in sulphurous slowconsuming fire almost since earliest memory i had shed no tear or once only when i murmuring halfaudibly recited fausts deathsong that wild selig der den er im siegesglanze findet happy whom he finds in battles splendour and thought that of this last friend even i was not forsaken that destiny itself could not doom me not to die having no hope neither had i any definite fear were it of man or of devil nay i often felt as if it might be solacing could the archdevil himself though in tartarean terrors but rise to me that i might tell him a little of my mind and yet strangely enough i lived in a continual indefinite pining fear tremulous pusillanimous apprehensive of i knew not what it seemed as if all things in the heavens above and the earth beneath would hurt me as if the heavens and the earth were but boundless jaws of a devouring monster wherein i palpitating waited to be devoured full of such humour and perhaps the miserablest man in the whole french capital or suburbs was i one sultry dogday after much perambulation toiling along the dirty little rue saintthomas de lenfer among civic rubbish enough in a close atmosphere and over pavements hot as nebuchadnezzars furnace whereby doubtless my spirits were little cheered when all at once there rose a thought in me and i asked myself what art thou afraid of wherefore like a coward dost thou forever pip and whimper and go cowering and trembling despicable biped what is the sumtotal of the worst that lies before thee death well death and say the pangs of tophet too and all that the devil and man may will or can do against thee hast thou not a heart canst thou not suffer whatsoever it be and as a child of freedom though outcast trample tophet itself under thy feet while it consumes thee let it come then i will meet it and defy it and as i so thought there rushed like a stream of fire over my whole soul and i shook base fear away from me forever i was strong of unknown strength a spirit almost a god ever from that time the temper of my misery was changed not fear or whining sorrow was it but indignation and grim fireeyed defiance thus had the everlasting no das ewige nein pealed authoritatively through all the recesses of my being of my me and then was it that my whole me stood up in native godcreated majesty and with emphasis recorded its protest such a protest the most important transaction in life may that same indignation and defiance in a psychological point of view be fitly called the everlasting no had said behold thou are fatherless outcast and the universe is mine the devils to which my whole me now made answer i am not thine but free and forever hate thee it is from this hour that i incline to date my spiritual newbirth or baphometic firebaptism perhaps i directly thereupon began to be a man chapter viii centre of indifference though after this baphometic firebaptism of his our wanderer signifies that his unrest was but increased as indeed indignation and defiance especially against things in general are not the most peaceable inmates yet can the psychologist surmise that it was no longer a quite hopeless unrest that henceforth it had at least a fixed centre to revolve round for the firebaptised soul long so scathed and thunderriven here feels its own freedom which feeling is its baphometic baptism the citadel of its whole kingdom it has thus gained by assault and will keep inexpugnable outwards from which the remaining dominions not indeed without hard battling will doubtless by degrees be conquered and pacificated under another figure we might say if in that great moment in the rue saintthomas de lenfer the old inward satanic school was not yet thrown out of doors it received peremptory judicial notice to quit whereby for the rest its howlchantings ernulphuscursings and rebellious gnashings of teeth might in the meanwhile become only the more tumultuous and difficult to keep secret accordingly if we scrutinise these pilgrimings well there is perhaps discernible henceforth a certain incipient method in their madness not wholly as a spectre does teufelsdrckh now storm through the world at worst as a spectrefighting man nay who will one day be a spectrequeller if pilgriming restlessly to so many saints wells and ever without quenching of his thirst he nevertheless finds little secular wells whereby from time to time some alleviation is ministered in a word he is now if not ceasing yet intermitting to eat his own heart and clutches round him outwardly on the notme for wholesomer food does not the following glimpse exhibit him in a much more natural state towns also and cities especially the ancient i failed not to look upon with interest how beautiful to see thereby as through a long vista into the remote time to have as it were an actual section of almost the earliest past brought safe into the present and set before your eyes there in that old city was a live ember of culinary fire put down say only two thousand years ago and there burning more or less triumphantly with such fuel as the region yielded it has burnt and still burns and thou thyself seest the very smoke thereof ah and the far more mysterious live ember of vital fire was then also put down there and still miraculously burns and spreads and the smoke and ashes thereof in these judgmenthalls and churchyards and its bellowsengines in these churches thou still seest and its flame looking out from every kind countenance and every hateful one still warms thee or scorches thee of mans activity and attainment the chief results are aeriform mystic and preserved in tradition only such are his forms of government with the authority they rest on his customs or fashions both of clothhabits and of soulhabits much more his collective stock of handicrafts the whole faculty he has acquired of manipulating nature all these things as indispensable and priceless as they are cannot in any way be fixed under lock and key but must flit spiritlike on impalpable vehicles from father to son if you demand sight of them they are nowhere to be met with visible ploughmen and hammermen there have been ever from cain and tubalcain downwards but where does your accumulated agricultural metallurgic and other manufacturing skill lie warehoused it transmits itself on the atmospheric air on the suns rays by hearing and by vision it is a thing aeriform impalpable of quite spiritual sort in like manner ask me not where are the laws where is the government in vain wilt thou go to schnbrunn to downing street to the palais bourbon thou findest nothing there but brick or stone houses and some bundles of papers tied with tape where then is that same cunninglydevised almighty government of theirs to be laid hands on everywhere yet nowhere seen only in its works this too is a thing aeriform invisible or if you will mystic and miraculous so spiritual geistig is our whole daily life all that we do springs out of mystery spirit invisible force only like a little cloudimage or armidas palace airbuilt does the actual body itself forth from the great mystic deep visible and tangible products of the past again i reckonup to the extent of three cities with their cabinets and arsenals then tilled fields to either or to both of which divisions roads with their bridges may belong and thirdlybooks in which third truly the last invented lies a worth far surpassing that of the two others wondrous indeed is the virtue of a true book not like a dead city of stones yearly crumbling yearly needing repair more like a tilled field but then a spiritual field like a spiritual tree let me rather say it stands from year to year and from age to age we have books that already number some hundredandfifty human ages and yearly comes its new produce of leaves commentaries deductions philosophical political systems or were it only sermons pamphlets journalistic essays every one of which is talismanic and thaumaturgic for it can persuade men o thou who art able to write a book which once in the two centuries or oftener there is a man gifted to do envy not him whom they name citybuilder and inexpressibly pity him whom they name conqueror or cityburner thou too art a conqueror and victor but of the true sort namely over the devil thou too hast built what will outlast all marble and metal and be a wonderbringing city of the mind a temple and seminary and prophetic mount whereto all kindreds of the earth will pilgrim fool why journeyest thou wearisomely in thy antiquarian fervour to gaze on the stone pyramids of geeza or the clay ones of sacchara these stand there as i can tell thee idle and inert looking over the desert foolishly enough for the last threethousand years but canst thou not open thy hebrew bible then or even luthers version thereof no less satisfactory is his sudden appearance not in battle yet on some battlefield which we soon gather must be that of wagram so that here for once is a certain approximation to distinctness of date omitting much let us impart what follows horrible enough a whole marchfeld strewed with shellsplinters cannonshot ruined tumbrils and dead men and horses stragglers still remaining not so much as buried and those red mould heaps ay there lie the shells of men out of which all the life and virtue has been blown and now are they swept together and crammeddown out of sight like blown eggshells did nature when she bade the donau bring down his mouldcargoes from the carinthian and carpathian heights and spread them out here into the softest richest level intend thee o marchfeld for a cornbearing nursery whereon her children might be nursed or for a cockpit wherein they might the more commodiously be throttled and tattered were thy three broad highways meeting here from the ends of europe made for ammunitionwagons then were thy wagrams and stillfrieds but so many readybuilt casemates wherein the house of hapsburg might batter with artillery and with artillery be battered knig ottokar amid yonder hillocks dies under rodolfs truncheon here kaiser franz falls aswoon under napoleons within which five centuries to omit the others how has thy breast fair plain been defaced and defiled the greensward is tornup and trampleddown mans fond care of it his fruittrees hedgerows and pleasant dwellings blownaway with gunpowder and the kind seedfield lies a desolate hideous place of sculls nevertheless nature is at work neither shall these powderdevilkins with their utmost devilry gainsay her but all that gore and carnage will be shroudedin absorbed into manure and next year the marchfeld will be green nay greener thrifty unwearied nature ever out of our great waste educing some little profit of thy own how dost thou from the very carcass of the killer bring life for the living what speaking in quite unofficial language is the netpurport and upshot of war to my own knowledge for example there dwell and toil in the british village of dumdrudge usually some fivehundred souls from these by certain natural enemies of the french there are successively selected during the french war say thirty ablebodied men dumdrudge at her own expense has suckled and nursed them she has not without difficulty and sorrow fed them up to manhood and even trained them to crafts so that one can weave another build another hammer and the weakest can stand under thirty stone avoirdupois nevertheless amid much weeping and swearing they are selected all dressed in red and shipped away at the public charges some twothousand miles or say only to the south of spain and fed there till wanted and now to that same spot in the south of spain are thirty similar french artisans from a french dumdrudge in like manner wending till at length after infinite effort the two parties come into actual juxtaposition and thirty stands fronting thirty each with a gun in his hand straightway the word fire is given and they blow the souls out of one another and in place of sixty brisk useful craftsmen the world has sixty dead carcasses which it must bury and anew shed tears for had these men any quarrel busy as the devil is not the smallest they lived far enough apart were the entirest strangers nay in so wide a universe there was even unconsciously by commerce some mutual helpfulness between them how then simpleton their governors had fallenout and instead of shooting one another had the cunning to make these poor blockheads shoot alas so is it in deutschland and hitherto in all other lands still as of old what devilry soever kings do the greeks must pay the piper in that fiction of the english smollet it is true the final cessation of war is perhaps prophetically shadowed forth where the two natural enemies in person take each a tobaccopipe filled with brimstone light the same and smoke in one anothers faces till the weaker gives in but from such predicted peaceera what bloodfilled trenches and contentious centuries may still divide us thus can the professor at least in lucid intervals look away from his own sorrows over the manycoloured world and pertinently enough note what is passing there we may remark indeed that for the matter of spiritual culture if for nothing else perhaps few periods of his life were richer than this internally there is the most momentous instructive course of practical philosophy with experiments going on towards the right comprehension of which his peripatetic habits favourable to meditation might help him rather than hinder externally again as he wanders to and fro there are if for the longing heart little substance yet for the seeing eye sights enough in these so boundless travels of his granting that the satanic school was even partially kept down what an incredible knowledge of our planet and its inhabitants and their works that is to say of all knowable things might not teufelsdrckh acquire i have read in most public libraries says he including those of constantinople and samarcand in most colleges except the chinese mandarin ones i have studied or seen that there was no studying unknown languages have i oftenest gathered from their natural repertory the air by my organ of hearing statistics geographics topographics came through the eye almost of their own accord the ways of man how he seeks food and warmth and protection for himself in most regions are ocularly known to me like the great hadrian i metedout much of the terraqueous globe with a pair of compasses that belonged to myself only of great scenes why speak three summer days i lingered reflecting and even composing dichtete by the pinechasms of vaucluse and in that clear lakelet moistened my bread i have sat under the palmtrees of tadmor smoked a pipe among the ruins of babylon the great wall of china i have seen and can testify that it is of gray brick coped and covered with granite and shows only secondrate masonry great events also have not i witnessed kings sweateddown ausgemergelt into berlinandmilan customhouseofficers the world well won and the world well lost oftener than once a hundredthousand individuals shot by each other in one day all kindreds and peoples and nations dashed together and shifted and shovelled into heaps that they might ferment there and in time unite the birthpangs of democracy wherewith convulsed europe was groaning in cries that reached heaven could not escape me for great men i have ever had the warmest predilection and can perhaps boast that few such in this era have wholly escaped me great men are the inspired speaking and acting texts of that divine book of revelations whereof a chapter is completed from epoch to epoch and by some named history to which inspired texts your numerous talented men and your innumerable untalented men are the better or worse exegetic commentaries and wagonload of toostupid heretical or orthodox weekly sermons for my study the inspired texts themselves thus did not i in very early days having disguised me as tavernwaiter stand behind the fieldchairs under that shady tree at treisnitz by the jena highway waiting upon the great schiller and greater goethe and hearing what i have not forgotten for but at this point the editor recalls his principle of caution some time ago laid down and must suppress much let not the sacredness of laurelled still more of crowned heads be tampered with should we at a future day find circumstances altered and the time come for publication then may these glimpses into the privacy of the illustrious be conceded which for the present were little better than treacherous perhaps traitorous eavesdroppings of lord byron therefore of pope pius emperor tarakwang and the white waterroses chinese carbonari with their mysteries no notice here of napoleon himself we shall only glancing from afar remark that teufelsdrckhs relation to him seems to have been of very varied character at first we find our poor professor on the point of being shot as a spy then taken into private conversation even pinched on the ear yet presented with no money at last indignantly dismissed almost thrown out of doors as an ideologist he himself says the professor was among the completest ideologists at least ideopraxists in the idea in der idee he lived moved and fought the man was a divine missionary though unconscious of it and preached through the cannons throat that great doctrine la carrire ouverte aux talens the tools to him that can handle them which is our ultimate political evangel wherein alone can liberty lie madly enough he preached it is true as enthusiasts and first missionaries are wont with imperfect utterance amid much frothy rant yet as articulately perhaps as the case admitted or call him if you will an american backwoodsman who had to fell unpenetrated forests and battle with innumerable wolves and did not entirely forbear strong liquor rioting and even theft whom notwithstanding the peaceful sower will follow and as he cuts the boundless harvest bless more legitimate and decisively authentic is teufelsdrckhs appearance and emergence we know not well whence in the solitude of the north cape on that june midnight he has a lightblue spanish cloak hanging round him as his most commodious principal indeed sole upper garment and stands there on the worldpromontory looking over the infinite brine like a little blue belfry as we figure now motionless indeed yet ready if stirred to ring quaintest changes silence as of death writes he for midnight even in the arctic latitudes has its character nothing but the granite cliffs ruddytinged the peaceable gurgle of that slowheaving polar ocean over which in the utmost north the great sun hangs low and lazy as if he too were slumbering yet is his cloudcouch wrought of crimson and clothofgold yet does his light stream over the mirror of waters like a tremulous firepillar shooting downwards to the abyss and hide itself under my feet in such moments solitude also is invaluable for who would speak or be looked on when behind him lies all europe and africa fast asleep except the watchmen and before him the silent immensity and palace of the eternal whereof our sun is but a porchlamp nevertheless in this solemn moment comes a man or monster scrambling from among the rockhollows and shaggy huge as the hyperborean bear hails me in russian speech most probably therefore a russian smuggler with courteous brevity i signify my indifference to contraband trade my humane intentions yet strong wish to be private in vain the monster counting doubtless on his superior stature and minded to make sport for himself or perhaps profit were it with murder continues to advance ever assailing me with his importunate trainoil breath and now has advanced till we stand both on the verge of the rock the deep sea rippling greedily down below what argument will avail on the thick hyperborean cherubic reasoning seraphic eloquence were lost prepared for such extremity i deftly enough whisk aside one step draw out from my interior reservoirs a sufficient birmingham horsepistol and say be so obliging as retire friend er ziehe sich zurck freund and with promptitude this logic even the hyperborean understands fast enough with apologetic petitionary growl he sidles off and except for suicidal as well as homicidal purposes need not return such i hold to be the genuine use of gunpowder that it makes all men alike tall nay if thou be cooler cleverer than i if thou have more mind though all but no body whatever then canst thou kill me first and art the taller hereby at last is the goliath powerless and the david resistless savage animalism is nothing inventive spiritualism is all with respect to duels indeed i have my own ideas few things in this so surprising world strike me with more surprise two little visual spectra of men hovering with insecure enough cohesion in the midst of the unfathomable and to dissolve therein at any rate very soon make pause at the distance of twelve paces asunder whirl round and simultaneously by the cunningest mechanism explode one another into dissolution and offhand become air and nonextant deuce on it verdammt the little spitfires nay i think with old hugo von trimberg god must needs laugh outright could such a thing be to see his wondrous manikins here below but amid these specialties let us not forget the great generality which is our chief quest here how prospered the inner man of teufelsdrckh under so much outward shifting does legion still lurk in him though repressed or has he exorcised that devils brood we can answer that the symptoms continue promising experience is the grand spiritual doctor and with him teufelsdrckh has now been long a patient swallowing many a bitter bolus unless our poor friend belong to the numerous class of incurables which seems not likely some cure will doubtless be effected we should rather say that legion or the satanic school was now pretty well extirpated and cast out but next to nothing introduced in its room whereby the heart remains for the while in a quiet but no comfortable state at length after so much roasting thus writes our autobiographer i was what you might name calcined pray only that it be not rather as is the more frequent issue reduced to a caputmortuum but in any case by mere dint of practice i had grown familiar with many things wretchedness was still wretched but i could now partly see through it and despise it which highest mortal in this inane existence had i not found a shadowhunter or shadowhunted and when i looked through his brave garnitures miserable enough thy wishes have all been sniffed aside thought i but what had they even been all granted did not the boy alexander weep because he had not two planets to conquer or a whole solar system or after that a whole universe ach gott when i gazed into these stars have they not looked down on me as if with pity from their serene spaces like eyes glistening with heavenly tears over the little lot of man thousands of human generations all as noisy as our own have been swallowedup of time and there remains no wreck of them any more and arcturus and orion and sirius and the pleiades are still shining in their courses clear and young as when the shepherd first noted them in the plain of shinar pshaw what is this paltry little dogcage of an earth what art thou that sittest whining there thou art still nothing nobody true but who then is something somebody for thee the family of man has no use it rejects thee thou art wholly as a dissevered limb so be it perhaps it is better so tooheavyladen teufelsdrckh yet surely his bands are loosening one day he will hurl the burden far from him and bound forth free and with a second youth this says our professor was the centre of indifference i had now reached through which whoso travels from the negative pole to the positive must necessarily pass chapter ix the everlasting yea temptations in the wilderness exclaims teufelsdrckh have we not all to be tried with such not so easily can the old adam lodged in us by birth be dispossessed our life is compassed round with necessity yet is the meaning of life itself no other than freedom than voluntary force thus have we a warfare in the beginning especially a hardfought battle for the godgiven mandate work thou in welldoing lies mysteriously written in promethean prophetic characters in our hearts and leaves us no rest night or day till it be deciphered and obeyed till it burn forth in our conduct a visible acted gospel of freedom and as the claygiven mandate eat thou and be filled at the same time persuasively proclaims itself through every nerve must not there be a confusion a contest before the better influence can become the upper to me nothing seems more natural than that the son of man when such godgiven mandate first prophetically stirs within him and the clay must now be vanquished or vanquish should be carried of the spirit into grim solitudes and there fronting the tempter do grimmest battle with him defiantly setting him at naught till he yield and fly name it as we choose with or without visible devil whether in the natural desert of rocks and sands or in the populous moral desert of selfishness and baseness to such temptation are we all called unhappy if we are not unhappy if we are but halfmen in whom that divine handwriting has never blazed forth allsubduing in true sunsplendour but quivers dubiously amid meaner lights or smoulders in dull pain in darkness under earthly vapours our wilderness is the wide world in an atheistic century our forty days are long years of suffering and fasting nevertheless to these also comes an end yes to me also was given if not victory yet the consciousness of battle and the resolve to persevere therein while life or faculty is left to me also entangled in the enchanted forests demonpeopled doleful of sight and of sound it was given after weariest wanderings to work out my way into the higher sunlit slopes of that mountain which has no summit or whose summit is in heaven only he says elsewhere under a less ambitious figure as figures are once for all natural to him has not thy life been that of most sufficient men tchtigen mnner thou hast known in this generation an outflush of foolish young enthusiasm like the first fallowcrop wherein are as many weeds as valuable herbs this all parched away under the droughts of practical and spiritual unbelief as disappointment in thought and act oftenrepeated gave rise to doubt and doubt gradually settled into denial if i have had a secondcrop and now see the perennial greensward and sit under umbrageous cedars which defy all drought and doubt herein too be the heavens praised i am not without examples and even exemplars so that for teufelsdrckh also there has been a glorious revolution these mad shadowhunting and shadowhunted pilgrimings of his were but some purifying temptation in the wilderness before his apostolic work such as it was could begin which temptation is now happily over and the devil once more worsted was that high moment in the rue de lenfer then properly the turningpoint of the battle when the fiend said worship me or be torn in shreds and was answered valiantly with an apage satana singular teufelsdrckh would thou hadst told thy singular story in plain words but it is fruitless to look there in those paperbags for such nothing but innuendoes figurative crotchets a typical shadow fitfully wavering propheticosatiric no clear logical picture how paint to the sensual eye asks he once what passes in the holyofholies of mans soul in what words known to these profane times speak even afaroff of the unspeakable we ask in turn why perplex these times profane as they are with needless obscurity by omission and by commission not mystical only is our professor but whimsical and involves himself now more than ever in eyebewildering chiaroscuro successive glimpses here faithfully imparted our more gifted readers must endeavour to combine for their own behoof he says the hot harmattan wind had raged itself out its howl went silent within me and the longdeafened soul could now hear i paused in my wild wanderings and sat me down to wait and consider for it was as if the hour of change drew nigh i seemed to surrender to renounce utterly and say fly then false shadows of hope i will chase you no more i will believe you no more and ye too haggard spectres of fear i care not for you ye too are all shadows and a lie let me rest here for i am wayweary and lifeweary i will rest here were it but to die to die or to live is alike to me alike insignificant and again here then as i lay in that centre of indifference cast doubtless by benignant upper influence into a healing sleep the heavy dreams rolled gradually away and i awoke to a new heaven and a new earth the first preliminary moral act annihilation of self selbsttdtung had been happily accomplished and my minds eyes were now unsealed and its hands ungyved might we not also conjecture that the following passage refers to his locality during this same healing sleep that his pilgrimstaff lies cast aside here on the high tableland and indeed that the repose is already taking wholesome effect on him if it were not that the tone in some parts has more of riancy even of levity than we could have expected however in teufelsdrckh there is always the strangest dualism light dancing with guitarmusic will be going on in the forecourt while by fits from within comes the faint whimpering of woe and wail we transcribe the piece entire beautiful it was to sit there as in my skyey tent musing and meditating on the high tableland in front of the mountains over me as roof the azure dome and around me for walls four azureflowing curtains namely of the four azure winds on whose bottomfringes also i have seen gilding and then to fancy the fair castles that stood sheltered in these mountain hollows with their green flowerlawns and white dames and damosels lovely enough or better still the strawroofed cottages wherein stood many a mother baking bread with her children round her all hidden and protectingly foldedup in the valleyfolds yet there and alive as sure as if i beheld them or to see as well as fancy the nine towns and villages that lay round my mountainseat which in still weather were wont to speak to me by their steeplebells with metal tongue and in almost all weather proclaimed their vitality by repeated smokeclouds whereon as on a culinary horologe i might read the hour of the day for it was the smoke of cookery as kind housewives at morning midday eventide were boiling their husbands kettles and ever a blue pillar rose up into the air successively or simultaneously from each of the nine saying as plainly as smoke could say such and such a meal is getting ready here not uninteresting for you have the whole borough with all its lovemakings and scandalmongeries contentions and contentments as in miniature and could cover it all with your hat if in my wide wayfarings i had learned to look into the business of the world in its details here perhaps was the place for combining it into general propositions and deducing inferences therefrom often also could i see the black tempest marching in anger through the distance round some schreckhorn as yet grimblue would the eddying vapour gather and there tumultuously eddy and flow down like a mad witchs hair till after a space it vanished and in the clear sunbeam your schreckhorn stood smiling grimwhite for the vapour had held snow how thou fermentest and elaboratest in thy great fermentingvat and laboratory of an atmosphere of a world o nature or what is nature ha why do i not name thee god art not thou the living garment of god o heavens is it in very deed he then that ever speaks through thee that lives and loves in thee that lives and loves in me foreshadows call them rather foresplendours of that truth and beginning of truths fell mysteriously over my soul sweeter than dayspring to the shipwrecked in nova zembla ah like the mothers voice to her little child that strays bewildered weeping in unknown tumults like soft streamings of celestial music to my tooexasperated heart came that evangel the universe is not dead and demoniacal a charnelhouse with spectres but godlike and my fathers with other eyes too could i now look upon my fellow man with an infinite love an infinite pity poor wandering wayward man art thou not tired and beaten with stripes even as i am ever whether thou bear the royal mantle or the beggars gabardine art thou not so weary so heavyladen and thy bed of rest is but a grave o my brother my brother why cannot i shelter thee in my bosom and wipe away all tears from thy eyes truly the din of manyvoiced life which in this solitude with the minds organ i could hear was no longer a maddening discord but a melting one like inarticulate cries and sobbings of a dumb creature which in the ear of heaven are prayers the poor earth with her poor joys was now my needy mother not my cruel stepdame man with his so mad wants and so mean endeavours had become the dearer to me and even for his sufferings and his sins i now first named him brother thus was i standing in the porch of that sanctuary of sorrow by strange steep ways had i too been guided thither and ere long its sacred gates would open and the divine depth of sorrow lie disclosed to me the professor says he here first got eye on the knot that had been strangling him and straightway could unfasten it and was free a vain interminable controversy writes he touching what is at present called origin of evil or some such thing arises in every soul since the beginning of the world and in every soul that would pass from idle suffering into actual endeavouring must first be put an end to the most in our time have to go content with a simple incomplete enough suppression of this controversy to a few some solution of it is indispensable in every new era too such solution comesout in different terms and ever the solution of the last era has become obsolete and is found unserviceable for it is mans nature to change his dialect from century to century he cannot help it though he would the authentic churchcatechism of our present century has not yet fallen into my hands meanwhile for my own private behoof i attempt to elucidate the matter so mans unhappiness as i construe comes of his greatness it is because there is an infinite in him which with all his cunning he cannot quite bury under the finite will the whole finance ministers and upholsterers and confectioners of modern europe undertake in jointstock company to make one shoeblack happy they cannot accomplish it above an hour or two for the shoeblack also has a soul quite other than his stomach and would require if you consider it for his permanent satisfaction and saturation simply this allotment no more and no less gods infinite universe altogether to himself therein to enjoy infinitely and fill every wish as fast as it rose oceans of hochheimer a throat like that of ophiuchus speak not of them to the infinite shoeblack they are as nothing no sooner is your ocean filled than he grumbles that it might have been of better vintage try him with half of a universe of an omnipotence he sets to quarrelling with the proprietor of the other half and declares himself the most maltreated of men always there is a black spot in our sunshine it is even as i said the shadow of ourselves but the whim we have of happiness is somewhat thus by certain valuations and averages of our own striking we come upon some sort of average terrestrial lot this we fancy belongs to us by nature and of indefeasible right it is simple payment of our wages of our deserts requires neither thanks nor complaint only such overplus as there may be do we account happiness any deficit again is misery now consider that we have the valuation of our own deserts ourselves and what a fund of selfconceit there is in each of us do you wonder that the balance should so often dip the wrong way and many a blockhead cry see there what a payment was ever worthy gentleman so used i tell thee blockhead it all comes of thy vanity of what thou fanciest those same deserts of thine to be fancy that thou deservest to be hanged as is most likely thou wilt feel it happiness to be only shot fancy that thou deservest to be hanged in a hairhalter it will be a luxury to die in hemp so true is it what i then say that the fraction of life can be increased in value not so much by increasing your numerator as by lessening your denominator nay unless my algebra deceive me unity itself divided by zero will give infinity make thy claim of wages a zero then thou hast the world under thy feet well did the wisest of our time write it is only with renunciation entsagen that life properly speaking can be said to begin i asked myself what is this that ever since earliest years thou hast been fretting and fuming and lamenting and selftormenting on account of say it in a word is it not because thou art not happy because the thou sweet gentleman is not sufficiently honoured nourished softbedded and lovingly cared for foolish soul what act of legislature was there that thou shouldst be happy a little while ago thou hadst no right to be at all what if thou wert born and predestined not to be happy but to be unhappy art thou nothing other than a vulture then that fliest through the universe seeking after somewhat to eat and shrieking dolefully because carrion enough is not given thee close thy byron open thy goethe es leuchtet mir ein i see a glimpse of it cries he elsewhere there is in man a higher than love of happiness he can do without happiness and instead thereof find blessedness was it not to preachforth this same higher that sages and martyrs the poet and the priest in all times have spoken and suffered bearing testimony through life and through death of the godlike that is in man and how in the godlike only has he strength and freedom which godinspired doctrine art thou also honoured to be taught o heavens and broken with manifold merciful afflictions even till thou become contrite and learn it o thank thy destiny for these thankfully bear what yet remain thou hadst need of them the self in thee needed to be annihilated by benignant feverparoxysms is life rooting out the deepseated chronic disease and triumphs over death on the roaring billows of time thou art not engulfed but borne aloft into the azure of eternity love not pleasure love god this is the everlasting yea wherein all contradiction is solved wherein whoso walks and works it is well with him and again small is it that thou canst trample the earth with its injuries under thy feet as old greek zeno trained thee thou canst love the earth while it injures thee and even because it injures thee for this a greater than zeno was needed and he too was sent knowest thou that worship of sorrow the temple thereof founded some eighteen centuries ago now lies in ruins overgrown with jungle the habitation of doleful creatures nevertheless venture forward in a low crypt arched out of falling fragments thou findest the altar still there and its sacred lamp perennially burning without pretending to comment on which strange utterances the editor will only remark that there lies beside them much of a still more questionable character unsuited to the general apprehension nay wherein he himself does not see his way nebulous disquisitions on religion yet not without bursts of splendour on the perennial continuance of inspiration on prophecy that there are true priests as well as baalpriests in our own day with more of the like sort we select some fractions by way of finish to this farrago cease my muchrespected herr von voltaire thus apostrophises the professor shut thy sweet voice for the task appointed thee seems finished sufficiently hast thou demonstrated this proposition considerable or otherwise that the mythus of the christian religion looks not in the eighteenth century as it did in the eighth alas were thy sixandthirty quartos and the sixandthirty thousand other quartos and folios and flying sheets or reams printed before and since on the same subject all needed to convince us of so little but what next wilt thou help us to embody the divine spirit of that religion in a new mythus in a new vehicle and vesture that our souls otherwise too like perishing may live what thou hast no faculty in that kind only a torch for burning no hammer for building take our thanks then and thyself away meanwhile what are antiquated mythuses to me or is the god present felt in my own heart a thing which herr von voltaire will dispute out of me or dispute into me to the worship of sorrow ascribe what origin and genesis thou pleasest has not that worship originated and been generated is it not here feel it in thy heart and then say whether it is of god this is belief all else is opinion for which latter whoso will let him worry and be worried neither observes he elsewhere shall ye tearout one anothers eyes struggling over plenary inspiration and suchlike try rather to get a little even partial inspiration each of you for himself one bible i know of whose plenary inspiration doubt is not so much as possible nay with my own eyes i saw the godshand writing it thereof all other bibles are but leaves say in picturewriting to assist the weaker faculty or to give the wearied reader relief and bring it to an end let him take the following perhaps more intelligible passage to me in this our life says the professor which is an internecine warfare with the timespirit other warfare seems questionable hast thou in any way a contention with thy brother i advise thee think well what the meaning thereof is if thou gauge it to the bottom it is simply this fellow see thou art taking more than thy share of happiness in the world something from my share which by the heavens thou shall not nay i will fight thee rather alas and the whole lot to be divided is such a beggarly matter truly a feast of shells for the substance has been spilled out not enough to quench one appetite and the collective human species clutching at them can we not in all such cases rather say take it thou tooravenous individual take that pitiful additional fraction of a share which i reckoned mine but which thou so wantest take it with a blessing would to heaven i had enough for thee if fichtes wissenschaftslehre be to a certain extent applied christianity surely to a still greater extent so is this we have here not a whole duty of man yet a half duty namely the passive half could we but do it as we can demonstrate it but indeed conviction were it never so excellent is worthless till it convert itself into conduct nay properly conviction is not possible till then inasmuch as all speculation is by nature endless formless a vortex amid vortices only by a felt indubitable certainty of experience does it find any centre to revolve round and so fashion itself into a system most true is it as a wise man teaches us that doubt of any sort cannot be removed except by action on which ground too let him who gropes painfully in darkness or uncertain light and prays vehemently that the dawn may ripen into day lay this other precept well to heart which to me was of invaluable service do the duty which lies nearest thee which thou knowest to be a duty thy second duty will already have become clearer may we not say however that the hour of spiritual enfranchisement is even this when your ideal world wherein the whole man has been dimly struggling and inexpressibly languishing to work becomes revealed and thrown open and you discover with amazement enough like the lothario in wilhelm meister that your america is here or nowhere the situation that has not its duty its ideal was never yet occupied by man yes here in this poor miserable hampered despicable actual wherein thou even now standest here or nowhere is thy ideal work it out therefrom and working believe live be free fool the ideal is in thyself the impediment too is in thyself thy condition is but the stuff thou art to shape that same ideal out of what matters whether such stuff be of this sort or that so the form thou give it be heroic be poetic o thou that pinest in the imprisonment of the actual and criest bitterly to the gods for a kingdom wherein to rule and create know this of a truth the thing thou seekest is already with thee here or nowhere couldst thou only see but it is with mans soul as it was with nature the beginning of creation is light till the eye have vision the whole members are in bonds divine moment when over the tempesttost soul as once over the wildweltering chaos it is spoken let there be light ever to the greatest that has felt such moment is it not miraculous and godannouncing even as under simpler figures to the simplest and least the mad primeval discord is hushed the rudelyjumbled conflicting elements bind themselves into separate firmaments deep silent rockfoundations are built beneath and the skyey vault with its everlasting luminaries above instead of a dark wasteful chaos we have a blooming fertile heavenencompassed world i too could now say to myself be no longer a chaos but a world or even worldkin produce produce were it but the pitifullest infinitesimal fraction of a product produce it in gods name tis the utmost thou hast in thee out with it then up up whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy whole might work while it is called today for the night cometh wherein no man can work chapter x pause thus have we as closely and perhaps satisfactorily as in such circumstances might be followed teufelsdrckh through the various successive states and stages of growth entanglement unbelief and almost reprobation into a certain clearer state of what he himself seems to consider as conversion blame not the word says he rejoice rather that such a word signifying such a thing has come to light in our modern era though hidden from the wisest ancients the old world knew nothing of conversion instead of an ecce homo they had only some choice of hercules it was a newattained progress in the moral development of man hereby has the highest come home to the bosoms of the most limited what to plato was but a hallucination and to socrates a chimera is now clear and certain to your zinzendorfs your wesleys and the poorest of their pietists and methodists it is here then that the spiritual majority of teufelsdrckh commences we are henceforth to see him work in welldoing with the spirit and clear aims of a man he has discovered that the ideal workshop he so panted for is even this same actual illfurnished workshop he has so long been stumbling in he can say to himself tools thou hast no tools why there is not a man or a thing now alive but has tools the basest of created animalcules the spider itself has a spinningjenny and warpingmill and powerloom within its head the stupidest of oysters has a papinsdigester with stoneandlime house to hold it in every being that can live can do something this let him do tools hast thou not a brain furnished furnishable with some glimmerings of light and three fingers to hold a pen withal never since aarons rod went out of practice or even before it was there such a wonderworking tool greater than all recorded miracles have been performed by pens for strangely in this so solidseeming world which nevertheless is in continual restless flux it is appointed that sound to appearance the most fleeting should be the most continuing of all things the word is well said to be omnipotent in this world man thereby divine can create as by a fiat awake arise speak forth what is in thee what god has given thee what the devil shall not take away higher task than that of priesthood was allotted to no man wert thou but the meanest in that sacred hierarchy is it not honour enough therein to spend and be spent by this art which whoso will may sacrilegiously degrade into a handicraft adds teufelsdrckh have i thenceforth abidden writings of mine not indeed known as mine for what am i have fallen perhaps not altogether void into the mighty seedfield of opinion fruits of my unseen sowing gratifyingly meet me here and there i thank the heavens that i have now found my calling wherein with or without perceptible result i am minded diligently to persevere nay how knowest thou cries he but this and the other pregnant device now grown to be a worldrenowned farworking institution like a grain of right mustardseed once cast into the right soil and now stretchingout strong boughs to the four winds for the birds of the air to lodge in may have been properly my doing some ones doing it without doubt was from some idea in some single head it did first of all take beginning why not from some idea in mine does teufelsdrckh here glance at that society for the conservation of property eigenthumsconservirende gesellschaft of which so many ambiguous notices glide spectrelike through these inexpressible paperbags an institution hints he not unsuitable to the wants of the time as indeed such sudden extension proves for already can the society number among its officebearers or corresponding members the highest names if not the highest persons in germany england france and contributions both of money and of meditation pourin from all quarters to if possible enlist the remaining integrity of the world and defensively and with forethought marshal it round this palladium does teufelsdrckh mean then to give himself out as the originator of that so notable eigenthumsconservirende owndomconserving gesellschaft and if so what in the devils name is it he again hints at a time when the divine commandment thou shalt not steal wherein truly if well understood is comprised the whole hebrew decalogue with solons and lycurguss constitutions justinians pandects the code napolon and all codes catechisms divinities moralities whatsoever that man has hitherto devised and enforced with altarfire and gallowsropes for his social guidance at a time i say when this divine commandment has allbut faded away from the general remembrance and with little disguise a new opposite commandment thou shalt steal is everywhere promulgated it perhaps behooved in this universal dotage and deliration the sound portion of mankind to bestir themselves and rally when the widest and wildest violations of that divine right of property the only divine right now extant or conceivable are sanctioned and recommended by a vicious press and the world has lived to hear it asserted that we have no property in our very bodies but only an accidental possession and liferent what is the issue to be looked for hangmen and catchpoles may by their noosegins and baited falltraps keepdown the smaller sort of vermin but what except perhaps some such universal association can protect us against whole meatdevouring and mandevouring hosts of boaconstrictors if therefore the more sequestered thinker have wondered in his privacy from what hand that perhaps not illwritten program in the public journals with its high prizequestions and so liberal prizes could have proceeded let him now cease such wonder and with undivided faculty betake himself to the concurrenz competition we ask has this same perhaps not illwritten program or any other authentic transaction of that propertyconserving society fallen under the eye of the british reader in any journal foreign or domestic if so what are those prizequestions what are the terms of competition and when and where no printed newspaperleaf no farther light of any sort to be met with in these paperbags or is the whole business one other of those whimsicalities and perverse inexplicabilities whereby herr teufelsdrckh meaning much or nothing is pleased so often to play fastandloose with us here indeed at length must the editor give utterance to a painful suspicion which through late chapters has begun to haunt him paralysing any little enthusiasm that might still have rendered his thorny biographical task a labour of love it is a suspicion grounded perhaps on trifles yet confirmed almost into certainty by the more and more discernible humoristicosatirical tendency of teufelsdrckh in whom underground humours and intricate sardonic rogueries wheel within wheel defy all reckoning a suspicion in one word that these autobiographical documents are partly a mystification what if many a socalled fact were little better than a fiction if here we had no direct cameraobscura picture of the professors history but only some more or less fantastic adumbration symbolically perhaps significantly enough shadowingforth the same our theory begins to be that in receiving as literally authentic what was but hieroglyphically so hofrath heuschrecke whom in that case we scruple not to name hofrath noseofwax was made a fool of and set adrift to make fools of others could it be expected indeed that a man so known for impenetrable reticence as teufelsdrckh would all at once frankly unlock his private citadel to an english editor and a german hofrath and not rather deceptively inlock both editor and hofrath in the labyrinthic tortuosities and coveredways of said citadel having enticed them thither to see in his halfdevilish way how the fools would look of one fool however the herr professor will perhaps find himself short on a small slip formerly thrown aside as blank the ink being allbut invisible we lately notice and with effort decipher the following what are your historical facts still more your biographical wilt thou know a man above all a mankind by stringingtogether beadrolls of what thou namest facts the man is the spirit he worked in not what he did but what he became facts are engraved hierograms for which the fewest have the key and then how your blockhead dummkopf studies not their meaning but simply whether they are well or ill cut what he calls moral or immoral still worse is it with your bungler pfuscher such i have seen reading some rousseau with pretences of interpretation and mistaking the illcut serpentofeternity for a common poisonous reptile was the professor apprehensive lest an editor selected as the present boasts himself might mistake the teufelsdrckh serpentofeternity in like manner for which reason it was to be altered not without underhand satire into a plainer symbol or is this merely one of his halfsophisms halftruisms which if he can but set on the back of a figure he cares not whither it gallop we say not with certainty and indeed so strange is the professor can never say if our suspicion be wholly unfounded let his own questionable ways not our necessary circumspectness bear the blame but be this as it will the somewhat exasperated and indeed exhausted editor determines here to shut these paperbags for the present let it suffice that we know of teufelsdrckh so far if not what he did yet what he became the rather as his character has now taken its ultimate bent and no new revolution of importance is to be looked for the imprisoned chrysalis is now a winged psyche and such wheresoever be its flight it will continue to trace by what complex gyrations flights or involuntary waftings through the mere external life element teufelsdrckh reaches his university professorship and the psyche clothes herself in civic titles without altering her now fixed nature would be comparatively an unproductive task were we even unsuspicious of its being for us at least a false and impossible one his outward biography therefore which at the blumine loversleap we saw churned utterly into sprayvapour may hover in that condition for aught that concerns us here enough that by survey of certain pools and plashes we have ascertained its general direction do we not already know that by one way and other it has long since raineddown again into a stream and even now at weissnichtwo flows deep and still fraught with the philosophy of clothes and visible to whoso will cast eye thereon over much invaluable matter that lies scattered like jewels among quarryrubbish in those papercatacombs we may have occasion to glance back and somewhat will demand insertion at the right place meanwhile be our tiresome diggings therein suspended if now before reopening the great clothesvolume we ask what our degree of progress during these ten chapters has been towards right understanding of the clothesphilosophy let not our discouragement become total to speak in that old figure of the hellgate bridge over chaos a few flying pontoons have perhaps been added though as yet they drift straggling on the flood how far they will reach when once the chains are straightened and fastened can at present only be matter of conjecture so much we already calculate through many a little loophole we have had glimpses into the internal world of teufelsdrckh his strange mystic almost magic diagram of the universe and how it was gradually drawn is not henceforth altogether dark to us those mysterious ideas on time which merit consideration and are not wholly unintelligible with such may by and by prove significant still more may his somewhat peculiar view of nature the decisive oneness he ascribes to nature how all nature and life are but one garment a living garment woven and ever aweaving in the loom of time is not here indeed the outline of a whole clothesphilosophy at least the arena it is to work in remark too that the character of the man nowise without meaning in such a matter becomes less enigmatic amid so much tumultuous obscurity almost like diluted madness do not a certain indomitable defiance and yet a boundless reverence seem to loomforth as the two mountainsummits on whose rockstrata all the rest were based and built nay further may we not say that teufelsdrckhs biography allowing it even as suspected only a hieroglyphical truth exhibits a man as it were preappointed for clothesphilosophy to look through the shows of things into things themselves he is led and compelled the passivity given him by birth is fostered by all turns of his fortune everywhere cast out like oil out of water from mingling in any employment in any public communion he has no portion but solitude and a life of meditation the whole energy of his existence is directed through long years on one task that of enduring pain if he cannot cure it thus everywhere do the shows of things oppress him withstand him threaten him with fearfullest destruction only by victoriously penetrating into things themselves can he find peace and a stronghold but is not this same looking through the shows or vestures into the things even the first preliminary to a philosophy of clothes do we not in all this discern some beckonings towards the true higher purport of such a philosophy and what shape it must assume with such a man in such an era perhaps in entering on book third the courteous reader is not utterly without guess whither he is bound nor let us hope for all the fantastic dreamgrottoes through which as is our lot with teufelsdrckh he must wander will there be wanting between whiles some twinkling of a steady polar star book third chapter i incident in modern history as a wonderloving and wonderseeking man teufelsdrckh from an early part of this clothesvolume has more and more exhibited himself striking it was amid all his perverse cloudiness with what force of vision and of heart he pierced into the mystery of the world recognising in the highest sensible phenomena so far as sense went only fresh or faded raiment yet ever under this a celestial essence thereby rendered visible and while on the one hand he trod the old rags of matter with their tinsels into the mire he on the other everywhere exalted spirit above all earthly principalities and powers and worshipped it though under the meanest shapes with a true platonic mysticism what the man ultimately purposed by thus casting his greekfire into the general wardrobe of the universe what such more or less complete rending and burning of garments throughout the whole compass of civilized life and speculation should lead to the rather as he was no adamite in any sense and could not like rousseau recommend either bodily or intellectual nudity and a return to the savage state all this our readers are now bent to discover this is in fact properly the gist and purport of professor teufelsdrckhs philosophy of clothes be it remembered however that such purport is here not so much evolved as detected to lie ready for evolving we are to guide our british friends into the new goldcountry and show them the mines nowise to digout and exhaust its wealth which indeed remains for all time inexhaustible once there let each dig for his own behoof and enrich himself neither in so capricious inexpressible a work as this of the professors can our course now more than formerly be straightforward step by step but at best leap by leap significant indications standout here and there which for the critical eye that looks both widely and narrowly shape themselves into some groundscheme of a whole to select these with judgment so that a leap from one to the other be possible and in our old figure by chaining them together a passable bridge be effected this as heretofore continues our only method among such lightspots the following floating in much wild matter about perfectibility has seemed worth clutching at perhaps the most remarkable incident in modern history says teufelsdrckh is not the diet of worms still less the battle of austerlitz waterloo peterloo or any other battle but an incident passed carelessly over by most historians and treated with some degree of ridicule by others namely george foxs making to himself a suit of leather this man the first of the quakers and by trade a shoemaker was one of those to whom under ruder or purer form the divine idea of the universe is pleased to manifest itself and across all the hulls of ignorance and earthly degradation shine through in unspeakable awfulness unspeakable beauty on their souls who therefore are rightly accounted prophets godpossessed or even gods as in some periods it has chanced sitting in his stall working on tanned hides amid pincers pastehorns rosin swinebristles and a nameless flood of rubbish this youth had nevertheless a living spirit belonging to him also an antique inspired volume through which as through a window it could look upwards and discern its celestial home the task of a daily pair of shoes coupled even with some prospect of victuals and an honourable mastership in cordwainery and perhaps the post of thirdborough in his hundred as the crown of long faithful sewing was nowise satisfaction enough to such a mind but ever amid the boring and hammering came tones from that far country came splendours and terrors for this poor cordwainer as we said was a man and the temple of immensity wherein as man he had been sent to minister was full of holy mystery to him the clergy of the neighbourhood the ordained watchers and interpreters of that same holy mystery listened with unaffected tedium to his consultations and advised him as the solution of such doubts to drink beer and dance with the girls blind leaders of the blind for what end were their tithes levied and eaten for what were their shovelhats scoopedout and their surplices and cassockaprons girton and such a churchrepairing and chaffering and organing and other racketing held over that spot of gods earth if man were but a patent digester and the belly with its adjuncts the grand reality fox turned from them with tears and a sacred scorn back to his leatherparings and his bible mountains of encumbrance higher than tna had been heaped over that spirit but it was a spirit and would not lie buried there through long days and nights of silent agony it struggled and wrestled with a mans force to be free how its prisonmountains heaved and swayed tumultuously as the giant spirit shook them to this hand and that and emerged into the light of heaven that leicester shoeshop had men known it was a holier place than any vatican or lorettoshrine so bandaged and hampered and hemmed in groaned he with thousand requisitions obligations straps tatters and tagrags i can neither see nor move not my own am i but the worlds and time flies fast and heaven is high and hell is deep man bethink thee if thou hast power of thought why not what binds me here want want ha of what will all the shoewages under the moon ferry me across into that far land of light only meditation can and devout prayer to god i will to the woods the hollow of a tree will lodge me wildberries feed me and for clothes cannot i stitch myself one perennial suit of leather historical oilpainting continues teufelsdrckh is one of the arts i never practised therefore shall i not decide whether this subject were easy of execution on the canvas yet often has it seemed to me as if such first outflashing of mans freewill to lighten more and more into day the chaotic night that threatened to engulf him in its hindrances and its horrors were properly the only grandeur there is in history let some living angelo or rosa with seeing eye and understanding heart picture george fox on that morning when he spreadsout his cuttingboard for the last time and cuts cowhides by unwonted patterns and stitches them together into one continuous allincluding case the farewell service of his awl stitch away thou noble fox every prick of that little instrument is pricking into the heart of slavery and worldworship and the mammongod thy elbows jerk and in strong swimmerstrokes and every stroke is bearing thee across the prisonditch within which vanity holds her workhouse and ragfair into lands of true liberty were the work done there is in broad europe one free man and thou art he thus from the lowest depth there is a path to the loftiest height and for the poor also a gospel has been published surely if as dalembert asserts my illustrious namesake diogenes was the greatest man of antiquity only that he wanted decency then by stronger reason is george fox the greatest of the moderns and greater than diogenes himself for he too stands on the adamantine basis of his manhood casting aside all props and shoars yet not in halfsavage pride undervaluing the earth valuing it rather as a place to yield him warmth and food he looks heavenward from his earth and dwells in an element of mercy and worship with a still strength such as the cynics tub did nowise witness great truly was that tub a temple from which mans dignity and divinity was scornfully preached abroad but greater is the leather hull for the same sermon was preached there and not in scorn but in love george foxs perennial suit with all that it held has been worn quite into ashes for nigh two centuries why in a discussion on the perfectibility of society reproduce it now not out of blind sectarian partisanship teufelsdrckh himself is no quaker with all his pacific tendencies did not we see him in that scene at the north cape with the archangel smuggler exhibit firearms for us aware of his deep sansculottism there is more meant in this passage than meets the ear at the same time who can avoid smiling at the earnestness and boeotian simplicity if indeed there be not an underhand satire in it with which that incident is here brought forward and in the professors ambiguous way as clearly perhaps as he durst in weissnichtwo recommended to imitation does teufelsdrckh anticipate that in this age of refinement any considerable class of the community by way of testifying against the mammongod and escaping from what he calls vanitys workhouse and ragfair where doubtless some of them are toiled and whipped and hoodwinked sufficiently will sheathe themselves in closefitting cases of leather the idea is ridiculous in the extreme will majesty lay aside its robes of state and beauty its frills and traingowns for a secondskin of tanned hide by which change huddersfield and manchester and coventry and paisley and the fancybazaar were reduced to hungry solitudes and only day and martin could profit for neither would teufelsdrckhs mad daydream here as we presume covertly intended of levelling society levelling it indeed with a vengeance into one huge drowned marsh and so attaining the political effects of nudity without its frigorific or other consequences be thereby realised would not the rich man purchase a waterproof suit of russia leather and the highborn belle stepforth in red or azure morocco lined with shamoy the black cowhide being left to the drudges and gibeonites of the world and so all the old distinctions be reestablished or has the professor his own deeper intention and laughs in his sleeve at our strictures and glosses which indeed are but a part thereof chapter ii churchclothes not less questionable is his chapter on churchclothes which has the farther distinction of being the shortest in the volume we here translate it entire by churchclothes it need not be premised that i mean infinitely more than cassocks and surplices and do not at all mean the mere haberdasher sunday clothes that men go to church in far from it churchclothes are in our vocabulary the forms the vestures under which men have at various periods embodied and represented for themselves the religious principle that is to say invested the divine idea of the world with a sensible and practically active body so that it might dwell among them as a living and lifegiving word these are unspeakably the most important of all the vestures and garnitures of human existence they are first spun and woven i may say by that wonder of wonders society for it is still only when two or three are gathered together that religion spiritually existent and indeed indestructible however latent in each first outwardly manifests itself as with cloven tongues of fire and seeks to be embodied in a visible communion and church militant mystical more than magical is that communing of soul with soul both looking heavenward here properly soul first speaks with soul for only in looking heavenward take it in what sense you may not in looking earthward does what we can call union mutual love society begin to be possible how true is that of novalis it is certain my belief gains quite infinitely the moment i can convince another mind thereof gaze thou in the face of thy brother in those eyes where plays the lambent fire of kindness or in those where rages the lurid conflagration of anger feel how thy own so quiet soul is straightway involuntarily kindled with the like and ye blaze and reverberate on each other till it is all one limitless confluent flame of embracing love or of deadlygrappling hate and then say what miraculous virtue goes out of man into man but if so through all the thickplied hulls of our earthly life how much more when it is of the divine life we speak and inmost me is as it were brought into contact with inmost me thus was it that i said the churchclothes are first spun and woven by society outward religion originates by society society becomes possible by religion nay perhaps every conceivable society past and present may well be figured as properly and wholly a church in one or other of these three predicaments an audibly preaching and prophesying church which is the best second a church that struggles to preach and prophesy but cannot as yet till its pentecost come and third and worst a church gone dumb with old age or which only mumbles delirium prior to dissolution whoso fancies that by church is here meant chapterhouses and cathedrals or by preaching and prophesying mere speech and chanting let him says the oracular professor read on light of heart getrosten muthes but with regard to your church proper and the churchclothes specially recognised as churchclothes i remark fearlessly enough that without such vestures and sacred tissues society has not existed and will not exist for if government is so to speak the outward skin of the body politic holding the whole together and protecting it and all your craftguilds and associations for industry of hand or of head are the fleshly clothes the muscular and osseous tissues lying under such skin whereby society stands and works then is religion the inmost pericardial and nervous tissue which ministers life and warm circulation to the whole without which pericardial tissue the bones and muscles of industry were inert or animated only by a galvanic vitality the skin would become a shrivelled pelt or fastrotting rawhide and society itself a dead carcass deserving to be buried men were no longer social but gregarious which latter state also could not continue but must gradually issue in universal selfish discord hatred savage isolation and dispersion whereby as we might continue to say the very dust and dead body of society would have evaporated and become abolished such and so allimportant allsustaining are the churchclothes to civilised or even to rational men meanwhile in our era of the world those same churchclothes have gone sorrowfully outatelbows nay far worse many of them have become mere hollow shapes or masks under which no living figure or spirit any longer dwells but only spiders and unclean beetles in horrid accumulation drive their trade and the mask still glares on you with its glasseyes in ghastly affectation of life some generationandhalf after religion has quite withdrawn from it and in unnoticed nooks is weaving for herself new vestures wherewith to reappear and bless us or our sons or grandsons as a priest or interpreter of the holy is the noblest and highest of all men so is a shampriest scheinpriester the falsest and basest neither is it doubtful that his canonicals were they popes tiaras will one day be torn from him to make bandages for the wounds of mankind or even to burn into tinder for general scientific or culinary purposes all which as out of place here falls to be handled in my second volume on the palingenesia or newbirth of society which volume as treating practically of the wear destruction and retexture of spiritual tissues or garments forms properly speaking the transcendental or ultimate portion of this my work on clothes and is already in a state of forwardness and herewith no farther exposition note or commentary being added does teufelsdrckh and must his editor now terminate the singular chapter on churchclothes chapter iii symbols probably it will elucidate the drift of these foregoing obscure utterances if we here insert somewhat of our professors speculations on symbols to state his whole doctrine indeed were beyond our compass nowhere is he more mysterious impalpable than in this of fantasy being the organ of the godlike and how man thereby though based to all seeming on the small visible does nevertheless extend down into the infinite deeps of the invisible of which invisible indeed his life is properly the bodying forth let us omitting these high transcendental aspects of the matter study to glean whether from the paperbags or the printed volume what little seems logical and practical and cunningly arrange it into such degree of coherence as it will assume by way of proem take the following not injudicious remarks the benignant efficacies of concealment cries our professor who shall speak or sing silence and secrecy altars might still be raised to them were this an altarbuilding time for universal worship silence is the element in which great things fashion themselves together that at length they may emerge fullformed and majestic into the daylight of life which they are thenceforth to rule not william the silent only but all the considerable men i have known and the most undiplomatic and unstrategic of these forbore to babble of what they were creating and projecting nay in thy own mean perplexities do thou thyself but hold thy tongue for one day on the morrow how much clearer are thy purposes and duties what wreck and rubbish have those mute workmen within thee swept away when intrusive noises were shut out speech is too often not as the frenchman defined it the art of concealing thought but of quite stifling and suspending thought so that there is none to conceal speech too is great but not the greatest as the swiss inscription says sprechen ist silbern schweigen ist golden speech is silvern silence is golden or as i might rather express it speech is of time silence is of eternity bees will not work except in darkness thought will not work except in silence neither will virtue work except in secrecy let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth neither shalt thou prate even to thy own heart of those secrets known to all is not shame schaam the soil of all virtue of all good manners and good morals like other plants virtue will not grow unless its root be hidden buried from the eye of the sun let the sun shine on it nay do but look at it privily thyself the root withers and no flower will glad thee o my friends when we view the fair clustering flowers that overwreathe for example the marriagebower and encircle mans life with the fragrance and hues of heaven what hand will not smite the foul plunderer that grubs them up by the roots and with grinning grunting satisfaction shows us the dung they flourish in men speak much of the printingpress with its newspapers du himmel what are these to clothes and the tailors goose of kin to the so incalculable influences of concealment and connected with still greater things is the wondrous agency of symbols in a symbol there is concealment and yet revelation here therefore by silence and by speech acting together comes a double significance and if both the speech be itself high and the silence fit and noble how expressive will their union be thus in many a painted device or simple sealemblem the commonest truth standsout to us proclaimed with quite new emphasis for it is here that fantasy with her mystic wonderland plays into the small prose domain of sense and becomes incorporated therewith in the symbol proper what we can call a symbol there is ever more or less distinctly and directly some embodiment and revelation of the infinite the infinite is made to blend itself with the finite to stand visible and as it were attainable there by symbols accordingly is man guided and commanded made happy made wretched he everywhere finds himself encompassed with symbols recognised as such or not recognised the universe is but one vast symbol of god nay if thou wilt have it what is man himself but a symbol of god is not all that he does symbolical a revelation to sense of the mystic godgiven force that is in him a gospel of freedom which he the messias of nature preaches as he can by act and word not a hut he builds but is the visible embodiment of a thought but bears visible record of invisible things but is in the transcendental sense symbolical as well as real man says the professor elsewhere in quite antipodal contrast with these highsoaring delineations which we have here cut short on the verge of the inane man is by birth somewhat of an owl perhaps too of all the owleries that ever possessed him the most owlish if we consider it is that of your actually existing motivemillwrights fantastic tricks enough man has played in his time has fancied himself to be most things down even to an animated heap of glass but to fancy himself a dead ironbalance for weighing pains and pleasures on was reserved for this his latter era there stands he his universe one huge manger filled with hay and thistles to be weighed against each other and looks longeared enough alas poor devil spectres are appointed to haunt him one age he is hagridden bewitched the next priestridden befooled in all ages bedevilled and now the genius of mechanism smothers him worse than any nightmare did till the soul is nigh choked out of him and only a kind of digestive mechanic life remains in earth and in heaven he can see nothing but mechanism has fear for nothing else hope in nothing else the world would indeed grind him to pieces but cannot he fathom the doctrine of motives and cunningly compute these and mechanise them to grind the other way were he not as has been said purblinded by enchantment you had but to bid him open his eyes and look in which country in which time was it hitherto that mans history or the history of any man went on by calculated or calculable motives what make ye of your christianities and chivalries and reformations and marseillese hymns and reigns of terror nay has not perhaps the motivegrinder himself been in love did he never stand so much as a contested election leave him to time and the medicating virtue of nature yes friends elsewhere observes the professor not our logical mensurative faculty but our imaginative one is king over us i might say priest and prophet to lead us heavenward our magician and wizard to lead us hellward nay even for the basest sensualist what is sense but the implement of fantasy the vessel it drinks out of ever in the dullest existence there is a sheen either of inspiration or of madness thou partly hast it in thy choice which of the two that gleamsin from the circumambient eternity and colours with its own hues our little islet of time the understanding is indeed thy window too clear thou canst not make it but fantasy is thy eye with its colourgiving retina healthy or diseased have not i myself known fivehundred living soldiers sabred into crowsmeat for a piece of glazed cotton which they called their flag which had you sold it at any marketcross would not have brought above three groschen did not the whole hungarian nation rise like some tumultuous moonstirred atlantic when kaiser joseph pocketed their iron crown an implement as was sagaciously observed in size and commercial value little differing from a horseshoe it is in and through symbols that man consciously or unconsciously lives works and has his being those ages moreover are accounted the noblest which can the best recognise symbolical worth and prize it the highest for is not a symbol ever to him who has eyes for it some dimmer or clearer revelation of the godlike of symbols however i remark farther that they have both an extrinsic and intrinsic value oftenest the former only what for instance was in that clouted shoe which the peasants bore aloft with them as ensign in their bauernkrieg peasants war or in the walletandstaff round which the netherland gueux glorying in that nickname of beggars heroically rallied and prevailed though against king philip himself intrinsic significance these had none only extrinsic as the accidental standards of multitudes more or less sacredly uniting together in which union itself as above noted there is ever something mystical and borrowing of the godlike under a like category too stand or stood the stupidest heraldic coatsofarms military banners everywhere and generally all national or other sectarian costumes and customs they have no intrinsic necessary divineness or even worth but have acquired an extrinsic one nevertheless through all these there glimmers something of a divine idea as through military banners themselves the divine idea of duty of heroic daring in some instances of freedom of right nay the highest ensign that men ever met and embraced under the cross itself had no meaning save an accidental extrinsic one another matter it is however when your symbol has intrinsic meaning and is of itself fit that men should unite round it let but the godlike manifest itself to sense let but eternity look more or less visibly through the timefigure zeitbild then is it fit that men unite there and worship together before such symbol and so from day to day and from age to age superadd to it new divineness of this latter sort are all true works of art in them if thou know a work of art from a daub of artifice wilt thou discern eternity looking through time the godlike rendered visible here too may an extrinsic value gradually superadd itself thus certain iliads and the like have in threethousand years attained quite new significance but nobler than all in this kind are the lives of heroic godinspired men for what other work of art is so divine in death too in the death of the just as the last perfection of a work of art may we not discern symbolic meaning in that divinely transfigured sleep as of victory resting over the beloved face which now knows thee no more read if thou canst for tears the confluence of time with eternity and some gleam of the latter peering through highest of all symbols are those wherein the artist or poet has risen into prophet and all men can recognise a present god and worship the same i mean religious symbols various enough have been such religious symbols what we call religions as men stood in this stage of culture or the other and could worse or better bodyforth the godlike some symbols with a transient intrinsic worth many with only an extrinsic if thou ask to what height man has carried it in this manner look on our divinest symbol on jesus of nazareth and his life and his biography and what followed therefrom higher has the human thought not yet reached this is christianity and christendom a symbol of quite perennial infinite character whose significance will ever demand to be anew inquired into and anew made manifest but on the whole as time adds much to the sacredness of symbols so likewise in his progress he at length defaces or even desecrates them and symbols like all terrestrial garments wax old homers epos has not ceased to be true yet it is no longer our epos but shines in the distance if clearer and clearer yet also smaller and smaller like a receding star it needs a scientific telescope it needs to be reinterpreted and artificially brought near us before we can so much as know that it was a sun so likewise a day comes when the runic thor with his eddas must withdraw into dimness and many an african mumbojumbo and indian pawaw be utterly abolished for all things even celestial luminaries much more atmospheric meteors have their rise their culmination their decline small is this which thou tellest me that the royal sceptre is but a piece of giltwood that the pyx has become a most foolish box and truly as ancient pistol thought of little price a right conjuror might i name thee couldst thou conjure back into these wooden tools the divine virtue they once held of this thing however be certain wouldst thou plant for eternity then plant into the deep infinite faculties of man his fantasy and heart wouldst thou plant for year and day then plant into his shallow superficial faculties his selflove and arithmetical understanding what will grow there a hierarch therefore and pontiff of the world will we call him the poet and inspired maker who prometheuslike can shape new symbols and bring new fire from heaven to fix it there such too will not always be wanting neither perhaps now are meanwhile as the average of matters goes we account him legislator and wise who can so much as tell when a symbol has grown old and gently remove it when as the last english coronation was preparing concludes this wonderful professor i read in their newspapers that the champion of england he who has to offer battle to the universe for his new king had brought it so far that he could now mount his horse with little assistance i said to myself here also we have a symbol wellnigh superannuated alas move whithersoever you may are not the tatters and rags of superannuated wornout symbols in this ragfair of a world dropping off everywhere to hoodwink to halter to tether you nay if you shake them not aside threatening to accumulate and perhaps produce suffocation that of george iv ed chapter iv helotage at this point we determine on adverting shortly or rather reverting to a certain tract of hofrath heuschreckes entitled institute for the repression of population which lies dishonourable enough with torn leaves and a perceptible smell of aloetic drugs stuffed into the bag pisces not indeed for the sake of the tract itself which we admire little but of the marginal notes evidently in teufelsdrckhs hand which rather copiously fringe it a few of these may be in their right place here into the hofraths institute with its extraordinary schemes and machinery of corresponding boards and the like we shall not so much as glance enough for us to understand that heuschrecke is a disciple of malthus and so zealous for the doctrine that his zeal almost literally eats him up a deadly fear of population possesses the hofrath something like a fixedidea undoubtedly akin to the more diluted forms of madness nowhere in that quarter of his intellectual world is there light nothing but a grim shadow of hunger open mouths opening wider and wider a world to terminate by the frightfullest consummation by its too dense inhabitants famished into delirium universally eating one another to make air for himself in which strangulation choking enough to a benevolent heart the hofrath founds or proposes to found this institute of his as the best he can do it is only with our professors comments thereon that we concern ourselves first then remark that teufelsdrckh as a speculative radical has his own notions about human dignity that the zhdarm palaces and courtesies have not made him forgetful of the futteral cottages on the blank cover of heuschreckes tract we find the following indistinctly engrossed two men i honour and no third first the toilworn craftsman that with earthmade implement laboriously conquers the earth and makes her mans venerable to me is the hard hand crooked coarse wherein notwithstanding lies a cunning virtue indefeasibly royal as of the sceptre of this planet venerable too is the rugged face all weathertanned besoiled with its rude intelligence for it is the face of a man living manlike o but the more venerable for thy rudeness and even because we must pity as well as love thee hardlyentreated brother for us was thy back so bent for us were thy straight limbs and fingers so deformed thou wert our conscript on whom the lot fell and fighting our battles wert so marred for in thee too lay a godcreated form but it was not to be unfolded encrusted must it stand with the thick adhesions and defacements of labour and thy body like thy soul was not to know freedom yet toil on toil on thou art in thy duty be out of it who may thou toilest for the altogether indispensable for daily bread a second man i honour and still more highly him who is seen toiling for the spiritually indispensable not daily bread but the bread of life is not he too in his duty endeavouring towards inward harmony revealing this by act or by word through all his outward endeavours be they high or low highest of all when his outward and his inward endeavour are one when we can name him artist not earthly craftsman only but inspired thinker who with heavenmade implement conquers heaven for us if the poor and humble toil that we have food must not the high and glorious toil for him in return that he have light have guidance freedom immortality these two in all their degrees i honour all else is chaff and dust which let the wind blow whither it listeth unspeakably touching is it however when i find both dignities united and he that must toil outwardly for the lowest of mans wants is also toiling inwardly for the highest sublimer in this world know i nothing than a peasant saint could such now anywhere be met with such a one will take thee back to nazareth itself thou wilt see the splendour of heaven spring forth from the humblest depths of earth like a light shining in great darkness and again it is not because of his toils that i lament for the poor we must all toil or steal howsoever we name our stealing which is worse no faithful workman finds his task a pastime the poor is hungry and athirst but for him also there is food and drink he is heavyladen and weary but for him also the heavens send sleep and of the deepest in his smoky cribs a clear dewy heaven of rest envelops him and fitful glitterings of cloudskirted dreams but what i do mourn over is that the lamp of his soul should go out that no ray of heavenly or even of earthly knowledge should visit him but only in the haggard darkness like two spectres fear and indignation bear him company alas while the body stands so broad and brawny must the soul lie blinded dwarfed stupefied almost annihilated alas was this too a breath of god bestowed in heaven but on earth never to be unfolded that there should one man die ignorant who had capacity for knowledge this i call a tragedy were it to happen more than twenty times in the minute as by some computations it does the miserable fraction of science which our united mankind in a wide universe of nescience has acquired why is not this with all diligence imparted to all quite in an opposite strain is the following the old spartans had a wiser method and went out and hunteddown their helots and speared and spitted them when they grew too numerous with our improved fashions of hunting herr hofrath now after the invention of firearms and standingarmies how much easier were such a hunt perhaps in the most thicklypeopled country some three days annually might suffice to shoot all the ablebodied paupers that had accumulated within the year let governments think of this the expense were trifling nay the very carcasses would pay it have them salted and barrelled could not you victual therewith if not army and navy yet richly such infirm paupers in workhouses and elsewhere as enlightened charity dreading no evil of them might see good to keep alive and yet writes he farther on there must be something wrong a fullformed horse will in any market bring from twenty to as high as twohundred friedrichs dor such is his worth to the world a fullformed man is not only worth nothing to the world but the world could afford him a round sum would he simply engage to go and hang himself nevertheless which of the two was the more cunninglydevised article even as an engine good heavens a white european man standing on his two legs with his two fivefingered hands at his shacklebones and miraculous head on his shoulders is worth i should say from fifty to a hundred horses true thou goldhofrath cries the professor elsewhere too crowded indeed meanwhile what portion of this inconsiderable terraqueous globe have ye actually tilled and delved till it will grow no more how thick stands your population in the pampas and savannas of america round ancient carthage and in the interior of africa on both slopes of the altaic chain in the central platform of asia in spain greece turkey crim tartary the curragh of kildare one man in one year as i have understood it if you lend him earth will feed himself and nine others alas where now are the hengsts and alarics of our stillglowing stillexpanding europe who when their home is grown too narrow will enlist and like firepillars guide onwards those superfluous masses of indomitable living valour equipped not now with the battleaxe and warchariot but with the steamengine and ploughshare where are they preserving their game chapter v the phoenix putting which four singular chapters together and alongside of them numerous hints and even direct utterances scattered over these writings of his we come upon the startling yet not quite unlookedfor conclusion that teufelsdrckh is one of those who consider society properly so called to be as good as extinct and that only the gregarious feelings and old inherited habitudes at this juncture hold us from dispersion and universal national civil domestic and personal war he says expressly for the last three centuries above all for the last three quarters of a century that same pericardial nervous tissue as we named it of religion where lies the lifeessence of society has been smoteat and perforated needfully and needlessly till now it is quite rent into shreds and society long pining diabetic consumptive can be regarded as defunct for those spasmodic galvanic sprawlings are not life neither indeed will they endure galvanise as you may beyond two days call ye that a society cries he again where there is no longer any social idea extant not so much as the idea of a common home but only of a common overcrowded lodginghouse where each isolated regardless of his neighbour turned against his neighbour clutches what he can get and cries mine and calls it peace because in the cutpurse and cutthroat scramble no steel knives but only a far cunninger sort can be employed where friendship communion has become an incredible tradition and your holiest sacramental supper is a smoking tavern dinner with cook for evangelist where your priest has no tongue but for platelicking and your high guides and governors cannot guide but on all hands hear it passionately proclaimed laissez faire leave us alone of your guidance such light is darker than darkness eat you your wages and sleep thus too continues he does an observant eye discern everywhere that saddest spectacle the poor perishing like neglected foundered draughtcattle of hunger and overwork the rich still more wretchedly of idleness satiety and overgrowth the highest in rank at length without honour from the lowest scarcely with a little mouthhonour as from tavernwaiters who expect to put it in the bill oncesacred symbols fluttering as empty pageants whereof men grudge even the expense a world becoming dismantled in one word the church fallen speechless from obesity and apoplexy the state shrunken into a policeoffice straitened to get its pay we might ask are there many observant eyes belonging to practical men in england or elsewhere which have descried these phenomena or is it only from the mystic elevation of a german wahngasse that such wonders are visible teufelsdrckh contends that the aspect of a deceased or expiring society fronts us everywhere so that whoso runs may read what for example says he is the universallyarrogated virtue almost the sole remaining catholic virtue of these days for some half century it has been the thing you name independence suspicion of servility of reverence for superiors the very dogleech is anxious to disavow fools were your superiors worthy to govern and you worthy to obey reverence for them were even your only possible freedom independence in all kinds is rebellion if unjust rebellion why parade it and everywhere prescribe it but what then are we returning as rousseau prayed to the state of nature the soul politic having departed says teufelsdrckh what can follow but that the body politic be decently interred to avoid putrescence liberals economists utilitarians enough i see marching with its bier and chanting loud pans towards the funeralpile where amid wailings from some and saturnalian revelries from the most the venerable corpse is to be burnt or in plain words that these men liberals utilitarians or whatsoever they are called will ultimately carry their point and dissever and destroy most existing institutions of society seems a thing which has some time ago ceased to be doubtful do we not see a little subdivision of the grand utilitarian armament come to light even in insulated england a living nucleus that will attract and grow does at length appear there also and under curious phasis properly as the inconsiderable fagend and so far in the rear of the others as to fancy itself the van our european mechanisers are a sect of boundless diffusion activity and cooperative spirit has not utilitarianism flourished in high places of thought here among ourselves and in every european country at some time or other within the last fifty years if now in all countries except perhaps england it has ceased to flourish or indeed to exist among thinkers and sunk to journalists and the popular mass who sees not that as hereby it no longer preaches so the reason is it now needs no preaching but is in full universal action the doctrine everywhere known and enthusiastically laid to heart the fit pabulum in these times for a certain rugged workshop intellect and heart nowise without their corresponding workshop strength and ferocity it requires but to be stated in such scenes to make proselytes enough admirably calculated for destroying only not for rebuilding it spreads like a sort of dogmadness till the whole worldkennel will be rabid then woe to the huntsmen with or without their whips they should have given the quadrupeds water adds he the water namely of knowledge and of life while it was yet time thus if professor teufelsdrckh can be relied on we are at this hour in a most critical condition beleaguered by that boundless armament of mechanisers and unbelievers threatening to strip us bare the world says he as it needs must is under a process of devastation and waste which whether by silent assiduous corrosion or open quicker combustion as the case chances will effectually enough annihilate the past forms of society replace them with what it may for the present it is contemplated that when mans whole spiritual interests are once divested these innumerable striptoff garments shall mostly be burnt but the sounder rags among them be quilted together into one huge irish watchcoat for the defence of the body only this we think is but jobsnews to the humane reader nevertheless cries teufelsdrckh who can hinder it who is there that can clutch into the wheelspokes of destiny and say to the spirit of the time turn back i command thee wiser were it that we yielded to the inevitable and inexorable and accounted even this the best nay might not an attentive editor drawing his own inferences from what stands written conjecture that teufelsdrckh individually had yielded to this same inevitable and inexorable heartily enough and now sat waiting the issue with his natural diabolicoangelical indifference if not even placidity did we not hear him complain that the world was a huge ragfair and the rags and tatters of old symbols were rainingdown everywhere like to drift him in and suffocate him what with those unhunted helots of his and the uneven sicvosnonvobis pressure and hardcrashing collision he is pleased to discern in existing things what with the so hateful empty masks full of beetles and spiders yet glaring out on him from their glass eyes with a ghastly affectation of life we feel entitled to conclude him even willing that much should be thrown to the devil so it were but done gently safe himself in that pinnacle of weissnichtwo he would consent with a tragic solemnity that the monster utilitaria held back indeed and moderated by noserings halters footshackles and every conceivable modification of rope should go forth to do her work to tread down old ruinous palaces and temples with her broad hoof till the whole were trodden down that new and better might be built remarkable in this point of view are the following sentences society says he is not dead that carcass which you call dead society is but her mortal coil which she has shuffled off to assume a nobler she herself through perpetual metamorphoses in fairer and fairer development has to live till time also merge in eternity wheresoever two or three living men are gathered together there is society or there it will be with its cunning mechanisms and stupendous structures overspreading this little globe and reaching upwards to heaven and downwards to gehenna for always under one or the other figure it has two authentic revelations of a god and of a devil the pulpit namely and the gallows indeed we already heard him speak of religion in unnoticed nooks weaving for herself new vestures teufelsdrckh himself being one of the loomtreadles elsewhere he quotes without censure that strange aphorism of saintsimons concerning which and whom so much were to be said lge dor quune aveugle tradition a plac jusquici dans le pass est devant nous the golden age which a blind tradition has hitherto placed in the past is before us but listen again when the phoenix is fanning her funeral pyre will there not be sparks flying alas some millions of men and among them such as a napoleon have already been licked into that higheddying flame and like moths consumed there still also have we to fear that incautious beards will get singed for the rest in what year of grace such phoenixcremation will be completed you need not ask the law of perseverance is among the deepest in man by nature he hates change seldom will he quit his old house till it has actually fallen about his ears thus have i seen solemnities linger as ceremonies sacred symbols as idlepageants to the extent of threehundred years and more after all life and sacredness had evaporated out of them and then finally what time the phoenix deathbirth itself will require depends on unseen contingencies meanwhile would destiny offer mankind that after say two centuries of convulsion and conflagration more or less vivid the firecreation should be accomplished and we too find ourselves again in a living society and no longer fighting but working were it not perhaps prudent in mankind to strike the bargain thus is teufelsdrckh content that old sick society should be deliberately burnt alas with quite other fuel than spicewood in the faith that she is a phoenix and that a new heavenborn young one will rise out of her ashes we ourselves restricted to the duty of indicator shall forbear commentary meanwhile will not the judicious reader shake his head and reproachfully yet more in sorrow than in anger say or think from a doctor utriusque juris titular professor in a university and man to whom hitherto for his services society bad as she is has given not only food and raiment of a kind but books tobacco and gukguk we expected more gratitude to his benefactress and less of a blind trust in the future which resembles that rather of a philosophical fatalist and enthusiast than of a solid householder paying scotandlot in a christian country chapter vi old clothes as mentioned above teufelsdrckh though a sansculottist is in practice probably the politest man extant his whole heart and life are penetrated and informed with the spirit of politeness a noble natural courtesy shines through him beautifying his vagaries like sunlight making a rosyfingered rainbowdyed aurora out of mere aqueous clouds nay brightening londonsmoke itself into gold vapour as from the crucible of an alchemist hear in what earnest though fantastic wise he expresses himself on this head shall courtesy be done only to the rich and only by the rich in goodbreeding which differs if at all from highbreeding only as it gracefully remembers the rights of others rather than gracefully insists on its own rights i discern no special connexion with wealth or birth but rather that it lies in human nature itself and is due from all men towards all men of a truth were your schoolmaster at his post and worth anything when there this with so much else would be reformed nay each man were then also his neighbours schoolmaster till at length a rudevisaged unmannered peasant could no more be met with than a peasant unacquainted with botanical physiology or who felt not that the clod he broke was created in heaven for whether thou bear a sceptre or a sledgehammer art thou not alive is not this thy brother alive there is but one temple in the world says novalis and that temple is the body of man nothing is holier than this high form bending before men is a reverence done to this revelation in the flesh we touch heaven when we lay our hands on a human body on which ground i would fain carry it farther than most do and whereas the english johnson only bowed to every clergyman or man with a shovelhat i would bow to every man with any sort of hat or with no hat whatever is not he a temple then the visible manifestation and impersonation of the divinity and yet alas such indiscriminate bowing serves not for there is a devil dwells in man as well as a divinity and too often the bow is but pocketed by the former it would go to the pocket of vanity which is your clearest phasis of the devil in these times therefore must we withhold it the gladder am i on the other hand to do reverence to those shells and outer husks of the body wherein no devilish passion any longer lodges but only the pure emblem and effigies of man i mean to empty or even to cast clothes nay is it not to clothes that most men do reverence to the fine frogged broadcloth nowise to the straddling animal with bandy legs which it holds and makes a dignitary of who ever saw any lord mylorded in tattered blanket fastened with wooden skewer nevertheless i say there is in such worship a shade of hypocrisy a practical deception for how often does the body appropriate what was meant for the cloth only whoso would avoid falsehood which is the essence of all sin will perhaps see good to take a different course that reverence which cannot act without obstruction and perversion when the clothes are full may have free course when they are empty even as for hindoo worshippers the pagoda is not less sacred than the god so do i too worship the hollow cloth garment with equal fervour as when it contained the man nay with more for i now fear no deception of myself or of others did not king toomtabard or in other words john baliol reign long over scotland the man john baliol being quite gone and only the toom tabard empty gown remaining what still dignity dwells in a suit of cast clothes how meekly it bears its honours no haughty looks no scornful gesture silent and serene it fronts the world neither demanding worship nor afraid to miss it the hat still carries the physiognomy of its head but the vanity and the stupidity and goosespeech which was the sign of these two are gone the coatarm is stretched out but not to strike the breeches in modest simplicity depend at ease and now at last have a graceful flow the waistcoat hides no evil passion no riotous desire hunger or thirst now dwells not in it thus all is purged from the grossness of sense from the carking cares and foul vices of the world and rides there on its clotheshorse as on a pegasus might some skyey messenger or purified apparition visiting our low earth often while i sojourned in that monstrous tuberosity of civilised life the capital of england and meditated and questioned destiny under that inksea of vapour black thick and multifarious as spartan broth and was one lone soul amid those grinding millions often have i turned into their oldclothes market to worship with awestruck heart i walk through that monmouth street with its empty suits as through a sanhedrim of stainless ghosts silent are they but expressive in their silence the past witnesses and instruments of woe and joy of passions virtues crimes and all the fathomless tumult of good and evil in the prison men call life friends trust not the heart of that man for whom old clothes are not venerable watch too with reverence that bearded jewish highpriest who with hoarse voice like some angel of doom summons them from the four winds on his head like the pope he has three hats a real triple tiara on either hand are the similitude of wings whereon the summoned garments come to alight and ever as he slowly cleaves the air sounds forth his deep fateful note as if through a trumpet he were proclaiming ghosts of life come to judgment reck not ye fluttering ghosts he will purify you in his purgatory with fire and with water and one day newcreated ye shall reappear o let him in whom the flame of devotion is ready to go out who has never worshipped and knows not what to worship pace and repace with austerest thought the pavement of monmouth street and say whether his heart and his eyes still continue dry if field lane with its long fluttering rows of yellow handkerchiefs be a dionysius ear where in stifled jarring hubbub we hear the indictment which poverty and vice bring against lazy wealth that it has left them there castout and trodden under foot of want darkness and the devil then is monmouth street a mirzas hill where in motley vision the whole pageant of existence passes awfully before us with its wail and jubilee mad loves and mad hatreds churchbells and gallowsropes farcetragedy beastgodhood the bedlam of creation to most men as it does to ourselves all this will seem overcharged we too have walked through monmouth street but with little feeling of devotion probably in part because the contemplative process is so fatally broken in upon by the brood of moneychangers who nestle in that church and importune the worshipper with merely secular proposals whereas teufelsdrckh might be in that happy middle state which leaves to the clothesbroker no hope either of sale or of purchase and so be allowed to linger there without molestation something we would have given to see the little philosophical figure with its steeplehat and loose flowing skirts and eyes in a fine frenzy pacing and repacing in austerest thought that foolish street which to him was a true delphic avenue and supernatural whisperinggallery where the ghosts of life rounded strange secrets in his ear o thou philosophic teufelsdrckh that listenest while others only gabble and with thy quick tympanum hearest the grass grow at the same time is it not strange that in paperbag documents destined for an english work there exists nothing like an authentic diary of this his sojourn in london and of his meditations among the clothesshops only the obscurest emblematic shadows neither in conversation for indeed he was not a man to pester you with his travels have we heard him more than allude to the subject for the rest however it cannot be uninteresting that we here find how early the significance of clothes had dawned on the now so distinguished clothesprofessor might we but fancy it to have been even in monmouth street at the bottom of our own english inksea that this remarkable volume first took being and shot forth its salient point in his soul as in chaos did the egg of eros one day to be hatched into a universe chapter vii organic filaments for us who happen to live while the worldphoenix is burning herself and burning so slowly that as teufelsdrckh calculates it were a handsome bargain would she engage to have done within two centuries there seems to lie but an ashy prospect not altogether so however does the professor figure it in the living subject says he change is wont to be gradual thus while the serpent sheds its old skin the new is already formed beneath little knowest thou of the burning of a worldphoenix who fanciest that she must first burnout and lie as a dead cinereous heap and therefrom the young one startup by miracle and fly heavenward far otherwise in that firewhirlwind creation and destruction proceed together ever as the ashes of the old are blown about do organic filaments of the new mysteriously spin themselves and amid the rushing and the waving of the whirlwindelement come tones of a melodious deathsong which end not but in tones of a more melodious birthsong nay look into the firewhirlwind with thy own eyes and thou wilt see let us actually look then to poor individuals who cannot expect to live two centuries those same organic filaments mysteriously spinning themselves will be the best part of the spectacle first therefore this of mankind in general in vain thou deniest it says the professor thou art my brother thy very hatred thy very envy those foolish lies thou tellest of me in thy splenetic humour what is all this but an inverted sympathy were i a steamengine wouldst thou take the trouble to tell lies of me not thou i should grind all unheeded whether badly or well wondrous truly are the bonds that unite us one and all whether by the soft binding of love or the iron chaining of necessity as we like to choose it more than once have i said to myself of some perhaps whimsically strutting figure such as provokes whimsical thoughts wert thou my little brotherkin suddenly coveredup within the largest imaginable glassbell what a thing it were not for thyself only but for the world post letters more or fewer from all the four winds impinge against thy glass walls but have to drop unread neither from within comes there question or response into any postbag thy thoughts fall into no friendly ear or heart thy manufacture into no purchasing hand thou art no

by which all things the minutest that he does minutely influence all men and the very look of his face blesses or curses whomso it lights on and so generates ever new blessing or new cursing all this you cannot see but only imagine i say there is not a red indian hunting by lake winnipic can quarrel with his squaw but the whole world must smart for it will not the price of beaver rise it is a mathematical fact that the casting of this pebble from my hand alters the centre of gravity of the universe if now an existing generation of men stand so woven together not less indissolubly does generation with generation hast thou ever meditated on that word tradition how we inherit not life only but all the garniture and form of life and work and speak and even think and feel as our fathers and primeval grandfathers from the beginning have given it us who printed thee for example this unpretending volume on the philosophy of clothes not the herren stillschweigen and company but cadmus of thebes faust of mentz and innumerable others whom thou knowest not had there been no moesogothic ulfila there had been no english shakspeare or a different one simpleton it was tubalcain that made thy very tailors needle and sewed that courtsuit of thine yes truly if nature is one and a living indivisible whole much more is mankind the image that reflects and creates nature without which nature were not as palpable lifestreams in that wondrous individual mankind among so many lifestreams that are not palpable flow on those maincurrents of what we call opinion as preserved in institutions polities churches above all in books beautiful it is to understand and know that a thought did never yet die that as thou the originator thereof hast gathered it and created it from the whole past so thou wilt transmit it to the whole future it is thus that the heroic heart the seeing eye of the first times still feels and sees in us of the latest that the wise man stands ever encompassed and spiritually embraced by a cloud of witnesses and brothers and there is a living literal communion of saints wide as the world itself and as the history of the world noteworthy also and serviceable for the progress of this same individual wilt thou find his subdivision into generations generations are as the days of toilsome mankind death and birth are the vesper and the matin bells that summon mankind to sleep and to rise refreshed for new advancement what the father has made the son can make and enjoy but has also work of his own appointed him thus all things wax and roll onwards arts establishments opinions nothing is completed but ever completing newton has learned to see what kepler saw but there is also a fresh heavenderived force in newton he must mount to still higher points of vision so too the hebrew lawgiver is in due time followed by an apostle of the gentiles in the business of destruction as this also is from time to time a necessary work thou findest a like sequence and perseverance for luther it was as yet hot enough to stand by that burning of the popes bull voltaire could not warm himself at the glimmering ashes but required quite other fuel thus likewise i note the english whig has in the second generation become an english radical who in the third again it is to be hoped will become an english rebuilder find mankind where thou wilt thou findest it in living movement in progress faster or slower the phoenix soars aloft hovers with outstretched wings filling earth with her music or as now she sinks and with spheral swansong immolates herself in flame that she may soar the higher and sing the clearer let the friends of social order in such a disastrous period lay this to heart and derive from it any little comfort they can we subjoin another passage concerning titles remark not without surprise says teufelsdrckh how all high titles of honour come hitherto from fighting your herzog duke dux is leader of armies your earl jarl is strong man your marshal cavalry horseshoer a millennium or reign of peace and wisdom having from of old been prophesied and becoming now daily more and more indubitable may it not be apprehended that such fightingtitles will cease to be palatable and new and higher need to be devised the only title wherein i with confidence trace eternity is that of king knig king anciently knning means kenning cunning or which is the same thing canning ever must the sovereign of mankind be fitly entitled king well also says he elsewhere was it written by theologians a king rules by divine right he carries in him an authority from god or man will never give it him can i choose my own king i can choose my own king popinjay and play what farce or tragedy i may with him but he who is to be my ruler whose will is to be higher than my will was chosen for me in heaven neither except in such obedience to the heavenchosen is freedom so much as conceivable the editor will here admit that among all the wondrous provinces of teufelsdrckhs spiritual world there is none he walks in with such astonishment hesitation and even pain as in the political how with our english love of ministry and opposition and that generous conflict of parties mind warming itself against mind in their mutual wrestle for the public good by which wrestle indeed is our invaluable constitution kept warm and alive how shall we domesticate ourselves in this spectral necropolis or rather city both of the dead and of the unborn where the present seems little other than an inconsiderable film dividing the past and the future in those dim longdrawn expanses all is so immeasurable much so disastrous ghastly your very radiances and straggling lightbeams have a supernatural character and then with such an indifference such a prophetic peacefulness accounting the inevitably coming as already here to him all one whether it be distant by centuries or only by days does he sit and live you would say rather in any other age than in his own it is our painful duty to announce or repeat that looking into this man we discern a deep silent slowburning inextinguishable radicalism such as fills us with shuddering admiration thus for example he appears to make little even of the elective franchise at least so we interpret the following satisfy yourselves he says by universal indubitable experiment even as ye are now doing or will do whether freedom heavenborn and leading heavenward and so vitally essential for us all cannot peradventure be mechanically hatched and brought to light in that same ballotbox of yours or at worst in some other discoverable or devisable box edifice or steammechanism it were a mighty convenience and beyond all feats of manufacture witnessed hitherto is teufelsdrckh acquainted with the british constitution even slightly he says under another figure but after all were the problem as indeed it now everywhere is to rebuild your old house from the top downwards since you must live in it the while what better what other than the representative machine will serve your turn meanwhile however mock me not with the name of free when you have but knitup my chains into ornamental festoons or what will any member of the peace society make of such an assertion as this the lower people everywhere desire war not so unwisely there is then a demand for lower people to be shot gladly therefore do we emerge from those soulconfusing labyrinths of speculative radicalism into somewhat clearer regions here looking round as was our hest for organic filaments we ask may not this touching heroworship be of the number it seems of a cheerful character yet so quaint so mystical one knows not what or how little may lie under it our readers shall look with their own eyes true is it that in these days man can do almost all things only not obey true likewise that whoso cannot obey cannot be free still less bear rule he that is the inferior of nothing can be the superior of nothing the equal of nothing nevertheless believe not that man has lost his faculty of reverence that if it slumber in him it has gone dead painful for man is that same rebellious independence when it has become inevitable only in loving companionship with his fellows does he feel safe only in reverently bowing down before the higher does he feel himself exalted or what if the character of our so troublous era lay even in this that man had forever cast away fear which is the lower but not yet risen into perennial reverence which is the higher and highest meanwhile observe with joy so cunningly has nature ordered it that whatsoever man ought to obey he cannot but obey before no faintest revelation of the godlike did he ever stand irreverent least of all when the godlike showed itself revealed in his fellowman thus is there a true religious loyalty forever rooted in his heart nay in all ages even in ours it manifests itself as a more or less orthodox heroworship in which fact that heroworship exists has existed and will forever exist universally among mankind mayest thou discern the cornerstone of livingrock whereon all polities for the remotest time may stand secure do our readers discern any such cornerstone or even so much as what teufelsdrckh is looking at he exclaims or hast thou forgotten paris and voltaire how the aged withered man though but a sceptic mocker and millinery courtpoet yet because even he seemed the wisest best could drag mankind at his chariotwheels so that princes coveted a smile from him and the loveliest of france would have laid their hair beneath his feet all paris was one vast temple of heroworship though their divinity moreover was of feature too apish but if such things continues he were done in the dry tree what will be done in the green if in the most parched season of mans history in the most parched spot of europe when parisian life was at best but a scientific hortus siccus bedizened with some italian gumflowers such virtue could come out of it what is to be looked for when life again waves leafy and bloomy and your herodivinity shall have nothing apelike but be wholly human know that there is in man a quite indestructible reverence for whatsoever holds of heaven or even plausibly counterfeits such holding show the dullest clodpole show the haughtiest featherhead that a soul higher than himself is actually here were his knees stiffened into brass he must down and worship organic filaments of a more authentic sort mysteriously spinning themselves some will perhaps discover in the following passage there is no church sayest thou the voice of prophecy has gone dumb this is even what i dispute but in any case hast thou not still preaching enough a preaching friar settles himself in every village and builds a pulpit which he calls newspaper therefrom he preaches what most momentous doctrine is in him for mans salvation and dost not thou listen and believe look well thou seest everywhere a new clergy of the mendicant orders some barefooted some almost barebacked fashion itself into shape and teach and preach zealously enough for copper alms and the love of god these break in pieces the ancient idols and though themselves too often reprobate as idolbreakers are wont to be mark out the sites of new churches where the true godordained that are to follow may find audience and minister said i not before the old skin was shed the new had formed itself beneath it perhaps also in the following wherewith we now hasten to knitup this ravelled sleeve but there is no religion reiterates the professor fool i tell thee there is hast thou well considered all that lies in this immeasurable frothocean we name literature fragments of a genuine churchhomiletic lie scattered there which time will assort nay fractions even of a liturgy could i point out and knowest thou no prophet even in the vesture environment and dialect of this age none to whom the godlike had revealed itself through all meanest and highest forms of the common and by him been again prophetically revealed in whose inspired melody even in these raggathering and ragburning days mans life again begins were it but afar off to be divine knowest thou none such i know him and name him goethe but thou as yet standest in no temple joinest in no psalmworship feelest well that where there is no ministering priest the people perish be of comfort thou art not alone if thou have faith spake we not of a communion of saints unseen yet not unreal accompanying and brotherlike embracing thee so thou be worthy their heroic sufferings rise up melodiously together to heaven out of all lands and out of all times as a sacred miserere their heroic actions also as a boundless everlasting psalm of triumph neither say that thou hast now no symbol of the godlike is not gods universe a symbol of the godlike is not immensity a temple is not mans history and mens history a perpetual evangel listen and for organmusic thou wilt ever as of old hear the morning stars sing together chapter viii natural supernaturalism it is in his stupendous section headed natural supernaturalism that the professor first becomes a seer and after long effort such as we have witnessed finally subdues under his feet this refractory clothesphilosophy and takes victorious possession thereof phantasms enough he has had to struggle with clothwebs and cobwebs of imperial mantles superannuated symbols and what not yet still did he courageously pierce through nay worst of all two quite mysterious worldembracing phantasms time and space have ever hovered round him perplexing and bewildering but with these also he now resolutely grapples these also he victoriously rends asunder in a word he has looked fixedly on existence till one after the other its earthly hulls and garnitures have all melted away and now to his rapt vision the interior celestial holy of holies lies disclosed here therefore properly it is that the philosophy of clothes attains to transcendentalism this last leap can we but clear it takes us safe into the promised land where palingenesia in all senses may be considered as beginning courage then may our diogenes exclaim with better right than diogenes the first once did this stupendous section we after long painful meditation have found not to be unintelligible but on the contrary to grow clear nay radiant and allilluminating let the reader turning on it what utmost force of speculative intellect is in him do his part as we by judicious selection and adjustment shall study to do ours deep has been and is the significance of miracles thus quietly begins the professor far deeper perhaps than we imagine meanwhile the question of questions were what specially is a miracle to that dutch king of siam an icicle had been a miracle whoso had carried with him an airpump and vial of vitriolic ether might have worked a miracle to my horse again who unhappily is still more unscientific do not i work a miracle and magical open sesame every time i please to pay twopence and open for him an impassable schlagbaum or shut turnpike but is not a real miracle simply a violation of the laws of nature ask several whom i answer by this new question what are the laws of nature to me perhaps the rising of one from the dead were no violation of these laws but a confirmation were some far deeper law now first penetrated into and by spiritual force even as the rest have all been brought to bear on us with its material force here too may some inquire not without astonishment on what ground shall one that can make iron swim come and declare that therefore he can teach religion to us truly of the nineteenth century such declaration were inept enough which nevertheless to our fathers of the first century was full of meaning but is it not the deepest law of nature that she be constant cries an illuminated class is not the machine of the universe fixed to move by unalterable rules probable enough good friends nay i too must believe that the god whom ancient inspired men assert to be without variableness or shadow of turning does indeed never change that nature that the universe which no one whom it so pleases can be prevented from calling a machine does move by the most unalterable rules and now of you too i make the old inquiry what those same unalterable rules forming the complete statutebook of nature may possibly be they stand written in our works of science say you in the accumulated records of mans experience was man with his experience present at the creation then to see how it all went on have any deepest scientific individuals yet diveddown to the foundations of the universe and gauged everything there did the maker take them into his counsel that they read his groundplan of the incomprehensible all and can say this stands marked therein and no more than this alas not in anywise these scientific individuals have been nowhere but where we also are have seen some handbreadths deeper than we see into the deep that is infinite without bottom as without shore laplaces book on the stars wherein he exhibits that certain planets with their satellites gyrate round our worthy sun at a rate and in a course which by greatest good fortune he and the like of him have succeeded in detecting is to me as precious as to another but is this what thou namest mechanism of the heavens and system of the world this wherein sirius and the pleiades and all herschels fifteenthousand suns per minute being left out some paltry handful of moons and inert balls had been looked at nicknamed and marked in the zodiacal waybill so that we can now prate of their whereabout their how their why their what being hid from us as in the signless inane system of nature to the wisest man wide as is his vision nature remains of quite infinite depth of quite infinite expansion and all experience thereof limits itself to some few computed centuries and measured squaremiles the course of natures phases on this our little fraction of a planet is partially known to us but who knows what deeper courses these depend on what infinitely larger cycle of causes our little epicycle revolves on to the minnow every cranny and pebble and quality and accident of its little native creek may have become familiar but does the minnow understand the ocean tides and periodic currents the tradewinds and monsoons and moons eclipses by all which the condition of its little creek is regulated and may from time to time unmiraculously enough be quite overset and reversed such a minnow is man his creek this planet earth his ocean the immeasurable all his monsoons and periodic currents the mysterious course of providence through ons of ons we speak of the volume of nature and truly a volume it is whose author and writer is god to read it dost thou does man so much as well know the alphabet thereof with its words sentences and grand descriptive pages poetical and philosophical spread out through solar systems and thousands of years we shall not try thee it is a volume written in celestial hieroglyphs in the true sacredwriting of which even prophets are happy that they can read here a line and there a line as for your institutes and academies of science they strive bravely and from amid the thickcrowded inextricably intertwisted hieroglyphic writing pickout by dextrous combination some letters in the vulgar character and therefrom put together this and the other economic recipe of high avail in practice that nature is more than some boundless volume of such recipes or huge wellnigh inexhaustible domesticcookery book of which the whole secret will in this manner one day evolve itself the fewest dream custom continues the professor doth make dotards of us all consider well thou wilt find that custom is the greatest of weavers and weaves airraiment for all the spirits of the universe whereby indeed these dwell with us visibly as ministering servants in our houses and workshops but their spiritual nature becomes to the most forever hidden philosophy complains that custom has hoodwinked us from the first that we do everything by custom even believe by it that our very axioms let us boast of freethinking as we may are oftenest simply such beliefs as we have never heard questioned nay what is philosophy throughout but a continual battle against custom an everrenewed effort to transcend the sphere of blind custom and so become transcendental innumerable are the illusions and legerdemaintricks of custom but of all these perhaps the cleverest is her knack of persuading us that the miraculous by simple repetition ceases to be miraculous true it is by this means we live for man must work as well as wonder and herein is custom so far a kind nurse guiding him to his true benefit but she is a fond foolish nurse or rather we are false foolish nurslings when in our resting and reflecting hours we prolong the same deception am i to view the stupendous with stupid indifference because i have seen it twice or twohundred or twomillion times there is no reason in nature or in art why i should unless indeed i am a mere workmachine for whom the divine gift of thought were no other than the terrestrial gift of steam is to the steamengine a power whereby cotton might be spun and money and moneys worth realised notable enough too here as elsewhere wilt thou find the potency of names which indeed are but one kind of such customwoven wonderhiding garments witchcraft and all manner of spectrework and demonology we have now named madness and diseases of the nerves seldom reflecting that still the new question comes upon us what is madness what are nerves ever as before does madness remain a mysteriousterrific altogether infernal boilingup of the nether chaotic deep through this fairpainted vision of creation which swims thereon which we name the real was luthers picture of the devil less a reality whether it were formed within the bodily eye or without it in every the wisest soul lies a whole world of internal madness an authentic demon empire out of which indeed his world of wisdom has been creatively built together and now rests there as on its dark foundations does a habitable flowery earthrind but deepest of all illusory appearances for hiding wonder as for many other ends are your two grand fundamental worldenveloping appearances space and time these as spun and woven for us from before birth itself to clothe our celestial me for dwelling here and yet to blind it lie all embracing as the universal canvas or warp and woof whereby all minor illusions in this phantasm existence weave and paint themselves in vain while here on earth shall you endeavour to strip them off you can at best but rend them asunder for moments and look through fortunatus had a wishing hat which when he put on and wished himself anywhere behold he was there by this means had fortunatus triumphed over space he had annihilated space for him there was no where but all was here were a hatter to establish himself in the wahngasse of weissnichtwo and make felts of this sort for all mankind what a world we should have of it still stranger should on the opposite side of the street another hatter establish himself and as his fellowcraftsman made spaceannihilating hats make timeannihilating of both would i purchase were it with my last groschen but chiefly of this latter to clapon your felt and simply by wishing that you were anywhere straightway to be there next to clapon your other felt and simply by wishing that you were anywhen straightway to be then this were indeed the grander shooting at will from the firecreation of the world to its fireconsummation here historically present in the first century conversing face to face with paul and seneca there prophetically in the thirtyfirst conversing also face to face with other pauls and senecas who as yet stand hidden in the depth of that late time or thinkest thou it were impossible unimaginable is the past annihilated then or only past is the future nonextant or only future those mystic faculties of thine memory and hope already answer already through those mystic avenues thou the earthblinded summonest both past and future and communest with them though as yet darkly and with mute beckonings the curtains of yesterday drop down the curtains of tomorrow roll up but yesterday and tomorrow both are pierce through the timeelement glance into the eternal believe what thou findest written in the sanctuaries of mans soul even as all thinkers in all ages have devoutly read it there that time and space are not god but creations of god that with god as it is a universal here so is it an everlasting now and seest thou therein any glimpse of immortality o heaven is the white tomb of our loved one who died from our arms and had to be left behind us there which rises in the distance like a pale mournfully receding milestone to tell how many toilsome uncheered miles we have journeyed on alone but a pale spectral illusion is the lost friend still mysteriously here even as we are here mysteriously with god know of a truth that only the timeshadows have perished or are perishable that the real being of whatever was and whatever is and whatever will be is even now and forever this should it unhappily seem new thou mayest ponder at thy leisure for the next twenty years or the next twenty centuries believe it thou must understand it thou canst not that the thoughtforms space and time wherein once for all we are sent into this earth to live should condition and determine our whole practical reasonings conceptions and imagines or imaginings seems altogether fit just and unavoidable but that they should furthermore usurp such sway over pure spiritual meditation and blind us to the wonder everywhere lying close on us seems nowise so admit space and time to their due rank as forms of thought nay even if thou wilt to their quite undue rank of realities and consider then with thyself how their thin disguises hide from us the brightest godeffulgences thus were it not miraculous could i stretch forth my hand and clutch the sun yet thou seest me daily stretch forth my hand and therewith clutch many a thing and swing it hither and thither art thou a grown baby then to fancy that the miracle lies in miles of distance or in pounds avoirdupois of weight and not to see that the true inexplicable godrevealing miracle lies in this that i can stretch forth my hand at all that i have free force to clutch aught therewith innumerable other of this sort are the deceptions and wonderhiding stupefactions which space practises on us still worse is it with regard to time your grand antimagician and universal wonderhider is this same lying time had we but the timeannihilating hat to put on for once only we should see ourselves in a world of miracles wherein all fabled or authentic thaumaturgy and feats of magic were outdone but unhappily we have not such a hat and man poor fool that he is can seldom and scantily help himself without one were it not wonderful for instance had orpheus or amphion built the walls of thebes by the mere sound of his lyre yet tell me who built these walls of weissnichtwo summoningout all the sandstone rocks to dance along from the steinbruch now a huge troglodyte chasm with frightful greenmantled pools and shape themselves into doric and ionic pillars squared ashlar houses and noble streets was it not the still higher orpheus or orpheuses who in past centuries by the divine music of wisdom succeeded in civilising man our highest orpheus walked in judea eighteen hundred years ago his spheremelody flowing in wild native tones took captive the ravished souls of men and being of a truth spheremelody still flows and sounds though now with thousandfold accompaniments and rich symphonies through all our hearts and modulates and divinely leads them is that a wonder which happens in two hours and does it cease to be wonderful if happening in two million not only was thebes built by the music of an orpheus but without the music of some inspired orpheus was no city ever built no work that man gloriesin ever done sweep away the illusion of time glance if thou hast eyes from the near movingcause to its fardistant mover the stroke that came transmitted through a whole galaxy of elastic balls was it less a stroke than if the last ball only had been struck and sent flying o could i with the timeannihilating hat transport thee direct from the beginnings to the endings how were thy eyesight unsealed and thy heart set flaming in the lightsea of celestial wonder then sawest thou that this fair universe were it in the meanest province thereof is in very deed the stardomed city of god that through every star through every grassblade and most through every living soul the glory of a present god still beams but nature which is the timevesture of god and reveals him to the wise hides him from the foolish again could anything be more miraculous than an actual authentic ghost the english johnson longed all his life to see one but could not though he went to cock lane and thence to the churchvaults and tapped on coffins foolish doctor did he never with the minds eye as well as with the bodys look round him into that full tide of human life he so loved did he never so much as look into himself the good doctor was a ghost as actual and authentic as heart could wish wellnigh a million of ghosts were travelling the streets by his side once more i say sweep away the illusion of time compress the threescore years into three minutes what else was he what else are we are we not spirits that are shaped into a body into an appearance and that fadeaway again into air and invisibility this is no metaphor it is a simple scientific fact we start out of nothingness take figure and are apparitions round us as round the veriest spectre is eternity and to eternity minutes are as years and ons come there not tones of love and faith as from celestial harpstrings like the song of beautified souls and again do not we squeak and jibber in our discordant screechowlish debatings and recriminatings and glide bodeful and feeble and fearful or uproar poltern and revel in our mad dance of the dead till the scent of the morning air summons us to our still home and dreamy night becomes awake and day where now is alexander of macedon does the steel host that yelled in fierce battleshouts at issus and arbela remain behind him or have they all vanished utterly even as perturbed goblins must napoleon too and his moscow retreats and austerlitz campaigns was it all other than the veriest spectrehunt which has now with its howling tumult that made night hideous flitted away ghosts there are nigh a thousandmillion walking the earth openly at noontide some halfhundred have vanished from it some halfhundred have arisen in it ere thy watch ticks once o heaven it is mysterious it is awful to consider that we not only carry each a future ghost within him but are in very deed ghosts these limbs whence had we them this stormy force this lifeblood with its burning passion they are dust and shadow a shadowsystem gathered round our me wherein through some moments or years the divine essence is to be revealed in the flesh that warrior on his strong warhorse fire flashes through his eyes force dwells in his arm and heart but warrior and warhorse are a vision a revealed force nothing more stately they tread the earth as if it were a firm substance fool the earth is but a film it cracks in twain and warrior and warhorse sink beyond plummets sounding plummets fantasy herself will not follow them a little while ago they were not a little while and they are not their very ashes are not so has it been from the beginning so will it be to the end generation after generation takes to itself the form of a body and forthissuing from cimmerian night on heavens mission appears what force and fire is in each he expends one grinding in the mill of industry one hunterlike climbing the giddy alpine heights of science one madly dashed in pieces on the rocks of strife in war with his fellow and then the heavensent is recalled his earthly vesture falls away and soon even to sense becomes a vanished shadow thus like some wildflaming wildthundering train of heavens artillery does this mysterious mankind thunder and flame in longdrawn quicksucceeding grandeur through the unknown deep thus like a godcreated firebreathing spirithost we emerge from the inane haste stormfully across the astonished earth then plunge again into the inane earths mountains are levelled and her seas filled up in our passage can the earth which is but dead and a vision resist spirits which have reality and are alive on the hardest adamant some footprint of us is stampedin the last rear of the host will read traces of the earliest van but whence o heaven whither sense knows not faith knows not only that it is through mystery to mystery from god and to god we are such stuff as dreams are made of and our little life is rounded with a sleep chapter ix circumspective here then arises the so momentous question have many british readers actually arrived with us at the new promised country is the philosophy of clothes now at last opening around them long and adventurous has the journey been from those outmost vulgar palpable woollenhulls of man through his wondrous fleshgarments and his wondrous social garnitures inwards to the garments of his very souls soul to time and space themselves and now does the spiritual eternal essence of man and of mankind bared of such wrappages begin in any measure to reveal itself can many readers discern as through a glass darkly in huge wavering outlines some primeval rudiments of mans being what is changeable divided from what is unchangeable does that earthspirits speech in faust tis thus at the roaring loom of time i ply and weave for god the garment thou seest him by or that other thousandtimes repeated speech of the magician shakspeare and like the baseless fabric of this vision the cloudcapt towers the gorgeous palaces the solemn temples the great globe itself and all which it inherit shall dissolve and like this unsubstantial pageant faded leave not a wrack behind begin to have some meaning for us in a word do we at length stand safe in the far region of poetic creation and palingenesia where that phoenix deathbirth of human society and of all human things appears possible is seen to be inevitable along this most insufficient unheardof bridge which the editor by heavens blessing has now seen himself enabled to conclude if not complete it cannot be his sober calculation but only his fond hope that many have travelled without accident no firm arch overspanning the impassable with paved highway could the editor construct only as was said some zigzag series of rafts floating tumultuously thereon alas and the leaps from raft to raft were too often of a breakneck character the darkness the nature of the element all was against us nevertheless may not here and there one of a thousand provided with a discursiveness of intellect rare in our day have cleared the passage in spite of all happy few little band of friends be welcome be of courage by degrees the eye grows accustomed to its new whereabout the hand can stretch itself forth to work there it is in this grand and indeed highest work of palingenesia that ye shall labour each according to ability new labourers will arrive new bridges will be built nay may not our own poor ropeandraft bridge in your passings and repassings be mended in many a point till it grow quite firm passable even for the halt meanwhile of the innumerable multitude that started with us joyous and full of hope where now is the innumerable remainder whom we see no longer by our side the most have recoiled and stand gazing afar off in unsympathetic astonishment at our career not a few pressing forward with more courage have missed footing or leaped short and now swim weltering in the chaosflood some towards this shore some towards that to these also a helping hand should be held out at least some word of encouragement be said or to speak without metaphor with which mode of utterance teufelsdrckh unhappily has somewhat infected us can it be hidden from the editor that many a british reader sits reading quite bewildered in head and afflicted rather than instructed by the present work yes long ago has many a british reader been as now demanding with something like a snarl whereto does all this lead or what use is in it in the way of replenishing thy purse or otherwise aiding thy digestive faculty o british reader it leads to nothing and there is no use in it but rather the reverse for it costs thee somewhat nevertheless if through this unpromising horngate teufelsdrckh and we by means of him have led thee into the true land of dreams and through the clothesscreen as through a magical pierrepertuis thou lookest even for moments into the region of the wonderful and seest and feelest that thy daily life is girt with wonder and based on wonder and thy very blankets and breeches are miracles then art thou profited beyond moneys worth and hast a thankfulness towards our professor nay perhaps in many a literary teacircle wilt open thy kind lips and audibly express that same nay farther art not thou too perhaps by this time made aware that all symbols are properly clothes that all forms whereby spirit manifests itself to sense whether outwardly or in the imagination are clothes and thus not only the parchment magna charta which a tailor was nigh cutting into measures but the pomp and authority of law the sacredness of majesty and all inferior worships worthships are properly a vesture and raiment and the thirtynine articles themselves are articles of wearingapparel for the religious idea in which case must it not also be admitted that this science of clothes is a high one and may with infinitely deeper study on thy part yield richer fruit that it takes scientific rank beside codification and political economy and the theory of the british constitution nay rather from its prophetic height looks down on all these as on so many weavingshops and spinningmills where the vestures which it has to fashion and consecrate and distribute are too often by haggard hungry operatives who see no farther than their nose mechanically woven and spun but omitting all this much more all that concerns natural supernaturalism and indeed whatever has reference to the ulterior or transcendental portion of the science or bears never so remotely on that promised volume of the palingenesie der menschlichen gesellschaft newbirth of society we humbly suggest that no province of clothesphilosophy even the lowest is without its direct value but that innumerable inferences of a practical nature may be drawn therefrom to say nothing of those pregnant considerations ethical political symbolical which crowd on the clothesphilosopher from the very threshold of his science nothing even of those architectural ideas which as we have seen lurk at the bottom of all modes and will one day better unfolding themselves lead to important revolutions let us glance for a moment and with the faintest light of clothesphilosophy on what may be called the habilatory class of our fellowmen here too overlooking where so much were to be looked on the million spinners weavers fullers dyers washers and wringers that puddle and muddle in their dark recesses to make us clothes and die that we may live let us but turn the readers attention upon two small divisions of mankind who like moths may be regarded as clothanimals creatures that live move and have their being in cloth we mean dandies and tailors in regard to both which small divisions it may be asserted without scruple that the public feeling unenlightened by philosophy is at fault and even that the dictates of humanity are violated as will perhaps abundantly appear to readers of the two following chapters chapter x the dandiacal body first touching dandies let us consider with some scientific strictness what a dandy specially is a dandy is a clotheswearing man a man whose trade office and existence consists in the wearing of clothes every faculty of his soul spirit purse and person is heroically consecrated to this one object the wearing of clothes wisely and well so that as others dress to live he lives to dress the allimportance of clothes which a german professor of unequalled learning and acumen writes his enormous volume to demonstrate has sprung up in the intellect of the dandy without effort like an instinct of genius he is inspired with cloth a poet of cloth what teufelsdrckh would call a divine idea of cloth is born with him and this like other such ideas will express itself outwardly or wring his heart asunder with unutterable throes but like a generous creative enthusiast he fearlessly makes his idea an action shows himself in peculiar guise to mankind walks forth a witness and living martyr to the eternal worth of clothes we called him a poet is not his body the stuffed parchmentskin whereon he writes with cunning huddersfield dyes a sonnet to his mistress eyebrow say rather an epos and clotha virumque cano to the whole world in macaronic verses which he that runs may read nay if you grant what seems to be admissible that the dandy has a thinkingprinciple in him and some notions of time and space is there not in this lifedevotedness to cloth in this so willing sacrifice of the immortal to the perishable something though in reverse order of that blending and identification of eternity with time which as we have seen constitutes the prophetic character and now for all this perennial martyrdom and poesy and even prophecy what is it that the dandy asks in return solely we may say that you would recognise his existence would admit him to be a living object or even failing this a visual object or thing that will reflect rays of light your silver or your gold beyond what the niggardly law has already secured him he solicits not simply the glance of your eyes understand his mystic significance or altogether miss and misinterpret it do but look at him and he is contented may we not well cry shame on an ungrateful world which refuses even this poor boon which will waste its optic faculty on dried crocodiles and siamese twins and over the domestic wonderful wonder of wonders a live dandy glance with hasty indifference and a scarcely concealed contempt him no zoologist classes among the mammalia no anatomist dissects with care when did we see any injected preparation of the dandy in our museums any specimen of him preserved in spirits lord herringbone may dress himself in a snuffbrown suit with snuffbrown shirt and shoes it skills not the undiscerning public occupied with grosser wants passes by regardless on the other side the age of curiosity like that of chivalry is indeed properly speaking gone yet perhaps only gone to sleep for here arises the clothesphilosophy to resuscitate strangely enough both the one and the other should sound views of this science come to prevail the essential nature of the british dandy and the mystic significance that lies in him cannot always remain hidden under laughable and lamentable hallucination the following long extract from professor teufelsdrckh may set the matter if not in its true light yet in the way towards such it is to be regretted however that here as so often elsewhere the professors keen philosophic perspicacity is somewhat marred by a certain mixture of almost owlish purblindness or else of some perverse ineffectual ironic tendency our readers shall judge which in these distracted times writes he when the religious principle drivenout of most churches either lies unseen in the hearts of good men looking and longing and silently working there towards some new revelation or else wanders homeless over the world like a disembodied soul seeking its terrestrial organisation into how many strange shapes of superstition and fanaticism does it not tentatively and errantly cast itself the higher enthusiasm of mans nature is for the while without exponent yet does it continue indestructible unweariedly active and work blindly in the great chaotic deep thus sect after sect and church after church bodies itself forth and melts again into new metamorphosis chiefly is this observable in england which as the wealthiest and worstinstructed of european nations offers precisely the elements of heat namely and of darkness in which such mooncalves and monstrosities are best generated among the newer sects of that country one of the most notable and closely connected with our present subject is that of the dandies concerning which what little information i have been able to procure may fitly stand here it is true certain of the english journalists men generally without sense for the religious principle or judgment for its manifestations speak in their brief enigmatic notices as if this were perhaps rather a secular sect and not a religious one nevertheless to the psychologic eye its devotional and even sacrificial character plainly enough reveals itself whether it belongs to the class of fetishworships or of heroworships or polytheisms or to what other class may in the present state of our intelligence remain undecided schweben a certain touch of manicheism not indeed in the gnostic shape is discernible enough also for human error walks in a cycle and reappears at intervals a notinconsiderable resemblance to that superstition of the athos monks who by fasting from all nourishment and looking intensely for a length of time into their own navels came to discern therein the true apocalypse of nature and heaven unveiled to my own surmise it appears as if this dandiacal sect were but a new modification adapted to the new time of that primeval superstition selfworship which zerdusht quangfoutchee mohamed and others strove rather to subordinate and restrain than to eradicate and which only in the purer forms of religion has been altogether rejected wherefore if any one chooses to name it revived ahrimanism or a new figure of demonworship i have so far as is yet visible no objection for the rest these people animated with the zeal of a new sect display courage and perseverance and what force there is in mans nature though never so enslaved they affect great purity and separatism distinguish themselves by a particular costume whereof some notices were given in the earlier part of this volume likewise so far as possible by a particular speech apparently some broken linguafranca or englishfrench and on the whole strive to maintain a true nazarene deportment and keep themselves unspotted from the world they have their temples whereof the chief as the jewish temple did stands in their metropolis and is named almacks a word of uncertain etymology they worship principally by night and have their highpriests and highpriestesses who however do not continue for life the rites by some supposed to be of the menadic sort or perhaps with an eleusinian or cabiric character are held strictly secret nor are sacred books wanting to the sect these they call fashionable novels however the canon is not completed and some are canonical and others not of such sacred books i not without expense procured myself some samples and in hope of true insight and with the zeal which beseems an inquirer into clothes set to interpret and study them but wholly to no purpose that tough faculty of reading for which the world will not refuse me credit was here for the first time foiled and set at naught in vain that i summoned my whole energies mich weidlich anstrengte and did my very utmost at the end of some short space i was uniformly seized with not so much what i can call a drumming in my ears as a kind of infinite unsufferable jewsharping and scrannelpiping there to which the frightfullest species of magnetic sleep soon supervened and if i strove to shake this away and absolutely would not yield there came a hitherto unfelt sensation as of delirium tremens and a melting into total deliquium till at last by order of the doctor dreading ruin to my whole intellectual and bodily faculties and a general breakingup of the constitution i reluctantly but determinedly forbore was there some miracle at work here like those fireballs and supernal and infernal prodigies which in the case of the jewish mysteries have also more than once scaredback the alien be this as it may such failure on my part after best efforts must excuse the imperfection of this sketch altogether incomplete yet the completest i could give of a sect too singular to be omitted loving my own life and senses as i do no power shall induce me as a private individual to open another fashionable novel but luckily in this dilemma comes a hand from the clouds whereby if not victory deliverance is held out to me round one of those bookpackages which the stillschweigensche buchhandlung is in the habit of importing from england come as is usual various waste printedsheets maculatur bltter by way of interior wrappage into these the clothesphilosopher with a certain mohamedan reverence even for wastepaper where curious knowledge will sometimes hover disdains not to cast his eye readers may judge of his astonishment when on such a defaced straysheet probably the outcast fraction of some english periodical such as they name magazine appears something like a dissertation on this very subject of fashionable novels it sets out indeed chiefly from a secular point of view directing itself not without asperity against some to me unknown individual named pelham who seems to be a mystagogue and leading teacher and preacher of the sect so that what indeed otherwise was not to be expected in such a fugitive fragmentary sheet the true secret the religious physiognomy and physiology of the dandiacal body is nowise laid fully open there nevertheless scattered lights do from time to time sparkle out whereby i have endeavoured to profit nay in one passage selected from the prophecies or mythic theogonies or whatever they are for the style seems very mixed of this mystagogue i find what appears to be a confession of faith or whole duty of man according to the tenets of that sect which confession or whole duty therefore as proceeding from a source so authentic i shall here arrange under seven distinct articles and in very abridged shape lay before the german world therewith taking leave of this matter observe also that to avoid possibility of error i as far as may be quote literally from the original articles of faith coats should have nothing of the triangle about them at the same time wrinkles behind should be carefully avoided the collar is a very important point it should be low behind and slightly rolled no license of fashion can allow a man of delicate taste to adopt the posterial luxuriance of a hottentot there is safety in a swallowtail the good sense of a gentleman is nowhere more finely developed than in his rings it is permitted to mankind under certain restrictions to wear white waistcoats the trousers must be exceedingly tight across the hips all which propositions i for the present content myself with modestly but peremptorily and irrevocably denying in strange contrast with this dandiacal body stands another british sect originally as i understand of ireland where its chief seat still is but known also in the main island and indeed everywhere rapidly spreading as this sect has hitherto emitted no canonical books it remains to me in the same state of obscurity as the dandiacal which has published books that the unassisted human faculties are inadequate to read the members appear to be designated by a considerable diversity of names according to their various places of establishment in england they are generally called the drudge sect also unphilosophically enough the white negroes and chiefly in scorn by those of other communions the raggedbeggar sect in scotland again i find them entitled hallanshakers or the stook of duds sect any individual communicant is named stook of duds that is shock of rags in allusion doubtless to their professional costume while in ireland which as mentioned is their grand parent hive they go by a perplexing multiplicity of designations such as bogtrotters redshanks ribbonmen cottiers peepofday boys babes of the wood rockites poorslaves which last however seems to be the primary and generic name whereto probably enough the others are only subsidiary species or slight varieties or at most propagated offsets from the parent stem whose minute subdivisions and shades of difference it were here loss of time to dwell on enough for us to understand what seems indubitable that the original sect is that of the poorslaves whose doctrines practices and fundamental characteristics pervade and animate the whole body howsoever denominated or outwardly diversified the precise speculative tenets of this brotherhood how the universe and man and mans life picture themselves to the mind of an irish poorslave with what feelings and opinions he looks forward on the future round on the present back on the past it were extremely difficult to specify something monastic there appears to be in their constitution we find them bound by the two monastic vows of poverty and obedience which vows especially the former it is said they observe with great strictness nay as i have understood it they are pledged and be it by any solemn nazarene ordination or not irrevocably consecrated thereto even before birth that the third monastic vow of chastity is rigidly enforced among them i find no ground to conjecture furthermore they appear to imitate the dandiacal sect in their grand principle of wearing a peculiar costume of which irish poorslave costume no description will indeed be found in the present volume for this reason that by the imperfect organ of language it did not seem describable their raiment consists of innumerable skirts lappets and irregular wings of all cloths and of all colours through the labyrinthic intricacies of which their bodies are introduced by some unknown process it is fastened together by a multiplex combination of buttons thrums and skewers to which frequently is added a girdle of leather of hempen or even of straw rope round the loins to straw rope indeed they seem partial and often wear it by way of sandals in headdress they affect a certain freedom hats with partial brim without crown or with only a loose hinged or valve crown in the former case they sometimes invert the hat and wear it brim uppermost like a universitycap with what view is unknown the name poorslaves seems to indicate a slavonic polish or russian origin not so however the interior essence and spirit of their superstition which rather displays a teutonic or druidical character one might fancy them worshippers of hertha or the earth for they dig and affectionately work continually in her bosom or else shutup in private oratories meditate and manipulate the substances derived from her seldom lookingup towards the heavenly luminaries and then with comparative indifference like the druids on the other hand they live in dark dwellings often even breaking their glasswindows where they find such and stuffing them up with pieces of raiment or other opaque substances till the fit obscurity is restored again like all followers of natureworship they are liable to outbreakings of an enthusiasm rising to ferocity and burn men if not in wicker idols yet in sod cottages in respect of diet they have also their observances all poorslaves are rhizophagous or rooteaters a few are ichthyophagous and use salted herrings other animal food they abstain from except indeed with perhaps some strange inverted fragment of a brahminical feeling such animals as die a natural death their universal sustenance is the root named potato cooked by fire alone and generally without condiment or relish of any kind save an unknown condiment named point into the meaning of which i have vainly inquired the victual potatoesandpoint not appearing at least not with specific accuracy of description in any european cookerybook whatever for drink they use with an almost epigrammatic counterpoise of taste milk which is the mildest of liquors and potheen which is the fiercest this latter i have tasted as well as the english blueruin and the scotch whisky analogous fluids used by the sect in those countries it evidently contains some form of alcohol in the highest state of concentration though disguised with acrid oils and is on the whole the most pungent substance known to me indeed a perfect liquid fire in all their religious solemnities potheen is said to be an indispensable requisite and largely consumed an irish traveller of perhaps common veracity who presents himself under the to me unmeaning title of the late john bernard offers the following sketch of a domestic establishment the inmates whereof though such is not stated expressly appear to have been of that faith thereby shall my german readers now behold an irish poorslave as it were with their own eyes and even see him at meat moreover in the soprecious wastepaper sheet above mentioned i have found some corresponding picture of a dandiacal household painted by that same dandiacal mystagogue or theogonist this also by way of counterpart and contrast the world shall look into first therefore of the poorslave who appears likewise to have been a species of innkeeper i quote from the original poorslave household the furniture of this caravansera consisted of a large iron pot two oaken tables two benches two chairs and a potheen noggin there was a loft above attainable by a ladder upon which the inmates slept and the space below was divided by a hurdle into two apartments the one for their cow and pig the other for themselves and guests on entering the house we discovered the family eleven in number at dinner the father sitting at the top the mother at the bottom the children on each side of a large oaken board which was scoopedout in the middle like a trough to receive the contents of their pot of potatoes little holes were cut at equal distances to contain salt and a bowl of milk stood on the table all the luxuries of meat and beer bread knives and dishes were dispensed with the poorslave himself our traveller found as he says broadbacked blackbrowed of great personal strength and mouth from ear to ear his wife was a sunbrowned but wellfeatured woman and his young ones bare and chubby had the appetite of ravens of their philosophical or religious tenets or observances no notice or hint but now secondly of the dandiacal household in which truly that oftenmentioned mystagogue and inspired penman himself has his abode dandiacal household a dressingroom splendidly furnished violetcoloured curtains chairs and ottomans of the same hue two fulllength mirrors are placed one on each side of a table which supports the luxuries of the toilet several bottles of perfumes arranged in a peculiar fashion stand upon a smaller table of motherofpearl opposite to these are placed the appurtenances of lavation richly wrought in frosted silver a wardrobe of buhl is on the left the doors of which being partly open discover a profusion of clothes shoes of a singularly small size monopolise the lower shelves fronting the wardrobe a door ajar gives some slight glimpse of a bathroom foldingdoors in the background enter the author our theogonist in person obsequiously preceded by a french valet in white silk jacket and cambric apron such are the two sects which at this moment divide the more unsettled portion of the british people and agitate that evervexed country to the eye of the political seer their mutual relation pregnant with the elements of discord and hostility is far from consoling these two principals of dandiacal selfworship or demonworship and poorslavish or drudgical earthworship or whatever that same drudgism may be do as yet indeed manifest themselves under distant and nowise considerable shapes nevertheless in their roots and subterranean ramifications they extend through the entire structure of society and work unweariedly in the secret depths of english national existence striving to separate and isolate it into two contradictory uncommunicating masses in numbers and even individual strength the poorslaves or drudges it would seem are hourly increasing the dandiacal again is by nature no proselytising sect but it boasts of great hereditary resources and is strong by union whereas the drudges split into parties have as yet no rallyingpoint or at best only cooperate by means of partial secret affiliations if indeed there were to arise a communion of drudges as there is already a communion of saints what strangest effects would follow therefrom dandyism as yet affects to lookdown on drudgism but perhaps the hour of trial when it will be practically seen which ought to look down and which up is not so distant to me it seems probable that the two sects will one day part england between them each recruiting itself from the intermediate ranks till there be none left to enlist on either side those dandiacal manicheans with the host of dandyising christians will form one body the drudges gathering round them whosoever is drudgical be he christian or infidel pagan sweepingup likewise all manner of utilitarians radicals refractory potwallopers and so forth into their general mass will form another i could liken dandyism and drudgism to two bottomless boiling whirlpools that had brokenout on opposite quarters of the firm land as yet they appear only disquieted foolishly bubbling wells which mans art might coverin yet mark them their diameter is daily widening they are hollow cones that boilup from the infinite deep over which your firm land is but a thin crust or rind thus daily is the intermediate land crumblingin daily the empire of the two buchanbullers extending till now there is but a footplank a mere film of land between them this too is washed away and then we have the true hell of waters and noahs deluge is outdeluged or better i might call them two boundless and indeed unexampled electric machines turned by the machinery of society with batteries of opposite quality drudgism the negative dandyism the positive one attracts hourly towards it and appropriates all the positive electricity of the nation namely the money thereof the other is equally busy with the negative that is to say the hunger which is equally potent hitherto you see only partial transient sparkles and sputters but wait a little till the entire nation is in an electric state till your whole vital electricity no longer healthfully neutral is cut into two isolated portions of positive and negative of money and of hunger and stands there bottledup in two worldbatteries the stirring of a childs finger brings the two together and then what then the earth is but shivered into impalpable smoke by that doomsthunderpeal the sun misses one of his planets in space and thenceforth there are no eclipses of the moon or better still i might liken oh enough enough of likenings and similitudes in excess of which truly it is hard to say whether teufelsdrckh or ourselves sin the more we have often blamed him for a habit of wiredrawing and overrefining from of old we have been familiar with his tendency to mysticism and religiosity whereby in everything he was still scentingout religion but never perhaps did these amaurosissuffusions so cloud and distort his otherwise most piercing vision as in this of the dandiacal body or was there something of intended satire is the professor and seer not quite the blinkard he affects to be of an ordinary mortal we should have decisively answered in the affirmative but with a teufelsdrckh there ever hovers some shade of doubt in the mean while if satire were actually intended the case is little better there are not wanting men who will answer does your professor take us for simpletons his irony has overshot itself we see through it and perhaps through him chapter xi tailors thus however has our first practical inference from the clothesphilosophy that which respects dandies been sufficiently drawn and we come now to the second concerning tailors on this latter our opinion happily quite coincides with that of teufelsdrckh himself as expressed in the concluding page of his volume to whom therefore we willingly give place let him speak his own last words in his own way upwards of a century says he must elapse and still the bleeding fight of freedom be fought whoso is noblest perishing in the van and thrones be hurled on altars like pelion on ossa and the moloch of iniquity have his victims and the michael of justice his martyrs before tailors can be admitted to their true prerogatives of manhood and this last wound of suffering humanity be closed if aught in the history of the worlds blindness could surprise us here might we indeed pause and wonder an idea has gone abroad and fixed itself down into a widespreading rooted error that tailors are a distinct species in physiology not men but fractional parts of a man call any one a schneider cutter tailor is it not in our dislocated hoodwinked and indeed delirious condition of society equivalent to defying his perpetual fellest enmity the epithet schneidermssig tailorlike betokens an otherwise unapproachable degree of pusillanimity we introduce a tailorsmelancholy more opprobrious than any leprosy into our books of medicine and fable i know not what of his generating it by living on cabbage why should i speak of hans sachs himself a shoemaker or kind of leathertailor with his schneider mit dem panier why of shakspeare in his taming of the shrew and elsewhere does it not stand on record that the english queen elizabeth receiving a deputation of eighteen tailors addressed them with a good morning gentlemen both did not the same virago boast that she had a cavalry regiment whereof neither horse nor man could be injured her regiment namely of tailors on mares thus everywhere is the falsehood taken for granted and actedon as an indisputable fact nevertheless need i put the question to any physiologist whether it is disputable or not seems it not at least presumable that under his clothes the tailor has bones and viscera and other muscles than the sartorious which function of manhood is the tailor not conjectured to perform can he not arrest for debt is he not in most countries a taxpaying animal to no reader of this volume can it be doubtful which conviction is mine nay if the fruit of these long vigils and almost preternatural inquiries is not to perish utterly the world will have approximated towards a higher truth and the doctrine which swift with the keen forecast of genius dimly anticipated will stand revealed in clear light that the tailor is not only a man but something of a creator or divinity of franklin it was said that he snatched the thunder from heaven and the sceptre from kings but which is greater i would ask he that lends or he that snatches for looking away from individual cases and how a man is by the tailor newcreated into a nobleman and clothed not only with wool but with dignity and a mystic dominion is not the fair fabric of society itself with all its royal mantles and pontifical stoles whereby from nakedness and dismemberment we are organised into polities into nations and a whole cooperating mankind the creation as has here been often irrefragably evinced of the tailor alone what too are all poets and moral teachers but a species of metaphorical tailors touching which high guild the greatest living guildbrother has triumphantly asked us nay if thou wilt have it who but the poet first made gods for men brought them down to us and raised us up to them and this is he whom sitting downcast on the hard basis of his shopboard the world treats with contumely as the ninth part of a man look up thou muchinjured one look up with the kindling eye of hope and prophetic bodings of a noble better time too long hast thou sat there on crossed legs wearing thy anklejoints to horn like some sacred anchorite or catholic fakir doing penance drawing down heavens richest blessings for a world that scoffed at thee be of hope already streaks of blue peer through our clouds the thick gloom of ignorance is rolling asunder and it will be day mankind will repay with interest their longaccumulated debt the anchorite that was scoffed at will be worshipped the fraction will become not an integer only but a square and cube with astonishment the world will recognise that the tailor is its hierophant and hierarch or even its god as i stood in the mosque of st sophia and looked upon these fourandtwenty tailors sewing and embroidering that rich cloth which the sultan sends yearly for the caaba of mecca i thought within myself how many other unholies has your covering art made holy besides this arabian whinstone still more touching was it when turning the corner of a lane in the scottish town of edinburgh i came upon a signpost whereon stood written that such and such a one was breechesmaker to his majesty and stood painted the effigies of a pair of leather breeches and between the knees these memorable words sic itur ad astra was not this the martyr prisonspeech of a tailor sighing indeed in bonds yet sighing towards deliverance and prophetically appealing to a better day a day of justice when the worth of breeches would be revealed to man and the scissors become forever venerable neither perhaps may i now say has his appeal been altogether in vain it was in this high moment when the soul rent as it were and shed asunder is open to inspiring influence that i first conceived this work on clothes the greatest i can ever hope to do which has already after long retardations occupied and will yet occupy so large a section of my life and of which the primary and simpler portion may here find its conclusion chapter xii farewell so have we endeavoured from the enormous amorphous plumpudding more like a scottish haggis which herr teufelsdrckh had kneaded for his fellow mortals to pickout the choicest plums and present them separately on a cover of our own a laborious perhaps a thankless enterprise in which however something of hope has occasionally cheered us and of which we can now wash our hands not altogether without satisfaction if hereby though in barbaric wise some morsel of spiritual nourishment have been added to the scanty ration of our beloved british world what nobler recompense could the editor desire if it prove otherwise why should he murmur was not this a task which destiny in any case had appointed him which having now done with he sees his general dayswork so much the lighter so much the shorter of professor teufelsdrckh it seems impossible to take leave without a mingled feeling of astonishment gratitude and disapproval who will not regret that talents which might have profited in the higher walks of philosophy or in art itself have been so much devoted to a rummaging among lumberrooms nay too often to a scraping in kennels where lost rings and diamondnecklaces are nowise the sole conquests regret is unavoidable yet censure were loss of time to cure him of his mad humours british criticism would essay in vain enough for her if she can by vigilance prevent the spreading of such among ourselves what a result should this piebald entangled hypermetaphorical style of writing not to say of thinking become general among our literary men as it might so easily do thus has not the editor himself working over teufelsdrckhs german lost much of his own english purity even as the smaller whirlpool is sucked into the larger and made to whirl along with it so has the lesser mind in this instance been forced to become portion of the greater and like it see all things figuratively which habit time and assiduous effort will be needed to eradicate nevertheless wayward as our professor shows himself is there any reader that can part with him in declared enmity let us confess there is that in the wild muchsuffering muchinflicting man which almost attaches us his attitude we will hope and believe is that of a man who had said to cant begone and to dilettantism here thou canst not be and to truth be thou in place of all to me a man who had manfully defied the timeprince or devil to his face nay perhaps hanniballike was mysteriously consecrated from birth to that warfare and now stood minded to wage the same by all weapons in all places at all times in such a cause any soldier were he but a polack scytheman shall be welcome still the question returns on us how could a man occasionally of keen insight not without keen sense of propriety who had real thoughts to communicate resolve to emit them in a shape bordering so closely on the absurd which question he were wiser than the present editor who should satisfactorily answer our conjecture has sometimes been that perhaps necessity as well as choice was concerned in it seems it not conceivable that in a life like our professors where so much bountifully given by nature had in practice failed and misgone literature also would never rightly prosper that striving with his characteristic vehemence to paint this and the other picture and ever without success he at last desperately dashes his sponge full of all colours against the canvas to try whether it will paint foam with all his stillness there were perhaps in teufelsdrckh desperation enough for this a second conjecture we hazard with even less warranty it is that teufelsdrckh is not without some touch of the universal feeling a wish to proselytise how often already have we paused uncertain whether the basis of this so enigmatic nature were really stoicism and despair or love and hope only seared into the figure of these remarkable moreover is this saying of his how were friendship possible in mutual devotedness to the good and true otherwise impossible except as armed neutrality or hollow commercial league a man be the heavens ever praised is sufficient for himself yet were ten men united in love capable of being and of doing what ten thousand singly would fail in infinite is the help man can yield to man and now in conjunction therewith consider this other it is the night of the world and still long till it be day we wander amid the glimmer of smoking ruins and the sun and the stars of heaven are as if blotted out for a season and two immeasurable phantoms hypocrisy and atheism with the gowl sensuality stalk abroad over the earth and call it theirs well at ease are the sleepers for whom existence is a shallow dream but what of the awestruck wakeful who find it a reality should not these unite since even an authentic spectre is not visible to two in which case were this enormous clothesvolume properly an enormous pitchpan which our teufelsdrckh in his lone watchtower had kindled that it might flame far and wide through the night and many a disconsolately wandering spirit be guided thither to a brothers bosom we say as before with all his malign indifference who knows what mad hopes this man may harbour meanwhile there is one fact to be stated here which harmonises ill with such conjecture and indeed were teufelsdrckh made like other men might as good as altogether subvert it namely that while the beaconfire blazed its brightest the watchman had quitted it that no pilgrim could now ask him watchman what of the night professor teufelsdrckh be it known is no longer visibly present at weissnichtwo but again to all appearance lost in space some time ago the hofrath heuschrecke was pleased to favour us with another copious epistle wherein much is said about the populationinstitute much repeated in praise of the paperbag documents the hieroglyphic nature of which our hofrath still seems not to have surmised and lastly the strangest occurrence communicated to us for the first time in the following paragraph ew wohlgeboren will have seen from the public prints with what affectionate and hitherto fruitless solicitude weissnichtwo regards the disappearance of her sage might but the united voice of germany prevail on him to return nay could we but so much as elucidate for ourselves by what mystery he went away but alas old lieschen experiences or affects the profoundest deafness the profoundest ignorance in the wahngasse all lies swept silent sealed up the privy council itself can hitherto elicit no answer it had been remarked that while the agitating news of those parisian three days flew from mouth to mouth and dinned every ear in weissnichtwo herr teufelsdrckh was not known at the gans or elsewhere to have spoken for a whole week any syllable except once these three es geht an it is beginning shortly after as ew wohlgeboren knows was the public tranquillity here as in berlin threatened by a sedition of the tailors nor did there want evilwishers or perhaps mere desperate alarmists who asserted that the closing chapter of the clothesvolume was to blame in this appalling crisis the serenity of our philosopher was indescribable nay perhaps through one humble individual something thereof might pass into the rath council itself and so contribute to the countrys deliverance the tailors are now entirely pacificated to neither of these two incidents can i attribute our loss yet still comes there the shadow of a suspicion out of paris and its politics for example when the saintsimonian society transmitted its propositions hither and the whole gans was one vast cackle of laughter lamentation and astonishment our sage sat mute and at the end of the third evening said merely here also are men who have discovered not without amazement that man is still man of which high longforgotten truth you already see them make a false application since then as has been ascertained by examination of the postdirector there passed at least one letter with its answer between the messieurs bazardenfantin and our professor himself of what tenor can now only be conjectured on the fifth night following he was seen for the last time has this invaluable man so obnoxious to most of the hostile sects that convulse our era been spirited away by certain of their emissaries or did he go forth voluntarily to their headquarters to confer with them and confront them reason we have at least of a negative sort to believe the lost still living our widowed heart also whispers that ere long he will himself give a sign otherwise indeed his archives must one day be opened by authority where much perhaps the palingenesie itself is thought to be reposited thus far the hofrath who vanishes as is his wont too like an ignis fatuus leaving the dark still darker so that teufelsdrckhs public history were not done then or reduced to an even unromantic tenor nay perhaps the better part thereof were only beginning we stand in a region of conjectures where substance has melted into shadow and one cannot be distinguished from the other may time which solves or suppresses all problems throw glad light on this also our own private conjecture now amounting almost to certainty is that safemoored in some stillest obscurity not to lie always still teufelsdrckh is actually in london here however can the present editor with an ambrosial joy as of overweariness falling into sleep lay down his pen well does he know if human testimony be worth aught that to innumerable british readers likewise this is a satisfying consummation that innumerable british readers consider him during these current months but as an uneasy interruption to their ways of thought and digestion and indicate so much not without a certain irritancy and even spoken invective for which as for other mercies ought not he to thank the upper powers to one and all of you o irritated readers he with outstretched arms and open heart will wave a kind farewell thou too miraculous entity who namest thyself yorke and oliver and with thy vivacities and genialities with thy alltoo irish mirth and madness and odour of palled punch makest such strange work farewell long as thou canst farewell have we not in the course of eternity travelled some months of our lifejourney in partial sight of one another have we not existed together though in a state of quarrel appendix testimonies of authors this questionable little book was undoubtedly written among the mountain solitudes in but owing to impediments natural and accidental could not for seven years more appear as a volume in england and had at last to clip itself in pieces and be content to struggle out bit by bit in some courageous magazine that offered whereby now to certain idly curious readers and even to myself till i make study the insignificant but at last irritating question what its real history and chronology are is if not insoluble considerably involved in haze to the first english edition which an american or two american had now opened the way for there was slightingly prefixed under the title testimonies of authors some straggle of real documents which now that i find it again sets the matter into clear light and sequence and shall here for removal of idle stumblingblocks and nugatory guessings from the

sartor resartus is what old dennis used to call a heap of clotted nonsense mixed however here and there with passages marked by thought and striking poetic vigour but what does the writer mean by baphometic firebaptism why cannot he lay aside his pedantry and write so as to make himself generally intelligible we quote by way of curiosity a sentence from the sartor resartus which may be read either backwards or forwards for it is equally intelligible either way indeed by beginning at the tail and so working up to the head we think the reader will stand the fairest chance of getting at its meaning the firebaptised soul long so scathed and thunderriven here feels its own freedom which feeling is its baphometic baptism the citadel of its whole kingdom it has thus gained by assault and will keep inexpugnable outwards from which the remaining dominions not indeed without hard battering will doubtless by degrees be conquered and pacificated here is a sun newspaper st april iii northamerican reviewer after a careful survey of the whole ground our belief is that no such persons as professor teufelsdrckh or counsellor heuschrecke ever existed that the six paperbags with their chinaink inscriptions and multifarious contents are a mere figment of the brain that the present editor is the only person who has ever written upon the philosophy of clothes and that the sartor resartus is the only treatise that has yet appeared upon that subject in short that the whole account of the origin of the work before us which the supposed editor relates with so much gravity and of which we have given a brief abstract is in plain english a hum without troubling our readers at any great length with our reasons for entertaining these suspicions we may remark that the absence of all other information on the subject except what is contained in the work is itself a fact of a most significant character the whole german press as well as the particular one where the work purports to have been printed seems to be under the control of stillschweigen and co silence and company if the clothesphilosophy and its author are making so great a sensation throughout germany as is pretended how happens it that the only notice we have of the fact is contained in a few numbers of a monthly magazine published at london how happens it that no intelligence about the matter has come out directly to this country we pique ourselves here in new england upon knowing at least as much of what is going on in the literary way in the old dutch motherland as our brethren of the fastanchored isle but thus far we have no tidings whatever of the extensive closeprinted closemeditated volume which forms the subject of this pretended commentary again we would respectfully inquire of the present editor upon what part of the map of germany we are to look for the city of weissnichtwo knownotwhere at which place the work is supposed to have been printed and the author to have resided it has been our fortune to visit several portions of the german territory and to examine pretty carefully at different times and for various purposes maps of the whole but we have no recollection of any such place we suspect that the city of knownotwhere might be called with at least as much propriety nobodyknowswhere and is to be found in the kingdom of nowhere again the village of entepfuhl duckpond where the supposed author of the work is said to have passed his youth and that of hinterschlag where he had his education are equally foreign to our geography duckponds enough there undoubtedly are in almost every village in germany as the traveller in that country knows too well to his cost but any particular village denominated duckpond is to us altogether terra incognita the names of the personages are not less singular than those of the places who can refrain from a smile at the yoking together of such a pair of appellatives as diogenes teufelsdrckh the supposed bearer of this strange title is represented as admitting in his pretended autobiography that he had searched to no purpose through all the heralds books in and without the german empire and through all manner of subscriberslists militiarolls and other namecatalogues but had nowhere been able to find the name teufelsdrckh except as appended to his own person we can readily believe this and we doubt very much whether any christian parent would think of condemning a son to carry through life the burden of so unpleasant a title that of counsellor heuschrecke grasshopper though not offensive looks much more like a piece of fancy work than a fair business transaction the same may be said of blumine flowergoddess the heroine of the fable and so of the rest in short our private opinion is as we have remarked that the whole story of a correspondence with germany a university of nobodyknowswhere a professor of things in general a counsellor grasshopper a flowergoddess blumine and so forth has about as much foundation in truth as the late entertaining account of sir john herschels discoveries in the moon fictions of this kind are however not uncommon and ought not perhaps to be condemned with too much severity but we are not sure that we can exercise the same indulgence in regard to the attempt which seems to be made to mislead the public as to the substance of the work before us and its pretended german original both purport as we have seen to be upon the subject of clothes or dress clothes their origin and influence is the title of the supposed german treatise of professor teufelsdrckh and the rather odd name of sartor resartus the tailor patched which the present editor has affixed to his pretended commentary seems to look the same way but though there is a good deal of remark throughout the work in a halfserious halfcomic style upon dress it seems to be in reality a treatise upon the great science of things in general which teufelsdrckh is supposed to have professed at the university of nobodyknowswhere now without intending to adopt a too rigid standard of morals we own that we doubt a little the propriety of offering to the public a treatise on things in general under the name and in the form of an essay on dress for ourselves advanced as we unfortunately are in the journey of life far beyond the period when dress is practically a matter of interest we have no hesitation in saying that the real subject of the work is to us more attractive than the ostensible one but this is probably not the case with the mass of readers to the younger portion of the community which constitutes everywhere the very great majority the subject of dress is one of intense and paramount importance an author who treats it appeals like the poet to the young men and maidens virginibus puerisque and calls upon them by all the motives which habitually operate most strongly upon their feelings to buy his book when after opening their purses for this purpose they have carried home the work in triumph expecting to find in it some particular instruction in regard to the tying of their neckcloths or the cut of their corsets and meet with nothing better than a dissertation on things in general they will to use the mildest term not be in very good humour if the last improvements in legislation which we have made in this country should have found their way to england the author we think would stand some chance of being lynched whether his object in this piece of supercherie be merely pecuniary profit or whether he takes a malicious pleasure in quizzing the dandies we shall not undertake to say in the latter part of the work he devotes a separate chapter to this class of persons from the tenour of which we should be disposed to conclude that he would consider any mode of divesting them of their property very much in the nature of a spoiling of the egyptians the only thing about the work tending to prove that it is what it purports to be a commentary on a real german treatise is the style which is a sort of babylonish dialect not destitute it is true of richness vigour and at times a sort of singular felicity of expression but very strongly tinged throughout with the peculiar idiom of the german language this quality in the style however may be a mere result of a great familiarity with german literature and we cannot therefore look upon it as in itself decisive still less as outweighing so much evidence of an opposite character northamerican review no october iv new england editors the editors have been induced by the express desire of many persons to collect the following sheets out of the ephemeral pamphlets in which they first appeared under the conviction that they contain in themselves the assurance of a longer date frasers london magazine the editors have no expectation that this little work will have a sudden and general popularity they will not undertake as there is no need to justify the gay costume in which the author delights to dress his thoughts or the german idioms with which he has sportively sprinkled his pages it is his humour to advance the gravest speculations upon the gravest topics in a quaint and burlesque style if his masquerade offend any of his audience to that degree that they will not hear what he has to say it may chance to draw others to listen to his wisdom and what work of imagination can hope to please all but we will venture to remark that the distaste excited by these peculiarities in some readers is greatest at first and is soon forgotten and that the foreign dress and aspect of the work are quite superficial and cover a genuine saxon heart we believe no book has been published for many years written in a more sincere style of idiomatic english or which discovers an equal mastery over all the riches of the language the author makes ample amends for the occasional eccentricity of his genius not only by frequent bursts of pure splendour but by the wit and sense which never fail him but what will chiefly commend the book to the discerning reader is the manifest design of the work which is a criticism upon the spirit of the age we had almost said of the hour in which we live exhibiting in the most just and novel light the present aspects of religion politics literature arts and social life under all his gaiety the writer has an earnest meaning and discovers an insight into the manifold wants and tendencies of human nature which is very rare among our popular authors the philanthropy and the purity of moral sentiment which inspire

farewell p on heroes heroworship and the heroic in history lecture i the hero as divinity odin paganism scandinavian mythology tuesday th may we have undertaken to discourse here for a little on great men their manner of appearance in our worlds business how they have shaped themselves in the worlds history what ideas men formed of them what work they did on heroes namely and on their reception and performance what i call heroworship and the heroic in human affairs too evidently this is a large topic deserving quite other treatment than we can expect to give it at present a large topic indeed an illimitable one wide as universal history itself for as i take it universal history the history of what man has accomplished in this world is at bottom the history of the great men who have worked here they were the leaders of men these great ones the modellers patterns and in a wide sense creators of whatsoever the general mass of men contrived to do or to attain all things that we see standing accomplished in the world are properly the outer material result the practical realisation and embodiment of thoughts that dwelt in the great men sent into the world the soul of the whole worlds history it may justly be considered were the history of these too clearly it is a topic we shall do no justice to in this place one comfort is that great men taken up in any way are profitable company we cannot look however imperfectly upon a great man without gaining something by him he is the living lightfountain which it is good and pleasant to be near the light which enlightens which has enlightened the darkness of the world and this not as a kindled lamp only but rather as a natural luminary shining by the gift of heaven a flowing lightfountain as i say of native original insight of manhood and heroic nobleness in whose radiance all souls feel that it is well with them on any terms whatsoever you will not grudge to wander in such neighbourhood for a while these six classes of heroes chosen out of widelydistant countries and epochs and in mere external figure differing altogether ought if we look faithfully at them to illustrate several things for us could we see them well we should get some glimpses into the very marrow of the worlds history how happy could i but in any measure in such times as these make manifest to you the meanings of heroism the divine relation for i may well call it such which in all times unites a great man to other men and thus as it were not exhaust my subject but so much as break ground on it at all events i must make the attempt it is well said in every sense that a mans religion is the chief fact with regard to him a mans or a nation of mens by religion i do not mean here the churchcreed which he professes the articles of faith which he will sign and in words or otherwise assert not this wholly in many cases not this at all we see men of all kinds of professed creeds attain to almost all degrees of worth or worthlessness under each or any of them this is not what i call religion this profession and assertion which is often only a profession and assertion from the outworks of the man from the mere argumentative region of him if even so deep as that but the thing a man does practically believe and this is often enough without asserting it even to himself much less to others the thing a man does practically lay to heart and know for certain concerning his vital relations to this mysterious universe and his duty and destiny there that is in all cases the primary thing for him and creatively determines all the rest that is his religion or it may be his mere scepticism and noreligion the manner it is in which he feels himself to be spiritually related to the unseen world or noworld and i say if you tell me what that is you tell me to a very great extent what the man is what the kind of things he will do is of a man or of a nation we inquire therefore first of all what religion they had was it heathenism plurality of gods mere sensuous representation of this mystery of life and for chief recognised element therein physical force was it christianism faith in an invisible not as real only but as the only reality time through every meanest moment of it resting on eternity pagan empire of force displaced by a nobler supremacy that of holiness was it scepticism uncertainty and inquiry whether there was an unseen world any mystery of life except a mad one doubt as to all this or perhaps unbelief and flat denial answering of this question is giving us the soul of the history of the man or nation the thoughts they had were the parents of the actions they did their feelings were parents of their thoughts it was the unseen and spiritual in them that determined the outward and actual their religion as i say was the great fact about them in these discourses limited as we are it will be good to direct our survey chiefly to that religious phasis of the matter that once known well all is known we have chosen as the first hero in our series odin the central figure of scandinavian paganism an emblem to us of a most extensive province of things let us look for a little at the hero as divinity the oldest primary form of heroism surely it seems a very strangelooking thing this paganism almost inconceivable to us in these days a bewildering inextricable jungle of delusions confusions falsehoods and absurdities covering the whole field of life a thing that fills us with astonishment almost if it were possible with incredulity for truly it is not easy to understand that sane men could ever calmly with their eyes open believe and live by such a set of doctrines that men should have worshipped their poor fellowman as a god and not him only but stocks and stones and all manner of animate and inanimate objects and fashioned for themselves such a distracted chaos of hallucinations by way of theory of the universe all this looks like an incredible fable nevertheless it is a clear fact that they did it such hideous inextricable jungle of misworships misbeliefs men made as we are did actually hold by and live at home in this is strange yes we may pause in sorrow and silence over the depths of darkness that are in man if we rejoice in the heights of purer vision he has attained to such things were and are in man in all men in us too some speculators have a short way of accounting for the pagan religion mere quackery priestcraft and dupery say they no sane man ever did believe it merely contrived to persuade other men not worthy of the name of sane to believe it it will be often our duty to protest against this sort of hypothesis about mens doings and history and i here on the very threshold protest against it in reference to paganism and to all other isms by which man has ever for a length of time striven to walk in this world they have all had a truth in them or men would not have taken them up quackery and dupery do abound in religions above all in the more advanced decaying stages of religions they have fearfully abounded but quackery was never the originating influence in such things it was not the health and life of such things but their disease the sure precursor of their being about to die let us never forget this it seems to me a most mournful hypothesis that of quackery giving birth to any faith even in savage men quackery gives birth to nothing gives death to all things we shall not see into the true heart of anything or if we look merely at the quackeries of it if we do not reject the quackeries altogether as mere diseases corruptions with which our and all mens sole duty is to have done with them to sweep them out of our thoughts as out of our practice man everywhere is the born enemy of lies i find grand lamaism itself to have a kind of truth in it read the candid clearsighted rather sceptical mr turners account of his embassy to that country and see they have their belief these poor thibet people that providence sends down always an incarnation of himself into every generation at bottom some belief in a kind of pope at bottom still better belief that there is a greatest man that he is discoverable that once discovered we ought to treat him with an obedience which knows no bounds this is the truth of grand lamaism the discoverability is the only error here the thibet priests have methods of their own of discovering what man is greatest fit to be supreme over them bad methods but are they so much worse than our methods of understanding him to be always the eldest born of a certain genealogy alas it is a difficult thing to find good methods for we shall begin to have a chance of understanding paganism when we first admit that to its followers it was at one time earnestly true let us consider it very certain that men did believe in paganism men with open eyes sound senses men made altogether like ourselves that we had we been there should have believed in it ask now what paganism could have been another theory somewhat more respectable attributes such things to allegory it was a play of poetic minds say these theorists a shadowingforth in allegorical fable in personification and visual form of what such poetic minds had known and felt of this universe which agrees add they with a primary law of human nature still everywhere observably at work though in less important things that what a man feels intensely he struggles to speakout of him to see represented before him in visual shape and as if with a kind of life and historical reality in it now doubtless there is such a law and it is one of the deepest in human nature neither need we doubt that it did operate fundamentally in this business the hypothesis which ascribes paganism wholly or mostly to this agency i call a little more respectable but i cannot yet call it the true hypothesis think would we believe and take with us as our lifeguidance an allegory a poetic sport not sport but earnest is what we should require it is a most earnest thing to be alive in this world to die is not sport for a man mans life never was a sport to him it was a stern reality altogether a serious matter to be alive i find therefore that though these allegory theorists are on the way towards truth in this matter they have not reached it either pagan religion is indeed an allegory a symbol of what men felt and knew about the universe and all religions are symbols of that altering always as that alters but it seems to me a radical perversion and even inversion of the business to put that forward as the origin and moving cause when it was rather the result and termination to get beautiful allegories a perfect poetic symbol was not the want of men but to know what they were to believe about this universe what course they were to steer in it what in this mysterious life of theirs they had to hope and to fear to do and to forbear doing the pilgrims progress is an allegory and a beautiful just and serious one but consider whether bunyans allegory could have preceded the faith it symbolises the faith had to be already there standing believed by everybody of which the allegory could then become a shadow and with all its seriousness we may say a sportful shadow a mere play of the fancy in comparison with that awful fact and scientific certainty which it poetically strives to emblem the allegory is the product of the certainty not the producer of it not in bunyans nor in any other case for paganism therefore we have still to inquire whence came that scientific certainty the parent of such a bewildered heap of allegories errors and confusions how was it what was it surely it were a foolish attempt to pretend explaining in this place or in any place such a phenomenon as that fardistant distracted cloudy imbroglio of paganism more like a cloudfield than a distant continent of firm land and facts it is no longer a reality yet it was one we ought to understand that this seeming cloudfield was once a reality that not poetic allegory least of all that dupery and deception was the origin of it men i say never did believe idle songs never risked their souls life on allegories men in all times especially in early earnest times have had an instinct for detecting quacks for detesting quacks let us try if leaving out both the quack theory and the allegory one and listening with affectionate attention to that faroff confused rumour of the pagan ages we cannot ascertain so much as this at least that there was a kind of fact at the heart of them that they too were not mendacious and distracted but in their own poor way true and sane you remember that fancy of platos of a man who had grown to maturity in some dark distance and was brought on a sudden into the upper air to see the sun rise what would his wonder be his rapt astonishment at the sight we daily witness with indifference with the free open sense of a child yet with the ripe faculty of a man his whole heart would be kindled by that sight he would discern it well to be godlike his soul would fall down in worship before it now just such a childlike greatness was in the primitive nations the first pagan thinker among rude men the first man that began to think was precisely this childman of platos simple open as a child yet with the depth and strength of a man nature had as yet no name to him he had not yet united under a name the infinite variety of sights sounds shapes and motions which we now collectively name universe nature or the like and so with a name dismiss it from us to the wild deephearted man all was yet new not veiled under names or formulas it stood naked flashingin on him there beautiful awful unspeakable nature was to this man what to the thinker and prophet it forever is preternatural this green flowery rockbuilt earth the trees the mountains rivers manysounding seas that great deep sea of azure that swims overhead the winds sweeping through it the black cloud fashioning itself together now pouring out fire now hail and rain what is it ay what at bottom we do not yet know we can never know at all it is not by our superior insight that we escape the difficulty it is by our superior levity our inattention our want of insight it is by not thinking that we cease to wonder at it hardened round us encasing wholly every notion we form is a wrappage of traditions hearsays mere words we call that fire of the black thundercloud electricity and lecture learnedly about it and grind the like of it out of glass and silk but what is it what made it whence comes it whither goes it science has done much for us but it is a poor science that would hide from us the great deep sacred infinitude of nescience whither we can never penetrate on which all science swims as a mere superficial film this world after all our science and sciences is still a miracle wonderful inscrutable magical and more to whosoever will think of it that great mystery of time were there no other the illimitable silent neverresting thing called time rolling rushing on swift silent like an allembracing oceantide on which we and all the universe swim like exhalations like apparitions which are and then are not this is forever very literally a miracle a thing to strike us dumb for we have no word to speak about it this universe ah me what could the wild man know of it what can we yet know that it is a force and thousandfold complexity of forces a force which is not we that is all it is not we it is altogether different from us force force everywhere force we ourselves a mysterious force in the centre of that there is not a leaf rotting on the highway but has force in it how else could it rot nay surely to the atheistic thinker if such a one were possible it must be a miracle too this huge illimitable whirlwind of force which envelops us here neverresting whirlwind high as immensity old as eternity what is it gods creation the religious people answer it is the almighty gods atheistic science babbles poorly of it with scientific nomenclatures experiments and whatnot as if it were a poor dead thing to be bottled up in leyden jars and sold over counters but the natural sense of man in all times if he will honestly apply his sense proclaims it to be a living thing ah an unspeakable godlike thing towards which the best attitude for us after never so much science is awe devout prostration and humility of soul worship if not in words then in silence but now i remark farther what in such a time as ours it requires a prophet or poet to teach us namely the strippingoff of those poor undevout wrappages nomenclatures and scientific hearsays this the ancient earnest soul as yet unencumbered with these things did for itself the world which is now divine only to the gifted was then divine to whosoever would turn his eye upon it he stood bare before it face to face all was godlike or god jean paul still finds it so the giant jean paul who has power to escape out of hearsays but there then were no hearsays canopus shiningdown over the desert with its blue diamond brightness that wild blue spiritlike brightness far brighter than we ever witness here would pierce into the heart of the wild ishmaelitish man whom it was guiding through the solitary waste there to his wild heart with all feelings in it with no speech for any feeling it may seem a little eye that canopus glancingout on him from the great deep eternity revealing the inner splendour to him cannot we understand how these men worshipped canopus became what we call sabeans worshipping the stars such is to me the secret of all forms of paganism worship is transcendent wonder wonder for which there is now no limit or measure that is worship to these primeval men all things and everything they saw exist beside them were an emblem of the godlike of some god and look what perennial fibre of truth was in that to us also through every star through every blade of grass is not a god made visible if we will open our minds and eyes we do not worship in that way now but is it not reckoned still a merit proof of what we call a poetic nature that we recognise how every object has a divine beauty in it how every object still verily is a window through which we may look into infinitude itself he that can discern the loveliness of things we call him poet painter man of genius gifted lovable these poor sabeans did even what he does in their own fashion that they did it in what fashion soever was a merit better than what the entirely stupid man did what the horse and camel did namely nothing but now if all things whatsoever that we look upon are emblems to us of the highest god i add that more so than any of them is man such an emblem you have heard of st chrysostoms celebrated saying in reference to the shekinah or ark of testimony visible revelation of god among the hebrews the true shekinah is man yes it is even so this is no vain phrase it is veritably so the essence of our being the mystery in us that calls itself i ah what words have we for such things is a breath of heaven the highest being reveals himself in man this body these faculties this life of ours is it not all as a vesture for that unnamed there is but one temple in the universe says the devout novalis and that is the body of man nothing is holier than that high form bending before men is a reverence done to this revelation in the flesh we touch heaven when we lay our hand on a human body this sounds much like a mere flourish of rhetoric but it is not so if well meditated it will turn out to be a scientific fact the expression in such words as can be had of the actual truth of the thing we are the miracle of miracles the great inscrutable mystery of god we cannot understand it we know not how to speak of it but we may feel and know if we like that it is verily so well these truths were once more readily felt than now the young generations of the world who had in them the freshness of young children and yet the depth of earnest men who did not think that they had finishedoff all things in heaven and earth by merely giving them scientific names but had to gaze direct at them there with awe and wonder they felt better what of divinity is in man and nature they without being mad could worship nature and man more than anything else in nature worship that is as i said above admire without limit this in the full use of their faculties with all sincerity of heart they could do i consider heroworship to be the grand modifying element in that ancient system of thought what i called the perplexed jungle of paganism sprang we may say out of many roots every admiration adoration of a star or natural object was a root or fibre of a root but heroworship is the deepest root of all the taproot from which in a great degree all the rest were nourished and grown and now if worship even of a star had some meaning in it how much more might that of a hero worship of a hero is transcendent admiration of a great man i say great men are still admirable i say there is at bottom nothing else admirable no nobler feeling than this of admiration for one higher than himself dwells in the breast of man it is to this hour and at all hours the vivifying influence in mans life religion i find stand upon it not paganism only but far higher and truer religions all religion hitherto known heroworship heartfelt prostrate admiration submission burning boundless for a noblest godlike form of man is not that the germ of christianity itself the greatest of all heroes is one whom we do not name here let sacred silence meditate that sacred matter you will find it the ultimate perfection of a principle extant throughout mans whole history on earth or coming into lower less unspeakable provinces is not all loyalty akin to religious faith also faith is loyalty to some inspired teacher some spiritual hero and what therefore is loyalty proper the lifebreath of all society but an effluence of heroworship submissive admiration for the truly great society is founded on heroworship all dignities of rank on which human association rests are what we may call a heroarchy government of heroes or a hierarchy for it is sacred enough withal the duke means dux leader king is knning kanning man that knows or cans society everywhere is some representation not insupportably inaccurate of a graduated worship of heroes reverence and obedience done to men really great and wise not insupportably inaccurate i say they are all as banknotes these social dignitaries all representing gold and several of them alas always are forged notes we can do with some forged false notes with a good many even but not with all or the most of them forged no there have to come revolutions then cries of democracy liberty and equality and i know not what the notes being all false and no gold to be had for them people take to crying in their despair that there is no gold that there never was any gold heroworship is nevertheless as it was always and everywhere and cannot cease till man himself ceases i am well aware that in these days heroworship the thing i call heroworship professes to have gone out and finally ceased this for reasons which it will be worth while some time to inquire into is an age that as it were denies the existence of great men denies the desirableness of great men show our critics a great man a luther for example they begin to what they call account for him not to worship him but take the dimensions of him and bring him out to be a little kind of man he was the creature of the time they say the time called him forth the time did everything he nothing but what we the little critic could have done too this seems to me but melancholy work the time call forth alas we have known times call loudly enough for their great man but not find him when they called he was not there providence had not sent him the time calling its loudest had to go down to confusion and wreck because he would not come when called for if we will think of it no time need have gone to ruin could it have found a man great enough a man wise and good enough wisdom to discern truly what the time wanted valour to lead it on the right road thither these are the salvation of any time but i liken common languid times with their unbelief distress perplexity with their languid doubting characters and embarrassed circumstances impotently crumblingdown into ever worse distress towards final ruin all this i liken to dry dead fuel waiting for the lightning out of heaven that shall kindle it the great man with his free force direct out of gods own hand is the lightning his word is the wise healing word which all can believe in all blazes round him now when he has once struck on it into fire like his own the dry mouldering sticks are thought to have called him forth they did want him greatly but as to calling him forth those are critics of small vision i think who cry see is it not the sticks that made the fire no sadder proof can be given by a man of his own littleness than disbelief in great men there is no sadder symptom of a generation than such general blindness to the spiritual lightning with faith only in the heap of barren dead fuel it is the last consummation of unbelief in all epochs of the worlds history we shall find the great man to have been the indispensable saviour of his epoch the lightning without which the fuel never would have burnt the history of the world i said already was the biography of great men such small critics do what they can to promote unbelief and universal spiritual paralysis but happily they cannot always completely succeed in all times it is possible for a man to arise great enough to feel that they and their doctrines are chimeras and cobwebs and what is notable in no time whatever can they entirely eradicate out of living mens hearts a certain altogether peculiar reverence for great men genuine admiration loyalty adoration however dim and perverted it may be heroworship endures for ever while man endures boswell venerates his johnson right truly even in the eighteenth century the unbelieving french believe in their voltaire and burstout round him into very curious heroworship in that last act of his life when they stifle him under roses it has always seemed to me extremely curious this of voltaire truly if christianity be the highest instance of heroworship then we may find here in voltaireism one of the lowest he whose life was that of a kind of antichrist does again on this side exhibit a curious contrast no people ever were so little prone to admire at all as those french of voltaire persiflage was the character of their whole mind adoration had nowhere a place in it yet see the old man of ferney comes up to paris an old tottering infirm man of eightyfour years they feel that he too is a kind of hero that he has spent his life in opposing error and injustice delivering calases unmasking hypocrites in high places in short that he too though in a strange way has fought like a valiant man they feel withal that if persiflage be the great thing there never was such a persifleur he is the realised ideal of every one of them the thing they are all wanting to be of all frenchmen the most french he is properly their god such god as they are fit for accordingly all persons from the queen antoinette to the douanier at the porte st denis do they not worship him people of quality disguise themselves as tavernwaiters the matre de poste with a broad oath orders his postillion va bon train thou art driving m de voltaire at paris his carriage is the nucleus of a comet whose train fills whole streets the ladies pluck a hair or two from his fur to keep it as a sacred relic there was nothing highest beautifulest noblest in all france that did not feel this man to be higher beautifuler nobler yes from norse odin to english samuel johnson from the divine founder of christianity to the withered pontiff of encyclopedism in all times and places the hero has been worshipped it will ever be so we all love great men love venerate and bow down submissive before great men nay can we honestly bow down to anything else ah does not every true man feel that he is himself made higher by doing reverence to what is really above him no nobler or more blessed feeling dwells in mans heart and to me it is very cheering to consider that no sceptical logic or general triviality insincerity and aridity of any time and its influences can destroy this noble inborn loyalty and worship that is in man in times of unbelief which soon have to become times of revolution much downrushing sorrowful decay and ruin is visible to everybody for myself in these days i seem to see in this indestructibility of heroworship the everlasting adamant lower than which the confused wreck of revolutionary things cannot fall the confused wreck of things crumbling and even crashing and tumbling all round us in these revolutionary ages will get down so far no farther it is an eternal cornerstone from which they can begin to build themselves up again that man in some sense or other worships heroes that we all of us reverence and must ever reverence great men this is to me the living rock amid all rushingsdown whatsoever the one fixed point in modern revolutionary history otherwise as if bottomless and shoreless so much of truth only under an ancient obsolete vesture but the spirit of it still true do i find in the paganism of old nations nature is still divine the revelation of the workings of god the hero is still worshipable this under poor cramped incipient forms is what all pagan religions have struggled as they could to set forth i think scandinavian paganism to us here is more interesting than any other it is for one thing the latest it continued in these regions of europe till the eleventh century eighthundred years ago the norwegians were still worshippers of odin it is interesting also as the creed of our fathers the men whose blood still runs in our veins whom doubtless we still resemble in so many ways strange they did believe that while we believe so differently let us look a little at this poor norse creed for many reasons we have tolerable means to do it for there is another point of interest in these scandinavian mythologies that they have been preserved so well in that strange island iceland burstup the geologists say by fire from the bottom of the sea a wild land of barrenness and lava swallowed many months of every year in black tempests yet with a wild gleaming beauty in summertime towering up there stern and grim in the north ocean with its snow jokuls roaring geysers sulphurpools and horrid volcanic chasms like the waste chaotic battlefield of frost and fire where of all places we least looked for literature or written memorials the record of these things was written down on the seaboard of this wild land is a rim of grassy country where cattle can subsist and men by means of them and of what the sea yields and it seems they were poetic men these men who had deep thoughts in them and uttered musically their thoughts much would be lost had iceland not been burstup from the sea not been discovered by the northmen the old norse poets were many of them natives of iceland smund one of the early christian priests there who perhaps had a lingering fondness for paganism collected certain of their old pagan songs just about becoming obsolete then poems or chants of a mythic prophetic mostly all of a religious character that is what norse critics call the elder or poetic edda edda a word of uncertain etymology is thought to signify ancestress snorro sturleson an iceland gentleman an extremely notable personage educated by this smunds grandson took in hand next near a century afterwards to put together among several other books he wrote a kind of prose synopsis of the whole mythology elucidated by new fragments of traditionary verse a work constructed really with great ingenuity native talent what one might call unconscious art altogether a perspicuous clear work pleasant reading still this is the younger or prose edda by these and the numerous other sagas mostly icelandic with the commentaries icelandic or not which go on zealously in the north to this day it is possible to gain some direct insight even yet and see that old norse system of belief as it were face to face let us forget that it is erroneous religion let us look at it as old thought and try if we cannot sympathise with it somewhat the primary characteristic of this old northland mythology i find to be impersonation of the visible workings of nature earnest simple recognition of the workings of physical nature as a thing wholly miraculous stupendous and divine what we now lecture of as science they wondered at and fell down in awe before as religion the dark hostile powers of nature they figure to themselves as jtuns giants huge shaggy beings of a demonic character frost fire seatempest these are jtuns the friendly powers again as summerheat the sun are gods the empire of this universe is divided between these two they dwell apart in perennial internecine feud the gods dwell above in asgard the garden of the asen or divinities jtunheim a distant dark chaotic land is the home of the jtuns curious all this and not idle or inane if we will look at the foundation of it the power of fire or flame for instance which we designate by some trivial chemical name thereby hiding from ourselves the essential character of wonder that dwells in it as in all things is with these old northmen loke a most swift subtle demon of the brood of the jtuns the savages of the ladrones islands too say some spanish voyagers thought fire which they never had seen before was a devil or god that bit you sharply when you touched it and that lived upon dry wood from us too no chemistry if it had not stupidity to help it would hide that flame is a wonder what is flame frost the old norse seer discerns to be a monstrous hoary jtun the giant thrym hrym or rime the old word now nearly obsolete here but still used in scotland to signify hoarfrost rime was not then as now a dead chemical thing but a living jtun or devil the monstrous jtun rime drove home his horses at night sat combing their manes which horses were hailclouds or fleet frostwinds his cows no not his but a kinsmans the giant hymirs cows are icebergs this hymir looks at the rocks with his devileye and they split in the glance of it thunder was not then mere electricity vitreous or resinous it was the god donner thunder or thor god also of beneficent summerheat the thunder was his wrath the gathering of the black clouds is the drawing down of thors angry brows the firebolt bursting out of heaven is the allrending hammer flung from the hand of thor he urges his loud chariot over the mountaintops that is the peal wrathful he blows in his red beard that is the rustling stormblast before the thunder begin balder again the white god the beautiful the just and benignant whom the early christian missionaries found to resemble christ is the sun beautifulest of visible things wondrous too and divine still after all our astronomies and almanacs but perhaps the notablest god we hear tellof is one of whom grimm the german etymologist finds trace the god wnsch or wish the god wish who could give us all that we wished is not this the sincerest yet rudest voice of the spirit of man the rudest ideal that man ever formed which still shows itself in the latest forms of our spiritual culture higher considerations have to teach us that the god wish is not the true god of the other gods or jtuns i will mention only for etymologys sake that seatempest is the jtun aegir a very dangerous jtun and now to this day on our river trent as i learn the nottingham bargemen when the river is in a certain flooded state a kind of backwater or eddying swirl it has very dangerous to them call it eager they cry out have a care there is the eager coming curious that word surviving like the peak of a submerged world the oldest nottingham bargemen had believed in the god aegir indeed our english blood too in good part is danish norse or rather at bottom danish and norse and saxon have no distinction except a superficial one as of heathen and christian or the like but all over our island we are mingled largely with danes proper from the incessant invasions there were and this of course in a greater proportion along the east coast and greatest of all as i find in the north country from the humber upwards all over scotland the speech of the common people is still in a singular degree icelandic its germanism has still a peculiar norse tinge they too are normans northmen if that be any great beauty of the chief god odin we shall speak by and by mark at present so much what the essence of scandinavian and indeed of all paganism is a recognition of the forces of nature as godlike stupendous personal agencies as gods and demons not inconceivable to us it is the infant thought of man opening itself with awe and wonder on this everstupendous universe to me there is in the norse system something very genuine very great and manlike a broad simplicity rusticity so very different from the light gracefulness of the old greek paganism distinguishes this scandinavian system it is thought the genuine thought of deep rude earnest minds fairly opened to the things about them a facetoface and hearttoheart inspection of the things the first characteristic of all good thought in all times not graceful lightness halfsport as in the greek paganism a certain homely truthfulness and rustic strength a great rude sincerity discloses itself here it is strange after our beautiful apollo statues and clear smiling mythuses to come down upon the norse gods brewing ale to hold their feast with aegir the seajtun sending out thor to get the caldron for them in the jtun country thor after many adventures clapping the pot on his head like a huge hat and walking off with it quite lost in it the ears of the pot reaching down to his heels a kind of vacant hugeness large awkward gianthood characterises that norse system enormous force as yet altogether untutored stalking helpless with large uncertain strides consider only their primary mythus of the creation the gods having got the giant ymer slain a giant made by warm wind and much confused work out of the conflict of frost and fire determined on constructing a world with him his blood made the sea his flesh was the land the rocks his bones of his eyebrows they formed asgard their godsdwelling his skull was the great blue vault of immensity and the brains of it became the clouds what a hyperbrobdignagian business untamed thought great giantlike enormous to be tamed in due time into the compact greatness not giantlike but godlike and stronger than gianthood of the shakspeares the goethes spiritually as well as bodily these men are our progenitors i like too that representation they have of the tree igdrasil all life is figured by them as a tree igdrasil the ashtree of existence has its roots deepdown in the kingdoms of hela or death its trunk reaches up heavenhigh spreads its boughs over the whole universe it is the tree of existence at the foot of it in the deathkingdom sit three nornas fates the past present future watering its roots from the sacred well its boughs with their buddings and disleafings events things suffered things done catastrophes stretch through all lands and times is not every leaf of it a biography every fibre there an act or word its boughs are histories of nations the rustle of it is the noise of human existence onwards from of old it grows there the breath of human passion rustling through it or stormtost the stormwind howling through it like the voice of all the gods it is igdrasil the tree of existence it is the past the present and the future what was done what is doing what will be done the infinite conjugation of the verb to do considering how human things circulate each inextricably in communion with all how the word i speak to you today is borrowed not from ulfila the moesogoth only but from all men since the first man began to speak i find no similitude so true as this of a tree beautiful altogether beautiful and great the machine of the universe alas do but think of that in contrast well it is strange enough this old norse view of nature different enough from what we believe of nature whence it specially came one would not like to be compelled to say very minutely one thing we may say it came from the thoughts of norse men from the thought above all of the first norse man who had an original power of thinking the first norse man of genius as we should call him innumerable men had passed by across this universe with a dumb vague wonder such as the very animals may feel or with a painful fruitlessly inquiring wonder such as men only feel till the great thinker came the original man the seer whose shaped spoken thought awakes the slumbering capability of all into thought it is ever the way with the thinker the spiritual hero what he says all men were not far from saying were longing to say the thoughts of all start up as from painful enchanted sleep round his thought answering to it yes even so joyful to men as the dawning of day from night is it not indeed the awakening for them from nobeing into being from death into life we still honour such a man call him poet genius and so forth but to these wild men he was a very magician a worker of miraculous unexpected blessing for them a prophet a god thought once awakened does not again slumber unfolds itself into a system of thought grows in man after man generation after generation till its full stature is reached and such system of thought can grow no farther but must give place to another for the norse people the man now named odin and chief norse god we fancy was such a man a teacher and captain of soul and of body a hero of worth immeasurable admiration for whom transcending the known bounds became adoration has he not the power of articulate thinking and many other powers as yet miraculous so with boundless gratitude would the rude norse heart feel has he not solved for them the sphinxenigma of this universe given assurance to them of their own destiny there by him they know now what they have to do here what to look for hereafter existence has become articulate melodious by him he first has made life alive we may call this odin the origin of norse mythology odin or whatever name the first norse thinker bore while he was a man among men his view of the universe once promulgated a like view starts into being in all minds grows keeps ever growing while it continues credible there in all minds it lay written but invisibly as in sympathetic ink at his word it starts into visibility in all nay in every epoch of the world the great event parent of all others is it not the arrival of a thinker in the world one other thing we must not forget it will explain a little the confusion of these norse eddas they are not one coherent system of thought but properly the summation of several successive systems all this of the old norse belief which is flungout for us in one level of distance in the edda like a picture painted on the same canvas does not at all stand so in the reality it stands rather at all manner of distances and depths of successive generations since the belief first began all scandinavian thinkers since the first of them contributed to the scandinavian system of thought in evernew elaboration and addition it is the combined work of them all what history it had how it changed from shape to shape by one thinkers contribution after another till it got to the full final shape we see it under in the edda no man will now ever know its councils of trebisond councils of trent athanasiuses dantes luthers are sunk without echo in the dark night only that it had such a history we can all know wheresoever a thinker appeared there in the thing he thoughtof was a contribution accession a change or revolution made alas the grandest revolution of all the one made by the man odin himself is not this too sunk for us like the rest of odin what history strange rather to reflect that he had a history that this odin in his wild norse vesture with his wild beard and eyes his rude norse speech and ways was a man like us with our sorrows joys with our limbs features intrinsically all one as we and did such a work but the work much of it has perished the worker all to the name wednesday men will say tomorrow odins day of odin there exists no history no document of it no guess about it worth repeating snorro indeed in the quietest manner almost in a brief business style writes down in his heimskringla how odin was a heroic prince in the blacksea region with twelve peers and a great people straitened for room how he led these asen asiatics of his out of asia settled them in the north parts of europe by warlike conquest invented letters poetry and so forth and came by and by to be worshipped as chief god by these scandinavians his twelve peers made into twelve sons of his own gods like himself snorro has no doubt of this saxo grammaticus a very curious northman of that same century is still more unhesitating scruples not to find out a historical fact in every individual mythus and writes it down as a terrestrial event in denmark or elsewhere torfus learned and cautious some centuries later assigns by calculation a date for it odin he says came into europe about the year before christ of all which as grounded on mere uncertainties found to be untenable now i need say nothing far very far beyond the year odins date adventures whole terrestrial history figure and environment are sunk from us forever into unknown thousands of years nay grimm the german antiquary goes so far as to deny that any man odin ever existed he proves it by etymology the word wuotan which is the original form of odin a word spread as name of their chief divinity over all the teutonic nations everywhere this word which connects itself according to grimm with the latin vadere with the english wade and suchlike means primarily movement source of movement power and is the fit name of the highest god not of any man the word signifies divinity he says among the old saxon german and all teutonic nations the adjectives formed from it all signify divine supreme or something pertaining to the chief god like enough we must bow to grimm in matters etymological let us consider it fixed that wuotan means wading force of movement and now still what hinders it from being the name of a heroic man and mover as well as of a god as for the adjectives and words formed from it did not the spaniards in their universal admiration for lope get into the habit of saying a lope flower a lope dama if the flower or woman were of surpassing beauty had this lasted lope would have grown in spain to be an adjective signifying godlike also indeed adam smith in his essay on language surmises that all adjectives whatsoever were formed precisely in that way some very green thing chiefly notable for its greenness got the appellative name green and then the next thing remarkable for that quality a tree for instance was named the green tree as we still say the steam coach fourhorse coach or the like all primary adjectives according to smith were formed in this way were at first substantives and things we cannot annihilate a man for etymologies like that surely there was a first teacher and captain surely there must have been an odin palpable to the sense at one time no adjective but a real hero of flesh and blood the voice of all tradition history or echo of history agrees with all that thought will teach one about it to assure us of this how the man odin came to be considered a god the chief god that surely is a question which nobody would wish to dogmatise upon i have said his people knew no limits to their admiration of him they had as yet no scale to measure admiration by fancy your own generous heartslove of some greatest man expanding till it transcended all bounds till it filled and overflowed the whole field of your thought or what if this man odin since a great deep soul with the afflatus and mysterious tide of vision and impulse rushing on him he knows not whence is ever an enigma a kind of terror and wonder to himself should have felt that perhaps he was divine that he was some effluence of the wuotan movement supreme power and divinity of whom to his rapt vision all nature was the awful flameimage that some effluence of wuotan dwelt here in him he was not necessarily false he was but mistaken speaking the truest he knew a great soul any sincere soul knows not what he is alternates between the highest height and the lowest depth can of all things the least measure himself what others take him for and what he guesses that he may be these two items strangely act on one another help to determine one another with all men reverently admiring him with his own wild soul full of noble ardours and affections of whirlwind chaotic darkness and glorious new light a divine universe bursting all into godlike beauty round him and no man to whom the like ever had befallen what could he think himself to be wuotan all men answered wuotan and then consider what mere time will do in such cases how if a man was great while living he becomes tenfold greater when dead what an enormous cameraobscura magnifier is tradition how a thing grows in the human memory in the human imagination when love worship and all that lies in the human heart is there to encourage it and in the darkness in the entire ignorance without date or document no book no arundelmarble only here and there some dumb monumental cairn why in thirty or forty years were there no books any great man would grow mythic the contemporaries who had once seen him being all dead and in threehundred years and threethousand years to attempt theorising on such matters would profit little they are matters which refuse to be theoremed and diagramed which logic ought to know that she cannot speak of enough for us to discern far in the uttermost distance some gleam as of a small real light shining in the centre of that enormous cameraobscura image to discern that the centre of it all was not a madness and nothing but a sanity and something this light kindled in the great dark vortex of the norse mind dark but living waiting only for light this is to me the centre of the whole how such light will then shine out and with wondrous thousandfold expansion spread itself in forms and colours depends not on it so much as on the national mind recipient of it the colours and forms of your light will be those of the cutglass it has to shine through curious to think how for every man any the truest fact is modelled by the nature of the man i said the earnest man speaking to his brother men must always have stated what seemed to him a fact a real appearance of nature but the way in which such appearance or fact shaped itself what sort of fact it became for him was and is modified by his own laws of thinking deep subtle but universal everoperating laws the world of nature for every man is the phantasy of himself this world is the multiplex image of his own dream who knows to what unnameable subtleties of spiritual law all these pagan fables owe their shape the number twelve divisiblest of all which could be halved quartered parted into three into six the most remarkable number this was enough to determine the signs of the zodiac the number of odins sons and innumerable other twelves any vague rumour of number had a tendency to settle itself into twelve so with regard to every other matter and quite unconsciously too with no notion of buildingup allegories but the fresh clear glance of those first ages would be prompt in discerning the secret relations of things and wholly open to obey these schiller finds in the cestus of venus an everlasting sthetic truth as to the nature of all beauty curious but he is careful not to insinuate that the old greek mythists had any notion of lecturing about the philosophy of criticismon the whole we must leave those boundless regions cannot we conceive that odin was a reality error indeed error enough but sheer falsehood idle fables allegory aforethought we will not believe that our fathers believed in these odins runes are a significant feature of him runes and the miracles of magic he worked by them make a great feature in tradition runes are the scandinavian alphabet suppose odin to have been the inventor of letters as well as magic among that people it is the greatest invention man has ever made this of marking down the unseen thought that is in him by written characters it is a kind of second speech almost as miraculous as the first you remember the astonishment and incredulity of atahualpa the peruvian king how he made the spanish soldier who was guarding him scratch dios on his thumbnail that he might try the next soldier with it to ascertain whether such a miracle was possible if odin brought letters among his people he might work magic enough writing by runes has some air of being original among the norsemen not a phoenician alphabet but a native scandinavian one snorro tells us farther that odin invented poetry the music of human speech as well as that miraculous runic marking of it transport yourselves into the early childhood of nations the first beautiful morninglight of our europe when all yet lay in fresh young radiance as of a great sunrise and our europe was first beginning to think to be wonder hope infinite radiance of hope and wonder as of a young childs thoughts in the hearts of these strong men strong sons of nature and here was not only a wild captain and fighter discerning with his wild flashing eyes what to do with his wild lionheart daring and doing it but a poet too all that we mean by a poet prophet great devout thinker and inventor as the truly great man ever is a hero is a hero at all points in the soul and thought of him first of all this odin in his rude semiarticulate way had a word to speak a great heart laid open to take in this great universe and mans life here and utter a great word about it a hero as i say in his own rude manner a wise gifted noblehearted man and now if we still admire such a man beyond all others what must these wild norse souls first awakened into thinking have made of him to them as yet without names for it he was noble and noblest hero prophet god wuotan the greatest of all thought is thought however it speak or spell itself intrinsically i conjecture this odin must have been of the same sort of stuff as the greatest kind of men a great thought in the wild deep heart of him the rough words he articulated are they not the rudimental roots of those english words we still use he worked so in that obscure element but he was as a light kindled in it a light of intellect rude nobleness of heart the only kind of lights we have yet a hero as i say and he had to shine there and make his obscure element a little lighter as is still the task of us all we will fancy him to be the type norseman the finest teuton whom that race had yet produced the rude norse heart burstup into boundless admiration round him into adoration he is as a root of so many great things the fruit of him is found growing from deep thousands of years over the whole field of teutonic life our own wednesday as i said is it not still odins day wednesbury wansborough wanstead wandsworth odin grew into england too these are still leaves from that root he was the chief god to all the teutonic peoples their pattern norseman in such way did they admire their pattern norseman that was the fortune he had in the world thus if the man odin himself have vanished utterly there is this huge shadow of him which still projects itself over the whole history of his people for this odin once admitted to be god we can understand well that the whole scandinavian scheme of nature or dim noscheme whatever it might before have been would now begin to develop itself altogether differently and grow thenceforth in a new manner what this odin saw into and taught with his runes and his rhymes the whole teutonic people laid to heart and carried forward his way of thought became their way of thought such under new conditions is the history of every great thinker still in gigantic confused lineaments like some enormous cameraobscura shadow thrown upwards from the dead deeps of the past and covering the whole northern heaven is not that scandinavian mythology in some sort the portraiture of this man odin the gigantic image of his natural face legible or not legible there expanded and confused in that manner ah thought i say is always thought no great man lives in vain the history of the world is but the biography of great men to me there is something very touching in this primeval figure of heroism in such artless helpless but hearty entire reception of a hero by his fellowmen never so helpless in shape it is the noblest of feelings and a feeling in some shape or other perennial as man himself if i could show in any measure what i feel deeply for a long time now that it is the vital element of manhood the soul of mans history here in our world it would be the chief use of this discoursing at present we do not now call our great men gods nor admire without limit ah no with limit enough but if we have no great men or do not admire at all that were a still worse case this poor scandinavian heroworship that whole norse way of looking at the universe and adjusting oneself there has an indestructible merit for us a rude childlike way of recognising the divineness of nature the divineness of man most rude yet heartfelt robust giantlike betokening what a giant of a man this child would grow to it was a truth and is none is it not as the halfdumb stifled voice of the longburied generations of our own fathers calling out of the depths of ages to us in whose veins their blood still runs this then this is what we made of the world this is all the image and notion we could form to ourselves of this great mystery of a life and universe despise it not you are raised high above it to large free scope of vision but you too are not yet at the top no your notion too so much enlarged is but a partial imperfect one that matter is a thing no man will ever in time or out of time comprehend after thousands of years of evernew expansion man will find himself but struggling to comprehend again a part of it the thing is larger than man not to be comprehended by him an infinite thing the essence of the scandinavian as indeed of all pagan mythologies we found to be recognition of the divineness of nature sincere communion of man with the mysterious invisible powers visibly seen at work in the world round him this i should say is more sincerely done in the scandinavian than in any mythology i know sincerity is the great characteristic of it superior sincerity far superior consoles us for the total want of old grecian grace sincerity i think is better than grace i feel that these old northmen were looking into nature with open eye and soul most earnest honest childlike and yet manlike with a greathearted simplicity and depth and freshness in a true loving admiring unfearing way a right valiant true old race of men such recognition of nature one finds to be the chief element of paganism recognition of man and his moral duty though this too is not wanting comes to be the chief element only in purer forms of religion here indeed is a great distinction and epoch in human beliefs a great landmark in the religious development of mankind man first puts himself in relation with nature and her powers wonders and worships over those not till a later epoch does he discern that all power is moral that the grand point is the distinction for him of good and evil of thou shalt and thou shalt not with regard to all these fabulous delineations in the edda i will remark moreover as indeed was already hinted that most probably they must have been of much newer date most probably even from the first were comparatively idle for the old norsemen and as it were a kind of poetic sport allegory and poetic delineation as i said above cannot be religious faith the faith itself must first be there then allegory enough will gather round it as the fit body round its soul the norse faith i can well suppose like other faiths was most active while it lay mainly in the silent state and had not yet much to say about itself still less to sing among those shadowy edda matters amid all that fantastic congeries of assertions and traditions in their musical mythologies the main practical belief a man could have was probably not much more than this of the valkyrs and the hall of odin of an inflexible destiny and that the one thing needful for a man was to be brave the valkyrs are choosers of the slain a destiny inexorable which it is useless trying to bend or soften has appointed who is to be slain this was a fundamental point for the norse believer as indeed it is for all earnest men everywhere for a mahomet a luther for a napoleon too it lies at the basis this for every such man it is the woof out of which his whole system of thought is woven the valkyrs and then that these choosers lead the brave to a heavenly hall of odin only the base and slavish being thrust elsewhither into the realms of hela the deathgoddess i take this to have been the soul of the whole norse belief they understood in their heart that it was indispensable to be brave that odin would have no favour for them but despise and thrust them out if they were not brave consider too whether there is not something in this it is an everlasting duty valid in our day as in that the duty of being brave valour is still value the first duty of a man is still that of subduing fear we must get rid of fear we cannot act at all till then a mans acts are slavish not true but specious his very thoughts are false he thinks too as a slave and coward till he have got fear under his feet odins creed if we disentangle the real kernel of it is true to this hour a man shall and must be valiant he must march forward and quit himself like a man trusting imperturbably in the appointment and choice of the upper powers and on the whole not fear at all now and always the completeness of his victory over fear will determine how much of a man he is it is doubtless very savage that kind of valour of the old northmen snorro tells us they thought it a shame and misery not to die in battle and if natural death seemed to be coming on they would cut wounds in their flesh that odin might receive them as warriors slain old kings about to die had their body laid into a ship the ship sent forth with sails set and slow fire burning it that once out at sea it might blazeup in flame and in such manner bury worthily the old hero at once in the sky and in the ocean wild bloody valour yet valour of its kind better i say than none in the old seakings too what an indomitable rugged energy silent with closed lips as i fancy them unconscious that they were specially brave defying the wild ocean with its monsters and all men and things progenitors of our own blakes and nelsons no homer sang these norse seakings but agamemnons was a small audacity and of small fruit in the world to some of them to hrolfs of normandy for instance hrolf or rollo duke of normandy the wild seaking has a share in governing england at this hour nor was it altogether nothing even that wild searoving and battling through so many generations it needed to be ascertained which was the strongest kind of men who were to be ruler over whom among the northland sovereigns too i find some who got the title woodcutter forestfelling kings much lies in that i suppose at bottom many of them were forestfellers as well as fighters though the skalds talk mainly of the latter misleading certain critics not a little for no nation of men could ever live by fighting alone there could not produce enough come out of that i suppose the right good fighter was oftenest also the right good forestfeller the right good improver discerner doer and worker in every kind for true valour different enough from ferocity is the basis of all a more legitimate kind of valour that showing itself against the untamed forests and dark brute powers of nature to conquer nature for us in the same direction have not we their descendants since carried it far may such valour last forever with us that the man odin speaking with a heros voice and heart as with an impressiveness out of heaven told his people the infinite importance of valour how man thereby became a god and that his people feeling a response to it in their own hearts believed this message of his and thought it a message out of heaven and him a divinity for telling it them this seems to me the primary seedgrain of the norse religion from which all manner of mythologies symbolic practices speculations allegories songs and sagas would naturally grow grow how strangely i called it a small light shining and shaping in the huge vortex of norse darkness yet the darkness itself was alive consider that it was the eager inarticulate uninstructed mind of the whole norse people longing only to become articulate to go on articulating ever farther the living doctrine grows grows like a banyantree the first seed is the essential thing any branch strikes itself down into the earth becomes a new root and so in endless complexity we have a whole wood a whole jungle one seed the parent of it all was not the whole norse religion accordingly in some sense what we called the enormous shadow of this mans likeness critics trace some affinity in some norse mythuses of the creation and suchlike with those of the hindoos the cow adumbla licking the rime from the rocks has a kind of hindoo look a hindoo cow transported into frosty countries probably enough indeed we may say undoubtedly these things will have a kindred with the remotest lands with the earliest times thought does not die but only is changed the first man that began to think in this planet of ours he was the beginner of all and then the second man and the third man nay every true thinker to this hour is a kind of odin teaches men his way of thought spreads a shadow of his own likeness over sections of the history of the world of the distinctive poetic character or merit of this norse mythology i have not room to speak nor does it concern us much some wild prophecies we have as the vluspa in the elder edda of a rapt earnest sibylline sort but they were comparatively an idle adjunct of the matter men who as it were but toyed with the matter these later skalds and it is their songs chiefly that survive in later centuries i suppose they would go on singing poetically symbolising as our modern painters paint when it was no longer from the innermost heart or not from the heart at all this is everywhere to be well kept in mind grays fragments of norse lore at any rate will give one no notion of it any more than pope will of homer it is no squarebuilt gloomy palace of black ashlar marble shrouded in awe and horror as gray gives it us no rough as the north rocks as the iceland deserts it is with a heartiness homeliness even a tint of good humour and robust mirth in the middle of these fearful things the strong old norse heart did not go upon theatrical sublimities they had not time to tremble i like much their robust simplicity their veracity directness of conception thor draws down his brows in a veritable norse rage grasps his hammer till the knuckles grow white beautiful traits of pity too an honest pity balder the white god dies the beautiful benignant he is the sungod they try all nature for a remedy but he is dead frigga his mother sends hermoder to seek or see him nine days and nine nights he rides through gloomy deep valleys a labyrinth of gloom arrives at the bridge with its gold roof the keeper says yes balder did pass here but the kingdom of the dead is down yonder far towards the north hermoder rides on leaps hellgate helas gate does see balder and speak with him balder cannot be delivered inexorable hela will not for odin or any god give him up the beautiful and gentle has to remain there his wife had volunteered to go with him to die with him they shall forever remain there he sends his ring to odin nanna his wife sends her thimble to frigga as a remembrance ah me for indeed valour is the fountain of pity too of truth and all that is great and good in man the robust homely vigour of the norse heart attaches one much in these delineations is it not a trait of right honest strength says uhland who has written a fine essay on thor that the old norse heart finds its friend in the thundergod that it is not frightened away by his thunder but finds that summerheat the beautiful noble summer must and will have thunder withal the norse heart loves this thor and his hammerbolt sports with him thor is summerheat the god of peaceable industry as well as thunder he is the peasants friend his true henchman and attendant is thialfi manual labour thor himself engages in all manner of rough manual work scorns no business for its plebeianism is ever and anon travelling to the country of the jtuns harrying those chaotic frostmonsters subduing them at least straitening and damaging them there is a great broad humour in some of these things thor as we saw above goes to jtunland to seek hymirs caldron that the gods may brew beer hymir the huge giant enters his grey beard all full of hoarfrost splits pillars with the very glance of his eye thor after much rough tumult snatches the pot claps it on his head the handles of it reach down to his heels the norse skald has a kind of loving sport with thor this is the hymir whose cattle the critics have discovered are icebergs huge untutored brobdignag genius needing only to be tameddown into shakspeares dantes goethes it is all gone now that old norse work thor the thundergod changed into jack the giantkiller but the mind that made it is here yet how strangely things grow and die and do not die there are twigs of that great worldtree of norse belief still curiously traceable this poor jack of the nursery with his miraculous shoes of swiftness coat of darkness sword of sharpness he is one hynde etin and still more decisively red etin of ireland in the scottish ballads these are both derived from norseland etin is evidently a jtun nay shakspeares hamlet is a twig too of this same worldtree there seems no doubt of that hamlet amleth i find is really a mythic personage and his tragedy of the poisoned father poisoned asleep by drops in his ear and the rest is a norse mythus old saxo as his wont was made it a danish history shakspeare out of saxo made it what we see that is a twig of the worldtree that has grown i think by nature or accident that one has grown in fact these old norse songs have a truth in them an inward perennial truth and greatness as indeed all must have that can very long preserve itself by tradition alone it is a greatness not of mere body and gigantic bulk but a rude greatness of soul there is a sublime uncomplaining melancholy traceable in these old hearts a great free glance into the very deeps of thought they seem to have seen these brave old northmen what meditation has taught all men in all ages that this world is after all but a show a phenomenon or appearance no real thing all deep souls see into that the hindoo mythologist the german philosopher the shakspeare the earnest thinker wherever he may be we are such stuff as dreams are made of one of thors expeditions to utgard the outer garden central seat of jtunland is remarkable in this respect thialfi was with him and loke after various adventures they entered upon giantland wandered over plains wild uncultivated places among stones and trees at nightfall they noticed a house and as the door which indeed formed one whole side of the house was open they entered it was a simple habitation one large hall altogether empty they stayed there suddenly in the dead of the night loud noises alarmed them thor grasped his hammer stood in the door prepared for fight his companions within ran hither and thither in their terror seeking some outlet in that rude hall they found a little closet at last and took refuge there neither had thor any battle for lo in the morning it turnedout that the noise had been only the snoring of a certain enormous but peaceable giant the giant skrymir who lay peaceably sleeping near by and this that they took for a house was merely his glove thrown aside there the door was the glovewrist the little closet they had fled into was the thumb such a glove i remark too that it had not fingers as ours have but only a thumb and the rest undivided a most ancient rustic glove skrymir now carried their portmanteau all day thor however had his own suspicions did not like the ways of skrymir determined at night to put an end to him as he slept raising his hammer he struck down into the giants face a right thunderbolt blow of force to rend rocks the giant merely awoke rubbed his cheek and said did a leaf fall again thor struck so soon as skrymir again slept a better blow than before but the giant only murmured was that a grain of sand thors third stroke was with both his hands the knuckles white i suppose and seemed to dint deep into skrymirs visage but he merely checked his snore and remarked there must be sparrows roosting in this tree i think what is that they have dropt at the gate of utgard a place so high that you had to strain your neck bending back to see the top of it skrymir went his ways thor and his companions were admitted invited to take share in the games going on to thor for his part they handed a drinkinghorn it was a common feat they told him to drink this dry at one draught long and fiercely three times over thor drank but made hardly any impression he was a weak child they told him could he lift that cat he saw there small as the feat seemed thor with his whole godlike strength could not he bentup the creatures back could not raise its feet off the ground could at the utmost raise one foot why you are no man said the utgard people there is an old woman that will wrestle you thor heartily ashamed seized this haggard old woman but could not throw her and now on their quitting utgard the chief jtun escorting them politely a little way said to thor you are beaten then yet be not so much ashamed there was deception of appearance in it that horn you tried to drink was the sea you did make it ebb but who could drink that the bottomless the cat you would have lifted why that is the midgardsnake the great worldserpent which tail in mouth girds and keepsup the whole created world had you torn that up the world must have rushed to ruin as for the old woman she was time old age duration with her what can wrestle no man nor no god with her gods or men she prevails over all and then those three strokes you struck look at these three valleys your three strokes made these thor looked at his attendant jtun it was skrymir it was say norse critics the old chaotic rocky earth in person and that glovehouse was some earthcavern but skrymir had vanished utgard with its skyhigh gates when thor grasped his hammer to smite them had gone to air only the giants voice was heard mocking better come no more to jtunheim this is of the allegoric period as we see and half play not of the prophetic and entirely devout but as a mythus is there not real antique norse gold in it more true metal rough from the mimerstithy than in many a famed greek mythus shaped far better a great broad brobdignag grin of true humour is in this skrymir mirth resting on earnestness and sadness as the rainbow on black tempest only a right valiant heart is capable of that it is the grim humour of our own ben jonson rare old ben runs in the blood of us i fancy for one catches tones of it under a still other shape out of the american backwoods that is also a very striking conception that of the ragnark consummation or twilight of the gods it is in the vluspa song seemingly a very old prophetic idea the gods and jtuns the divine powers and the chaotic brute ones after long contest and partial victory by the former meet at last in universal worldembracing wrestle and duel worldserpent against thor strength against strength mutually extinctive and ruin twilight sinking into darkness swallows the created universe the old universe with its gods is sunk but it is not final death there is to be a new heaven and a new earth a higher supreme god and justice to reign among men curious this law of mutation which also is a law written in mans inmost thought had been deciphered by these old earnest thinkers in their rude style and how though all dies and even gods die yet all death is but a phoenix firedeath and newbirth into the greater and the better it is the fundamental law of being for a creature made of time living in this place of hope all earnest men have seen into it may still see into it and now connected with this let us glance at the last mythus of the appearance of thor and end there i fancy it to be the latest in date of all these fables a sorrowing protest against the advance of christianity set forth reproachfully by some conservative pagan king olaf has been harshly blamed for his overzeal in introducing christianity surely i should have blamed him far more for an underzeal in that he paid dear enough for it he died by the revolt of his pagan people in battle in the year at stickelstad near that drontheim where the chief cathedral of the north has now stood for many centuries dedicated gratefully to his memory as saint olaf the mythus about thor is to this effect king olaf the christian reform king is sailing with fit escort along the shore of norway from haven to haven dispensing justice or doing other royal work on leaving a certain haven it is found that a stranger of grave eyes and aspect red beard of stately robust figure has stept in the courtiers address him his answers surprise by their pertinency and depth at length he is brought to the king the strangers conversation here is not less remarkable as they sail along the beautiful shore but after some time he addresses king olaf thus yes king olaf it is all beautiful with the sun shining on it there green fruitful a right fair home for you and many a sore day had thor many a wild fight with the rock jtuns before he could make it so and now you seem minded to put away thor king olaf have a care said the stranger drawingdown his brows and when they looked again he was nowhere to be found this is the last appearance of thor on the stage of this world do we not see well enough how the fable might arise without unveracity on the part of any one it is the way most gods have come to appear among men thus if in pindars time neptune was seen once at the nemean games what was this neptune too but a stranger of noble grave aspect fit to be seen there is something pathetic tragic for me in this last voice of paganism thor is vanished the whole norse world has vanished and will not return ever again in like fashion to that pass away the highest things all things that have been in this world all things that are or will be in it have to vanish we have our sad farewell to give them that norse religion a rude but earnest sternly impressive consecration of valour so we may define it sufficed for these old valiant northmen consecration of valour is not a bad thing we will take it for good so far as it goes neither is there no use in knowing something about this old paganism of our fathers unconsciously and combined with higher things it is in us yet that old faith withal to know it consciously brings us into closer and clearer relation with the past with our own possessions in the past for the whole past as i keep repeating is the possession of the present the past had always something true and is a precious possession in a different time in a different place it is always some other side of our common human nature that has been developing itself the actual true is the sum of all these not any one of them by itself constitutes what of human nature is hitherto developed better to know them all than misknow them to which of these three religions do you specially adhere inquires meister of his teacher to all the three answers the other to all the three for they by their union first constitute the true religion lecture ii the hero as prophet mahomet islam friday th may from the first rude times of paganism among the scandinavians in the north we advance to a very different epoch of religion among a very different people mahometanism among the arabs a great change what a change and progress is indicated here in the universal condition and thoughts of men the hero is not now regarded as a god among his fellowmen but as one godinspired as a prophet it is the second phasis of heroworship the first or oldest we may say has passed away without return in the history of the world there will not again be any man never so great whom his fellowmen will take for a god nay we might rationally ask did any set of human beings ever really think the man they saw there standing beside them a god the maker of this world perhaps not it was usually some man they remembered or had seen but neither can this any more be the great man is not recognised henceforth as a god any more it was a rude gross error that of counting the great man a god yet let us say that it is at all times difficult to know what he is or how to account of him and receive him the most significant feature in the history of an epoch is the manner it has of welcoming a great man ever to the true instincts of men there is something godlike in him whether they shall take him to be a god to be a prophet or what they shall take him to be that is ever a grand question by their way of answering that we shall see as through a little window into the very heart of these mens spiritual condition for at bottom the great man as he comes from the hand of nature is ever the same kind of thing odin luther johnson burns i hope to make it appear that these are all originally of one stuff that only by the worlds reception of them and the shapes they assume are they so immeasurably diverse the worship of odin astonishes us to fall prostrate before the great man into deliquium of love and wonder over him and feel in their hearts that he was a denizen of the skies a god this was imperfect enough but to welcome for example a burns as we did was that what we can call perfect the most precious gift that heaven can give to the earth a man of genius as we call it the soul of a man actually sent down from the skies with a godsmessage to us this we waste away as an idle artificial firework sent to amuse us a little and sink it into ashes wreck and ineffectuality such reception of a great man i do not call very perfect either looking into the heart of the thing one may perhaps call that of burns a still uglier phenomenon betokening still sadder imperfections in mankinds ways than the scandinavian method itself to fall into mere unreasoning deliquium of love and admiration was not good but such unreasoning nay irrational supercilious nolove at all is perhaps still worse it is a thing forever changing this of heroworship different in each age difficult to do well in any age indeed the heart of the whole business of the age one may say is to do it well we have chosen mahomet not as the most eminent prophet but as the one we are freest to speak of he is by no means the truest of prophets but i do esteem him a true one farther as there is no danger of our becoming any of us mahometans i mean to say all the good of him i justly can it is the way to get at his secret let us try to understand what he meant with the world what the world meant and means with him will then be a more answerable question our current hypotheses about mahomet that he was a scheming impostor a falsehood incarnate that his religion is a mere mass of quackery and fatuity begins really to be now untenable to any one the lies which wellmeaning zeal has heaped round this man are disgraceful to ourselves only when pococke inquired of grotius where the proof was of that story of the pigeon trained to pick peas from mahomets ear and pass for an angel dictating to him grotius answered that there was no proof it is really time to dismiss all that the word this man spoke has been the lifeguidance now of a hundredandeighty millions of men these twelvehundred years these hundredandeighty millions were made by god as well as we a greater number of gods creatures believe in mahomets word at this hour than in any other word whatever are we to suppose that it was a miserable piece of spiritual legerdemain this which so many creatures of the almighty have lived by and died by i for my part cannot form any such supposition i will believe most things sooner than that one would be entirely at a loss what to think of this world at all if quackery so grew and were sanctioned here alas such theories are very lamentable if we would attain to knowledge of anything in gods true creation let us disbelieve them wholly they are the product of an age of scepticism they indicate the saddest spiritual paralysis and mere deathlife of the souls of men more godless theory i think was never promulgated in this earth a false man found a religion why a false man cannot build a brick house if he do not know and follow truly the properties of mortar burnt clay and what else he works in it is no house that he makes but a rubbishheap it will not stand for twelve centuries to lodge a hundredandeighty millions it will fall straightway a man must conform himself to natures laws be verily in communion with nature and the truth of things or nature will answer him no not at all speciosities are specious ah me a cagliostro many cagliostros prominent worldleaders do prosper by their quackery for a day it is like a forged banknote they get it passed out of their worthless hands others not they have to smart for it nature burstsup in fireflame french revolutions and suchlike proclaiming with terrible veracity that forged notes are forged but of a great man especially of him i will venture to assert that it is incredible he should have been other than true it seems to me the primary foundation of him and of all that can lie in him this no mirabeau napoleon burns cromwell no man adequate to do anything but is first of all in right earnest about it what i call a sincere man i should say sincerity a deep great genuine sincerity is the first characteristic of all men in any way heroic not the sincerity that calls itself sincere ah no that is a very poor matter indeed a shallow braggart conscious sincerity oftenest selfconceit mainly the great mans sincerity is of the kind he cannot speak of is not conscious of nay i suppose he is conscious rather of insincerity for what man can walk accurately by the law of truth for one day no the great man does not boast himself sincere far from that perhaps does not ask himself if he is so i would say rather his sincerity does not depend on himself he cannot help being sincere the great fact of existence is great to him fly as he will he cannot get out of the awful presence of this reality his mind is so made he is great by that first of all fearful and wonderful real as life real as death is this universe to him though all men should forget its truth and walk in a vain show he cannot at all moments the flameimage glaresin upon him undeniable there there i wish you to take this as my primary definition of a great man a little man may have this it is competent to all men that god has made but a great man cannot be without it such a man is what we call an original man he comes to us at firsthand a messenger he sent from the infinite unknown with tidings to us we may call him poet prophet god in one way or other we all feel that the words he utters are as no other mans words direct from the inner fact of things he lives and has to live in daily communion with that hearsays cannot hide it from him he is blind homeless miserable following hearsays it glaresin upon him really his utterances are they not a kind of revelation what we must call such for want of some other name it is from the heart of the world that he comes he is portion of the primal reality of things god has made many revelations but this man too has not god made him the latest and newest of all the inspiration of the almighty giveth him understanding we must listen before all to him this mahomet then we will in no wise consider as an inanity and theatricality a poor conscious ambitious schemer we cannot conceive him so the rude message he delivered was a real one withal an earnest confused voice from the unknown deep the mans words were not false nor his workings here below no inanity and simulacrum a fiery mass of life castup from the great bosom of nature herself to kindle the world the worlds maker had ordered it so neither can the faults imperfections insincerities even of mahomet if such were never so well proved against him shake this primary fact about him on the whole we make too much of faults the details of the business hide the real centre of it faults the greatest of faults i should say is to be conscious of none readers of the bible above all one would think might know better who is called there the man according to gods own heart david the hebrew king had fallen into sins enough blackest crimes there was no want of sins and thereupon the unbelievers sneer and ask is this your man according to gods own heart the sneer i must say seems to me but a shallow one what are faults what are the outward details of a life if the inner secret of it the remorse temptations true oftenbaffled neverended struggle of it be forgotten it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps of all acts is not for a man repentance the most divine the deadliest sin i say were that same supercilious consciousness of no sin that is death the heart so conscious is divorced from sincerity humility and fact is dead it is pure as dead dry sand is pure davids life and history as written for us in those psalms of his i consider to be the truest emblem ever given of a mans moral progress and warfare here below all earnest souls will ever discern in it the faithful struggle of an earnest human soul towards what is good and best struggle often baffled sore baffled down as into entire wreck yet a struggle never ended ever with tears repentance true unconquerable purpose begun anew poor human nature is not a mans walking in truth always that a succession of falls man can do no other in this wild element of a life he has to struggle onwards now fallen deepabased and ever with tears repentance with bleeding heart he has to rise again struggle again still onwards that his struggle be a faithful unconquerable one that is the question of questions we will putup with many sad details if the soul of it were true details by themselves will never teach us what it is i believe we misestimate mahomets faults even as faults but the secret of him will never be got by dwelling there we will leave all this behind us and assuring ourselves that he did mean some true thing ask candidly what it was or might be these arabs mahomet was born among are certainly a notable people their country itself is notable the fit habitation for such a race savage inaccessible rockmountains great grim deserts alternating with beautiful strips of verdure wherever water is there is greenness beauty odoriferous balmshrubs datetrees frankincensetrees consider that wide waste horizon of sand empty silent like a sandsea dividing habitable place from habitable you are all alone there left alone with the universe by day a fierce sun blazing down on it with intolerable radiance by night the great deep heaven with its stars such a country is fit for a swifthanded deephearted race of men there is something most agile active and yet most meditative enthusiastic in the arab character the persians are called the french of the east we will call the arabs oriental italians a gifted noble people a people of wild strong feelings and of iron restraint over these the characteristic of noblemindedness of genius the wild bedouin welcomes the stranger to his tent as one having right to all that is there were it his worst enemy he will slay his foal to treat him will serve him with sacred hospitality for three days will set him fairly on his way and then by another law as sacred kill him if he can in words too as in action they are not a loquacious people taciturn rather but eloquent gifted when they do speak an earnest truthful kind of men they are as we know of jewish kindred but with that deadly terrible earnestness of the jews they seem to combine something graceful brilliant which is not jewish they had poetic contests among them before the time of mahomet sale says at ocadh in the south of arabia there were yearly fairs and there when the merchandising was done poets sang for prizes the wild people gathered to hear that one jewish quality these arabs manifest the outcome of many or of all high qualities what we may call religiosity from of old they had been zealous workers according to their light they worshipped the stars as sabeans worshipped many natural objects recognised them as symbols immediate manifestations of the maker of nature it was wrong and yet not wholly wrong all gods works are still in a sense symbols of god do we not as i urged still account it a merit to recognise a certain inexhaustible significance poetic beauty as we name it in all natural objects whatsoever a man is a poet and honoured for doing that and speaking or singing it a kind of diluted worship they had many prophets these arabs teachers each to his tribe each according to the light he had but indeed have we not from of old the noblest of proofs still palpable to every one of us of what devoutness and noblemindedness had dwelt in these rustic thoughtful peoples biblical critics seem agreed that our own book of job was written in that region of the world i call that apart from all theories about it one of the grandest things ever written with pen one feels indeed as if it were not hebrew such a noble universality different from noble patriotism or sectarianism reigns in it a noble book all mens book it is our first oldest statement of the neverending problem mans destiny and gods ways with him here in this earth and all in such free flowing outlines grand in its sincerity in its simplicity in its epic melody and repose of reconcilement there is the seeing eye the mildly understanding heart so true everywhere true eyesight and vision for all things material things no less than spiritual the horse hast thou clothed his neck with thunder he laughs at the shaking of the spear such living likenesses were never since drawn sublime sorrow sublime reconciliation oldest choral melody as of the heart of mankind so soft and great as the summer midnight as the world with its seas and stars there is nothing written i think in the bible or out of it of equal literary merit to the idolatrous arabs one of the most ancient universal objects of worship was that black stone still kept in the building called caabah at mecca diodorus siculus mentions this caabah in a way not to be mistaken as the oldest most honoured temple in his time that is some halfcentury before our era silvestre de sacy says there is some likelihood that the black stone is an aerolite in that case some one might see it fall out of heaven it stands now beside the well zemzem the caabah is built over both a well is in all places a beautiful affecting object gushing out like life from the hard earth still more so in these hot dry countries where it is the first condition of being the well zemzem has its name from the bubbling sound of the waters zemzem they think it is the well which hagar found with her little ishmael in the wilderness the aerolite and it have been sacred now and had a caabah over them for thousands of years a curious object that caabah there it stands at this hour in the black clothcovering the sultan sends it yearly twentyseven cubits high with circuit with double circuit of pillars with festoonrows of lamps and quaint ornaments the lamps will be lighted again this night to glitter again under the stars an authentic fragment of the oldest past it is the keblah of all moslem from delhi all onwards to morocco the eyes of innumerable praying men are turned towards it five times this day and all days one of the notablest centres in the habitation of men it had been from the sacredness attached to this caabah stone and hagars well from the pilgrimings of all tribes of arabs thither that mecca took its rise as a town a great town once though much decayed now it has no natural advantage for a town stands in a sandy hollow amid bare barren hills at a distance from the sea its provisions its very bread have to be imported but so many pilgrims needed lodgings and then all places of pilgrimage do from the first become places of trade the first day pilgrims meet merchants have also met where men see themselves assembled for one object they find that they can accomplish other objects which depend on meeting together mecca became the fair of all arabia and thereby indeed the chief staple and warehouse of whatever commerce there was between the indian and western countries syria egypt even italy it had at one time a population of buyers forwarders of those eastern and western products importers for their own behoof of provisions and corn the government was a kind of irregular aristocratic republic not without a touch of theocracy ten men of a chief tribe chosen in some rough way were governors of mecca and keepers of the caabah the koreish were the chief tribe in mahomets time his own family was of that tribe the rest of the nation fractioned and cutasunder by deserts lived under similar rude patriarchal governments by one or several herdsmen carriers traders generally robbers too being oftenest at war one with another or with all held together by no open bond if it were not this meeting at the caabah where all forms of arab idolatry assembled in common adoration held mainly by the inward indissoluble bond of a common blood and language in this way had the arabs lived for long ages unnoticed by the world a people of great qualities unconsciously waiting for the day when they should become notable to all the world their idolatries appear to have been in a tottering state much was getting into confusion and fermentation among them obscure tidings of the most important event ever transacted in this world the life and death of the divine man in judea at once the symptom and cause of immeasurable change to all people in the world had in the course of centuries reached into arabia too and could not but of itself have produced fermentation there it was among this arab people so circumstanced in the year of our era that the man mahomet was born he was of the family of hashem of the koreish tribe as we said though poor connected with the chief persons of his country almost at his birth he lost his father at the age of six years his mother too a woman noted for her beauty her worth and sense he fell to the charge of his grandfather an old man a hundred years old a good old man mahomets father abdallah had been his youngest favourite son he saw in mahomet with his old lifeworn eyes a century old the lost abdallah come back again all that was left of abdallah he loved the little orphan boy greatly used to say they must take care of that beautiful little boy nothing in their kindred was more precious than he at his death while the boy was still but two years old he left him in charge to abu thaleb the eldest of the uncles as to him that now was head of the house by this uncle a just and rational man as everything betokens mahomet was broughtup in the best arab way mahomet as he grew up accompanied his uncle on trading journeys and suchlike in his eighteenth year one finds him a fighter following his uncle in war but perhaps the most significant of all his journeys is one we find noted as of some years earlier date a journey to the fairs of syria the young man here first came in contact with a quite foreign world with one foreign element of endless moment to him the christian religion i know not what to make of that sergius the nestorian monk whom abu thaleb and he are said to have lodged with or how much any monk could have taught one still so young probably enough it is greatly exaggerated this of the nestorian monk mahomet was only fourteen had no language but his own much in syria must have been a strange unintelligible whirlpool to him but the eyes of the lad were open glimpses of many things would doubtless be takenin and lie very enigmatic as yet which were to ripen in a strange way into views into beliefs and insights one day these journeys to syria were probably the beginning of much to mahomet one other circumstance we must not forget that he had no schoollearning of the thing we call schoollearning none at all the art of writing was but just introduced into arabia it seems to be the true opinion that mahomet never could write life in the desert with its experiences was all his education what of this infinite universe he from his dim place with his own eyes and thoughts could take in so much and no more of it was he to know curious if we will reflect on it this of having no books except by what he could see for himself or hear of by uncertain rumour of speech in the obscure arabian desert he could know nothing the wisdom that had been before him or at a distance from him in the world was in a manner as good as not there for him of the great brother souls flamebeacons through so many lands and times no one directly communicates with this great soul he is alone there deep down in the bosom of the wilderness has to grow up so alone with nature and his own thoughts but from an early age he had been remarked as a thoughtful man his companions named him al amin the faithful a man of truth and fidelity true in what he did in what he spake and thought they noted that he always meant something a man rather taciturn in speech silent when there was nothing to be said but pertinent wise sincere when he did speak always throwing light on the matter this is the only sort of speech worth speaking through life we find him to have been regarded as an altogether solid brotherly genuine man a serious sincere character yet amiable cordial companionable jocose even a good laugh in him withal there are men whose laugh is as untrue as anything about them who cannot laugh one hears of mahomets beauty his fine sagacious honest face brown florid complexion beaming black eyes i somehow like too that vein on the brow which swelledup black when he was in anger like the horseshoe vein in scotts redgauntlet it was a kind of feature in the hashem family this black swelling vein in the brow mahomet had it prominent as would appear a spontaneous passionate yet just truemeaning man full of wild faculty fire and light of wild worth all uncultured working out his lifetask in the depths of the desert there how he was placed with kadijah a rich widow as her steward and travelled in her business again to the fairs of syria how he managed all as one can well understand with fidelity adroitness how her gratitude her regard for him grew the story of their marriage is altogether a graceful intelligible one as told us by the arab authors he was twentyfive she forty though still beautiful he seems to have lived in a most affectionate peaceable wholesome way with this wedded benefactress loving her truly and her alone it goes greatly against the impostor theory the fact that he lived in this entirely unexceptionable entirely quiet and commonplace way till the heat of his years was done he was forty before he talked of any mission from heaven all his irregularities real and supposed date from after his fiftieth year when the good kadijah died all his ambition seemingly had been hitherto to live an honest life his fame the mere good opinion of neighbours that knew him had been sufficient hitherto not till he was already getting old the prurient heat of his life all burnt out and peace growing to be the chief thing this world could give him did he start on the career of ambition and belying all his past character and existence setup as a wretched empty charlatan to acquire what he could now no longer enjoy for my share i have no faith whatever in that ah no this deephearted son of the wilderness with his beaming black eyes and open social deep soul had other thoughts in him than ambition a silent great soul he was one of those who cannot but be in earnest whom nature herself has appointed to be sincere while others walk in formulas and hearsays contented enough to dwell there this man could not screen himself in formulas he was alone with his own soul and the reality of things the great mystery of existence as i said glaredin upon him with its terrors with its splendours no hearsays could hide that unspeakable fact here am i such sincerity as we named it has in very truth something of divine the word of such a man is a voice direct from natures own heart men do and must listen to that as to nothing else all else is wind in comparison from of old a thousand thoughts in his pilgrimings and wanderings had been in this man what am i what is this unfathomable thing i live in which men name universe what is life what is death what am i to believe what am i to do the grim rocks of mount hara of mount sinai the stern sandy solitudes answered not the great heaven rolling silent overhead with its blueglancing stars answered not there was no answer the mans own soul and what of gods inspiration dwelt there had to answer it is the thing which all men have to ask themselves which we too have to ask and answer this wild man felt it to be of infinite moment all other things of no moment whatever in comparison the jargon of argumentative greek sects vague traditions of jews the stupid routine of arab idolatry there was no answer in these a hero as i repeat has this first distinction which indeed we may call first and last the alpha and omega of his whole heroism that he looks through the shows of things into things use and wont respectable hearsay respectable formula all these are good or are not good there is something behind and beyond all these which all these must correspond with be the image of or they are idolatries bits of black wood pretending to be god to the earnest soul a mockery and abomination idolatries never so gilded waited on by heads of the koreish will do nothing for this man though all men walk by them what good is it the great reality stands glaring there upon him he there has to answer it or perish miserably now even now or else through all eternity never answer it thou must find an answer ambition what could all arabia do for this man with the crown of greek heraclius of persian chosroes and all crowns in the earth what could they all do for him it was not of the earth he wanted to hear tell it was of the heaven above and of the hell beneath all crowns and sovereignties whatsoever where would they in a few brief years be to be sheik of mecca or arabia and have a bit of gilt wood put into your hand will that be ones salvation i decidedly think not we will leave it altogether this impostor hypothesis as not credible not very tolerable even worthy chiefly of dismissal by us mahomet had been wont to retire yearly during the month ramadhan into solitude and silence as indeed was the arab custom a praiseworthy custom which such a man above all would find natural and useful communing with his own heart in the silence of the mountains himself silent open to the small still voices it was a right natural custom mahomet was in his fortieth year when having withdrawn to a cavern in mount hara near mecca during this ramadhan to pass the month in prayer and meditation on those great questions he one day told his wife kadijah who with his household was with him or near him this year that by the unspeakable special favour of heaven he had now found it all out was in doubt and darkness no longer but saw it all that all these idols and formulas were nothing miserable bits of wood that there was one god in and over all and we must leave all idols and look to him that god is great and that there is nothing else great he is the reality wooden idols are not real he is real he made us at first sustains us yet we and all things are but the shadow of him a transitory garment veiling the eternal splendour allah akbar god is great and then also islam that we must submit to god that our whole strength lies in resigned submission to him whatsoever he do to us for this world and for the other the thing he sends to us were it death and worse than death shall be good shall be best we resign ourselves to god if this be islam says goethe do we not all live in islam yes all of us that have any moral life we all live so it has ever been held the highest wisdom for a man not merely to submit to necessity necessity will make him submit but to know and believe well that the stern thing which necessity had ordered was the wisest the best the thing wanted there to cease his frantic pretension of scanning this great godsworld in his small fraction of a brain to know that it had verily though deep beyond his soundings a just law that the soul of it was good that his part in it was to conform to the law of the whole and in devout silence follow that not questioning it obeying it as unquestionable i say this is yet the only true morality known a man is right and invincible virtuous and on the road towards sure conquest precisely while he joins himself to the great deep law of the world in spite of all superficial laws temporary appearances profitandloss calculations he is victorious while he coperates with that great central law not victorious otherwise and surely his first chance of coperating with it or getting into the course of it is to know with his whole soul that it is that it is good and alone good this is the soul of islam it is properly the soul of christianity for islam is definable as a confused form of christianity had christianity not been neither had it been christianity also commands us before all to be resigned to god we are to take no counsel with fleshandblood give ear to no vain cavils vain sorrows and wishes to know that we know nothing that the worst and cruelest to our eyes is not what it seems that we have to receive whatsoever befalls us as sent from god above and say it is good and wise god is great though he slay me yet will i trust in him islam means in its way denial of self annihilation of self this is yet the highest wisdom that heaven has revealed to our earth such light had come as it could to illuminate the darkness of this wild arab soul a confused dazzling splendour as of life and heaven in the great darkness which threatened to be death he called it revelation and the angel gabriel who of us yet can know what to call it it is the inspiration of the almighty that giveth us understanding to know to get into the truth of anything is ever a mystic act of which the best logics can but babble on the surface is not belief the true godannouncing miracle says novalis that mahomets whole soul set in flame with this grand truth vouchsafed him should feel as if it were important and the only important thing was very natural that providence had unspeakably honoured him by revealing it saving him from death and darkness that he therefore was bound to make known the same to all creatures this is what was meant by mahomet is the prophet of god this too is not without its true meaning the good kadijah we can fancy listened to him with wonder with doubt at length she answered yes it was true this that he said one can fancy too the boundless gratitude of mahomet and how of all the kindnesses she had done him this of believing the earnest struggling word he now spoke was the greatest it is certain says novalis my conviction gains infinitely the moment another soul will believe in it it is a boundless favour he never forgot this good kadijah long afterwards ayesha his young favourite wife a woman who indeed distinguished herself among the moslem by all manner of qualities through her whole long life this young brilliant ayesha was one day questioning him now am not i better than kadijah she was a widow old and had lost her looks you love me better than you did her no by allah answered mahomet no by allah she believed in me when none else would believe in the whole world i had but one friend and she was that seid his slave also believed in him these with his young cousin ali abu thalebs son were his first converts he spoke of his doctrine to this man and that but the most treated it with ridicule with indifference in three years i think he had gained but thirteen followers his progress was slow enough his encouragement to go on was altogether the usual encouragement that such a man in such a case meets after some three years of small success he invited forty of his chief kindred to an entertainment and there stoodup and told them what his pretension was that he had this thing to promulgate abroad to all men that it was the highest thing the one thing which of them would second him in that amid the doubt and silence of all young ali as yet a lad of sixteen impatient of the silence startedup and exclaimed in passionate fierce language that he would the assembly among whom was abu thaleb alis father could not be unfriendly to mahomet yet the sight there of one unlettered elderly man with a lad of sixteen deciding on such an enterprise against all mankind appeared ridiculous to them the assembly brokeup in laughter nevertheless it proved not a laughable thing it was a very serious thing as for this young ali one cannot but like him a nobleminded creature as he shows himself now and always afterwards full of affection of fiery daring something chivalrous in him brave as a lion yet with a grace a truth and affection worthy of christian knighthood he died by assassination in the mosque at bagdad a death occasioned by his own generous fairness confidence in the fairness of others he said if the wound proved not unto death they must pardon the assassin but if it did then they must slay him straightway that so they two in the same hour might appear before god and see which side of that quarrel was the just one mahomet naturally gave offence to the koreish keepers of the caabah superintendents of the idols one or two men of influence had joined him the thing spread slowly but it was spreading naturally he gave offence to everybody who is this that pretends to be wiser than we all that rebukes us all as mere fools and worshippers of wood abu thaleb the good uncle spoke with him could he not be silent about all that believe it all for himself and not trouble others anger the chief men endanger himself and them all talking of it mahomet answered if the sun stood on his right hand and the moon on his left ordering him to hold his peace he could not obey no there was something in this truth he had got which was of nature herself equal in rank to sun or moon or whatsoever thing nature had made it would speak itself there so long as the almighty allowed it in spite of sun and moon and all koreish and all men and things it must do that and could do no other mahomet answered so and they say burst into tears burst into tears he felt that abu thaleb was good to him that the task he had got was no soft but a stern and great one he went on speaking to who would listen to him publishing his doctrine among the pilgrims as they came to mecca gaining adherents in this place and that continual contradiction hatred open or secret danger attended him his powerful relations protected mahomet himself but by and by on his own advice all his adherents had to quit mecca and seek refuge in abyssinia over the sea the koreish grew ever angrier laid plots and swore oaths among them to put mahomet to death with their own hands abu thaleb was dead the good kadijah was dead mahomet is not solicitous of sympathy from us but his outlook at this time was one of the dismalest he had to hide in caverns escape in disguise fly hither and thither homeless in continual peril of his life more than once it seemed allover with him more than once it turned on a straw some riders horse taking fright or the like whether mahomet and his doctrine had not ended there and not been heard of at all but it was not to end so in the thirteenth year of his mission finding his enemies all banded against him forty sworn men one out of every tribe waiting to take his life and no continuance possible at mecca for him any longer mahomet fled to the place then called yathreb where he had gained some adherents the place they now call medina or medinat al nabi the city of the prophet from that circumstance it lay some miles off through rocks and deserts not without great difficulty in such mood as we may fancy he escaped thither and found welcome the whole east dates its era from this flight hegira as they name it the year of this hegira is of our era the fiftythird of mahomets life he was now becoming an old man his friends sinking round him one by one his path desolate encompassed with danger unless he could find hope in his own heart the outward face of things was but hopeless for him it is so with all men in the like case hitherto mahomet had professed to publish his religion by the way of preaching and persuasion alone but now driven foully out of his native country since unjust men had not only given no ear to his earnest heavensmessage the deep cry of his heart but would not even let him live if he kept speaking it the wild son of the desert resolved to defend himself like a man and arab if the koreish will have it so they shall have it tidings felt to be of infinite moment to them and all men they would not listen to these would trample them down by sheer violence steel and murder well let steel try it then ten years more this mahomet had all of fighting of breathless impetuous toil and struggle with what result we know much has been said of mahomets propagating his religion by the sword it is no doubt far nobler what we have to boast of the christian religion that it propagated itself peaceably in the way of preaching and conviction yet withal if we take this for an argument of the truth or falsehood of a religion there is a radical mistake in it the sword indeed but where will you get your sword every new opinion at its starting is precisely in a minority of one in one mans head alone there it dwells as yet one man alone of the whole world believes it there is one man against all men that he take a sword and try to propagate with that will do little for him you must first get your sword on the whole a thing will propagate itself as it can we do not find of the christian religion either that it always disdained the sword when once it had got one charlemagnes conversion of the saxons was not by preaching i care little about the sword i will allow a thing to struggle for itself in this world with any sword or tongue or implement it has or can lay hold of we will let it preach and pamphleteer and fight and to the uttermost bestir itself and do beak and claws whatsoever is in it very sure that it will in the longrun conquer nothing which does not deserve to be conquered what is better than itself it cannot put away but only what is worse in this great duel nature herself is umpire and can do no wrong the thing which is deepestrooted in nature what we call truest that thing and not the other will be found growing at last here however in reference to much that there is in mahomet and his success we are to remember what an umpire nature is what a greatness composure of depth and tolerance there is in her you take wheat to cast into the earths bosom your wheat may be mixed with chaff chopped straw barnsweepings dust and all imaginable rubbish no matter you cast it into the kind just earth she grows the wheat the whole rubbish she silently absorbs shrouds it in says nothing of the rubbish the yellow wheat is growing there the good earth is silent about all the rest has silently turned all the rest to some benefit too and makes no complaint about it so everywhere in nature she is true and not a lie and yet so great and just and motherly in her truth she requires of a thing only that it be genuine of heart she will protect it if so will not if not so there is a soul of truth in all the things she ever gave harbour to alas is not this the history of all highest truth that comes or ever came into the world the body of them all is imperfection an element of light in darkness to us they have to come embodied in mere logic in some merely scientific theorem of the universe which cannot be complete which cannot but be found one day incomplete erroneous and so die and disappear the body of all truth dies and yet in all i say there is a soul which never dies which in new and evernobler embodiment lives immortal as man himself it is the way with nature the genuine essence of truth never dies that it be genuine a voice from the great deep of nature there is the point at natures judgmentseat what we call pure or impure is not with her the final question not how much chaff is in you but whether you have any wheat pure i might say to many a man yes you are pure pure enough but you are chaff insincere hypothesis hearsay formality you never were in contact with the great heart of the universe at all you are properly neither pure nor impure you are nothing nature has no business with you mahomets creed we called a kind of christianity and really if we look at the wild rapt earnestness with which it was believed and laid to heart i should say a better kind than that of those miserable syrian sects with their vain janglings about homoiousion and homoousion the head full of worthless noise the heart empty and dead the truth of it is embedded in portentous error and falsehood but the truth of it makes it be believed not the falsehood it succeeded by its truth a bastard kind of christianity but a living kind with a heartlife in it not dead chopping barren logic merely out of all that rubbish of arab idolatries argumentative theologies traditions subtleties rumours and hypotheses of greeks and jews with their idle wiredrawings this wild man of the desert with his wild sincere heart earnest as death and life with his great flashing natural eyesight had seen into the kernel of the matter idolatry is nothing these wooden idols of yours ye rub them with oil and wax and the flies stick on them these are wood i tell you they can do nothing for you they are an impotent blasphemous pretence a horror and abomination if ye knew them god alone is god alone has power he made us he can kill us and keep us alive allah akbar god is great understand that his will is the best for you that howsoever sore to fleshandblood you will find it the wisest best you are bound to take it so in this world and in the next you have no other thing that you can do and now if the wild idolatrous men did believe this and with their fiery hearts laid hold of it to do it in what form soever it came to them i say it was well worthy of being believed in one form or the other i say it is still the one thing worthy of being believed by all men man does hereby become the highpriest of this temple of a world he is in harmony with the decrees of the author of this world coperating with them not vainly withstanding them i know to this day no better definition of duty than that same all that is right includes itself in this of coperating with the real tendency of the world you succeed by this the worlds tendency will succeed you are good and in the right course there homoiousion homoousion vain logical jangle then or before or at any time may jangle itself out and go whither and how it likes this is the thing it all struggles to mean if it would mean anything if it do not succeed in meaning this it means nothing not that abstractions logical propositions be correctly worded or incorrectly but that living concrete sons of adam do lay this to heart that is the important point islam devoured all these vain jangling sects and i think had right to do so it was a reality direct from the great heart of nature once more arab idolatries syrian formulas whatsoever was not equally real had to go up in flame mere dead fuel in various senses for this which was fire it was during these wild warfarings and strugglings especially after the flight to mecca that mahomet dictated at intervals his sacred book which they name koran or reading thing to be read this is the work he and his disciples made so much of asking all the world is not that a miracle the mahometans regard their koran with a reverence which few christians pay even to their bible it is admitted everywhere as the standard of all law and all practice the thing to be goneupon in speculation and life the message sent direct out of heaven which this earth has to conform to and walk by the thing to be read their judges decide by it all moslem are bound to study it seek in it for the light of their life they have mosques where it is all read daily thirty relays of priests take it up in succession get through the whole each day there for twelvehundred years has the voice of this book at all moments kept sounding through the ears and the hearts of so many men we hear of mahometan doctors that had read it seventythousand times very curious if one sought for discrepancies of national taste here surely were the most eminent instance of that we also can read the koran our translation of it by sale is known to be a very fair one i must say it is as toilsome reading as i ever undertook a wearisome confused jumble crude incondite endless iterations longwindedness entanglement most crude incondite insupportable stupidity in short nothing but a sense of duty could carry any european through the koran we read in it as we might in the statepaper office unreadable masses of lumber that perhaps we may get some glimpses of a remarkable man it is true we have it under disadvantages the arabs see more method in it than we mahomets followers found the koran lying all in fractions as it had been writtendown at first promulgation much of it they say on shoulderblades of mutton flung pellmell into a chest and they published it without any discoverable order as to time or otherwise merely trying as would seem and this not very strictly to put the longest chapters first the real beginning of it in that way lies almost at the end for the earliest portions were the shortest read in its historical sequence it perhaps would not be so bad much of it too they say is rhythmic a kind of wild chanting song in the original this may be a great point much perhaps has been lost in the translation here yet with every allowance one feels it difficult to see how any mortal ever could consider this koran as a book written in heaven too good for the earth as a wellwritten book or indeed as a book at all and not a bewildered rhapsody written so far as writing goes as badly as almost any book ever was so much for national discrepancies and the standard of taste yet i should say it was not unintelligible how the arabs might so love it when once you get this confused coil of a koran fairly off your hands and have it behind you at a distance the essential type of it begins to disclose itself and in this there is a merit quite other than the literary one if a book come from the heart it will contrive to reach other hearts all art and authorcraft are of small amount to that one would say the primary character of the koran is that of its genuineness of its being a bonfide book prideaux i know and others have represented it as a mere bundle of juggleries chapter after chapter gotup to excuse and varnish the authors successive sins forward his ambitions and quackeries but really it is time to dismiss all that i do not assert mahomets continual sincerity who is continually sincere but i confess i can make nothing of the critic in these times who would accuse him of deceit prepense of conscious deceit generally or perhaps at all still more of living in a mere element of conscious deceit and writing this koran as a forger and juggler would have done every candid eye i think will read the koran far otherwise than so it is the confused ferment of a great rude human soul rude untutored that cannot even read but fervent earnest struggling vehemently to utter itself in words with a kind of breathless intensity he strives to utter himself the thoughts crowd on him pellmell for very multitude of things to say he can get nothing said the meaning that is in him shapes itself into no form of composition is stated in no sequence method or coherence they are not shaped at all these thoughts of his flungout unshaped as they struggle and tumble there in their chaotic inarticulate state we said stupid yet natural stupidity is by no means the character of mahomets book it is natural uncultivation rather the man has not studied speaking in the haste and pressure of continual fighting has not time to mature himself into fit speech the panting breathless haste and vehemence of a man struggling in the thick of battle for life and salvation this is the mood he is in a headlong haste for very magnitude of meaning he cannot get himself articulated into words the successive utterances of a soul in that mood coloured by the various vicissitudes of threeandtwenty years now well uttered now worse this is the koran for we are to consider mahomet through these threeandtwenty years as the centre of a world wholly in conflict battles with the koreish and heathen quarrels among his own people backslidings of his own wild heart all this kept him in a perpetual whirl his soul knowing rest no more in wakeful nights as one may fancy the wild soul of the man tossing amid these vortices would hail any light of a decision for them as a veritable light from heaven any makingup of his mind so blessed indispensable for him there would seem the inspiration of a gabriel forger and juggler no no this great fiery heart seething simmering like a great furnace of thoughts was not a jugglers his life was a fact to him this gods universe an awful fact and reality he has faults enough the man was an uncultured semibarbarous son of nature much of the bedouin still clinging to him we must take him for that but for a wretched simulacrum a hungry impostor without eyes or heart practising for a mess of pottage such blasphemous swindlery forgery of celestial documents continual hightreason against his maker and self we will not and cannot take him sincerity in all senses seems to me the merit of the koran what had rendered it precious to the wild arab men it is after all the first and last merit in a book gives rise to merits of all kinds nay at bottom it alone can give rise to merit of any kind curiously through these incondite masses of tradition vituperation complaint ejaculation in the koran a vein of true direct insight of what we might almost call poetry is found straggling the body of the book is madeup of mere tradition and as it were vehement enthusiastic extempore preaching he returns forever to the old stories of the prophets as they went current in the arab memory how prophet after prophet the prophet abraham the prophet hud the prophet moses christian and other real and fabulous prophets had come to this tribe and to that warning men of their sin and been received by them even as he mahomet was which is a great solace to him these things he repeats ten perhaps twenty times again and ever again with wearisome iteration has never done repeating them a brave samuel johnson in his forlorn garret might conover the biographies of authors in that way this is the great staple of the koran but curiously through all this comes ever and anon some glance as of the real thinker and seer he has actually an eye for the world this mahomet with a certain directness and rugged vigour he brings home still to our heart the thing his own heart has been opened to i make but little of his praises of allah which many praise they are borrowed i suppose mainly from the hebrew at least they are far surpassed there but the eye that flashes direct into the heart of things and sees the truth of them this is to me a highly interesting object great natures own gift which she bestows on all but which only one in the thousand does not cast sorrowfully away it is what i call sincerity of vision the test of a sincere heart mahomet can work no miracles he often answers impatiently i can work no miracles i i am a public preacher appointed to preach this doctrine to all creatures yet the world as we can see had really from of old been all one great miracle to him look over the world says he is it not wonderful the work of allah wholly a sign to you if your eyes were open this earth god made it for you appointed paths in it you can live in it go to and fro on it the clouds in the dry country of arabia to mahomet they are very wonderful great clouds he says born in the deep bosom of the upper immensity where do they come from they hang there the great black monsters pourdown their rain deluges to revive a dead earth and grass springs and tall leafy palmtrees with their dateclusters hanging round is not that a sign your cattle too allah made them serviceable dumb creatures they change the grass into milk you have your clothing from them very strange creatures they come ranking home at eveningtime and adds he and are a credit to you ships also he talks often about ships huge moving mountains they spreadout their cloth wings go bounding through the water there heavens wind driving them anon they lie motionless god has withdrawn the wind they lie dead and cannot stir miracles cries he what miracle would you have are not you yourselves there god made you shaped you out of a little clay ye were small once a few years ago ye were not at all ye have beauty strength thoughts ye have compassion on one another old age comeson you and gray hairs your strength fades into feebleness ye sink down and again are not ye have compassion on one another this struck me much allah might have made you having no compassion on one another how had it been then this is a great direct thought a glance at firsthand into the very fact of things rude vestiges of poetic genius of whatsoever is best and truest are visible in this man a strong untutored intellect eyesight heart a strong wild man might have shaped himself into poet king priest any kind of hero to his eyes it is forever clear that this world wholly is miraculous he sees what as we said once before all great thinkers the rude scandinavians themselves in one way or other have contrived to see that this so solidlooking material world is at bottom in very deed nothing is a visual and tactual manifestation of gods power and presence a shadow hungout by him on the bosom of the void infinite nothing more the mountains he says these great rockmountains they shall dissipate themselves like clouds melt into the blue as clouds do and not be he figures the earth in the arab fashion sale tells us as an immense plain or flat plate of ground the mountains are set on that to steady it at the last day they shall disappear like clouds the whole earth shall go spinning whirl itself off into wreck and as dust and vapour vanish in the inane allah withdraws his hand from it and it ceases to be the universal empire of allah presence everywhere of an unspeakable power a splendour and a terror not to be named as the true force essence and reality in all things whatsoever was continually clear to this man what a modern talksof by the name forces of nature laws of nature and does not figure as a divine thing not even as one thing at all but as a set of things undivine enough saleable curious good for propelling steamships with our sciences and cyclopdias we are apt to forget the divineness in these laboratories of ours we ought not to forget it that once well forgotten i know not what else were worth remembering most sciences i think were then a very dead thing withered contentious empty a thistle in late autumn the best science without this is but as the dead timber it is not the growing tree and forest which gives evernew timber among other things man cannot know either unless he can worship in some way his knowledge is a pedantry and dead thistle otherwise much has been said and written about the sensuality of mahomets religion more than was just the indulgences criminal to us which he permitted were not of his appointment he found them practised unquestioned from immemorial time in arabia what he did was to curtail them restrict them not on one but on many sides his religion is not an easy one with rigorous fasts lavations strict complex formulas prayers five times a day and abstinence from wine it did not succeed by being an easy religion as if indeed any religion or cause holding of religion could succeed by that it is a calumny on men to say that they are roused to heroic action by ease hope of pleasure recompense sugarplums of any kind in this world or the next in the meanest mortal there lies something nobler the poor swearing soldier hired to be shot has his honour of a soldier different from drillregulations and the shilling a day it is not to taste sweet things but to do noble and true things and vindicate himself under gods heaven as a godmade man that the poorest son of adam dimly longs show him the way of doing that the dullest daydrudge kindles into a hero they wrong man greatly who say he is to be seduced by ease difficulty abnegation martyrdom death are the allurements that act on the heart of man kindle the inner genial life of him you have a flame that burnsup all lower considerations not happiness but something higher one sees this even in the frivolous classes with their point of honour and the like not by flattering our appetites no by awakening the heroic that slumbers in every heart can any religion gain followers mahomet himself after all that can be said about him was not a sensual man we shall err widely if we consider this man as a common voluptuary intent mainly on base enjoyments nay on enjoyments of any kind his household was of the frugalest his common diet barleybread and water sometimes for months there was not a fire once lighted on his hearth they record with just pride that he would mend his own shoes patch his own cloak a poor hardtoiling illprovided man careless of what vulgar men toil for not a bad man i should say something better in him than hunger of any sort or these wild arab men fighting and jostling threeandtwenty years at his hand in close contact with him always would not have reverenced him so they were wild men bursting ever and anon into quarrel into all kinds of fierce sincerity without right worth and manhood no man could have commanded them they called him prophet you say why he stood there face to face with them bare not enshrined in any mystery visibly clouting his own cloak cobbling his own shoes fighting counselling ordering in the midst of them they must have seen what kind of a man he was let him be called what you like no emperor with his tiaras was obeyed as this man in a cloak of his own clouting during threeandtwenty years of rough actual trial i find something of a veritable hero necessary for that of itself his last words are a prayer broken ejaculations of a heart strugglingup in trembling hope towards its maker we cannot say that his religion made him worse it made him better good not bad generous things are recorded of him when he lost his daughter the thing he answers is in his own dialect everyway sincere and yet equivalent to that of christians the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord he answered in like manner of seid his emancipated wellbeloved slave the second of the believers seid had fallen in the war of tabc the first of mahomets fightings with the greeks mahomet said it was well seid had done his masters work seid had now gone to his master it was all well with seid yet seids daughter found him weeping over the body the old grayhaired man melting in tears what do i see said she you see a friend weeping over his friend he went out for the last time into the mosque two days before his death asked if he had injured any man let his own back bear the stripes if he owed any man a voice answered yes me three drachms borrowed on such an occasion mahomet ordered them to be paid better be in shame now said he than at the day of judgment you remember kadijah and the no by allah traits of that kind show us the genuine man the brother of us all brought visible through twelve centuries the veritable son of our common mother withal i like mahomet for his total freedom from cant he is a rough selfhelping son of the wilderness does not pretend to be what he is not there is no ostentatious pride in him but neither does he go much upon humility he is there as he can be in cloak and shoes of his own clouting speaks plainly to all manner of persian kings greek emperors what it is they are bound to do knows well enough about himself the respect due unto thee in a lifeanddeath war with bedouins cruel things could not fail but neither are acts of mercy of noble natural pity and generosity wanting mahomet makes no apology for the one no boast of the other they were each the free dictate of his heart each calledfor there and then not a mealymouthed man a candid ferocity if the case call for it is in him he does not mince matters the war of tabc is a thing he often speaks of his men refused many of them to march on that occasion pleaded the heat of the weather the harvest and so forth he can never forget that your harvest it lasts for a day what will become of your harvest through all eternity hot weather yes it was hot but hell will be hotter sometimes a rough sarcasm turnsup he says to the unbelievers ye shall have the just measure of your deeds at that great day they will be weighedout to you ye shall not have short weight everywhere he fixes the matter in his eye he sees it his heart now and then is as if struck dumb by the greatness of it assuredly he says that word in the koran is writtendown sometimes as a sentence by itself assuredly no dilettantism in this mahomet it is a business of reprobation and salvation with him of time and eternity he is in deadly earnest about it dilettantism hypothesis speculation a kind of amateursearch for truth toying and coquetting with truth this is the sorest sin the root of all other imaginable sins it consists in the heart and soul of the man never having been open to truth living in a vain show such a man not only utters and produces falsehoods but is himself a falsehood the rational moral principle spark of the divinity is sunk deep in him in quiet paralysis of lifedeath the very falsehoods of mahomet are truer than the truths of such a man he is the insincere man smoothpolished respectable in some times and places inoffensive says nothing harsh to anybody most cleanly just as carbonic acid is which is death and poison we will not praise mahomets moral precepts as always of the superfinest sort yet it can be said that there is always a tendency to good in them that they are the true dictates of a heart aiming towards what is just and true the sublime forgiveness of christianity turning of the other cheek when the one has been smitten is not here you are to revenge yourself but it is to be in measure not overmuch or beyond justice on the other hand islam like any great faith and insight into the essence of man is a perfect equaliser of men the soul of one believer outweighs all earthly kingships all men according to islam too are equal mahomet insists not on the propriety of giving alms but on the necessity of it he marksdown by law how much you are to give and it is at your peril if you neglect the tenth part of a mans annual income whatever that may be is the property of the poor of those that are afflicted and need help good all this the natural voice of humanity of pity and equity dwelling in the heart of this wild son of nature speaks so mahomets paradise is sensual his hell sensual true in the one and the other there is enough that shocks all spiritual feeling in us but we are to recollect that the arabs already had it so that mahomet in whatever he changed of it softened and diminished all this the worst sensualities too are the work of doctors followers of his not his work in the koran there is really very little said about the joys of paradise they are intimated rather than insisted on nor is it forgotten that the highest joys even there shall be spiritual the pure presence of the highest this shall infinitely transcend all other joys he says your salutation shall be peace salam have peace the thing that all rational souls long for and seek vainly here below as the one blessing ye shall sit on seats facing one another all grudges shall be taken away out of your hearts all grudges ye shall love one another freely for each of you in the eyes of his brothers there will be heaven enough in reference to this of the sensual paradise and mahomets sensuality the sorest chapter of all for us there were many things to be said which it is not convenient to enter upon here two remarks only i shall make and therewith leave it to your candour the first is furnished me by goethe it is a casual hint of his which seems well worth taking note of in one of his delineations in meisters travels it is the hero comesupon a society of men with very strange ways one of which was this we require says the master that each of our people shall restrict himself in one direction shall go right against his desire in one matter and make himself do the thing he does not wish should we allow him the greater latitude on all other sides there seems to me a great justness in this enjoying things which are pleasant that is not the evil it is the reducing of our moral self to slavery by them that is let a man assert withal that he is king over his habitudes that he could and would shake them off on cause shown this is an excellent law the month ramadhan for the moslem much in mahomets religion much in his own life bears in that direction if not by forethought or clear purpose of moral improvement on his part then by a certain healthy manful instinct which is as good but there is another thing to be said about the mahometan heaven and hell this namely that however gross and material they may be they are an emblem of an everlasting truth not always so well remembered elsewhere that gross sensual paradise of his that horrible flaming hell the great enormous day of judgment he perpetually insists on what is all this but a rude shadow in the rude bedouin imagination of that grand spiritual fact and beginning of facts which it is ill for us too if we do not all know and feel the infinite nature of duty that mans actions here are of infinite moment to him and never die or end at all that man with his little life reaches upwards high as heaven downwards low as hell and in his threescore years of time holds an eternity fearfully and wonderfully hidden all this had burnt itself as in flamecharacters into the wild arab soul as in flame and lightning it stands written there awful unspeakable ever present to him with bursting earnestness with a fierce savage sincerity halt articulating not able to articulate he strives to speak it bodies it forth in that heaven and that hell bodied forth in what way you will it is the first of all truths it is venerable under all embodiments what is the chief end of man here below mahomet has answered this question in a way that might put some of us to shame he does not like a bentham a paley take right and wrong and calculate the profit and loss ultimate pleasure of the one and of the other and summing all up by addition and subtraction into a net result ask you whether on the whole the right does not preponderate considerably no it is not better to do the one than the other the one is to the other as life is to death as heaven is to hell the one must in nowise be done the other in nowise left undone you shall not measure them they are incommensurable the one is death eternal to a man the other is life eternal benthamee utility virtue by profit and loss reducing this godsworld to a dead brute steamengine the infinite celestial soul of man to a kind of haybalance for weighing hay and thistles on pleasures and pains on if you ask me which gives mahomet or they the beggarlier and falser view of man and his destinies in this universe i will answer it is not mahomet on the whole we will repeat that this religion of mahomets is a kind of christianity has a genuine element of what is spiritually highest looking through it not to be hidden by all its imperfections the scandinavian god wish the god of all rude men this has been enlarged into a heaven by mahomet but a heaven symbolical of sacred duty and to be earned by faith and welldoing by valiant action and a divine patience which is still more valiant it is scandinavian paganism and a truly celestial element superadded to that call it not false look not at the falsehood of it look at the truth of it for these twelve centuries it has been the religion and lifeguidance of the fifth part of the whole kindred of mankind above all things it has been a religion heartily believed these arabs believe their religion and try to live by it no christians since the early ages or only perhaps the english puritans in modern times have ever stood by their faith as the moslem do by theirs believing it wholly fronting time with it and eternity with it this night the watchman on the streets of cairo when he cries who goes will hear from the passenger along with his answer there is no god but god allah akbar islam sounds through the souls and whole daily existence of these dusky millions zealous missionaries preach it abroad among malays black papuans brutal idolaters displacing what is worse nothing that is better or good to the arab nation it was as a birth from darkness into light arabia first became alive by means of it a poor shepherd people roaming unnoticed in its deserts since the creation of the world a heroprophet was sent down to them with a word they could believe see the unnoticed becomes worldnotable the small has grown worldgreat within one century afterwards arabia is at grenada on this hand at delhi on that glancing in valour and splendour and the light of genius arabia shines through long ages over a great section of the world belief is great lifegiving the history of a nation becomes fruitful soulelevating great so soon as it believes these arabs the man mahomet and that one century is it not as if a spark had fallen one spark on a world of what seemed black unnoticeable sand but lo the sand proves explosive powder blazes heavenhigh from delhi to grenada i said the great man was always as lightning out of heaven the rest of men waited for him like fuel and then they too would flame lecture iii the hero as poet dante shakspeare tuesday th may the hero as divinity the hero as prophet are productions of old ages not to be repeated in the new they presuppose a certain rudeness of conception which the progress of mere scientific knowledge puts an end to there needs to be as it were a world vacant or almost vacant of scientific forms if men in their loving wonder are to fancy their fellowman either a god or one speaking with the voice of a god divinity and prophet are past we are now to see our hero in the less ambitious but also less questionable character of poet a character which does not pass the poet is a heroic figure belonging to all ages whom all ages possess when once he is produced whom the newest age as the oldest may produce and will produce always when nature pleases let nature send a herosoul in no age is it other than possible that he may be shaped into a poet hero prophet poet many different names in different times and places do we give to great men according to varieties we note in them according to the sphere in which they have displayed themselves we might give many more names on this same principle i will remark again however as a fact not unimportant to be understood that the different sphere constitutes the grand origin of such distinction that the hero can be poet prophet king priest or what you will according to the kind of world he finds himself born into i confess i have no notion of a truly great man that could not be all sorts of men the poet who could merely sit on a chair and compose stanzas would never make a stanza worth much he could not sing the heroic warrior unless he himself were at least a heroic warrior too i fancy there is in him the politician the thinker legislator philosopher in one or the other degree he could have been he is all these so too i cannot understand how a mirabeau with that great glowing heart with the fire that was in it with the bursting tears that were in it could not have written verses tragedies poems touched all hearts in that way had his course of life and education led him thitherward the grand fundamental character is that of great man that the man be great napoleon has words in him which are like austerlitz battles louis fourteenths marshals are a kind of poetical men withal the things turenne says are full of sagacity and geniality like sayings of samuel johnson the great heart the clear deepseeing eye there it lies no man whatever in what province soever can prosper at all without these petrarch and boccaccio did diplomatic messages it seems quite well one can easily believe it they had done things a little harder than these burns a gifted songwriter might have made a still better mirabeau shakspeare one knows not what he could not have made in the supreme degree true there are aptitudes of nature too nature does not make all great men more than all other men in the selfsame mould varieties of aptitude doubtless but infinitely more of circumstance and far oftenest it is the latter only that are looked to but it is as with common men in the learning of trades you take any man as yet a vague capability of a man who could be any kind of craftsman and make him into a smith a carpenter a mason he is then and thenceforth that and nothing else and if as addison complains you sometimes see a streetporter staggering under his load on spindleshanks and near at hand a tailor with the frame of a samson handling a bit of cloth and small whitechapel needle it cannot be considered that aptitude of nature alone has been consulted here either the great man also to what shall he be bound apprentice given your hero is he to become conqueror king philosopher poet it is an inexplicably complex controversialcalculation between the world and him he will read the world and its laws the world with its laws will be there to be read what the world on this matter shall permit and bid is as we said the most important fact about the world poet and prophet differ greatly in our loose modern notions of them in some old languages again the titles are synonymous vates means both prophet and poet and indeed at all times prophet and poet well understood have much kindred of meaning fundamentally indeed they are still the same in this most important respect especially that they have penetrated both of them into the sacred mystery of the universe what goethe calls the open secret which is the great secret asks one the open secret open to all seen by almost none that divine mystery which lies everywhere in all beings the divine idea of the world that which lies at the bottom of appearance as fichte styles it of which all appearance from the starry sky to the grass of the field but especially the appearance of man and his work is but the vesture the embodiment that renders it visible this divine mystery is in all times and in all places veritably is in most times and places it is greatly overlooked and the universe definable always in one or the other dialect as the realised thought of god is considered a trivial inert commonplace matter as if says the satirist it were a dead thing which some upholsterer had put together it could do no good at present to speak much about this but it is a pity for every one of us if we do not know it live ever in the knowledge of it really a most mournful pity a failure to live at all if we live otherwise but now i say whoever may forget this divine mystery the vates whether prophet or poet has penetrated into it is a man sent hither to make it more impressively known to us that always is his message he is to reveal that to us that sacred mystery which he more than others lives ever present with while others forget it he knows it i might say he has been driven to know it without consent asked of him he finds himself living in it bound to live in it once more here is no hearsay but a direct insight and belief this man too could not help being a sincere man whosoever may live in the shows of things it is for him a necessity of nature to live in the very fact of things a man once more in earnest with the universe though all others were but toying with it he is a vates first of all in virtue of being sincere so far poet and prophet participators in the open secret are one with respect to their distinction again the vates prophet we might say has seized that sacred mystery rather on the moral side as good and evil duty and prohibition the vates poet on what the germans call the sthetic side as beautiful and the like the one we may call a revealer of what we are to do the other of what we are to love but indeed these two provinces run into one another and cannot be disjoined the prophet too has his eye on what we are to love how else shall he know what it is we are to do the highest voice ever heard on this earth said withal consider the lilies of the field they toil not neither do they spin yet solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these a glance that into the deepest deep of beauty the lilies of the field dressed finer than earthly princes springingup there in the humble furrowfield a beautiful eye lookingout on you from the great inner sea of beauty how could the rude earth make these if her essence rugged as she looks and is were not inwardly beauty in this point of view too a saying of goethes which has staggered several may have meaning the beautiful he intimates is higher than the good the beautiful includes in it the good the true beautiful which however i have said somewhere differs from the false as heaven does from vauxhall so much for the distinction and identity of poet and prophet in ancient and also in modern periods we find a few poets who are accounted perfect whom it were a kind of treason to find fault with this is noteworthy this is right yet in strictness it is only an illusion at bottom clearly enough there is no perfect poet a vein of poetry exists in the hearts of all men no man is made altogether of poetry we are all poets when we read a poem well the imagination that shudders at the hell of dante is not that the same faculty weaker in degree as dantes own no one but shakspeare can embody out of saxo grammaticus the story of hamlet as shakspeare did but every one models some kind of story out of it every one embodies it better or worse we need not spend time in defining where there is no specific difference as between round and square all definition must be more or less arbitrary a man that has so much more of the poetic element developed in him as to have become noticeable will be called poet by his neighbours worldpoets too those whom we are to take for perfect poets are settled by critics in the same way one who rises so far above the general level of poets will to such and such critics seem a universal poet as he ought to do and yet it is and must be an arbitrary distinction all poets all men have some touches of the universal no man is wholly made of that most poets are very soon forgotten but not the noblest shakspeare or homer of them can be remembered forever a day comes when he too is not nevertheless you will say there must be a difference between true poetry and true speech not poetical what is the difference on this point many things have been written especially by late german critics some of which are not very intelligible at first they say for example that the poet has an infinitude in him communicates an unendlichkeit a certain character of infinitude to whatsoever he delineates this though not very precise yet on so vague a matter is worth remembering if well meditated some meaning will gradually be found in it for my own part i find considerable meaning in the old vulgar distinction of poetry being metrical having music in it being a song truly if pressed to give a definition one might say this as soon as anything else if your delineation be authentically musical musical not in word only but in heart and substance in all the thoughts and utterances of it in the whole conception of it then it will be poetical if not not musical how much lies in that a musical thought is one spoken by a mind that has penetrated into the inmost heart of the thing detected the inmost mystery of it namely the melody that lies hidden in it the inward harmony of coherence which is its soul whereby it exists and has a right to be here in this world all inmost things we may say are melodious naturally utter themselves in song the meaning of song goes deep who is there that in logical words can express the effect music has on us a kind of inarticulate unfathomable speech which leads us to the edge of the infinite and lets us for moments gaze into that nay all speech even the commonest speech has something of song in it not a parish in the world but has its parishaccent the rhythm or tune to which the people there sing what they have to say accent is a kind of chanting all men have accent of their own though they only notice that of others observe too how all passionate language does of itself become musical with a finer music than the mere accent the speech of a man even in zealous anger becomes a chant a song all deep things are song it seems somehow the very central essence of us song as if all the rest were but wrappages and hulls the primal element of us of us and of all things the greeks fabled of sphereharmonies it was the feeling they had of the inner structure of nature that the soul of all her voices and utterances was perfect music poetry therefore we will call musical thought the poet is he who thinks in that manner at bottom it turns still on power of intellect it is a mans sincerity and depth of vision that makes him a poet see deep enough and you see musically the heart of nature being everywhere music if you can only reach it the vates poet with his melodious apocalypse of nature seems to hold a poor rank among us in comparison with the vates prophet his function and our esteem of him for his function alike slight the hero taken as divinity the hero taken as prophet then next the hero taken only as poet does it not look as if our estimate of the great man epoch after epoch were continually diminishing we take him first for a god then for one godinspired and now in the next stage of it his most miraculous word gains from us only the recognition that he is a poet beautiful versemaker man of genius or suchlike it looks so but i persuade myself that intrinsically it is not so if we consider well it will perhaps appear that in man still there is the same altogether peculiar admiration for the heroic gift by what name soever called that there at any time was i should say if we do not now reckon a great man literally divine it is that our notions of god of the supreme unattainable fountain of splendour wisdom and heroism are ever rising higher not altogether that our reverence for these qualities as manifested in our like is getting lower this is worth taking thought of sceptical dilettantism the curse of these ages a curse which will not last forever does indeed in this the highest province of human things as in all provinces make sad work and our reverence for great men all crippled blinded paralytic as it is comes out in poor plight hardly recognisable men worship the shows of great men the most disbelieve that there is any reality of great men to worship the dreariest fatalest faith believing which one would literally despair of human things nevertheless look for example at napoleon a corsican lieutenant of artillery that is the show of him yet is he not obeyed worshipped after his sort as all the tiaraed and diademed of the world put together could not be high duchesses and ostlers of inns gather round the scottish rustic burns a strange feeling dwelling in each that they had never heard a man like this that on the whole this is the man in the secret heart of these people it still dimly reveals itself though there is no accredited way of uttering it at present that this rustic with his black brows and flashing suneyes and strange words moving laughter and tears is of a dignity far beyond all others incommensurable with all others do not we feel it so but now were dilettantism scepticism triviality and all that sorrowful brood castout of us as by gods blessing they shall one day be were faith in the shows of things entirely sweptout replaced by clear faith in the things so that a man acted on the impulse of that only and counted the other nonextant what a new livelier feeling towards this burns were it nay here in these pages such as they are have we not two mere poets if not deified yet we may say beatified shakspeare and dante are saints of poetry really if we will think of it canonised so that it is impiety to meddle with them the unguided instinct of the world working across all these perverse impediments has arrived at such result dante and shakspeare are a peculiar two they dwell apart in a kind of royal solitude none equal none second to them in the general feeling of the world a certain transcendentalism a glory as of complete perfection invests these two they are canonised though no pope or cardinals took hand in doing it such in spite of every perverting influence in the most unheroic times is still our indestructible reverence for heroism we will look a little at these two the poet dante and the poet shakspeare what little it is permitted us to say here of the hero as poet will most fitly arrange itself in that fashion many volumes have been written by way of commentary on dante and his book yet on the whole with no great result his biography is as it were irrecoverably lost for us an unimportant wandering sorrowstricken man not much note was taken of him while he lived and the most of that has vanished in the long space that now intervenes it is five centuries since he ceased writing and living here after all commentaries the book itself is mainly what we know of him the book and one might add that portrait commonly attributed to giotto which looking on it you cannot help inclining to think genuine whoever did it to me it is a most touching face perhaps of all faces that i know the most so lonely there painted as on vacancy with the simple laurel wound round it the deathless sorrow and pain the known victory which is also deathless significant of the whole history of dante i think it is the mournfulest face that ever was painted from reality an altogether tragic heartaffecting face there is in it as foundation of it the softness tenderness gentle affection as of a child but all this is as if congealed into sharp contradiction into abnegation isolation proud hopeless pain a soft ethereal soul lookingout so stern implacable grimtrenchant as from imprisonment of thickribbed ice withal it is a silent pain too a silent scornful one the lip is curled in a kind of godlike disdain of the thing that is eatingout his heart as if it were withal a mean insignificant thing as if he whom it had power to torture and strangle were greater than it the face of one wholly in protest and lifelong unsurrendering battle against the world affection all converted into indignation an implacable indignation slow equable silent like that of a god the eye too it looksout as in a kind of surprise a kind of inquiry why the world was of such a sort this is dante so he looks this voice of ten silent centuries and sings us his mystic unfathomable song the little that we know of dantes life corresponds well enough with this portrait and this book he was born at florence in the upper class of society in the year his education was the best then going much schooldivinity aristotelean logic some latin classics no inconsiderable insight into certain provinces of things and dante with his earnest intelligent nature we need not doubt learned better than most all that was learnable he has a clear cultivated understanding and of great subtlety the best fruit of education he had contrived to realise from these scholastics he knows accurately and well what lies close to him but in such a time without printed books or free intercourse he could not know well what was distant the small clear light most luminous for what is near breaks itself into singular chiaroscuro striking on what is far off this was dantes learning from the schools in life he had gone through the usual destinies been twice out campaigning as a soldier for the florentine state been on embassy had in his thirtyfifth year by natural gradation of talent and service become one of the chief magistrates of florence he had met in boyhood a certain beatrice portinari a beautiful little girl of his own age and rank and grownup thenceforth in partial sight of her in some distant intercourse with her all readers know his graceful affecting account of this and then of their being parted of her being wedded to another and of her death soon after she makes a great figure in dantes poem seems to have made a great figure in his life of all beings it might seem as if she held apart from him far apart at last in the dim eternity were the only one he had ever with his whole strength of affection loved she died dante himself was wedded but it seems not happily far from happily i fancy the rigorous earnest man with his keen excitabilities was not altogether easy to make happy we will not complain of dantes miseries had all gone right with him as he wished it he might have been prior podest or whatsoever they call it of florence well accepted among neighbours and the world had wanted one of the most notable words ever spoken or sung florence would have had another prosperous lord mayor and the ten dumb centuries continued voiceless and the ten other listening centuries for there will be ten of them and more had no divina commedia to hear we will complain of nothing a nobler destiny was appointed for this dante and he struggling like a man led towards death and crucifixion could not help fulfilling it give him the choice of his happiness he knew not more than we do what was really happy what was really miserable in dantes priorship the guelfghibelline bianchineri or some other confused disturbance rose to such a height that dante whose party had seemed the stronger was with his friends cast unexpectedly forth into banishment doomed thenceforth to a life of woe and wandering his property was all confiscated and more he had the fiercest feeling that it was entirely unjust nefarious in the sight of god and man he tried what was in him to get reinstated tried even by warlike surprisal with arms in his hand but it would not do bad only had become worse there is a record i believe still extant in the florence archives dooming this dante wheresoever caught to be burnt alive burnt alive so it stands they say a very curious civic document another curious document some considerable number of years later is a letter of dantes to the florentine magistrates written in answer to a milder proposal of theirs that he should return on condition of apologising and paying a fine he answers with fixed stern pride if i cannot return without calling myself guilty i will never return nunquam revertar for dante there was now no home in this world he wandered from patron to patron from place to place proving in his own bitter words how hard is the path come duro calle the wretched are not cheerful company dante poor and banished with his proud earnest nature with his moody humours was not a man to conciliate men petrarch reports of him that being at can della scalas court and blamed one day for his gloom and taciturnity he answered in no courtierlike way della scala stood among his courtiers with mimes and buffoons nebulones ac histriones making him heartily merry when turning to dante he said is it not strange now that this poor fool should make himself so entertaining while you a wise man sit there day after day and have nothing to amuse us with at all dante answered bitterly no not strange your highness is to recollect the proverb like to like given the amuser the amusee must also be given such a man with his proud silent ways with his sarcasms and sorrows was not made to succeed at court by degrees it came to be evident to him that he had no longer any restingplace or hope of benefit in this earth the earthly world had cast him forth to wander wander no living heart to love him now for his sore miseries there was no solace here the deeper naturally would the eternal world impress itself on him that awful reality over which after all this timeworld with its florences and banishments only flutters as an unreal shadow florence thou shalt never see but hell and purgatory and heaven thou shalt surely see what is florence can della scala and the world and life altogether eternity thither of a truth not elsewhither art thou and all things bound the great soul of dante homeless on earth made its home more and more in that awful other world naturally his thoughts brooded on that as on the one fact important for him bodied or bodiless it is the one fact important for all men but to dante in that age it was bodied in fixed certainty of scientific shape he no more doubted of that malebolge pool that it all lay there with its gloomy circles with its alti guai and that he himself should see it than we doubt that we should see constantinople if we went thither dantes heart long filled with this brooding over it in speechless thought and awe bursts forth at length into mystic unfathomable song and this his divine comedy the most remarkable of all modern books is the result it must have been a great solacement to dante and was as we can see a proud thought for him at times that he here in exile could do this work that no florence nor no man or men could hinder him from doing it or even much help him in doing it he knew too partly that it was great the greatest a man could do if thou follow thy star se tu segui tua stella so could the hero in his forsakenness in his extreme need still say to himself follow thou thy star thou shalt not fail of a glorious haven the labour of writing we find and indeed could know otherwise was great and painful for him he says this book which has made me lean for many years ah yes it was won all of it with pain and sore toil not in sport but in grim earnest his book as indeed most good books are has been written in many senses with his hearts blood it is his whole history this book he died after finishing it not yet very old at the age of fiftysix brokenhearted rather as is said he lies buried in his deathcity ravenna hic claudor dantes patriis extorris ab oris the florentines begged back his body in a century after the ravenna people would not give it here am i dante laid shutout from my native shores i said dantes poem was a song it is tieck who calls it a mystic unfathomable song and such is literally the character of it coleridge remarks very pertinently somewhere that wherever you find a sentence musically worded of true rhythm and melody in the words there is something deep and good in the meaning too for body and soul word and idea go strangely together here as everywhere song we said before it was the heroic of speech all old poems homers and the rest are authentically songs i would say in strictness that all right poems are that whatsoever is not sung is properly no poem but a piece of prose cramped into jingling lines to the great injury of the grammar to the great grief of the reader for most part what we want to get at is the thought the man had if he had any why should he twist it into jingle if he could speak it out plainly it is only when the heart of him is rapt into true passion of melody and the very tones of him according to coleridges remark become musical by the greatness depth and music of his thoughts that we can give him right to rhyme and sing that we call him a poet and listen to him as the heroic of speakers whose speech is song pretenders to this are many and to an earnest reader i doubt it is for most part a very melancholy not to say an insupportable business that of reading rhyme rhyme that had no inward necessity to be rhymed it ought to have told us plainly without any jingle what it was aiming at i would advise all men who can speak their thought not to sing it to understand that in a serious time among serious men there is no vocation in them for singing it precisely as we love the true song and are charmed by it as by something divine so shall we hate the false song and account it a mere wooden noise a thing hollow superfluous altogether an insincere and offensive thing i give dante my highest praise when i say of his divine comedy that it is in all senses genuinely a song in the very sound of it there is a canto fermo it proceeds as by a chant the language his simple terza rima doubtless helped him in this one reads along naturally with a sort of lilt but i add that it could not be otherwise for the essence and material of the work are themselves rhythmic its depth and rapt passion and sincerity makes its musical go deep enough there is music everywhere a true inward symmetry what one calls an architectural harmony reigns in it proportionates it all architectural which also partakes of the character of music the three kingdoms inferno purgatorio paradiso lookout on one another like compartments of a great edifice a great supernatural worldcathedral piledup there stern solemn awful dantes world of souls it is at bottom the sincerest of all poems sincerity here too we find to be the measure of worth it came deep out of the authors heart of hearts and it goes deep and through long generations into ours the people of verona when they saw him on the streets used to say eccovi l uom ch stato all inferno see there is the man that was in hell ah yes he had been in hell in hell enough in long severe sorrow and struggle as the like of him is pretty sure to have been commedias that comeout divine are not accomplished otherwise thought true labour of any kind highest virtue itself is it not the daughter of pain born as out of the black whirlwind true effort in fact as of a captive struggling to free himself that is thought in all ways we are to become perfect through suffering but as i say no work known to me is so elaborated as this of dantes it has all been as if molten in the hottest furnace of his soul it had made him lean for many years not the general whole only every compartment of it is workedout with intense earnestness into truth into clear visuality each answers to the other each fits in its place like a marble stone accurately hewn and polished it is the soul of dante and in this the soul of the middle ages rendered forever rhythmically visible there no light task a right intense one but a task which is done perhaps one would say intensity with the much that depends on it is the prevailing character of dantes genius dante does not come before us as a large catholic mind rather as a narrow and even sectarian mind it is partly the fruit of his age and position but partly too of his own nature his greatness has in all senses concentered itself into fiery emphasis and depth he is worldgreat not because he is worldwide but because he is worlddeep through all objects he pierces as it were down into the heart of being i know nothing so intense as dante consider for example to begin with the outermost development of his intensity consider how he paints he has a great power of vision seizes the very type of a thing presents that and nothing more you remember that first view he gets of the hall of dite red pinnacle redhot cone of iron glowing through the dim immensity of gloom so vivid so distinct visible at once and forever it is as an emblem of the whole genius of dante there is a brevity an abrupt precision in him tacitus is not briefer more condensed and then in dante it seems a natural condensation spontaneous to the man one smiting word and then there is silence nothing more said his silence is more eloquent than words it is strange with what a sharp decisive grace he snatches the true likeness of a matter cuts into the matter as with a pen of fire plutus the blustering giant collapses at virgils rebuke it is as the sails sink the mast being suddenly broken or that poor brunetto latini with the cotto aspetto face baked parched brown and lean and the fiery snow that falls on them there a fiery snow without wind slow deliberate neverending or the lids of those tombs square sarcophaguses in that silent dimburning hall each with its soul in torment the lids laid open there they are to be shut at the day of judgment through eternity and how farinata rises and how cavalcante falls at hearing of his son and the past tense fue the very movements in dante have something brief swift decisive almost military it is of the inmost essence of his genius this sort of painting the fiery swift italian nature of the man so silent passionate with its quick abrupt movements its silent pale rages speaks itself in these things for though this of painting is one of the outermost developments of a man it comes like all else from the essential faculty of him it is physiognomical of the whole man find a man whose words paint you a likeness you have found a man worth something mark his manner of doing it as very characteristic of him in the first place he could not have discerned the object at all or seen the vital type of it unless he had what we may call sympathised with it had sympathy in him to bestow on objects he must have been sincere about it too sincere and sympathetic a man without worth cannot give you the likeness of any object he dwells in vague outwardness fallacy and trivial hearsay about all objects and indeed may we not say that intellect altogether expresses itself in this power of discerning what an object is whatsoever of faculty a mans mind may have will come out here is it even of business a matter to be done the gifted man is he who sees the essential point and leaves all the rest aside as surplusage it is his faculty too the man of businesss faculty that he discern the true likeness not the false superficial one of the thing he has got to work in and how much of morality is in the kind of insight we get of anything the eye seeing in all things what it brought with it the faculty of seeing to the mean eye all things are trivial as certainly as to the jaundiced they are yellow raphael the painters tell us is the best of all portraitpainters withal no most gifted eye can exhaust the significance of any object in the commonest human face there lies more than raphael will takeaway with him dantes painting is not graphic only brief true and of a vividness as of fire in dark night taken on the wider scale it is everyway noble and the outcome of a great soul francesca and her lover what qualities in that a thing woven as out of rainbows on a ground of eternal black a small flutevoice of infinite wail speaks there into our very heart of hearts a touch of womanhood in it too della bella persona che mi fu tolta and how even in the pit of woe it is a solace that he will never part from her saddest tragedy in these alti guai and the racking winds in that aer bruno whirl them away again to wail forever strange to think dante was the friend of this poor francescas father francesca herself may have sat upon the poets knee as a bright innocent little child infinite pity yet also infinite rigour of law it is so nature is made it is so dante discerned that she was made what a paltry notion is that of his divine comedys being a poor splenetic impotent terrestrial libel putting those into hell whom he could not be avengedupon on earth i suppose if ever pity tender as a mothers was in the heart of any man it was in dantes but a man who does not know rigour cannot pity either his very pity will be cowardly egoistic sentimentality or little better i know not in the world an affection equal to that of dante it is a tenderness a trembling longing pitying love like the wail of olean harps soft soft like a childs young heart and then that stern soresaddened heart these longings of his towards his beatrice their meeting together in the paradiso his gazing in her pure transfigured eyes her that had been purified by death so long separated from him so far one likens it to the song of angels it is among the purest utterances of affection perhaps the very purest that ever came out of a human soul for the intense dante is intense in all things he has got into the essence of all his intellectual insight as painter on occasion too as reasoner is but the result of all other sorts of intensity morally great above all we must call him it is the beginning of all his scorn his grief are as transcendent as his love as indeed what are they but the inverse or converse of his love a dio spiacenti ed a nemici sui hateful to god and to the enemies of god lofty scorn unappeasable silent reprobation and aversion non ragionam di lor we will not speak of them look only and pass or think of this they have not the hope to die non han speranza di morte one day it had risen sternly benign on the scathed heart of dante that he wretched neverresting worn as he was would full surely die that destiny itself could not doom him not to die such words are in this man for rigour earnestness and depth he is not to be paralleled in the modern world to seek his parallel we must go into the hebrew bible and live with the antique prophets there i do not agree with much modern criticism in greatly preferring the inferno to the two other parts of the divine commedia such preference belongs i imagine to our general byronism of taste and is like to be a transient feeling the purgatorio and paradiso especially the former one would almost say is even more excellent than it it is a noble thing that purgatorio mountain of purification an emblem of the noblest conception of that age if sin is so fatal and hell is and must be so rigorous awful yet in repentance too is man purified repentance is the grand christian act it is beautiful how dante works it out the tremolar dell onde that trembling of the oceanwaves under the first pure gleam of morning dawning afar on the wandering two is as the type of an altered mood hope has now dawned neverdying hope if in company still with heavy sorrow the obscure sojourn of dmons and reprobate is underfoot a soft breathing of penitence mounts higher and higher to the throne of mercy itself pray for me the denizens of that mount of pain all say to him tell my giovanna to pray for me my daughter giovanna i think her mother loves me no more they toil painfully up by that winding steep bentdown like corbels of a building some of them crushedtogether so for the sin of pride yet nevertheless in years in ages and ons they shall have reached the top which is heavens gate and by mercy shall have been admitted in the joy too of all when one has prevailed the whole mountain shakes with joy and a psalm of praise rises when one soul has perfected repentance and got its sin and misery left behind i call all this a noble embodiment of a true noble thought but indeed the three compartments mutually support one another are indispensable to one another the paradiso a kind of inarticulate music to me is the redeeming side of the inferno the inferno without it were untrue all three makeup the true unseen world as figured in the christianity of the middle ages a thing forever memorable forever true in the essence of it to all men it was perhaps delineated in no human soul with such depth of veracity as in this of dantes a man sent to sing it to keep it long memorable very notable with what brief simplicity he passes out of the everyday reality into the invisible one and in the second or third stanza we find ourselves in the world of spirits and dwell there as among things palpable indubitable to dante they were so the real world as it is called and its facts was but the threshold to an infinitely higher fact of a world at bottom the one was as preternatural as the other has not each man a soul he will not only be a spirit but is one to the earnest dante it is all one visible fact he believes it sees it is the poet of it in virtue of that sincerity i say again is the saving merit now as always dantes hell purgatory paradise are a symbol withal an emblematic representation of his belief about this universe some critic in a future age like those scandinavian ones the other day who has ceased altogether to think as dante did may find this too all an allegory perhaps an idle allegory it is a sublime embodiment or sublimest of the soul of christianity it expresses as in huge worldwide architectural emblems how the christian dante felt good and evil to be the two polar elements of this creation on which it all turns that these two differ not by preferability of one to the other but by incompatibility absolute and infinite that the one is excellent and high as light and heaven the other hideous black as gehenna and the pit of hell everlasting justice yet with penitence with everlasting pity all christianism as dante and the middle ages had it is emblemed here emblemed and yet as i urged the other day with what entire truth of purpose how unconscious of any embleming hell purgatory paradise these things were not fashioned as emblems was there in our modern european mind any thought at all of their being emblems were they not indubitable awful facts the whole heart of man taking them for practically true all nature everywhere confirming them so is it always in these things men do not believe an allegory the future critic whatever his new thought may be who considers this of dante to have been all gotup as an allegory will commit one sore mistake paganism we recognised as a veracious expression of the earnest awestruck feeling of man towards the universe veracious true once and still not without worth for us but mark here the difference of paganism and christianism one great difference paganism emblemed chiefly the operations of nature the destinies efforts combinations vicissitudes of things and men in this world christianism emblemed the law of human duty the moral law of man one was for the sensuous nature a rude helpless utterance of the first thought of men the chief recognised virtue courage superiority to fear the other was not for the sensuous nature but for the moral what a progress is here if in that one respect only and so in this dante as we said had ten silent centuries in a very strange way found a voice the divina commedia is of dantes writing yet in truth it belongs to ten christian centuries only the finishing of it is dantes so always the craftsman there the smith with that metal of his with these tools with these cunning methods how little of all he does is properly his work all past inventive men work there with him as indeed with all of us in all things dante is the spokesman of the middle ages the thought they lived by stands here in everlasting music these sublime ideas of his terrible and beautiful are the fruit of the christian meditation of all the good men who had gone before him precious they but also is not he precious much had not he spoken would have been dumb not dead yet living voiceless on the whole is it not an utterance this mystic song at once of one of the greatest human souls and of the highest thing that europe had hitherto realised for itself christianism as dante sings it is another than paganism in the rude norse mind another than bastard christianism halfarticulately spoken in the arab desert sevenhundred years before the noblest idea made real hitherto among men is sung and emblemedforth abidingly by one of the noblest men in the one sense and in the other are we not right glad to possess it as i calculate it may last yet for long thousands of years for the thing that is uttered from the inmost parts of a mans soul differs altogether from what is uttered by the outer part the outer is of the day under the empire of mode the outer passes away in swift endless changes the inmost is the same yesterday today and forever true souls in all generations of the world who look on this dante will find a brotherhood in him the deep sincerity of his thoughts his woes and hopes will speak likewise to their sincerity they will feel that this dante too was a brother napoleon in sainthelena is charmed with the genial veracity of old homer the oldest hebrew prophet under a vesture the most diverse from ours does yet because he speaks from the heart of man speak to all mens hearts it is the one sole secret of continuing long memorable dante for depth of sincerity is like an antique prophet too his words like theirs come from his very heart one need not wonder if it were predicted that his poem might be the most enduring thing our europe has yet made for nothing so endures as a truly spoken word all cathedrals pontificalities brass and stone and outer arrangement never so lasting are brief in comparison to an unfathomable heartsong like this one feels as if it might survive still of importance to men when these had all sunk into new irrecognisable combinations and had ceased individually to be europe has made much great cities great empires encyclopdias creeds bodies of opinion and practice but it has made little of the class of dantes thought homer yet is veritably present face to face with every open soul of us and greece where is it desolate for thousands of years away vanished a bewildered heap of stones and rubbish the life and existence of it all gone like a dream like the dust of king agamemnon greece was greece except in the words it spoke is not the uses of this dante we will not say much about his uses a human soul who has once got into that primal element of song and sungforth fitly somewhat therefrom has worked in the depths of our existence feeding through long times the liferoots of all excellent human things whatsoever in a way that utilities will not succeed well in calculating we will not estimate the sun by the quantity of gaslight it saves us dante shall be invaluable or of no value one remark i may make the contrast in this respect between the heropoet and the heroprophet in a hundred years mahomet as we saw had his arabians at grenada and at delhi dantes italians seem to be yet very much where they were shall we say then dantes effect on the world was small in comparison not so his arena is far more restricted but also it is far nobler clearer perhaps not less but more important mahomet speaks to great masses of men in the coarse dialect adapted to such a dialect filled with inconsistencies crudities follies on the great masses alone can he act and there with good and with evil strangely blended dante speaks to the noble the pure and great in all times and places neither does he grow obsolete as the other does dante burns as a pure star fixed there in the firmament at which the great and the high of all ages kindle themselves he is the possession of all the chosen of the world for uncounted time dante one calculates may long survive mahomet in this way the balance may be made straight again but at any rate it is not by what is called their effect on the world by what we can judge of their effect there that a man and his work are measured effect influence utility let a man do his work the fruit of it is the care of another than he it will grow its own fruit and whether embodied in caliph thrones and arabian conquests so that it fills all morning and evening newspapers and all histories which are a kind of distilled newspapers or not embodied so at all what matters that that is not the real fruit of it the arabian caliph in so far only as he did something was something if the great cause of man and mans work in gods earth got no furtherance from the arabian caliph then no matter how many scimetars he drew how many gold piasters pocketed and what uproar and blaring he made in this world he was but a loudsounding inanity and futility at bottom he was not at all let us honour the great empire of silence once more the boundless treasury which we do not jingle in our pockets or count up and present before men it is perhaps of all things the usefulest for each of us to do in these loud times as dante the italian man was sent into our world to embody musically the religion of the middle ages the religion of our modern europe its inner life so shakspeare we may say embodies for us the outer life of our europe as developed then its chivalries courtesies humours ambitions what practical way of thinking acting looking at the world men then had as in homer we may still construe old greece so in shakspeare and dante after thousands of years what our modern europe was in faith and in practice will still be legible dante has given us the faith or soul shakspeare in a not less noble way has given us the practice or body this latter also we were to have a man was sent for it the man shakspeare just when that chivalry way of life had reached its last finish and was on the point of breaking down into slow or swift dissolution as we now see it everywhere this other sovereign poet with his seeing eye with his perennial singing voice was sent to take note of it to give longenduring record of it two fit men dante deep fierce as the central fire of the world shakspeare wide placid farseeing as the sun the upper light of the world italy produced the one worldvoice we english had the honour of producing the other curious enough how as it were by mere accident this man came to us i think always so great quiet complete and selfsufficing is this shakspeare had the warwickshire squire not prosecuted him for deerstealing we had perhaps never heard of him as a poet the woods and skies the rustic life of man in stratford there had been enough for this man but indeed that strange outbudding of our whole english existence which we call the elizabethan era did not it too come as of its own accord the tree igdrasil buds and withers by its own laws too deep for our scanning yet it does bud and wither and every bough and leaf of it is there by fixed eternal laws not a sir thomas lucy but comes at the hour fit for him curious i say and not sufficiently considered how everything does coperate with all not a leaf rotting on the highway but is indissoluble portion of solar and stellar systems no thought word or act of man but has sprung withal out of all men and works sooner or later recognisably or irrecognisably on all men it is all a tree circulation of sap and influences mutual communication of every minutest leaf with the lowest talon of a root with every other greatest and minutest portion of the whole the tree igdrasil that has its roots down in the kingdoms of hela and death and whose boughs overspread the highest heaven in some sense it may be said that this glorious elizabethan era with its shakspeare as the outcome and flowerage of all which had preceded it is itself attributable to the catholicism of the middle ages the christian faith which was the theme of dantes song had produced this practical life which shakspeare was to sing for religion then as it now and always is was the soul of practice the primary vital fact in mens life and remark here as rather curious that middleage catholicism was abolished so far as acts of parliament could abolish it before shakspeare the noblest product of it made his appearance he did make his appearance nevertheless nature at her own time with catholicism or what else might be necessary sent him forth taking small thought of acts of parliament kinghenrys queenelizabeths go their way and nature too goes hers acts of parliament on the whole are small notwithstanding the noise they make what act of parliament debate at st stephens on the hustings or elsewhere was it that brought this shakspeare into being no dining at freemasons tavern opening subscriptionlists selling of shares and infinite other jangling and true or false endeavouring this elizabethan era and all its nobleness and blessedness came without proclamation preparation of ours priceless shakspeare was the free gift of nature given altogether silently received altogether silently as if it had been a thing of little account and yet very literally it is a priceless thing one should look at that side of matters too of this shakspeare of ours perhaps the opinion one sometimes hears a little idolatrously expressed is in fact the right one i think the best judgment not of this country only but of europe at large is slowly pointing to the conclusion that shakspeare is the chief of all poets hitherto the greatest intellect who in our recorded world has left record of himself in the way of literature on the whole i know not such a power of vision such a faculty of thought if we take all the characters of it in any other man such a calmness of depth placid joyous strength all things imaged in that great soul of his so true and clear as in a tranquil unfathomable sea it has been said that in the constructing of shakspeares dramas there is apart from all other faculties as they are called an understanding manifested equal to that in bacons novum organum that is true and it is not a truth that strikes every one it would become more apparent if we tried any of us for himself how out of shakspeares dramatic materials we could fashion such a result the built house seems all so fit everyway as it should be as if it came there by its own law and the nature of things we forget the rude disorderly quarry it was shaped from the very perfection of the house as if nature herself had made it hides the builders merit perfect more perfect than any other man we may call shakspeare in this he discerns knows as by instinct what condition he works under what his materials are what his own force and its relation to them is it is not a transitory glance of insight that will suffice it is deliberate illumination of the whole matter it is a calmly seeing eye a great intellect in short how a man of some wide thing that he has witnessed will construct a narrative what kind of picture and delineation he will give of it is the best measure you could get of what intellect is in the man which circumstance is vital and shall stand prominent which unessential fit to be suppressed where is the true beginning the true sequence and ending to find out this you task the whole force of insight that is in the man he must understand the thing according to the depth of his understanding will the fitness of his answer be you will try him so does like join itself to like does the spirit of method stir in that confusion so that its embroilment becomes order can the man say fiat lux let there be light and out of chaos make a world precisely as there is light in himself will he accomplish this or indeed we may say again it is in what i called portraitpainting delineating of men and things especially of men that shakspeare is great all the greatness of the man comes out decisively here it is unexampled i think that calm creative perspicacity of shakspeare the thing he looks at reveals not this or that face of it but its inmost heart and generic secret it dissolves itself as in light before him so that he discerns the perfect structure of it creative we said poetic creation what is this too but seeing the thing sufficiently the word that will describe the thing follows of itself from such clear intense sight of the thing and is not shakspeares morality his valour candour tolerance truthfulness his whole victorious strength and greatness which can triumph over such obstructions visible there too great as the world no twisted poor convexconcave mirror reflecting all objects with its own convexities and concavities a perfectly level mirror that is to say withal if we will understand it a man justly related to all things and men a good man it is truly a lordly spectacle how this great soul takesin all kinds of men and objects a falstaff an othello a juliet a coriolanus sets them all forth to us in their round completeness loving just the equal brother of all novum organum and all the intellect you will find in bacon is of a quite secondary order earthly material poor in comparison with this among modern men one finds in strictness almost nothing of the same rank goethe alone since the days of shakspeare reminds me of it of him too you say that he saw the object you may say what he himself says of shakspeare his characters are like watches with dialplates of transparent crystal they show you the hour like others and the inward mechanism also is all visible the seeing eye it is this that discloses the inner harmony of things what nature meant what musical idea nature has wrappedup in these often rough embodiments something she did mean to the seeing eye that something were discernible are they base miserable things you can laugh over them you can weep over them you can in some way or other genially relate yourself to them you can at lowest hold your peace about them turn away your own and others face from them till the hour come for practically exterminating and extinguishing them at bottom it is the poets first gift as it is all mens that he have intellect enough he will be a poet if he have a poet in word or failing that perhaps still better a poet in act whether he write at all and if so whether in prose or in verse will depend on accidents who knows on what extremely trivial accidents perhaps on his having had a singingmaster on his being taught to sing in his boyhood but the faculty which enables him to discern the inner heart of things and the harmony that dwells there for whatsoever exists has a harmony in the heart of it or it would not hold together and exist is not the result of habits or accidents but the gift of nature herself the primary outfit for a heroic man in what sort soever to the poet as to every other we say first of all see if you cannot do that it is of no use to keep stringing rhymes together jingling sensibilities against each other and name yourself a poet there is no hope for you if you can there is in prose or verse in action or speculation all manner of hope the crabbed old schoolmaster used to ask when they brought him a new pupil but are ye sure hes not a dunce why really one might ask the same thing in regard to every man proposed for whatsoever function and consider it as the one inquiry needful are ye sure hes not a dunce there is in this world no other entirely fatal person for in fact i say the degree of vision that dwells in a man is a correct measure of the man if called to define shakspeares faculty i should say superiority of intellect and think i had included all under that what indeed are faculties we talk of faculties as if they were distinct things separable as if a man had intellect imagination fancy c as he has hands feet and arms that is a capital error then again we hear of a mans intellectual nature and of his moral nature as if these again were divisible and existed apart necessities of language do perhaps prescribe such forms of utterance we must speak i am aware in that way if we are to speak at all but words ought not to harden into things for us it seems to me our apprehension of this matter is for the most part radically falsified thereby we ought to know withal and to keep for ever in mind that these divisions are at bottom but names that mans spiritual nature the vital force which dwells in him is essentially one and indivisible that what we call imagination fancy understanding and so forth are but different figures of the same power of insight all indissolubly connected with each other physiognomically related that if we knew one of them we might know all of them morality itself what we call the moral quality of a man what is this but another side of the one vital force whereby he is and works all that a man does is physiognomical of him you may see how a man would fight by the way in which he sings his courage or want of courage is visible in the word he utters in the opinion he has formed no less than in the stroke he strikes he is one and preaches the same self abroad in all these ways without hands a man might have feet and could still walk but consider it without morality intellect were impossible for him a thoroughly immoral man could not know anything at all to know a thing what we can call knowing a man must first love the thing sympathise with it that is be virtuously related to it if he have not the justice to put down his own selfishness at every turn the courage to stand by the dangeroustrue at every turn how shall he know his virtues all of them will lie recorded in his knowledge nature with her truth remains to the bad to the selfish and the pusillanimous forever a sealed book what such can know of nature is mean superficial small for the uses of the day merely but does not the very fox know something of nature exactly so it knows where the geese lodge the human reynard very frequent everywhere in the world what more does he know but this and the like of this nay it should be considered too that if the fox had not a certain vulpine morality he could not even know where the geese were or get at the geese if he spent his time in splenetic atrabiliar reflections on his own misery his ill usage by nature fortune and other foxes and so forth and had not courage promptitude practicality and other suitable vulpine gifts and graces he would catch no geese we may say of the fox too that his morality and insight are of the same dimensions different faces of the same internal unity of vulpine life these things are worth stating for the contrary of them acts with manifold very baleful perversion in this time what limitations modifications they require your own candour will supply if i say therefore that shakspeare is the greatest of intellects i have said all concerning him but there is more in shakspeares intellect than we have yet seen it is what i call an unconscious intellect there is more virtue in it than he himself is aware of novalis beautifully remarks of him that those dramas of his are products of nature too deep as nature herself i find a great truth in this saying shakspeares art is not artifice the noblest worth of it is not there by plan or precontrivance it growsup from the deeps of nature through this noble sincere soul who is a voice of nature the latest generations of men will find new meanings in shakspeare new elucidations of their own human being new harmonies with the infinite structure of the universe concurrences with later ideas affinities with the higher powers and senses of man this well deserves meditating it is natures highest reward to a true simple great soul that he get thus to be a part of herself such a mans works whatsoever he with utmost conscious exertion and forethought shall accomplish grow up withal unconsciously from the unknown deeps in him as the oaktree grows from the earths bosom as the mountains and waters shape themselves with a symmetry grounded on natures own laws conformable to all truth whatsoever how much in shakspeare lies hid his sorrows his silent struggles known to himself much that was not known at all not speakable at all like roots like sap and forces working underground speech is great but silence is greater withal the joyful tranquillity of this man is notable i will not blame dante for his misery it is as battle without victory but true battle the first indispensable thing yet i call shakspeare greater than dante in that he fought truly and did conquer doubt it not he had his own sorrows those sonnets of his will even testify expressly in what deep waters he had waded and swum struggling for his life as what man like him ever failed to have to do it seems to me a heedless notion our common one that he sat like a bird on the bough and sang forth free and offhand never knowing the troubles of other men not so with no man is it so how could a man travel forward from rustic deerpoaching to such tragedywriting and not fallin with sorrows by the way or still better how could a man delineate a hamlet a coriolanus a macbeth so many suffering heroic hearts if his own heroic heart had never suffered and now in contrast with all this observe his mirthfulness his genuine overflowing love of laughter you would say in no point does he exaggerate but only in laughter fiery objurgations words that pierce and burn are to be found in shakspeare yet he is always in measure here never what johnson would remark as a specially good hater but his laughter seems to pour from him in floods he heaps all manner of ridiculous nicknames on the butt he is bantering tumbles and tosses him in all sorts of horseplay you would say with his whole heart laughs and then if not always the finest it is always a genial laughter not at mere weakness at misery or poverty never no man who can laugh what we call laughing will laugh at these things it is some poor character only desiring to laugh and have the credit of wit that does so laughter means sympathy good laughter is not the crackling of thorns under the pot even at stupidity and pretension this shakspeare does not laugh otherwise than genially dogberry and verges tickle our very hearts and we dismiss them covered with explosions of laughter but we like the poor fellows only the better for our laughing and hope they will get on well there and continue presidents of the citywatch such laughter like sunshine on the deep sea is very beautiful to me we have no room to speak of shakspeares individual works though perhaps there is much still waiting to be said on that head had we for instance all his plays reviewed as hamlet in wilhelm meister is a thing which might one day be done august wilhelm schlegel has a remark on his historical plays henry fifth and the others which is worth remembering he calls them a kind of national epic marlborough you recollect said he knew no english history but what he had learned from shakspeare there are really if we look to it few as memorable histories the great salient points are admirably seized all rounds itself off into a kind of rhythmic coherence it is as schlegel says epic as indeed all delineation by a great thinker will be there are right beautiful things in those pieces which indeed together form one beautiful thing that battle of agincourt strikes me as one of the most perfect things in its sort we anywhere have of shakspeares the description of the two hosts the wornout jaded english the dread hour big with destiny when the battle shall begin and then that deathless valour ye good yeomen whose limbs were made in england there is a noble patriotism in it far other than the indifference you sometimes hear ascribed to shakspeare a true english heart breathes calm and strong through the whole business not boisterous protrusive all the better for that there is a sound in it like the ring of steel this man too had a right stroke in him had it come to that but i will say of shakspeares works generally that we have no full impress of him there even as full as we have of many men his works are so many windows through which we see a glimpse of the world that was in him all his works seem comparatively speaking cursory imperfect written under cramping circumstances giving only here and there a note of the full utterance of the man passages there are that come upon you like splendour out of heaven bursts of radiance illuminating the very heart of the thing you say that is true spoken once and forever wheresoever and whensoever there is an open human soul that will be recognised as true such bursts however make us feel that the surrounding matter is not radiant that it is in part temporary conventional alas shakspeare had to write for the globe playhouse his great soul had to crush itself as it could into that and no other mould it was with him then as it is with us all no man works save under conditions the sculptor cannot set his own free thought before us but his thought as he could translate it into the stone that was given with the tools that were given disjecta membra are all that we find of any poet or of any man whoever looks intelligently at this shakspeare may recognise that he too was a prophet in his way of an insight analogous to the prophetic though he took it up in another strain nature seemed to this man also divine unspeakable deep as tophet high as heaven we are such stuff as dreams are made of that scroll in westminster abbey which few read with understanding is of the depth of any seer but the man sang did not preach except musically we called dante the melodious priest of middleage catholicism may we not call shakspeare the still more melodious priest of a true catholicism the universal church of the future and of all times no narrow superstition harsh asceticism intolerance fanatical fierceness or perversion a revelation so far as it goes that such a thousandfold hidden beauty and divineness dwells in all nature which let all men worship as they can we may say without offence that there rises a kind of universal psalm out of this shakspeare too not unfit to make itself heard among the still more sacred psalms not in disharmony with these if we understood them but in harmony i cannot call this shakspeare a sceptic as some do his indifference to the creeds and theological quarrels of his time misleading them no neither unpatriotic though he says little about his patriotism nor sceptic though he says little about his faith such indifference was the fruit of his greatness withal his whole heart was in his own grand sphere of worship we may call it such these other controversies vitally important to other men were not vital to him but call it worship call it what you will is it not a right glorious thing and set of things this that shakspeare has brought us for myself i feel that there is actually a kind of sacredness in the fact of such a man being sent into this earth is he not an eye to us all a blessed heavensent bringer of light and at bottom was it not perhaps far better that this shakspeare everyway an unconscious man was conscious of no heavenly message he did not feel like mahomet because he saw into those internal splendours that he specially was the prophet of god and was he not greater than mahomet in that greater and also if we compute strictly as we did in dantes case more successful it was intrinsically an error that notion of mahomets of his supreme prophethood and has come down to us inextricably involved in error to this day dragging along with it such a coil of fables impurities intolerances as makes it a questionable step for me here and now to say as i have done that mahomet was a true speaker at all and not rather an ambitious charlatan perversity and simulacrum no speaker but a babbler even in arabia as i compute mahomet will have exhausted himself and become obsolete while this shakspeare this dante may still be young while this shakspeare may still pretend to be a priest of mankind of arabia as of other places for unlimited periods to come compared with any speaker or singer one knows even with schylus or homer why should he not for veracity and universality last like them he is sincere as they reaches deep down like them to the universal and perennial but as for mahomet i think it had been better for him not to be so conscious alas poor mahomet all that he was conscious of was a mere error a futility and triviality as indeed such ever is the truly great in him too was the unconscious that he was a wild arab lion of the desert and did speakout with that great thundervoice of his not by words which he thought to be great but by actions by feelings by a history which were great his koran has become a stupid piece of prolix absurdity we do not believe like him that god wrote that the great man here too as always is a force of nature whatsoever is truly great in him springsup from the inarticulate deeps well this is our poor warwickshire peasant who rose to be manager of a playhouse so that he could live without begging whom the earl of southampton cast some kind glances on whom sir thomas lucy many thanks to him was for sending to the treadmill we did not account him a god like odin while he dwelt with us on which point there were much to be said but i will say rather or repeat in spite of the sad state heroworship now lies in consider what this shakspeare has actually become among us which englishman we ever made in this land of ours which million of englishmen would we not giveup rather than the stratford peasant there is no regiment of highest dignitaries that we would sell him for he is the grandest thing we have yet done for our honour among foreign nations as an ornament to our english household what item is there that we would not surrender rather than him consider now if they asked us will you giveup your indian empire or your shakspeare you english never have had any indian empire or never have had any shakspeare really it were a grave question official persons would answer doubtless in official language but we for our part too should not we be forced to answer indian empire or no indian empire we cannot do without shakspeare indian empire will go at any rate some day but this shakspeare does not go he lasts forever with us we cannot giveup our shakspeare nay apart from spiritualities and considering him merely as a real marketable tangiblyuseful possession england before long this island of ours will hold but a small fraction of the english in america in new holland east and west to the very antipodes there will be a saxondom covering great spaces of the globe and now what is it that can keep all these together into virtually one nation so that they do not fallout and fight but live at peace in brotherlike intercourse helping one another this is justly regarded as the greatest practical problem the thing all manner of sovereignties and governments are here to accomplish what is it that will accomplish this acts of parliament administrative primeministers cannot america is parted from us so far as parliament could part it call it not fantastic for there is much reality in it here i say is an english king whom no time or chance parliament or combination of parliaments can dethrone this king shakspeare does not he shine in crowned sovereignty over us all as the noblest gentlest yet strongest of rallyingsigns indestructible really more valuable in that point of view than any other means or appliance whatsoever we can fancy him as radiant aloft over all the nations of englishmen a thousand years hence from paramatta from new york wheresoever under what sort of parishconstable soever english men and women are they will say to one another yes this shakspeare is ours we produced him we speak and think by him we are of one blood and kind with him the most commonsense politician too if he pleases may think of that yes truly it is a great thing for a nation that it get an articulate voice that it produce a man who will speakforth melodiously what the heart of it means italy for example poor italy lies dismembered scattered asunder not appearing in any protocol or treaty as a unity at all yet the noble italy is actually one italy produced its dante italy can speak the czar of all the russias he is strong with so many bayonets cossacks and cannons and does a great feat in keeping such a tract of earth politically together but he cannot yet speak something great in him but it is a dumb greatness he has had no voice of genius to be heard of all men and times he must learn to speak he is a great dumb monster hitherto his cannons and cossacks will all have rusted into nonentity while that dantes voice is still audible the nation that has a dante is bound together as no dumb russia can be we must here end what we had to say of the heropoet lecture iv the hero as priest luther reformation knox puritanism friday th may our present discourse is to be of the great man as priest we have repeatedly endeavoured to explain that all sorts of heroes are intrinsically of the same material that given a great soul open to the divine significance of life then there is given a man fit to speak of this to sing of this to fight and work for this in a great victorious enduring manner there is given a hero the outward shape of whom will depend on the time and the environment he finds himself in the priest too as i understand it is a kind of prophet in him too there is required to be a light of inspiration as we must name it he presides over the worship of the people is the uniter of them with the unseen holy he is the spiritual captain of the people as the prophet is their spiritual king with many captains he guides them heavenward by wise guidance through this earth and its work the ideal of him is that he too be what we can call a voice from the unseen heaven interpreting even as the prophet did and in a more familiar manner unfolding the same to men the unseen heaven the open secret of the universe which so few have an eye for he is the prophet shorn of his more awful splendour burning with mild equable radiance as the enlightener of daily life this i say is the ideal of a priest so in old times so in these and in all times one knows very well that in reducing ideals to practice great latitude of tolerance is needful very great but a priest who is not this at all who does not any longer aim or try to be this is a character of whom we had rather not speak in this place luther and knox were by express vocation priests and did faithfully perform that function in its common sense yet it will suit us better here to consider them chiefly in their historical character rather as reformers than priests there have been other priests perhaps equally notable in calmer times for doing faithfully the office of a leader of worship bringing down by faithful heroism in that kind a light from heaven into the daily life of their people leading them forward as under gods guidance in the way wherein they were to go but when this same way was a rough one of battle confusion and danger the spiritual captain who led through that becomes especially to us who live under the fruit of his leading more notable than any other he is the warfaring and battling priest who led his people not to quiet faithful labour as in smooth times but to faithful valorous conflict in times all violent dismembered a more perilous service and a more memorable one be it higher or not these two men we will account our best priests inasmuch as they were our best reformers nay i may ask is not every true reformer by the nature of him a priest first of all he appeals to heavens invisible justice against earths visible force knows that it the invisible is strong and alone strong he is a believer in the divine truth of things a seer seeing through the shows of things a worshipper in one way or the other of the divine truth of things a priest that is if he be not first a priest he will never be good for much as a reformer thus then as we have seen great men in various situations building up religions heroic forms of human existence in this world theories of life worthy to be sung by a dante practices of life by a shakspeare we are now to see the reverse process which also is necessary which also may be carried on in the heroic manner curious how this should be necessary yet necessary it is the mild shining of the poets light has to give place to the fierce lightning of the reformer unfortunately the reformer too is a personage that cannot fail in history the poet indeed with his mildness what is he but the product and ultimate adjustment of reform or prophecy with its fierceness no wild saint dominics and thebad eremites there had been no melodious dante rough practical endeavour scandinavian and other from odin to walter raleigh from ulfila to cranmer enabled shakspeare to speak nay the finished poet i remark sometimes is a symptom that his epoch itself has reached perfection and is finished that before long there will be a new epoch new reformers needed doubtless it were finer could we go along always in the way of music be tamed and taught by our poets as the rude creatures were by their orpheus of old or failing this rhythmic musical way how good were it could we get so much as into the equable way i mean if peaceable priests reforming from day to day would always suffice us but it is not so even this latter has not yet been realised alas the battling reformer too is from time to time a needful and inevitable phenomenon obstructions are never wanting the very things that were once indispensable furtherances become obstructions and need to be shaken off and left behind us a business often of enormous difficulty it is notable enough surely how a theorem or spiritual representation so we may call it which once took in the whole universe and was completely satisfactory in all parts of it to the highlydiscursive acute intellect of dante one of the greatest in the world had in the course of another century become dubitable to common intellects become deniable and is now to every one of us flatly incredible obsolete as odins theorem to dante human existence and gods ways with men were all well represented by those malebolges purgatorios to luther not well how was this why could not dantes catholicism continue but luthers protestantism must needs follow alas nothing will continue i do not make much of progress of the species as handled in these times of ours nor do i think you would care to hear much about it the talk on that subject is too often of the most extravagant confused sort yet i may say the fact itself seems certain enough nay we can trace out the inevitable necessity of it in the nature of things every man as i have stated somewhere is not only a learner but a doer he learns with the mind given him what has been but with the same mind he discovers farther he invents and devises somewhat of his own absolutely without originality there is no man no man whatever believes or can believe exactly what his grandfather believed he enlarges somewhat by fresh discovery his view of the universe and consequently his theorem of the universe which is an infinite universe and can never be embraced wholly or finally by any view or theorem in any conceivable enlargement he enlarges somewhat i say finds somewhat that was credible to his grandfather incredible to him false to him inconsistent with some new thing he has discovered or observed it is the history of every man and in the history of mankind we see it summedup into great historical amounts revolutions new epochs dantes mountain of purgatory does not stand in the ocean of the other hemisphere when columbus has once sailed thither men find no such thing extant in the other hemisphere it is not there it must cease to be believed to be there so with all beliefs whatsoever in this world all systems of belief and systems of practice that spring from these if we add now the melancholy fact that when belief waxes uncertain practice too becomes unsound and errors injustices and miseries everywhere more and more prevail we shall see material enough for revolution at all turns a man who will do faithfully needs to believe firmly if he have to ask at every turn the worlds suffrage if he cannot dispense with the worlds suffrage and make his own suffrage serve he is a poor eyeservant the work committed to him will be misdone every such man is a daily contributor to the inevitable downfall whatsoever work he does dishonestly with an eye to the outward look of it is a new offence parent of new misery to somebody or other offences accumulate till they become insupportable and are then violently burst through cleared off as by explosion dantes sublime catholicism incredible now in theory and defaced still worse by faithless doubting and dishonest practice has to be torn asunder by a luther shakspeares noble feudalism as beautiful as it once looked and was has to end in a french revolution the accumulation of offences is as we say too literally exploded blasted asunder volcanically and there are long troublous periods before matters come to a settlement again surely it were mournful enough to look only at this face of the matter and find in all human opinions and arrangements merely the fact that they were uncertain temporary subject to the law of death at bottom it is not so all death here too we find is but of the body not of the essence or soul all destruction by violent revolution or howsoever it be is but new creation on a wider scale odinism was valour christianism was humility a nobler kind of valour no thought that ever dwelt honestly as true in the heart of man but was an honest insight into gods truth on mans part and has an essential truth in it which endures through all changes an everlasting possession for us all and on the other hand what a melancholy notion is that which has to represent all men in all countries and times except our own as having spent their life in blind condemnable error mere lost pagans scandinavians mahometans only that we might have the true ultimate knowledge all generations of men were lost and wrong only that this present little section of a generation might be saved and right they all marched forward there all generations since the beginning of the world like the russian soldiers into the ditch of schweidnitz fort only to fillup the ditch with their dead bodies that we might marchover and take the place it is an incredible hypothesis such incredible hypothesis we have seen maintained with fierce emphasis and this or the other poor individual man with his sect of individual men marching as over the dead bodies of all men towards sure victory but when he too with his hypothesis and ultimate infallible credo sank into the ditch and became a dead body what was to be said withal it is an important fact in the nature of man that he tends to reckon his own insight as final and goes upon it as such he will always do it i suppose in one or the other way but it must be in some wider wiser way than this are not all true men that live or that ever lived soldiers of the same army enlisted under heavens captaincy to do battle against the same enemy the empire of darkness and wrong why should we misknow one another fight not against the enemy but against ourselves from mere difference of uniform all uniforms shall be good so they hold in them true valiant men all fashions of arms the arab turban and swift scimetar thors strong hammer smiting down jtuns shall be welcome luthers battlevoice dantes marchmelody all genuine things are with us not against us we are all under one captain soldiers of the same host let us now look a little at this luthers fighting what kind of battle it was and how he comported himself in it luther too was of our spiritual heroes a prophet to his country and time as introductory to the whole a remark about idolatry will perhaps be in place here one of mahomets characteristics which indeed belongs to all prophets is unlimited implacable zeal against idolatry it is the grand theme of prophets idolatry the worshipping of dead idols as the divinity is a thing they cannot awaywith but have to denounce continually and brand with inexpiable reprobation it is the chief of all the sins they see done under the sun this is worth noting we will not enter here into the theological question about idolatry idol is eidolon a thing seen a symbol it is not god but a symbol of god and perhaps one may question whether any the most benighted mortal ever took it for more than a symbol i fancy he did not think that the poor image his own hands had made was god but that god was emblemed by it that god was in it some way or another and now in this sense one may ask is not all worship whatsoever a worship by symbols by eidola or things seen whether seen rendered visible as an image or picture to the bodily eye or visible only to the inward eye to the imagination to the intellect this makes a superficial but no substantial difference it is still a thing seen significant of godhead an idol the most rigorous puritan has his confession of faith and intellectual representation of divine things and worships thereby thereby is worship first made possible for him all creeds liturgies religious forms conceptions that fitly invest religious feelings are in this sense eidola things seen all worship whatsoever must proceed by symbols by idols we may say all idolatry is comparative and the worst idolatry is only more idolatrous where then lies the evil of it some fatal evil must lie in it or earnest prophetic men would not on all hands so reprobate it why is idolatry so hateful to prophets it seems to me as if in the worship of those poor wooden symbols the thing that had chiefly provoked the prophet and filled his inmost soul with indignation and aversion was not exactly what suggested itself to his own thought and came out of him in words to others as the thing the rudest heathen that worshipped canopus or the caabah blackstone he as we saw was superior to the horse that worshipped nothing at all nay there was a kind of lasting merit in that poor act of his analogous to what is still meritorious in poets recognition of a certain endless divine beauty and significance in stars and all natural objects whatsoever why should the prophet so mercilessly condemn him the poorest mortal worshipping his fetish while his heart is full of it may be an object of pity of contempt and avoidance if you will but cannot surely be an object of hatred let his heart be honestly full of it the whole space of his dark narrow mind illuminated thereby in one word let him entirely believe in his fetish it will then be i should say if not well with him yet as well as it can readily be made to be and you will leave him alone unmolested there but here enters the fatal circumstance of idolatry that in the era of the prophets no mans mind is any longer honestly filled with his idol or symbol before the prophet can arise who seeing through it knows it to be mere wood many men must have begun dimly to doubt that it was little more condemnable idolatry is insincere idolatry doubt has eatenout the heart of it a human soul is seen clinging spasmodically to an ark of the covenant which it halffeels now to have become a phantasm this is one of the balefulest sights souls are no longer filled with their fetish but only pretend to be filled and would fain make themselves feel that they are filled you do not believe said coleridge you only believe that you believe it is the final scene in all kinds of worship and symbolism the sure symptom that death is now nigh it is equivalent to what we call formulism and worship of formulas in these days of ours no more immoral act can be done by a human creature for it is the beginning of all immorality or rather it is the impossibility henceforth of any morality whatsoever the innermost moral soul is paralysed thereby cast into fatal magnetic sleep men are no longer sincere men i do not wonder that the earnest man denounces this brands it prosecutes it with unextinguishable aversion he and it all good and it are at deathfeud blamable idolatry is cant and even what one may call sincerecant sincerecant that is worth thinking of every sort of worship ends with this phasis i find luther to have been a breaker of idols no less than any other prophet the wooden gods of the koreish made of timber and beeswax were not more hateful to mahomet than tetzels pardons of sin made of sheepskin and ink were to luther it is the property of every hero in every time in every place and situation that he come back to reality that he stand upon things and not shows of things according as he loves and venerates articulately or with deep speechless thought the awful realities of things so will the hollow shows of things however regular decorous accredited by koreishes or conclaves be intolerable and detestable to him protestantism too is the work of a prophet the prophetwork of that sixteenth century the first stroke of honest demolition to an ancient thing grown false and idolatrous preparatory afar off to a new thing which shall be true and authentically divine at first view it might seem as if protestantism were entirely destructive to this that we call heroworship and represent as the basis of all possible good religious or social for mankind one often hears it said that protestantism introduced a new era radically different from any the world had ever seen before the era of private judgment as they call it by this revolt against the pope every man became his own pope and learnt among other things that he must never trust any pope or spiritual herocaptain any more whereby is not spiritual union all hierarchy and subordination among men henceforth an impossibility so we hear it said now i need not deny that protestantism was a revolt against spiritual sovereignties popes and much else nay i will grant that english puritanism revolt against earthly sovereignties was the second act of it that the enormous french revolution itself was the third act whereby all sovereignties earthly and spiritual were as might seem abolished or made sure of abolition protestantism is the grand root from which our whole subsequent european history branches out for the spiritual will always body itself forth in the temporal history of men the spiritual is the beginning of the temporal and now sure enough the cry is everywhere for liberty and equality independence and so forth instead of kings ballotboxes and electoral suffrages it seems made out that any herosovereign or loyal obedience of men to a man in things temporal or things spiritual has passed away forever from the world i should despair of the world altogether if so one of my deepest convictions is that it is not so without sovereigns true sovereigns temporal and spiritual i see nothing possible but an anarchy the hatefulest of things but i find protestantism whatever anarchic democracy it have produced to be the beginning of new genuine sovereignty and order i find it to be a revolt against false sovereigns the painful but indispensable first preparative for true sovereigns getting place among us this is worth explaining a little let us remark therefore in the first place that this of private judgment is at bottom not a new thing in the world but only new at that epoch of the world there is nothing generically new or peculiar in the reformation it was a return to truth and reality in opposition to falsehood and semblance as all kinds of improvement and genuine teaching are and have been liberty of private judgment if we will consider it must at all times have existed in the world dante had not putout his eyes or tied shackles on himself he was at home in that catholicism of his a freeseeing soul in it if many a poor hogstraten tetzel and dr eck had now become slaves in it liberty of judgment no iron chain or outward force of any kind could ever compel the soul of a man to believe or to disbelieve it is his own indefeasible light that judgment of his he will reign and believe there by the grace of god alone the sorriest sophistical bellarmine preaching sightless faith and passive obedience must first by some kind of conviction have abdicated his right to be convinced his private judgment indicated that as the advisablest step he could take the right of private judgment will subsist in full force wherever true men subsist a true man believes with his whole judgment with all the illumination and discernment that is in him and has always so believed a false man only struggling to believe that he believes will naturally manage it in some other way protestantism said to this latter woe and to the former well done at bottom it was no new saying it was a return to all old sayings that ever had been said be genuine be sincere that was once more the meaning of it mahomet believed with his whole mind odin with his whole mind he and all true followers of odinism they by their private judgment had judged so and now i venture to assert that the exercise of private judgment faithfully gone about does by no means necessarily end in selfish independence isolation but rather ends necessarily in the opposite of that it is not honest inquiry that makes anarchy but it is error insincerity halfbelief and untruth that make it a man protesting against error is on the way towards uniting himself with all men that believe in truth there is no communion possible among men who believe only in hearsays the heart of each is lying dead has no power of sympathy even with things or he would believe them and not hearsays no sympathy even with things how much less with his fellowmen he cannot unite with men he is an anarchic man only in a world of sincere men is unity possible and there in the longrun it is as good as certain for observe one thing a thing too often left out of view or rather altogether lost sight of in this controversy that it is not necessary a man should himself have discovered the truth he is to believe in and never so sincerely to believe in a great man we said was always sincere as the first condition of him but a man need not be great in order to be sincere that is not the necessity of nature and all time but only of certain corrupt unfortunate epochs of time a man can believe and make his own in the most genuine way what he has received from another and with boundless gratitude to that other the merit of originality is not novelty it is sincerity the believing man is the original man whatsoever he believes he believes it for himself not for another every son of adam can become a sincere man an original man in this sense no mortal is doomed to be an insincere man whole ages what we call ages of faith are original all men in them or the most of men in them sincere these are the great and fruitful ages every worker in all spheres is a worker not on semblance but on substance every work issues in a result the general sum of such work is great for all of it as genuine tends towards one goal all of it is additive none of it subtractive there is true union true kingship loyalty all true and blessed things so far as the poor earth can produce blessedness for men heroworship ah me that a man be selfsubsistent original true or what we call it is surely the farthest in the world from indisposing him to reverence and believe other mens truth it only disposes necessitates and invincibly compels him to disbelieve other mens dead formulas hearsays and untruths a man embraces truth with his eyes open and because his eyes are open does he need to shut them before he can love his teacher of truth he alone can love with a right gratitude and genuine loyalty of soul the heroteacher who has delivered him out of darkness into light is not such a one a true hero and serpentqueller worthy of all reverence the black monster falsehood our one enemy in this world lies prostrate by his valour it was he that conquered the world for us see accordingly was not luther himself reverenced as a true pope or spiritual father being verily such napoleon from amid boundless revolt of sansculottism became a king heroworship never dies nor can die loyalty and sovereignty are everlasting in the world and there is this in them that they are grounded not on garnitures and semblances but on realities and sincerities not by shutting your eyes your private judgment no but by opening them and by having something to see luthers message was deposition and abolition to all false popes and potentates but life and strength though afar off to new genuine ones all this of liberty and equality electoral suffrages independence and so forth we will take therefore to be a temporary phenomenon by no means a final one though likely to last a long time with sad enough embroilments for us all we must welcome it as the penalty of sins that are past the pledge of inestimable benefits that are coming in all ways it behoved men to quit simulacra and return to fact cost what it might that did behove to be done with spurious popes and believers having no private judgment quacks pretending to command over dupes what can you do misery and mischief only you cannot make an association out of insincere men you cannot build an edifice except by plummet and level at rightangles to one another in all this wild revolutionary work from protestantism downwards i see the blessedest result preparing itself not abolition of heroworship but rather what i would call a whole world of heroes if hero mean sincere man why may not every one of us be a hero a world all sincere a believing world the like has been the like will again be cannot help being that were the right sort of worshippers for heroes never could the truly better be so reverenced as where all were true and good but we must hasten to luther and his life luthers birthplace was eisleben in saxony he came into the world there on the th of november it was an accident that gave this honour to eisleben his parents poor minelabourers in a village of that region named mohra had gone to the eisleben winterfair in the tumult of this scene the frau luther was taken with travail found refuge in some poor house there and the boy she bore was named martin luther strange enough to reflect upon it this poor frau luther she had gone with her husband to make her small merchandisings perhaps to sell the lock of yarn she had been spinning to buy the small winternecessaries for her narrow hut or household in the whole world that day there was not a more entirely unimportantlooking pair of people than this miner and his wife and yet what were all emperors popes and potentates in comparison there was born here once more a mighty man whose light was to flame as the beacon over long centuries and epochs of the world the whole world and its history was waiting for this man it is strange it is great it leads us back to another birthhour in a still meaner environment eighteen hundred years ago of which it is fit that we say nothing that we think only in silence for what words are there the age of miracles past the age of miracles is forever here i find it altogether suitable to luthers function in this earth and doubtless wisely ordered to that end by the providence presiding over him and us and all things that he was born poor and broughtup poor one of the poorest of men he had to beg as the schoolchildren in those times did singing for alms and bread from door to door hardship rigorous necessity was the poor boys companion no man nor no thing would puton a false face to flatter martin luther among things not among the shows of things had he to grow a boy of rude figure yet with weak health with his large greedy soul full of all faculty and sensibility he suffered greatly but it was his task to get acquainted with realities and keep acquainted with them at whatever cost his task was to bring the whole world back to reality for it had dwelt too long with semblance a youth nursedup in wintry whirlwinds in desolate darkness and difficulty that he may stepforth at last from his stormy scandinavia strong as a true man as a god a christian odin a right thor once more with his thunderhammer to smite asunder ugly enough jtuns and giantmonsters perhaps the turning incident of his life we may fancy was that death of his friend alexis by lightning at the gate of erfurt luther had struggledup through boyhood better and worse displaying in spite of all hindrances the largest intellect eager to learn his father judging doubtless that he might promote himself in the world set him upon the study of law this was the path to rise luther with little will in it either way had consented he was now nineteen years of age alexis and he had been to see the old luther people at mansfeldt were got back again near erfurt when a thunderstorm came on the bolt struck alexis he fell dead at luthers feet what is this life of ours gone in a moment burntup like a scroll into the blank eternity what are all earthly preferments chancellorships kingships they lie shrunk together there the earth has opened on them in a moment they are not and eternity is luther struck to the heart determined to devote himself to god and gods service alone in spite of all dissuasions from his father and others he became a monk in the augustine convent at erfurt this was probably the first lightpoint in the history of luther his purer will now first decisively uttering itself but for the present it was still as one lightpoint in an element all of darkness he says he was a pious monk ich bin ein frommer mnch gewesen faithfully painfully struggling to workout the truth of this high act of his but it was to little purpose his misery had not lessened had rather as it were increased into infinitude the drudgeries he had to do as novice in his convent all sorts of slavework were not his grievance the deep earnest soul of the man had fallen into all manner of black scruples dubitations he believed himself likely to die soon and far worse than die one hears with a new interest for poor luther that at this time he lived in terror of the unspeakable misery fancied that he was doomed to eternal reprobation was it not the humble sincere nature of the man what was he that he should be raised to heaven he that had known only misery and mean slavery the news was too blessed to be credible it could not become clear to him how by fasts vigils formalities and masswork a mans soul could be saved he fell into the blackest wretchedness had to wander staggering as on the verge of bottomless despair it must have been a most blessed discovery that of an old latin bible which he found in the erfurt library about this time he had never seen the book before it taught him another lesson than that of fasts and vigils a brother monk too of pious experience was helpful luther learned now that a man was saved not by singing masses but by the infinite grace of god a more credible hypothesis he gradually got himself founded as on the rock no wonder he should venerate the bible which had brought this blessed help to him he prized it as the word of the highest must be prized by such a man he determined to hold by that as through life and to death he firmly did this then is his deliverance from darkness his final triumph over darkness what we call his conversion for himself the most important of all epochs that he should now grow daily in peace and clearness that unfolding now the great talents and virtues implanted in him he should rise to importance in his convent in his country and be found more and more useful in all honest business of life is a natural result he was sent on missions by his augustine order as a man of talent and fidelity fit to do their business well the elector of saxony friedrich named the wise a truly wise and just prince had cast his eye on him as a valuable person made him professor in his new university of wittenberg preacher too at wittenberg in both which capacities as in all duties he did this luther in the peaceable sphere of common life was gaining more and more esteem with all good men it was in his twentyseventh year that he first saw rome being sent thither as i said on mission from his convent pope julius the second and what was goingon at rome must have filled the mind of luther with amazement he had come as to the sacred city throne of gods highpriest on earth and he found it what we know many thoughts it must have given the man many which we have no record of which perhaps he did not himself know how to utter this rome this scene of false priests clothed not in the beauty of holiness but in far other vesture is false but what is it to luther a mean man he how shall he reform a world that was far from his thoughts a humble solitary man why should he at all meddle with the world it was the task of quite higher men than he his business was to guide his own footsteps wisely through the world let him do his own obscure duty in it well the rest horrible and dismal as it looks is in gods hand not in his it is curious to reflect what might have been the issue had roman popery happened to pass this luther by to go on in its great wasteful orbit and not come athwart his little path and force him to assault it conceivable enough that in this case he might have held his peace about the abuses of rome left providence and god on high to deal with them a modest quiet man not prompt he to attack irreverently persons in authority his clear task as i say was to do his own duty to walk wisely in this world of confused wickedness and save his own soul alive but the roman highpriesthood did come athwart him afar off at wittenberg he luther could not get lived in honesty for it he remonstrated resisted came to extremity was struckat struck again and so it came to wager of battle between them this is worth attending to in luthers history perhaps no man of so humble peaceable a disposition ever filled the world with contention we cannot but see that he would have loved privacy quiet diligence in the shade that it was against his will he ever became a notoriety notoriety what would that do for him the goal of his march through this world was the infinite heaven an indubitable goal for him in a few years he should either have attained that or lost it forever we will say nothing at all i think of that sorrowfulest of theories of its being some mean shopkeeper grudge of the augustine monk against the dominican that first kindled the wrath of luther and produced the protestant reformation we will say to the people who maintain it if indeed any such exist now get first into the sphere of thought by which it is so much as possible to judge of luther or of any man like luther otherwise than distractedly we may then begin arguing with you the monk tetzel sent out carelessly in the way of trade by leo tenth who merely wanted to raise a little money and for the rest seems to have been a pagan rather than a christian so far as he was anything arrived at wittenberg and drove his scandalous trade there luthers flock bought indulgences in the confessional of his church people pleaded to him that they had already got their sins pardoned luther if he would not be found wanting at his own post a false sluggard and coward at the very centre of the little space of ground that was his own and no other mans had to stepforth against indulgences and declare aloud that they were a futility and sorrowful mockery that no mans sins could be pardoned by them it was the beginning of the whole reformation we know how it went forward from this first public challenge of tetzel on the last day of october through remonstrance and argument spreading ever wider rising ever higher till it became unquenchable and enveloped all the world luthers heartsdesire was to have this grief and other griefs amended his thought was still far other than that of introducing separation in the church or revolting against the pope father of christendom the elegant pagan pope cared little about this monk and his doctrines wished however to have done with the noise of him in a space of some three years having tried various softer methods he thought good to end it by fire he dooms the monks writings to be burnt by the hangman and his body to be sent bound to rome probably for a similar purpose it was the way they had ended with huss with jerome the century before a short argument fire poor huss he came to that constance council with all imaginable promises and safeconducts an earnest not rebellious kind of man they laid him instantly in a stone dungeon threefeet wide sixfeet high sevenfeet long burnt the true voice of him out of this world choked it in smoke and fire that was not well done i for one pardon luther for now altogether revolting against the pope the elegant pagan by this firedecree of his had kindled into noble just wrath the bravest heart then living in this world the bravest if also one of the humblest peaceablest it was now kindled these words of mine words of truth and soberness aiming faithfully as human inability would allow to promote gods truth on earth and save mens souls you gods vicegerent on earth answer them by the hangman and fire you will burn me and them for answer to the godsmessage they strove to bring you you are not gods vicegerent you are anothers than his i think i take your bull as an emparchmented lie and burn it you will do what you see good next this is what i do it was on the th of december three years after the beginning of the business that luther with a great concourse of people took this indignant step of burning the popes firedecree at the elstergate of wittenberg wittenberg looked on with shoutings the whole world was looking on the pope should not have provoked that shout it was the shout of the awakening of nations the quiet german heart modest patient of much had at length got more than it could bear formulism pagan popeism and other falsehood and corrupt semblance had ruled long enough and here once more was a man found who durst tell all men that gods world stood not on semblances but on realities that life was a truth and not a lie at bottom as was said above we are to consider luther as a prophet idolbreaker a bringerback of men to reality it is the function of great men and teachers mahomet said these idols of yours are wood you put wax and oil on them the flies stick on them they are not god i tell you they are black wood luther said to the pope this thing of yours that you call a pardon of sins it is a bit of ragpaper with ink it is nothing else it and so much like it is nothing else god alone can pardon sins popeship spiritual fatherhood of gods church is that a vain semblance of cloth and parchment it is an awful fact gods church is not a semblance heaven and hell are not semblances i stand on this since you drive me to it standing on this i a poor german monk am stronger than you all i stand solitary friendless but on gods truth you with your tiaras triplehats with your treasuries and armories thunders spiritual and temporal stand on the devils lie and are not so strong the diet of worms luthers appearance there on the th of april may be considered as the greatest scene in modern european history the point indeed from which the whole subsequent history of civilisation takes its rise after multiplied negotiations disputations it had come to this the young emperor charles fifth with all the princes of germany papal nuncios dignitaries spiritual and temporal are assembled there luther is to appear and answer for himself whether he will recant or not the worlds pomp and power sits there on this hand on that standsup for gods truth one man the poor miner hans luthers son friends had reminded him of huss advised him not to go he would not be advised a large company of friends rodeout to meet him with still more earnest warnings he answered were there as many devils in worms as there are rooftiles i would on the people on the morrow as he went to the hall of the diet crowded the windows and housetops some of them calling out to him in solemn words not to recant whosoever denieth me before men they cried to him as in a kind of solemn petition and adjuration was it not in reality our petition too the petition of the whole world lying in dark bondage of soul paralysed under a black spectral nightmare and triplehatted chimera calling itself father in god and what not free us it rests with thee desert us not luther did not desert us his speech of two hours distinguished itself by its respectful wise and honest tone submissive to whatsoever could lawfully claim submission not submissive to any more than that his writings he said were partly his own partly derived from the word of god as to what was his own human infirmity entered into it unguarded anger blindness many things doubtless which it were a blessing for him could he abolish altogether but as to what stood on sound truth and the word of god he could not recant it how could he confute me he concluded by proofs of scripture or else by plain just arguments i cannot recant otherwise for it is neither safe nor prudent to do ought against conscience here stand i i can do no other god assist me it is as we say the greatest moment in the modern history of men english puritanism england and its parliaments americas and vast work these two centuries french revolution europe and its work everywhere at present the germ of it all lay there had luther in that moment done other it had all been otherwise the european world was asking him am i to sink ever lower into falsehood stagnant putrescence loathsome accursed death or with whatever paroxysm to cast the falsehoods out of me and be cured and live great wars contentions and disunion followed out of this reformation which last down to our day and are yet far from ended great talk and crimination has been made about these they are lamentable undeniable but after all what has luther or his cause to do with them it seems strange reasoning to charge the reformation with all this when hercules turned the purifying river into king augeass stables i have no doubt the confusion that resulted was considerable all around but i think it was not herculess blame it was some others blame the reformation might bring what results it liked when it came but the reformation simply could not help coming to all popes and popes advocates expostulating lamenting and accusing the answer of the world is once for all your popehood has become untrue no matter how good it was how good you say it is we cannot believe it the light of our whole mind given us to walkby from heaven above finds it henceforth a thing unbelievable we will not believe it we will not try to believe it we dare not the thing is untrue we were traitors against the giver of all truth if we durst pretend to think it true away with it let whatsoever likes come in the place of it with it we can have no farther trade luther and his protestantism is not responsible for wars the false simulacra that forced him to protest they are responsible luther did what every man that god has made has not only the right but lies under the sacred duty to do answered a falsehood when it questioned him dost thou believe me no at what cost soever without counting of costs this thing behoved to be done union organisation spiritual and material a far nobler than any popedom or feudalism in their truest days i never doubt is coming for the world sure to come but on fact alone not on semblance and simulacrum will it be able either to come or to stand when come with union grounded on falsehood and ordering us to speak and act lies we will not have anything to do peace a brutal lethargy is peaceable the noisome grave is peaceable we hope for a living peace not a dead one and yet in prizing justly the indispensable blessings of the new let us not be unjust to the old the old was true if it no longer is in dantes days it needed no sophistry selfblinding or other dishonesty to get itself reckoned true it was good then nay there is in the soul of it a deathless good the cry of no popery is foolish enough in these days the speculation that popery is on the increase building new chapels and so forth may pass for one of the idlest ever started very curious to countup a few popish chapels listen to a few protestant logicchoppings to much dulldroning drowsy inanity that still calls itself protestant and say see protestantism is dead popeism is more alive than it will be alive after it drowsy inanities not a few that call themselves protestant are dead but protestantism has not died yet that i hear of protestantism if we will look has in these days produced its goethe its napoleon german literature and the french revolution rather considerable signs of life nay at bottom what else is alive but protestantism the life of most else that one meets is a galvanic one merely not a pleasant not a lasting sort of life popery can build new chapels welcome to do so to all lengths popery cannot come back any more than paganism can which also still lingers in some countries but indeed it is with these things as with the ebbing of the sea you look at the waves oscillating hither thither on the beach for minutes you cannot tell how it is going look in half an hour where it is look in half a century where your popehood is alas would there were no greater danger to our europe than the poor old popes revival thor may as soon try to revive and withal this oscillation has a meaning the poor old popehood will not die away entirely as thor has done for some time yet nor ought it we may say the old never dies till this happen till all the soul of good that was in it have got itself transfused into the practical new while a good work remains capable of being done by the romish form or what is inclusive of all while a pious life remains capable of being led by it just so long if we consider will this or the other human soul adopt it go about as a living witness of it so long it will obtrude itself on the eye of us who reject it till we in our practice too have appropriated whatsoever of truth was in it then but also not till then it will have no charm more for any man it lasts here for a purpose let it last as long as it can of luther i will add now in reference to all these wars and bloodshed the noticeable fact that none of them began so long as he continued living the controversy did not get to fighting so long as he was there to me it is proof of his greatness in all senses this fact how seldom do we find a man that has stirredup some vast commotion who does not himself perish sweptaway in it such is the usual course of revolutionists luther continued in a good degree sovereign of this greatest revolution all protestants of what rank or function soever looking much to him for guidance and he held it peaceable continued firm at the centre of it a man to do this must have a kingly faculty he must have the gift to discern at all turns where the true heart of the matter lies and to plant himself courageously on that as a strong true man that other true men may rally round him there he will not continue leader of men otherwise luthers clear deep force of judgment his force of all sorts of silence of tolerance and moderation among others are very notable in these circumstances tolerance i say a very genuine kind of tolerance he distinguishes what is essential and what is not the unessential may go very much as it will a complaint comes to him that such and such a reformed preacher will not preach without a cassock well answers luther what harm will a cassock do the man let him have a cassock to preach in let him have three cassocks if he find benefit in them his conduct in the matter of karlstadts wild imagebreaking of the anabaptists of the peasants war shows a noble strength very different from spasmodic violence with sure prompt insight he discriminates what is what a strong just man he speaksforth what is the wise course and all men follow him in that luthers written works give similar testimony of him the dialect of these speculations is now grown obsolete for us but one still reads them with a singular attraction and indeed the mere grammatical diction is still legible enough luthers merit in literary history is of the greatest his dialect became the language of all writing they are not well written these fourandtwenty quartos of his written hastily with quite other than literary objects but in no books have i found a more robust genuine i will say noble faculty of a man than in these a rugged honesty homeliness simplicity a rugged sterling sense and strength he flashesout illumination from him his smiting idiomatic phrases seem to cleave into the very secret of the matter good humour too nay tender affection nobleness and depth this man could have been a poet too he had to work an epic poem not write one i call him a great thinker as indeed his greatness of heart already betokens that richter says of luthers words his words are halfbattles they may be called so the essential quality of him was that he could fight and conquer that he was a right piece of human valour no more valiant man no mortal heart to be called braver that one has record of ever lived in that teutonic kindred whose character is valour his defiance of the devils in worms was not a mere boast as the like might be if now spoken it was a faith of luthers that there were devils spiritual denizens of the pit continually besetting men many times in his writings this turnsup and a most small sneer has been grounded on it by some in the room of the wartburg where he sat translating the bible they still show you a black spot on the wall the strange memorial of one of these conflicts luther sat translating one of the psalms he was worndown with long labour with sickness abstinence from food there rose before him some hideous indefinable image which he took for the evil one to forbid his work luther startedup with fienddefiance flung his inkstand at the spectre and it disappeared the spot still remains there a curious monument of several things any apothecarys apprentice can now tell us what we are to think of this apparition in a scientific sense but the mans heart that dare rise defiant face to face against hell itself can give no higher proof of fearlessness the thing he will quail before exists not on this earth or under it fearless enough the devil is aware writes he on one occasion that this does not proceed out of fear in me i have seen and defied innumerable devils duke george of leipzig a great enemy of his duke george is not equal to one devil far short of a devil if i had business at leipzig i would ride into leipzig though it rained dukegeorges for nine days running what a reservoir of dukes to ride into at the same time they err greatly who imagine that this mans courage was ferocity mere coarse disobedient obstinacy and savagery as many do far from that there may be an absence of fear which arises from the absence of thought or affection from the presence of hatred and stupid fury we do not value the courage of the tiger highly with luther it was far otherwise no accusation could be more unjust than this of mere ferocious violence brought against him a most gentle heart withal full of pity and love as indeed the truly valiant heart ever is the tiger before a stronger foe flies the tiger is not what we call valiant only fierce and cruel i know few things more touching than those soft breathings of affection soft as a childs or a mothers in this great wild heart of luther so honest unadulterated with any cant homely rude in their utterance pure as water welling from the rock what in fact was all that downpressed mood of despair and reprobation which we saw in his youth but the outcome of preeminent thoughtful gentleness affections too keen and fine it is the course such men as the poor poet cowper fall into luther to a slight observer might have seemed a timid weak man modesty affectionate shrinking tenderness the chief distinction of him it is a noble valour which is roused in a heart like this once stirredup into defiance all kindled into a heavenly blaze in luthers tabletalk a posthumous book of anecdotes and sayings collected by his friends the most interesting now of all the books proceeding from him we have many beautiful unconscious displays of the man and what sort of nature he had his behaviour at the deathbed of his little daughter so still so great and loving is among the most affecting things he is resigned that his little magdalene should die yet longs inexpressibly that she might live follows in awestruck thought the flight of her little soul through those unknown realms awestruck most heartfelt we can see and sincere for after all dogmatic creeds and articles he feels what nothing it is that we know or can know his little magdalene shall be with god as god wills for luther too that is all islam is all once he looksout from his solitary patmos the castle of coburg in the middle of the night the great vault of immensity long flights of clouds sailing through it dumb gaunt huge who supports all that none ever saw the pillars of it yet it is supported god supports it we must know that god is great that god is good and trust where we cannot see returning home from leipzig once he is struck by the beauty of the harvestfields how it stands that golden yellow corn on its fair taper stem its golden head bent all rich and waving there the meek earth at gods kind bidding has produced it once again the bread of man in the garden at wittenburg one evening at sunset a little bird was perched for the night that little bird says luther above it are the stars and deep heaven of worlds yet it has folded its little wings gone trustfully to rest there as in its home the maker of it has given it too a home neither are mirthful turns wanting there is a great free human heart in this man the common speech of him has a rugged nobleness idiomatic expressive genuine gleams here and there with beautiful poetic tints one feels him to be a great brother man his love of music indeed is not this as it were the summary of all these affections in him many a wild unutterability he spokeforth from him in the tones of his flute the devils fled from his flute he says deathdefiance on the one hand and such love of music on the other i could call these the two opposite poles of a great soul between these two all great things had room luthers face is to me expressive of him in kranachs best portraits i find the true luther a rude plebeian face with its huge craglike brows and bones the emblem of rugged energy at first almost a repulsive face yet in the eyes especially there is a wild silent sorrow an unnamable melancholy the element of all gentle and fine affections giving to the rest the true stamp of nobleness laughter was in this luther as we said but tears also were there tears also were appointed him tears and hard toil the basis of his life was sadness earnestness in his latter days after all triumphs and victories he expresses himself heartily weary of living he considers that god alone can and will regulate the course things are taking and that perhaps the day of judgment is not far as for him he longs for one thing that god would release him from his labour and let him depart and be at rest they understand little of the man who cite this in discredit of him i will call this luther a true great man great in intellect in courage affection and integrity one of our most lovable and precious men great not as a hewn obelisk but as an alpine mountain so simple honest spontaneous not settingup to be great at all there for quite another purpose than being great ah yes unsubduable granite piercing far and wide into the heavens yet in the clefts of it fountains green beautiful valleys with flowers a right spiritual hero and prophet once more a true son of nature and fact for whom these centuries and many that are to come yet will be thankful to heaven the most interesting phasis which the reformation anywhere assumes especially for us english is that of puritanism in luthers own country protestantism soon dwindled into a rather barren affair not a religion or faith but rather now a theological jangling of argument the proper seat of it not the heart the essence of it sceptical contention which indeed has jangled more and more down to voltaireism itself through gustavusadolphus contentions onward to frenchrevolution ones but in our island there arose a puritanism which even got itself established as a presbyterianism and national church among the scotch which came forth as a real business of the heart and has produced in the world very notable fruit in some senses one may say it is the only phasis of protestantism that ever got to the rank of being a faith a true heartcommunication with heaven and of exhibiting itself in history as such we must spare a few words for knox himself a brave and remarkable man but still more important as chief priest and founder which one may consider him to be of the faith that became scotlands new englands oliver cromwells history will have something to say about this for some time to come we may censure puritanism as we please and no one of us i suppose but would find it a very rough defective thing but we and all men may understand that it was a genuine thing for nature has adopted it and it has grown and grows i say sometimes that all goes by wagerofbattle in this world that strength well understood is the measure of all worth give a thing time if it can succeed it is a right thing look now at american saxondom and at that little fact of the sailing of the mayflower two hundred years ago from delft haven in holland were we of open sense as the greeks were we had found a poem here one of natures own poems such as she writes in broad facts over great continents for it was properly the beginning of america there were straggling settlers in america before some material as of a body was there but the soul of it was first this these poor men drivenout of their country not able well to live in holland determine on settling in the new world black untamed forests are there and wild savage creatures but not so cruel as starchamber hangmen they thought the earth would yield them food if they tilled honestly the everlasting heaven would stretch there too overhead they should be left in peace to prepare for eternity by living well in this world of time worshipping in what they thought the true not the idolatrous way they clubbed their small means together hired a ship the little ship mayflower and made ready to set sail in neals history of the puritans is an account of the ceremony of their departure solemnity we might call it rather for it was a real act of worship their minister went down with them to the beach and their brethren whom they were to leave behind all joined in solemn prayer that god would have pity on his poor children and go with them into that waste wilderness for he also had made that he was there also as well as here hah these men i think had a work the weak thing weaker than a child becomes strong one day if it be a true thing puritanism was only despicable laughable then but nobody can manage to laugh at it now puritanism has got weapons and sinews it has firearms warnavies it has cunning in its ten fingers strength in its right arm it can steer ships fell forests remove mountains it is one of the strongest things under the sun at present neal london i in the history of scotland too i can find properly but one epoch we may say it contains nothing of worldinterest at all but this reformation by knox a poor barren country full of continual broils dissensions massacrings a people in the last state of rudeness and destitution little better perhaps than ireland at this day hungry fierce barons not so much as able to form any arrangement with each other how to divide what they fleeced from these poor drudges but obliged as the columbian republics are at this day to make of every alteration a revolution no way of changing a ministry but by hanging the old ministers on gibbets this is a historical spectacle of no very singular significance bravery enough i doubt not fierce fighting in abundance but not braver or fiercer than that of their old scandinavian seaking ancestors whose exploits we have not found worth dwelling on it is a country as yet without a soul nothing developed in it but what is rude external semianimal and now at the reformation the internal life is kindled as it were under the ribs of this outward material death a cause the noblest of causes kindles itself like a beacon set on high high as heaven yet attainable from earth whereby the meanest man becomes not a citizen only but a member of christs visible church a veritable hero if he prove a true man well this is what i mean by a whole nation of heroes a believing nation there needs not a great soul to make a hero there needs a godcreated soul which will be true to its origin that will be a great soul the like has been seen we find the like will be again seen under wider forms than the presbyterian there can be no lasting good done till then impossible say some possible has it not been in this world as a practised fact did heroworship fail in knoxs case or are we made of other clay now did the westminster confession of faith add some new property to the soul of man god made the soul of man he did not doom any soul of man to live as a hypothesis and hearsay in a world filled with such and with the fatal work and fruit of such but to return this that knox did for his nation i say we may really call a resurrection as from death it was not a smooth business but it was welcome surely and cheap at that price had it been far rougher on the whole cheap at any price as life is the people began to live they needed first of all to do that at what cost and costs soever scotch literature and thought scotch industry james watt david hume walter scott robert burns i find knox and the reformation acting in the hearts core of every one of these persons and phenomena i find that without the reformation they would not have been or what of scotland the puritanism of scotland became that of england of new england a tumult in the high church of edinburgh spread into a universal battle and struggle over all these realms there came out after fifty years struggling what we call the glorious revolution a habeascorpus act free parliaments and much else alas is it not too true what we said that many men in the van do always like russian soldiers march into the ditch of schweidnitz and fill it up with their dead bodies that the rear may pass over them dryshod and gain the honour how many earnest rugged cromwells knoxes poor peasant covenants wrestling battling for very life in rough miry places have to struggle and suffer and fall greatly censured bemired before a beautiful revolution of eightyeight can stepover them in official pumps and silkstockings with universal threetimesthree it seems to me hard measure that this scottish man now after threehundred years should have to plead like a culprit before the world intrinsically for having been in such way as it was then possible to be the bravest of all scotchmen had he been a poor halfandhalf he could have crouched into the corner like so many others scotland had not been delivered and knox had been without blame he is the one scotchman to whom of all others his country and the world owe a debt he has to plead that scotland would forgive him for having been worth to it any million unblamable scotchmen that need no forgiveness he bared his breast to the battle had to row in french galleys wander forlorn in exile in clouds and storms was censured shotat through his windows had a right sore fighting life if this world were his place of recompense he had made but a bad venture of it i cannot apologise for knox to him it is very indifferent these twohundredandfifty years or more what men say of him but we having got above all those details of his battle and living now in clearness on the fruits of his victory we for our own sake ought to look through the rumours and controversies enveloping the man into the man himself for one thing i will remark that this post of prophet to his nation was not of his seeking knox had lived forty years quietly obscure before he became conspicuous he was the son of poor parents had got a college education become a priest adopted the reformation and seemed well content to guide his own steps by the light of it nowise unduly intruding it on others he had lived as tutor in gentlemens families preaching when any body of persons wished to hear his doctrine resolute he to walk by the truth and speak the truth when called to do it not ambitious of more not fancying himself capable of more in this entirely obscure way he had reached the age of forty was with the small body of reformers who were standing siege in st andrews castle when one day in their chapel the preacher after finishing his exhortation to these fighters in the forlorn hope said suddenly that there ought to be other speakers that all men who had a priests heart and gift in them ought now to speak which gifts and heart one of their own number john knox the name of him had had he not said the preacher appealing to all the audience what then is his duty the people answered affirmatively it was a criminal forsaking of his post if such a man held the word that was in him silent poor knox was obliged to standup he attempted to reply he could say no word burst into a flood of tears and ran out it is worth remembering that scene he was in grievous trouble for some days he felt what a small faculty was his for this great work he felt what a baptism he was called to be baptised withal he burst into tears our primary characteristic of a hero that he is sincere applies emphatically to knox it is not denied anywhere that this whatever might be his other qualities or faults is among the truest of men with a singular instinct he holds to the truth and fact the truth alone is there for him the rest a mere shadow and deceptive nonentity however feeble forlorn the reality may seem on that and that only can he take his stand in the galleys of the river loire whither knox and the others after their castle of st andrews was taken had been sent as galleyslaves some officer or priest one day presented them an image of the virgin mother requiring that they the blasphemous heretics should do it reverence mother mother of god said knox when the turn came to him this is no mother of god this is a pented bredd a piece of wood i tell you with paint on it she is fitter for swimming i think than for being worshipped added knox and flung the thing into the river it was not very cheap jesting there but come of it what might this thing to knox was and must continue nothing other than the real truth it was a pented bredd worship it he would not he told his fellowprisoners in this darkest time to be of courage the cause they had was the true one and must and would prosper the whole world could not put it down reality is of gods making it is alone strong how many pented bredds pretending to be real are fitter to swim than to be worshipped this knox cannot live but by fact he clings to reality as the shipwrecked sailor to the cliff he is an instance to us how a man by sincerity itself becomes heroic it is the grand gift he has we find in knox a good honest intellectual talent no transcendent one a narrow inconsiderable man as compared with luther but in heartfelt instinctive adherence to truth in sincerity as we say he has no superior nay one might ask what equal he has the heart of him is of the true prophet cast he lies there said the earl of morton at his grave who never feared the face of man he resembles more than any of the moderns an oldhebrew prophet the same inflexibility intolerance rigid narrowlooking adherence to gods truth stern rebuke in the name of god to all that forsake truth an oldhebrew prophet in the guise of an edinburgh minister of the sixteenth century we are to take him for that not require him to be other knoxs conduct to queen mary the harsh visits he used to make in her own palace to reprove her there have been much commented upon such cruelty such coarseness fills us with indignation on reading the actual narrative of the business what knox said and what knox meant i must say ones tragic feeling is rather disappointed they are not so coarse these speeches they seem to me about as fine as the circumstances would permit knox was not there to do the courtier he came on another errand whoever reading these colloquies of his with the queen thinks they are vulgar insolences of a plebeian priest to a delicate high lady mistakes the purport and essence of them altogether it was unfortunately not possible to be polite with the queen of scotland unless one proved untrue to the nation and cause of scotland a man who did not wish to see the land of his birth made a huntingfield for intriguing ambitious guises and the cause of god trampled underfoot of falsehoods formulas and the devils cause had no method of making himself agreeable better that women weep said morton than that bearded men be forced to weep knox was the constitutional oppositionparty in scotland the nobles of the country called by their station to take that post were not found in it knox had to go or no one the hapless queen but the still more hapless country if she were made happy mary herself was not without sharpness enough among her other qualities who are you said she once that presume to school the nobles and sovereign of this realm madam a subject born within the same answered he reasonably answered if the subject have truth to speak it is not the subjects footing that will fail him here we blame knox for his intolerance well surely it is good that each of us be as tolerant as possible yet at bottom after all the talk there is and has been about it what is tolerance tolerance has to tolerate the unessential and to see well what that is tolerance has to be noble measured just in its very wrath when it can tolerate no longer but on the whole we are not altogether here to tolerate we are here to resist to control and vanquish withal we do not tolerate falsehoods thieveries iniquities when they fasten on us we say to them thou art false thou art not tolerable we are here to extinguish falsehoods and put an end to them in some wise way i will not quarrel so much with the way the doing of the thing is our great concern in this sense knox was full surely intolerant a man sent to row in french galleys and suchlike for teaching the truth in his own land cannot always be in the mildest humour i am not prepared to say that knox had a soft temper nor do i know that he had what we call an illtemper an ill nature he decidedly had not kind honest affections dwell in the muchenduring hardworn everbattling man that he could rebuke queens and had such weight among those proud turbulent nobles proud enough whatever else they were and could maintain to the end a kind of virtual presidency and sovereignty in that wild realm he who was only a subject born within the same this of itself will prove to us that he was found close at hand to be no mean acrid man but at heart a healthful strong sagacious man such alone can bear rule in that kind they blame him for pullingdown cathedrals and so forth as if he were a seditious rioting demagogue precisely the reverse is seen to be the fact in regard to cathedrals and the rest of it if we examine knox wanted no pullingdown of stone edifices he wanted leprosy and darkness to be thrown out of the lives of men tumult was not his element it was the tragic feature of his life that he was forced to dwell so much in that every such man is the born enemy of disorder hates to be in it but what then smooth falsehood is not order it is the general sumtotal of disorder order is truth each thing standing on the basis that belongs to it order and falsehood cannot subsist together withal unexpectedly enough this knox has a vein of drollery in him which i like much in combination with his other qualities he has a true eye for the ridiculous his history with its rough earnestness is curiously enlivened with this when the two prelates entering glasgow cathedral quarrel about precedence march rapidly up take to hustling one another twitching one anothers rochets and at last flourishing their crosiers like quarterstaves it is a great sight for him everyway not mockery scorn bitterness alone though there is enough of that too but a true loving illuminating laugh mountsup over the earnest visage not a loud laugh you would say a laugh in the eyes most of all an honesthearted brotherly man brother to the high brother also to the low sincere in his sympathy with both he has his pipe of bourdeaux too we find in that old edinburgh house of his a cheery social man with faces that loved him they go far wrong who think this knox was a gloomy spasmodic shrieking fanatic not at all he is one of the solidest of men practical cautioushopeful patient a most shrewd observing quietly discerning man in fact he has very much the type of character we assign to the scotch at present a certain sardonic taciturnity is in him insight enough and a stouter heart than he himself knows of he has the power of holding his peace over many things which do not vitally concern him they what are they but the thing which does vitally concern him that thing he will speak of and in a tone the whole world shall be made to hear all the more emphatic for his long silence this prophet of the scotch is to me no hateful man he had a sore fight of an existence wrestling with popes and principalities in defeat contention lifelong struggle rowing as a galleyslave wandering as an exile a sore fight but he won it have you hope they asked him in his last moment when he could no longer speak he lifted his finger pointed upwards with his finger and so died honour to him his works have not died the letter of his work dies as of all mens but the spirit of it never one word more as to the letter of knoxs work the unforgivable offence in him is that he wished to setup priests over the head of kings in other words he strove to make the government of scotland a theocracy this indeed is properly the sum of his offences the essential sin for which what pardon can there be it is most true he did at bottom consciously or unconsciously mean a theocracy or government of god he did mean that kings and prime ministers and all manner of persons in public or private diplomatising or whatever else they might be doing should walk according to the gospel of christ and understand that this was their law supreme over all laws he hoped once to see such a thing realised and the petition thy kingdom come no longer an empty word he was sore grieved when he saw greedy worldly barons clutch hold of the churchs property when he expostulated that it was not secular property that it was spiritual property and should be turned to true churchly uses education schools worship and the regent murray had to answer with a shrug of the shoulders it is a devout imagination this was knoxs scheme of right and truth this he zealously endeavoured after to realise it if we think this scheme of truth was too narrow was not true we may rejoice that he could not realise it that it remained after two centuries of effort unrealisable and is a devout imagination still but how shall we blame him for struggling to realise it theocracy government of god is precisely the thing to be struggled for all prophets zealous priests are there for that purpose hildebrand wished a theocracy cromwell wished it fought for it mahomet attained it nay is it not what all zealous men whether called priests prophets or whatsoever else called do essentially wish and must wish that right and truth or gods law reign supreme among men this is the heavenly ideal well named in knoxs time and namable in all times a revealed will of god towards which the reformer will insist that all be more and more approximated all true reformers as i said are by the nature of them priests and strive for a theocracy how far such ideals can ever be introduced into practice and at what point our impatience with their nonintroduction ought to begin is always a question i think we may say safely let them introduce themselves as far as they can contrive to do it if they are the true faith of men all men ought to be more or less impatient always where they are not found introduced there will never be wanting regent murrays enough to shrug their shoulders and say a devout imagination we will praise the heropriest rather who does what is in him to bring them in and wears out in toil calumny contradiction a noble life to make a gods kingdom of this earth the earth will not become too godlike lecture v the hero as a man of letters johnson rousseau burns tuesday th may herogods prophets poets priests are forms of heroism that belong to the old ages make their appearance in the remotest times some of them have ceased to be possible long since and cannot any more show themselves in this world the hero as man of letters again of which class we are to speak today is altogether a product of these new ages and so long as the wondrous art of writing or of readywriting which we call printing subsists he may be expected to continue as one of the main forms of heroism for all future ages he is in various respects a very singular phenomenon he is new i say he has hardly lasted above a century in the world yet never till about a hundred years ago was there seen any figure of a great soul living apart in that anomalous manner endeavouring to speakforth the inspiration that was in him by printed books and find place and subsistence by what the world would please to give him for doing that much had been sold and bought and left to make its own bargain in the marketplace but the inspired wisdom of a heroic soul never till then in that naked manner he with his copyrights and copywrongs in his squalid garret in his rusty coat ruling for this is what he does from his grave after death whole nations and generations who would or would not give him bread while living is a rather curious spectacle few shapes of heroism can be more unexpected alas the hero from of old has had to cramp himself into strange shapes the world knows not well at any time what to do with him so foreign is his aspect in the world it seemed absurd to us that men in their rude admiration should take some wise great odin for a god and worship him as such some wise great mahomet for one godinspired and religiously follow his law for twelve centuries but that a wise great johnson a burns a rousseau should be taken for some idle nondescript extant in the world to amuse idleness and have a few coins and applauses thrown in that he might live thereby this perhaps as before hinted will one day seem a still absurder phasis of things meanwhile since it is the spiritual always that determines the material this same manofletters hero must be regarded as our most important modern person he such as he may be is the soul of all what he teachers the whole world will do and make the worlds manner of dealing with him is the most significant feature of the worlds general position looking well at his life we may get a glance as deep as is readily possible for us into the life of those singular centuries which have produced him in which we ourselves live and work there are genuine men of letters and not genuine as in every kind there is a genuine and a spurious if hero be taken to mean genuine then i say the hero as man of letters will be found discharging a function for us which is ever honourable ever the highest and was once well known to be the highest he is utteringforth in such a way as he has the inspired soul of him all that a man in any case can do i say inspired for what we call originality sincerity genius the heroic quality we have no good name for signifies that the hero is he who lives in the inward sphere of things in the true divine and eternal which exists always unseen to most under the temporary trivial his being is in that he declares that abroad by act or speech as it may be in declaring himself abroad his life as we said before is a piece of the everlasting heart of nature herself all mens life is but the weak many know not the fact and are untrue to it in most times the strong few are strong heroic perennial because it cannot be hidden from them the man of letters like every hero is there to proclaim this in such sort as he can intrinsically it is the same function which the old generations named a man prophet priest divinity for doing which all manner of heroes by speech or by act are sent into the world to do fichte the german philosopher delivered some forty years ago at erlangen a highly remarkable course of lectures on this subject ueber das wesen des gelehrten on the nature of the literary man fichte in conformity with the transcendental philosophy of which he was a distinguished teacher declares first that all things which we see or work with in this earth especially we ourselves and all persons are as a kind of vesture or sensuous appearance that under all there lies as the essence of them what he calls the divine idea of the world this is the reality which lies at the bottom of all appearance to the mass of men no such divine idea is recognisable in the world they live merely says fichte among the superficialities practicalities and shows of the world not dreaming that there is anything divine under them but the man of letters is sent hither specially that he may discern for himself and make manifest to us this same divine idea in every new generation it will manifest itself in a new dialect and he is there for the purpose of doing that such is fichtes phraseology with which we need not quarrel it is his way of naming what i here by other words am striving imperfectly to name what there is at present no name for the unspeakable divine significance full of splendour of wonder and terror that lies in the being of every man of every thing the presence of the god who made every man and thing mahomet taught this in his dialect odin in his it is the thing which all thinking hearts in one dialect or another are here to teach fichte calls the man of letters therefore a prophet or as he prefers to phrase it a priest continually unfolding the godlike to men men of letters are a perpetual priesthood from age to age teaching all men that a god is still present in their life that all appearance whatsoever we see in the world is but as a vesture for the divine idea of the world for that which lies at the bottom of appearance in the true literary man there is thus ever acknowledged or not by the world a sacredness he is the light of the world the worlds priest guiding it like a sacred pillar of fire in its dark pilgrimage through the waste of time fichte discriminates with sharp zeal the true literary man what we here call the hero as man of letters from multitudes of false unheroic whoever lives not wholly in this divine idea or living partially in it struggles not as for the one good to live wholly in it he is let him live where else he like in what pomps and prosperities he like no literary man he is says fichte a bungler stmper or at best if he belong to the prosaic provinces he may be a hodman fichte even calls him elsewhere a nonentity and has in short no mercy for him no wish that he should continue happy among us this is fichtes notion of the man of letters it means in its own form precisely what we here mean in this point of view i consider that for the last hundred years by far the notablest of all literary men is fichtes countryman goethe to that man too in a strange way there was given what we may call a life in the divine idea of the world vision of the inward divine mystery and strangely out of his books the world rises imaged once more as godlike the workmanship and temple of a god illuminated all not in fierce impure firesplendour as of mahomet but in mild celestial radiance really a prophecy in these most unprophetic times to my mind by far the greatest though one of the quietest among all the great things that have come to pass in them our chosen specimen of the hero as literary man would be this goethe and it were a very pleasant plan for me here to discourse of his heroism for i consider him to be a true hero heroic in what he said and did and perhaps still more in what he did not say and did not do to me a noble spectacle a great heroic ancient man speaking and keeping silence as an ancient hero in the guise of a most modern highbred highcultivated man of letters we have had no such spectacle no man capable of affording such for the last hundredandfifty years but at present such is the general state of knowledge about goethe it were worse than useless to attempt speaking of him in this case speak as i might goethe to the great majority of you would remain problematic vague no impression but a false one could be realised him we must leave to future times johnson burns rousseau three great figures from a prior time from a far inferior state of circumstances will suit us better here three men of the eighteenth century the conditions of their life far more resemble what those of ours still are in england than what goethes in germany were alas these men did not conquer like him they fought bravely and fell they were not heroic bringers of the light but heroic seekers of it they lived under galling conditions struggling as under mountains of impediment and could not unfold themselves into clearness or victorious interpretation of that divine idea it is rather the tombs of three literary heroes that i have to show you there are the monumental heaps under which three spiritual giants lie buried very mournful but also great and full of interest for us we will linger by them for a while complaint is often made in these times of what we call the disorganised condition of society how ill many arranged forces of society fulfil their work how many powerful forces are seen working in a wasteful chaotic altogether unarranged manner it is too just a complaint as we all know but perhaps if we look at this of books and the writers of books we shall find here as it were the summary of all other disorganisation a sort of heart from which and to which all other confusion circulates in the world considering what bookwriters do in the world and what the world does with bookwriters i should say it is the most anomalous thing the world at present has to show we should get into a sea far beyond sounding did we attempt to give account of this but we must glance at it for the sake of our subject the worst element in the life of these three literary heroes was that they found their business and position such a chaos on the beaten road there is tolerable travelling but it is sore work and many have to perish fashioning a path through the impassable our pious fathers feeling well what importance lay in the speaking of man to men founded churches made endowments regulations everywhere in the civilised world there is a pulpit environed with all manner of complex dignified appurtenances and furtherances that therefrom a man with the tongue may to best advantage address his fellowmen they felt that this was the most important thing that without this there was no good thing it is a right pious work that of theirs beautiful to behold but now with the art of writing with the art of printing a total change has come over that business the writer of a book is not he a preacher preaching not to this parish or that on this day or that but to all men in all times and places surely it is of the last importance that he do his work right whoever do it wrong that the eye report not falsely for then all the other members are astray well how he may do his work whether he do it right or wrong or do it at all is a point which no man in the world has taken the pains to think of to a certain shopkeeper trying to get some money for his books if lucky he is of some importance to no other man of any whence he came whither he is bound by what ways he arrived by what he might be furthered on his course no one asks he is an accident in society he wanders like a wild ishmaelite in a world of which he is as the spiritual light either the guidance or the misguidance certainly the art of writing is the most miraculous of all things man has devised odins runes were the first form of the work of a hero books written words are still miraculous runes of the latest form in books lies the soul of the whole past time the articulate audible voice of the past when the body and material substance of it has altogether vanished like a dream mighty fleets and armies harbours and arsenals vast cities highdomed manyengined they are precious great but what do they become agamemnon the many agamemnons pericleses and their greece all is gone now to some ruined fragments dumb mournful wrecks and blocks but the books of greece there greece to every thinker still very literally lives can be calledup again into life no magic rune is stranger than a book all that mankind has done thought gained or been it is lying as in magic preservation in the pages of books they are the chosen possession of men do not books still accomplish miracles as runes were fabled to do they persuade men not the wretchedest circulatinglibrary novel which foolish girls thumb and con in remote villages but will help to regulate the actual practical weddings and households of those foolish girls so celia felt so clifford acted the foolish theorem of life stamped into those young brains comes out as a solid practice one day consider whether any rune in the wildest imagination of mythologist ever did such wonders as on the actual firm earth some books have done what built st pauls cathedral look at the heart of the matter it was that divine hebrew book the word partly of the man moses an outlaw tending his midianitish herds four thousand years ago in the wildernesses of sinai it is the strangest of things yet nothing is truer with the art of writing of which printing is a simple an inevitable and comparatively insignificant corollary the true reign of miracles for mankind commenced it related with a wondrous new contiguity and perpetual closeness the past and distant with the present in time and place all times and all places with this our actual here and now all things were altered for men all modes of important work of men teaching preaching governing and all else to look at teaching for instance universities are a notable respectable product of the modern ages their existence too is modified to the very basis of it by the existence of books universities arose while there were yet no books procurable while a man for a single book had to give an estate of land that in those circumstances when a man had some knowledge to communicate he should do it by gathering the learners round him face to face was a necessity for him if you wanted to know what abelard knew you must go and listen to abelard thousands as many as thirtythousand went to hear abelard and that metaphysical theology of his and now for any other teacher who had something of his own to teach there was a great convenience opened so many thousands eager to learn were already assembled yonder of all places the best place for him was that for any third teacher it was better still and grew ever the better the more teachers there came it only needed now that the king took notice of this new phenomenon combined or agglomerated the various schools into one school gave it edifices privileges encouragements and named it universitas or school of all sciences the university of paris in its essential characters was there the model of all subsequent universities which down even to these days for six centuries now have gone on to found themselves such i conceive was the origin of universities it is clear however that with this simple circumstance facility of getting books the whole conditions of the business from top to bottom were changed once invent printing you metamorphosed all universities or superseded them the teacher needed not now to gather men personally round him that he might speak to them what he knew print it in a book and all learners far and wide for a trifle had it each at his own fireside much more effectually to learn it doubtless there is still peculiar virtue in speech even writers of books may still in some circumstances find it convenient to speak also witness our present meeting here there is one would say and must ever remain while man has a tongue a distinct province for speech as well as for writing and printing in regard to all things this must remain to universities among others but the limits of the two have nowhere yet been pointed out ascertained much less put in practice the university which would completely takein that great new fact of the existence of printed books and stand on a clear footing for the nineteenth century as the paris one did for the thirteenth has not yet come into existence if we think of it all that a university or final highest school can do for us is still but what the first school began doing teach us to read we learn to read in various languages in various sciences we learn the alphabet and letters of all manner of books but the place where we go to get knowledge even theoretic knowledge is the books themselves it depends on what we read after all manner of professors have done their best for us the true university of these days is a collection of books but to the church itself as i hinted already all is changed in its preaching in its working by the introduction of books the church is the working recognised union of our priests or prophets of those who by wise teaching guide the souls of men while there was no writing even while there was no easywriting or printing the preaching of the voice was the natural sole method of performing this but now with books he that can write a true book to persuade england is not he the bishop and archbishop the primate of england and of all england i many a time say the writers of newspapers pamphlets poems books these are the real working effective church of a modern country nay not only our preaching but even our worship is not it too accomplished by means of printed books the noble sentiment which a gifted soul has clothed for us in melodious words which brings melody into our hearts is not this essentially if we will understand it of the nature of worship there are many in all countries who in this confused time have no other method of worship he who in any way shows us better than we knew before that a lily of the fields is beautiful does he not show it us as an effluence of the fountain of all beauty as the handwriting made visible there of the great maker of the universe he has sung for us made us sing with him a little verse of a sacred psalm essentially so how much more he who sings who says or in any way brings home to our heart the noble doings feelings darings and endurances of a brother man he has verily touched our hearts as with a live coal from the altar perhaps there is no worship more authentic literature so far as it is literature is an apocalypse of nature a revealing of the open secret it may well enough be named in fichtes style a continuous revelation of the godlike in the terrestrial and common the godlike does ever in very truth endure there is brought out now in this dialect now in that with various degrees of clearness all true gifted singers and speakers are consciously or unconsciously doing so the dark stormful indignation of a byron so wayward and perverse may have touches of it nay the withered mockery of a french sceptic his mockery of the false a love and worship of the true how much more the sphereharmony of a shakspeare of a goethe the cathedralmusic of a milton they are something too those humble genuine larknotes of a burns skylark starting from the humble furrow far overhead into the blue depths and singing to us so genuinely there for all true singing is of the nature of worship as indeed all true working may be said to be whereof such singing is but the record and fit melodious representation to us fragments of a real church liturgy and body of homilies strangely disguised from the common eye are to be found weltering in that huge frothocean of printed speech we loosely call literature books are our church too or turning now to the government of men witenagemote old parliament was a great thing the affairs of the nation were there deliberated and decided what we were to do as a nation but does not though the name parliament subsists the parliamentary debate go on now everywhere and at all times in a far more comprehensive way out of parliament altogether burke said there were three estates in parliament but in the reporters gallery yonder there sat a fourth estate more important far than they all it is not a figure of speech or a witty saying it is a literal fact very momentous to us in these times literature is our parliament too printing which comes necessarily out of writing i say often is equivalent to democracy invent writing democracy is inevitable writing brings printing brings universal everyday extempore printing as we see at present whoever can speak speaking now to the whole nation becomes a power a branch of government with inalienable weight in lawmaking in all acts of authority it matters not what rank he has what revenues or garnitures the requisite thing is that he have a tongue which others will listen to this and nothing more is requisite the nation is governed by all that has tongue in the nation democracy is virtually there add only that whatsoever power exists will have itself by and by organised working secretly under bandages obscurations obstructions it will never rest till it get to work free unencumbered visible to all democracy virtually extant will insist on becoming palpably extant on all sides are we not driven to the conclusion that of the things which man can do or make here below by far the most momentous wonderful and worthy are the things we call books those poor bits of ragpaper with black ink on them from the daily newspaper to the sacred hebrew book what have they not done what are they not doing for indeed whatever be the outward form of the thing bits of paper as we say and black ink is it not verily at bottom the highest act of mans faculty that produces a book it is the thought of man the true thaumaturgic virtue by which man works all things whatsoever all that he does and brings to pass is the vesture of a thought this london city with all its houses palaces steamengines cathedrals and huge immeasurable traffic and tumult what is it but a thought but millions of thoughts made into one a huge immeasurable spirit of a thought embodied in brick in iron smoke dust palaces parliaments hackney coaches katherine docks and the rest of it not a brick was made but some man had to think of the making of that brick the thing we called bits of paper with traces of black ink is the purest embodiment a thought of man can have no wonder it is in all ways the activest and noblest all this of the importance and supreme importance of the man of letters in modern society and how the press is to such a degree superseding the pulpit the senate the senatus academicus and much else has been admitted for a good while and recognised often enough in late times with a sort of sentimental triumph and wonderment it seems to me the sentimental by and by will have to give place to the practical if men of letters are so incalculably influential actually performing such work for us from age to age and even from day to day then i think we may conclude that men of letters will not always wander like unrecognised unregulated ishmaelites among us whatsoever thing as i said above has virtual unnoticed power will castoff its wrappages bandages and stepforth one day with palpably articulated universally visible power that one man wear the clothes and take the wages of a function which is done by quite another there can be no profit in this this is not right it is wrong and yet alas the making of it right what a business for long times to come sure enough this that we call organisation of the literary guild is still a great way off encumbered with all manner of complexities if you asked me what were the best possible organisation for the men of letters in modern society the arrangement of furtherance and regulation grounded the most accurately on the actual facts of their position and of the worlds position i should beg to say that the problem far exceeded my faculty it is not one mans faculty it is that of many successive men turned earnestly upon it that will bringout even an approximate solution what the best arrangement were none of us could say but if you ask which is the worst i answer this which we now have that chaos should sit umpire in it this is the worst to the best or any good one there is yet a long way one remark i must not omit that royal or parliamentary grants of money are by no means the chief thing wanted to give our men of letters stipends endowments and all furtherance of cash will do little towards the business on the whole one is weary of hearing about the omnipotence of money i will say rather that for a genuine man it is no evil to be poor that there ought to be literary men poor to show whether they are genuine or not mendicant orders bodies of good men doomed to beg were instituted in the christian church a most natural and even necessary development of the spirit of christianity it was itself founded on poverty on sorrow contradiction crucifixion every species of worldly distress and degradation we may say that he who has not known those things and learned from them the priceless lessons they have to teach has missed a good opportunity of schooling to beg and go barefoot in coarse woollen cloak with a rope round your loins and be despised of all the world was no beautiful business nor an honourable one in any eye till the nobleness of those who did so had made it honoured of some begging is not in our course at the present time but for the rest of it who will say that a johnson is not perhaps the better for being poor it is needful for him at all rates to know that outward profit that success of any kind is not the goal he has to aim at pride vanity illconditioned egoism of all sorts are bred in his heart as in every heart need above all to be castout of his heart to be with whatever pangs tornout of it castforth from it as a thing worthless byron born rich and noble madeout even less than burns poor and plebeian who knows but in that same best possible organisation as yet far off poverty may still enter as an important element what if our men of letters men settingup to be spiritual heroes were still then as they now are a kind of involuntary monastic order bound still to this same ugly poverty till they had tried what was in it too till they had learned to make it too do for them money in truth can do much but it cannot do all we must know the province of it and confine it and even spurn it back when it wishes to get farther besides were the moneyfurtherances the proper season for them the fit assigner of them all settled how is the burns to be recognised that merits these he must pass through the ordeal and prove himself this ordeal this wild welter of a chaos which is called literary life this too is a kind of ordeal there is clear truth in the idea that a struggle from the lower classes of society towards the upper regions and rewards of society must ever continue strong men are born there who ought to stand elsewhere than there the manifold inextricably complex universal struggle of these constitutes and must constitute what is called the progress of society for men of letters as for all other sorts of men how to regulate that struggle there is the whole question to leave it as it is at the mercy of blind chance a whirl of distracted atoms one cancelling the other one of the thousand arriving saved ninehundredandninetynine lost by the way your royal johnson languishing inactive in garrets or harnessed to the yoke of printer cave your burns dying brokenhearted as a gauger your rousseau driven into mad exasperation kindling french revolutions by his paradoxes this as we said is clearly enough the worst regulation the best alas is far from us and yet there can be no doubt but it is coming advancing on us as yet hidden in the bosom of centuries this is a prophecy one can risk for so soon as men get to discern the importance of a thing they do infallibly set about arranging it facilitating forwarding it and rest not till in some approximate degree they have accomplished that i say of all priesthoods aristocracies governing classes at present extant in the world there is no class comparable for importance to that priesthood of the writers of books this is a fact which he who runs may read and draw inferences from literature will take care of itself answered mr pitt when appliedto for some help for burns yes adds mr southey it will take care of itself and of you too if you do not look to it the result to individual men of letters is not the momentous one they are but individuals an infinitesimal fraction of the great body they can struggle on and live or else die as they have been wont but it deeply concerns the whole society whether it will set its light on high places to walk thereby or trample it under foot and scatter it in all ways of wild waste not without conflagration as heretofore light is the one thing wanted for the world put wisdom in the head of the world the world will fight its battle victoriously and be the best world man can make it i call this anomaly of a disorganic literary class the heart of all other anomalies at once product and parent some good arrangement for that would be as the punctum saliens of a new vitality and just arrangement for all already in some european countries in france in prussia one traces some beginnings of an arrangement for the literary class indicating the gradual possibility of such i believe that it is possible that it will have to be possible by far the most interesting fact i hear about the chinese is one on which we cannot arrive at clearness but which excites endless curiosity even in the dim state this namely that they do attempt to make their men of letters their governors it would be rash to say one understood how this was done or with what degree of success it was done all such things must be very unsuccessful yet a small degree of success is precious the very attempt how precious there does seem to be all over china a more or less active search everywhere to discover the men of talent that grow up in the young generation schools there are for every one a foolish sort of training yet still a sort the youths who distinguish themselves in the lower school are promoted into favourable stations in the higher that they may still more distinguish themselves forward and forward it appears to be out of these that the official persons and incipient governors are taken these are they whom they try first whether they can govern or not and surely with the best hope for they are the men that have already shown intellect try them they have not governed or administered as yet perhaps they cannot but there is no doubt they have some understanding without which no man can neither is understanding a tool as we are too apt to figure it is a hand which can handle any tool try these men they are of all others the best worth trying surely there is no kind of government constitution revolution social apparatus or arrangement that i know of in this world so promising to ones scientific curiosity as this the man of intellect at the top of affairs this is the aim of all constitutions and revolutions if they have any aim for the man of true intellect as i assert and believe always is the noblehearted man withal the true just humane and valiant man get him for governor all is got fail to get him though you had constitutions plentiful as blackberries and a parliament in every village there is nothing yet got these things look strange truly and are not such as we commonly speculate upon but we are fallen into strange times these things will require to be speculated upon to be rendered practicable to be in some way put in practice these and many others on all hands of us there is the announcement audible enough that the old empire of routine has ended that to say a thing has long been is no reason for its continuing to be the things which have been are fallen into decay are fallen into incompetence large masses of mankind in every society of our europe are no longer capable of living at all by the things which have been when millions of men can no longer by their utmost exertion gain food for themselves and the third man for thirtysix weeks each year is short of thirdrate potatoes the things which have been must decidedly prepare to alter themselves i will now quit this of the organisation of men of letters alas the evil that pressed heaviest on those literary heroes of ours was not the want of organisation for men of letters but a far deeper one out of which indeed this and so many other evils for the literary man and for all men had as from their fountain taken rise that our hero as man of letters had to travel without highway companionless through an inorganic chaos and to leave his own life and faculty lying there as a partial contribution towards pushing some highway through it this had not his faculty itself been so perverted and paralysed he might have put up with might have considered to be but the common lot of heroes his fatal misery was the spiritual paralysis so we may name it of the age in which his life lay whereby his life too do what he might was halfparalysed the eighteenth was a sceptical century in which little word there is a whole pandoras box of miseries scepticism means not intellectual doubt alone but moral doubt all sorts of infidelity insincerity spiritual paralysis perhaps in few centuries that one could specify since the world began was a life of heroism more difficult for a man that was not an age of faith an age of heroes the very possibility of heroism had been as it were formally abnegated in the minds of all heroism was gone forever triviality formulism and commonplace were come forever the age of miracles had been or perhaps had not been but it was not any longer an effete world wherein wonder greatness godhood could not now dwell in one word a godless world how mean dwarfish are their ways of thinking in this time compared not with the christian shakspeares and miltons but with the old pagan skalds with any species of believing men the living tree igdrasil with the melodious prophetic waving of its worldwide boughs deeprooted as hela has diedout into the clanking of a worldmachine tree and machine contrast these two things i for my share declare the world to be no machine i say that it does not go by wheelandpinion motives selfinterests checks balances that there is something far other in it than the clank of spinningjennies and parliamentary majorities and on the whole that it is not a machine at all the old norse heathen had a truer notion of godsworld than these poor machinesceptics the old heathen norse were sincere men but for these poor sceptics there was no sincerity no truth halftruth and hearsay was called truth truth for most men meant plausibility to be measured by the number of votes you could get they had lost any notion that sincerity was possible or of what sincerity was how many plausibilities asking with unaffected surprise and the air of offended virtue what am not i sincere spiritual paralysis i say nothing left but a mechanical life was the characteristic of that century for the common man unless happily he stood below his century and belonged to another prior one it was impossible to be a believer a hero he lay buried unconscious under these baleful influences to the strongest man only with infinite struggle and confusion was it possible to work himself halfloose and lead as it were in an enchanted most tragical way a spiritual deathinlife and be a halfhero scepticism is the name we give to all this as the chief symptom as the chief origin of all this concerning which so much were to be said it would take many discourses not a small fraction of one discourse to state what one feels about that eighteenth century and its ways as indeed this and the like of this which we now call scepticism is precisely the black malady and lifefoe against which all teaching and discoursing since mans life began has directed itself the battle of belief against unbelief is the neverending battle neither is it in the way of crimination that one would wish to speak scepticism for that century we must consider as the decay of old ways of believing the preparation afar off for new better and wider ways an inevitable thing we will not blame men for it we will lament their hard fate we will understand that destruction of old forms is not destruction of everlasting substances that scepticism as sorrowful and hateful as we see it is not an end but a beginning the other day speaking without prior purpose that way of benthams theory of man and mans life i chanced to call it a more beggarly one than mahomets i am bound to say now when it is once uttered that such is my deliberate opinion not that one would mean offence against the man jeremy bentham or those who respect and believe him bentham himself and even the creed of bentham seems to me comparatively worthy of praise it is a determinate being what all the world in a cowardly halfandhalf manner was tending to be let us have the crisis we shall either have death or the cure i call this gross steamengine utilitarianism an approach towards new faith it was a laying down of cant a saying to oneself well then this world is a dead iron machine the god of it gravitation and selfish hunger let us see what by checking and balancing and good adjustment of tooth and pinion can be made of it benthamism has something complete manful in such fearless committal of itself to what it finds true you may call it heroic though a heroism with its eyes put out it is the culminating point and fearless ultimatum of what lay in the halfandhalf state pervading mans whole existence in that eighteenth century it seems to me all deniers of godhood and all lipbelievers of it are bound to be benthamites if they have courage and honesty benthamism is an eyeless heroism the human species like a hapless blinded samson grinding in the philistine mill clasps convulsively the pillars of its mill brings huge ruin down but ultimately deliverance withal of bentham i meant to say no harm but this i do say and would wish all men to know and lay to heart that he who discerns nothing but mechanism in the universe has in the fatalest way missed the secret of the universe altogether that all godhood should vanish out of mens conception of this universe seems to me precisely the most brutal error i will not disparage heathenism by calling it a heathen error that men could fall into it is not true it is false at the very heart of it a man who thinks so will think wrong about all things in the world this original sin will vitiate all other conclusions he can form one might call it the most lamentable of delusions not forgetting witchcraft itself witchcraft worshipped at least a living devil but this worships a dead iron devil no god not even a devil whatsoever is noble divine inspired drops thereby out of life there remains everywhere in life a despicable caputmortuum the mechanical hull all soul fled out of it how can a man act heroically the doctrine of motives will teach him that it is under more or less disguise nothing but a wretched love of pleasure fear of pain that hunger of applause of cash of whatsoever victual it may be is the ultimate fact of mans life atheism in brief which does indeed frightfully punish itself the man i say is become spiritually a paralytic man this godlike universe a dead mechanical steamengine all working by motives checks balances and i know not what wherein as in the detestable belly of some phalarisbull of his own contriving he the poor phalaris sits miserably dying belief i define to be the healthy act of a mans mind it is a mysterious indescribable process that of getting to believe indescribable as all vital acts are we have our mind given us not that it may cavil and argue but that it may see into something give us clear belief and understanding about something whereon we are then to proceed to act doubt truly is not itself a crime certainly we do not rush out clutchup the first thing we find and straightway believe that all manner of doubt inquiry greek skepsis as it is named about all manner of objects dwells in every reasonable mind it is the mystic working of the mind on the object it is getting to know and believe belief comes out of all this above ground like the tree from its hidden roots but now if even on common things we require that a man keep his doubts silent and not babble of them till they in some measure become affirmations or denials how much more in regard to the highest things impossible to speak of in words at all that a man parade his doubt and get to imagine that debating and logic which means at best only the manner of telling us your thought your belief or disbelief about a thing is the triumph and true work of what intellect he has alas this is as if you should overturn the tree and instead of green boughs leaves and fruits show us ugly taloned roots turnedup into the air and no growth only death and misery going on for the scepticism as i said is not intellectual only it is moral also a chronic atrophy and disease of the whole soul a man lives by believing something not by debating and arguing about many things a sad case for him when all that he can manage to believe is something he can button in his pocket and with one or the other organ eat and digest lower than that he will not get we call those ages in which he gets so low the mournfulest sickest and meanest of all ages the worlds heart is palsied sick how can any limb of it be whole genuine acting ceases in all departments of the worlds work dextrous similitude of acting begins the worlds wages are pocketed the worlds work is not done heroes have gone out quacks have come in accordingly what century since the end of the roman world which also was a time of scepticism simulacra and universal decadence so abounds with quacks as that eighteenth consider them with their tumid sentimental vapouring about virtue benevolence the wretched quacksquadron cagliostro at the head of them few men were without quackery they had got to consider it a necessary ingredient and amalgam for truth chatham our brave chatham himself comes down to the house all wrapt and bandaged he has crawled out in great bodily suffering and so on forgets says walpole that he is acting the sick man in the fire of debate snatches his arm from the sling and oratorically swings and brandishes it chatham himself lives the strangest mimetic life half hero half quack all along for indeed the world is full of dupes and you have to gain the worlds suffrage how the duties of the world will be done in that case what quantities of error which means failure which means sorrow and misery to some and to many will gradually accumulate in all provinces of the worlds business we need not compute it seems to me you lay your finger here on the heart of the worlds maladies when you call it a sceptical world an insincere world a godless untruth of a world it is out of this as i consider that the whole tribe of social pestilences french revolutions chartisms and what not have derived their being their chief necessity to be this must alter till this alter nothing can beneficially alter my one hope of the world my inexpugnable consolation in looking at the miseries of the world is that this is altering here and there one does now find a man who knows as of old that this world is a truth and no plausibility and falsity that he himself is alive not dead or paralytic and that the world is alive instinct with godhood beautiful and awful even as in the beginning of days one man once knowing this many men all men must by and by come to know it it lies there clear for whosoever will take the spectacles off his eyes and honestly look to know for such a man the unbelieving century with its unblessed products is already past a new century is already come the old unblessed products and performances as solid as they look are phantasms preparing speedily to vanish to this and the other noisy very greatlooking simulacrum with the whole world huzzahing at its heels he can say composedly stepping aside thou art not true thou art not extant only semblant go thy way yes hollow formulism gross benthamism and other unheroic atheistic insincerity is visibly and even rapidly declining an unbelieving eighteenth century is but an exception such as now and then occurs i prophesy that the world will once more become sincere a believing world with many heroes in it a heroic world it will then be a victorious world never till then or indeed what of the world and its victories men speak too much about the world each one of us here let the world go how it will and be victorious or not victorious has he not a life of his own to lead one life a little gleam of time between two eternities no second chance to us forevermore it were well for us to live not as fools and simulacra but as wise and realities the worlds being saved will not save us nor the worlds being lost destroy us we should look to ourselves there is great merit here in the duty of staying at home and on the whole to say truth i never heard of worlds being saved in any other way that mania of saving worlds is itself a piece of the eighteenth century with its windy sentimentalism let us not follow it too far for the saving of the world i will trust confidently to the maker of the world and look a little to my own saving which i am more competent to in brief for the worlds sake and for our own we will rejoice greatly that scepticism insincerity mechanical atheism with all their poisondews are going and as good as gone now it was under such conditions in those times of johnson that our men of letters had to live times in which there was properly no truth in life old truths had fallen nigh dumb the new lay yet hidden not trying to speak that mans life here below was a sincerity and fact and would forever continue such no new intimation in that dusk of the world had yet dawned no intimation not even any french revolution which we define to be a truth once more though a truth clad in hellfire how different was the luthers pilgrimage with its assured goal from the johnsons girt with mere traditions suppositions grown now incredible unintelligible mahomets formulas were of wood waxed and oiled and could be burnt out of ones way poor johnsons were far more difficult to burn the strong man will ever find work which means difficulty pain to the full measure of his strength but to makeout a victory in those circumstances of our poor hero as man of letters was perhaps more difficult than in any not obstruction disorganisation bookseller osborne and fourpencehalfpenny a day not this alone but the light of his own soul was taken from him no landmark on the earth and alas what is that to having no loadstar in the heaven we need not wonder that none of those three men rose to victory that they fought truly is the highest praise with a mournful sympathy we will contemplate if not three living victorious heroes as i said the tombs of three fallen heroes they fell for us too making a way for us there are the mountains which they hurled abroad in their confused war of the giants under which their strength and life spent they now lie buried i have already written of these three literary heroes expressly or incidentally what i suppose is known to most of you what need not be spoken or written a second time they concern us here as the singular prophets of that singular age for such they virtually were and the aspect they and their world exhibit under this point of view might lead us into reflections enough i call them all three genuine men more or less faithfully for most part unconsciously struggling to be genuine and plant themselves on the everlasting truth of things this to a degree that eminently distinguishes them from the poor artificial mass of their contemporaries and renders them worthy to be considered as speakers in some measure of the everlasting truth as prophets in that age of theirs by nature herself a noble necessity was laid on them to be so they were men of such magnitude that they could not live on unrealities clouds froth and all inanity gaveway under them there was no footing for them but on firm earth no rest or regular motion for them if they got not footing there to a certain extent they were sons of nature once more in an age of artifice once more original men as for johnson i have always considered him to be by nature one of our great english souls a strong and noble man so much left undeveloped in him to the last in a kindlier element what might he not have been poet priest sovereign ruler on the whole a man must not complain of his element of his time or the like it is thriftless work doing so his time is bad well then he is there to make it better johnsons youth was poor isolated hopeless very miserable indeed it does not seem possible that in any the favourablest outward circumstances johnsons life could have been other than a painful one the world might have had more of profitable work out of him or less but his effort against the worlds work could never have been a light one nature in return for his nobleness had said to him live in an element of diseased sorrow nay perhaps the sorrow and the nobleness were intimately and even inseparably connected with each other at all events poor johnson had to go about girt with continual hypochondria physical and spiritual pain like a hercules with the burning nessusshirt on him which shootsin on him dull incurable misery the nessusshirt not to be striptoff which is his own natural skin in this manner he had to live figure him there with his scrofulous diseases with his great greedy heart and unspeakable chaos of thoughts stalking mournful as a stranger in this earth eagerly devouring what spiritual thing he could come at schoollanguages and other merely grammatical stuff if there were nothing better the largest soul that was in all england and provision made for it of fourpencehalfpenny a day yet a giant invincible soul a true mans one remembers always that story of the shoes at oxford the rough seamyfaced rawboned college servitor stalking about in winterseason with his shoes wornout how the charitable gentleman commoner secretly places a new pair at his door and the rawboned servitor lifting them looking at them near with his dim eyes with what thoughts pitches them out of window wet feet mud frost hunger or what you will but not beggary we cannot stand beggary rude stubborn selfhelp here a whole world of squalor rudeness confused misery and want yet of nobleness and manfulness withal it is a type of the mans life this pitchingaway of the shoes an original man not a secondhand borrowing or begging man let us stand on our own basis at any rate on such shoes as we ourselves can get on frost and mud if you will but honestly on that on the reality and substance which nature gives us not on the semblance on the thing she has given another than us and yet with all this rugged pride of manhood and selfhelp was there ever soul more tenderly affectionate loyally submissive to what was really higher than he great souls are always loyally submissive reverent to what is over them only small mean souls are otherwise i could not find a better proof of what i said the other day that the sincere man was by nature the obedient man that only in a world of heroes was there loyal obedience to the heroic the essence of originality is not that it be new johnson believed altogether in the old he found the old opinions credible for him fit for him and in a right heroic manner lived under them he is well worth study in regard to that for we are to say that johnson was far other than a mere man of words and formulas he was a man of truths and facts he stood by the old formulas the happier was it for him that he could so stand but in all formulas that he could stand by there needed to be a most genuine substance very curious how in that poor paperage so barren artificial thickquilted with pedantries hearsays the great fact of this universe glared in forever wonderful indubitable unspeakable divineinfernal upon this man too how he harmonised his formulas with it how he managed at all under such circumstances that is a thing worth seeing a thing to be looked at with reverence with pity with awe that church of st clement danes where johnson still worshipped in the era of voltaire is to me a venerable place it was in virtue of his sincerity of his speaking still in some sort from the heart of nature though in the current artificial dialect that johnson was a prophet are not all dialects artificial artificial things are not all false nay every true product of nature will infallibly shape itself we may say all artificial things are at the starting of them true what we call formulas are not in their origin bad they are indispensably good formula is method habitude found wherever man is found formulas fashion themselves as paths do as beaten highways leading towards some sacred or high object whither many men are bent consider it one man full of heartfelt earnest impulse findsout a way of doing somewhat were it of uttering his souls reverence for the highest were it but of fitly saluting his fellowman an inventor was needed to do that a poet he has articulated the dimstruggling thought that dwelt in his own and many hearts this is his way of doing that these are his footsteps the beginning of a path and now see the second man travels naturally in the footsteps of his foregoer it is the easiest method in the footsteps of his foregoer yet with improvements with changes where such seem good at all events with enlargements the path ever widening itself as more travel it till at last there is a broad highway whereon the whole world may travel and drive while there remains a city or shrine or any reality to drive to at the farther end the highway shall be right welcome when the city is gone we will forsake the highway in this manner all institutions practices regulated things in the world have come into existence and gone out of existence formulas all begin by being full of substance you may call them the skin the articulation into shape into limbs and skin of a substance that is already there they had not been there otherwise idols as we said are not idolatrous till they become doubtful empty for the worshippers heart much as we talk against formulas i hope no one of us is ignorant withal of the high significance of true formulas that they were and will ever be the indispensablest furniture of our habitation in this world mark too how little johnson boasts of his sincerity he has no suspicion of his being particularly sincere of his being particularly anything a hardstruggling wearyhearted man or scholar as he calls himself trying hard to get some honest livelihood in the world not to starve but to live without stealing a noble unconsciousness is in him he does not engrave truth on his watchseal no but he stands by truth speaks by it works and lives by it thus it ever is think of it once more the man whom nature has appointed to do great things is first of all furnished with that openness to nature which renders him incapable of being insincere to his large open deepfeeling heart nature is a fact all hearsay is hearsay the unspeakable greatness of this mystery of life let him acknowledge it or not nay even though he seem to forget it or deny it is ever present to him fearful and wonderful on this hand and on that he has a basis of sincerity unrecognised because never questioned or capable of question mirabeau mahomet cromwell napoleon all the great men i ever heardof have this as the primary material of them innumerable commonplace men are debating are talking everywhere their commonplace doctrines which they have learned by logic by rote at secondhand to that kind of man all this is still nothing he must have truth truth which he feels to be true how shall he stand otherwise his whole soul at all moments in all ways tells him that there is no standing he is under the noble necessity of being true johnsons way of thinking about this world is not mine any more than mahomets was but i recognise the everlasting element of heartsincerity in both and see with pleasure how neither of them remains ineffectual neither of them is as chaff sown in both of them is something which the seedfield will grow johnson was a prophet to his people preached a gospel to them as all like him always do the highest gospel he preached we may describe as a kind of moral prudence in a world where much is to be done and little is to be known see how you will do it a thing well worth preaching a world where much is to be done and little is to be known do not sink yourselves in boundless bottomless abysses of doubt of wretched godforgetting unbelief you were miserable then powerless mad how could you do or work at all such gospel johnson preached and taught coupled theoretically and practically with this other great gospel clear your mind of cant have no trade with cant stand on the cold mud in the frosty weather but let it be in your own real torn shoes that will be better for you as mahomet says i call this i call these two things joined together a great gospel the greatest perhaps that was possible at that time johnsons writings which once had such currency and celebrity are now as it were disowned by the young generation it is not wonderful johnsons opinions are fast becoming obsolete but his style of thinking and of living we may hope will never become obsolete i find in johnsons books the indisputablest traces of a great intellect and great heart ever welcome under what obstructions and perversions soever they are sincere words those of his he means things by them a wondrous buckram style the best he could get to then a measured grandiloquence stepping or rather stalking along in a very solemn way grown obsolete now sometimes a tumid size of phraseology not in proportion to the contents of it all this you will putup with for the phraseology tumid or not has always something within it so many beautiful styles and books with nothing in them a man is a malefactor to the world who writes such they are the avoidable kind had johnson left nothing but his dictionary one might have traced there a great intellect a genuine man looking to its clearness of definition its general solidity honesty insight and successful method it may be called the best of all dictionaries there is in it a kind of architectural nobleness it stands there like a great solid squarebuilt edifice finished symmetrically complete you judge that a true builder did it one word in spite of our haste must be granted to poor bozzy he passes for a mean inflated gluttonous creature and was so in many senses yet the fact of his reverence for johnson will ever remain noteworthy the foolish conceited scotch laird the most conceited man of his time approaching in such awestruck attitude the great dusty irascible pedagogue in his mean garret there it is a genuine reverence for excellence a worship for heroes at a time when neither heroes nor worship were surmised to exist heroes it would seem exist always and a certain worship of them we will also take the liberty to deny altogether that of the witty frenchman that no man is a hero to his valetdechambre or if so it is not the heros blame but the valets that his soul namely is a mean valetsoul he expects his hero to advance in royal stagetrappings with measured step trains borne behind him trumpets sounding before him it should stand rather no man can be a grandmonarque to his valetdechambre strip your louis quatorze of his kinggear and there is left nothing but a poor forked radish with a head fantastically carved admirable to no valet the valet does not know a hero when he sees him alas no it requires a kind of hero to do that and one of the worlds wants in this as in other senses is for the most part want of such on the whole shall we not say that boswells admiration was well bestowed that he could have found no soul in all england so worthy of bending down before shall we not say of this great mournful johnson too that he guided his difficult confused existence wisely led it well like a rightvaliant man that waste chaos of authorship by trade that waste chaos of scepticism in religion and politics in lifetheory and lifepractice in his poverty in his dust and dimness with the sick body and the rusty coat he made it do for him like a brave man not wholly without a loadstar in the eternal he had still a loadstar as the brave all need to have with his eye set on that he would change his course for nothing in these confused vortices of the lower sea of time to the spirit of lies bearing death and hunger he would in no wise strike his flag brave old samuel ultimus romanorum of rousseau and his heroism i cannot say so much he is not what i call a strong man a morbid excitable spasmodic man at best intense rather than strong he had not the talent of silence an invaluable talent which few frenchmen or indeed men of any sort in these times excel in the suffering man ought really to consume his own smoke there is no good in emitting smoke till you have made it into fire which in the metaphorical sense too all smoke is capable of becoming rousseau has not depth or width not calm force for difficulty the first characteristic of true greatness a fundamental mistake to call vehemence and rigidity strength a man is not strong who takes convulsionfits though six men cannot hold him then he that can walk under the heaviest weight without staggering he is the strong man we need forever especially in these loudshrieking days to remind ourselves of that a man who cannot hold his peace till the time come for speaking and acting is no right man poor rousseaus face is to me expressive of him a high but narrow contracted intensity in it bony brows deep straightset eyes in which there is something bewilderedlooking bewildered peering with lynxeagerness a face full of misery even ignoble misery and also of the antagonism against that something mean plebeian there redeemed only by intensity the face of what is called a fanatic a sadly contracted hero we name him here because with all his drawbacks and they are many he has the first and chief characteristic of a hero he is heartily in earnest in earnest if ever man was as none of these french philosophes were nay one would say of an earnestness too great for his otherwise sensitive rather feeble nature and which indeed in the end drove him into the strangest incoherences almost delirations there had come at last to be a kind of madness in him his ideas possessed him like demons hurried him so about drove him over steep places the fault and misery of rousseau was what we easily name by a single word egoism which is indeed the source and summary of all faults and miseries whatsoever he had not perfected himself into victory over mere desire a mean hunger in many sorts was still the motive principle of him i am afraid he was a very vain man hungry for the praises of men you remember genliss experience of him she took jean jacques to the theatre he bargaining for a strict incognito he would not be seen there for the world the curtain did happen nevertheless to be drawn aside the pit recognised jean jacques but took no great notice of him he expressed the bitterest indignation gloomed all evening spake no other than surly words the glib countess remained entirely convinced that his anger was not at being seen but at not being applauded when seen how the whole nature of the man is poisoned nothing but suspicion selfisolation fierce moody ways he could not live with anybody a man of some rank from the country who visited him often and used to sit with him expressing all reverence and affection for him comes one day finds jean jacques full of the sourest unintelligible humour monsieur said jean jacques with flaming eyes i know why you come here you come to see what a poor life i lead how little is in my poor pot that is boiling there well look into the pot there is half a pound of meat one carrot and three onions that is all go and tell the whole world that if you like monsieur a man of this sort was far gone the whole world got itself supplied with anecdotes for light laughter for a certain theatrical interest from these perversions and contortions of poor jean jacques alas to him they were not laughing or theatrical too real to him the contortions of a dying gladiator the crowded amphitheatre lookson with entertainment but the gladiator is in agonies and dying and yet this rousseau as we say with his passionate appeals to mothers with his contratsocial with his celebrations of nature even of savage life in nature did once more touch upon reality struggle towards reality was doing the function of a prophet to his time as he could and as the time could strangely through all that defacement degradation and almost madness there is in the inmost heart of poor rousseau a spark of real heavenly fire once more out of the element of that withered mocking philosophism scepticism and persiflage there has arisen in that man the ineradicable feeling and knowledge that this life of ours is true not a scepticism theorem or persiflage but a fact an awful reality nature had made that revelation to him had ordered him to speak it out he got it spoken out if not well and clearly then ill and dimly as clearly as he could nay what are all errors and perversities of his even those stealings of ribbons aimless confused miseries and vagabondisms if we will interpret them kindly but the blinkard dazzlements and staggerings to and fro of a man sent on an errand he is too weak for by a path he cannot yet find men are led by strange ways one should have tolerance for a man hope of him leave him to try yet what he will do while life lasts hope lasts for every man of rousseaus literary talents greatly celebrated still among his countrymen i do not say much his books like himself are what i call unhealthy not the good sort of books there is a sensuality in rousseau combined with such an intellectual gift as his it makes pictures of a certain gorgeous attractiveness but they are not genuinely poetical not white sunlight something operatic a kind of rosepink artificial bedizenment it is frequent or rather it is universal among the french since his time madame de stal has something of it st pierre and down onwards to the present astonishing convulsionary literature of desperation it is everywhere abundant that same rosepink is not the right hue look at a shakspeare at a goethe even at a walter scott he who has once seen into this has seen the difference of the true from the shamtrue and will discriminate them ever afterwards we had to observe in johnson how much good a prophet under all disadvantages and disorganisations can accomplish for the world in rousseau we are called to look rather at the fearful amount of evil which under such disorganisation may accompany the good historically it is a most pregnant spectacle that of rousseau banished into paris garrets in the gloomy company of his own thoughts and necessities there driven from post to pillar fretted exasperated till the heart of him went mad he had grown to feel deeply that the world was not his friend nor the worlds law it was expedient if anyway possible that such a man should not have been set in flat hostility with the world he could be cooped into garrets laughed at as a maniac left to starve like a wild beast in his cage but he could not be hindered from setting the world on fire the french revolution found its evangelist in rousseau his semidelirious speculations on the miseries of civilised life the preferability of the savage to the civilised and suchlike helped well to produce a whole delirium in france generally true you may well ask what could the world the governors of the world do with such a man difficult to say what the governors of the world could do with him what he could do with them is unhappily clear enough guillotine a great many of them enough now of rousseau it was a curious phenomenon in the withered unbelieving secondhand eighteenth century that of a hero starting up among the artificial pasteboard figures and productions in the guise of a robert burns like a little well in the rocky desert places like a sudden splendour of heaven in the artificial vauxhall people knew not what to make of it they took it for a piece of the vauxhall firework alas it let itself be so taken though struggling halfblindly as in bitterness of death against that perhaps no man had such a false reception from his fellowmen once more a very wasteful lifedrama was enacted under the sun the tragedy of burnss life is known to all of you surely we may say if discrepancy between place held and place merited constitute perverseness of lot for a man no lot could be more perverse than burnss among those secondhand actingfigures mimes for most part of the eighteenth century once more a giant original man one of those men who reach down to the perennial deeps who take rank with the heroic among men and he was born in a poor ayrshire hut the largest soul of all the british lands came among us in the shape of a hardhanded scottish peasant his father a poor toiling man tried various things did not succeed in any was involved in continual difficulties the steward factor as the scotch call him used to send letters and threatenings burns says which threw us all into tears the brave hardtoiling hardsuffering father his brave heroine of a wife and those children of whom robert was one in this earth so wide otherwise no shelter for them the letters threw us all into tears figure it the brave father i say always a silent hero and poet without whom the son had never been a speaking one burnss schoolmaster came afterwards to london learnt what good society was but declares that in no meeting of men did he ever enjoy better discourse than at the hearth of this peasant and his poor seven acres of nurseryground not that nor the miserable patch of clayfarm nor anything he tried to get a living by would prosper with him he had a sore unequal battle all his days but he stood to it valiantly a wise faithful unconquerable man swallowingdown how many sore sufferings daily into silence fighting like an unseen hero nobody publishing newspaper paragraphs about his nobleness voting pieces of plate to him however he was not lost nothing is lost robert is there the outcome of him and indeed of many generations of such as him this burns appears under every disadvantage uninstructed poor born only to hard manual toil and writing when it came to that in a rustic special dialect known only to a small province of the country he lived in had he written even what he did write in the general language of england i doubt not he had already become universally recognised as being or capable to be one of our greatest men that he should have tempted so many to penetrate through the rough husk of that dialect of his is proof that there lay something far from common within it he has gained a certain recognition and is continuing to do so over all quarters of our wide saxon world wheresoever a saxon dialect is spoken it begins to be understood by personal inspection of this and the other that one of the most considerable saxon men of the eighteenth century was an ayrshire peasant named robert burns yes i will say here too was a piece of the right saxon stuff strong as the harzrock rooted in the depths of the world rock yet with wells of living softness in it a wild impetuous whirlwind of passion and faculty slumbered quiet there such heavenly melody dwelling in the heart of it a noble rough genuineness homely rustic honest true simplicity of strength with its lightningfire with its soft dewy pity like the old norse thor the peasantgod burnss brother gilbert a man of much sense and worth has told me that robert in his young days in spite of their hardship was usually the gayest of speech a fellow of infinite frolic laughter sense and heart far pleasanter to hear there stript cutting peats in the bog or suchlike than he ever afterwards knew him i can well believe it this basis of mirth fond gaillard as old marquis mirabeau calls it a primalelement of sunshine and joyfulness coupled with his other deep and earnest qualities is one of the most attractive characteristics of burns a large fund of hope dwells in him spite of his tragical history he is not a mourning man he shakes his sorrows gallantly aside bounds forth victorious over them it is as the lion shaking dewdrops from his mane as the swiftbounding horse that laughs at the shaking of the spear but indeed hope mirth of the sort like burnss are they not the outcome properly of warm generous affection such as is the beginning of all to every man you would think it strange if i called burns the most gifted british soul we had in all that century of his and yet i believe the day is coming when there will be little danger in saying so his writings all that he did under such obstructions are only a poor fragment of him professor stewart remarked very justly what indeed is true of all poets good for much that his poetry was not any particular faculty but the general result of a naturally vigorous original mind expressing itself in that way burnss gifts expressed in conversation are the theme of all that ever heard him all kinds of gifts from the gracefulest utterances of courtesy to the highest fire of passionate speech loud floods of mirth soft wailings of affection laconic emphasis clear piercing insight all was in him witty duchesses celebrate him as a man whose speech led them off their feet this is beautiful but still more beautiful that which mr lockhart has recorded which i have more than once alluded to how the waiters and ostlers at inns would get out of bed and come crowding to hear this man speak waiters and ostlers they too were men and here was a man i have heard much about his speech but one of the best things i ever heard of it was last year from a venerable gentleman long familiar with him that it was speech distinguished by always having something in it he spoke rather little than much this old man told me sat rather silent in those early days as in the company of persons above him and always when he did speak it was to throw new light on the matter i know not why any one should ever speak otherwise but if we look at his general force of soul his healthy robustness everyway the rugged downrightness penetration generous valour and manfulness that was in him where shall we readily find a bettergifted man among the great men of the eighteenth century i sometimes feel as if burns might be found to resemble mirabeau more than any other they differ widely in vesture yet look at them intrinsically there is the same burly thicknecked strength of body as of soul built in both cases on what the old marquis calls a fond gaillard by nature by course of breeding indeed by nation mirabeau has much more of bluster a noisy forward unresting man but the characteristic of mirabeau too is veracity and sense power of true insight superiority of vision the thing that he says is worth remembering it is a flash of insight into some object or other so do both these men speak the same raging passions capable too in both of manifesting themselves as the tenderest noble affections wit wild laughter energy directness sincerity these were in both the types of the two men are not dissimilar burns too could have governed debated in national assemblies politicised as few could alas the courage which had to exhibit itself in capture of smuggling schooners in the solway frith in keeping silence over so much where no good speech but only inarticulate rage was possible this might have bellowed forth ushers de brz and the like and made itself visible to all men in managing of kingdoms in ruling of great evermemorable epochs but they said to him reprovingly his official superiors said and wrote you are to work not think of your thinkingfaculty the greatest in this land we have no need you are to gauge beer there for that only are you wanted very notable and worth mentioning though we know what is to be said and answered as if thought power of thinking were not at all times in all places and situations of the world precisely the thing that was wanted the fatal man is he not always the unthinking man the man who cannot think and see but only grope and hallucinate and missee the nature of the thing he works with he missees it mistakes it as we say takes it for one thing and it is another thing and leaves him standing like a futility there he is the fatal man unutterably fatal put in the high places of men why complain of this say some strength is mournfully denied its arena that was true from of old doubtless and the worse for the arena answer i complaining profits little stating of the truth may profit that a europe with its french revolution just breaking out finds no need of a burns except for gauging beer is a thing i for one cannot rejoice at once more we have to say here that the chief quality of burns is the sincerity of him so in his poetry so in his life the song he sings is not of fantasticalities it is of a thing felt really there the prime merit of this as of all in him and of his life generally is truth the life of burns is what we may call a great tragic sincerity a sort of savage sincerity not cruel far from that but wild wrestling naked with the truth of things in that sense there is something of the savage in all great men heroworship odin burns well these men of letters too were not without a kind of heroworship but what a strange condition has that got into now the waiters and ostlers of scotch inns prying about the door eager to catch any word that fell from burns were doing unconscious reverence to the heroic johnson had his boswell for worshipper rousseau had worshippers enough princes calling on him in his mean garret the great the beautiful doing reverence to the poor moonstruck man for himself a most portentous contradiction the two ends of his life not to be brought into harmony he sits at the tables of grandees and has to copy music for his own living he cannot even get his music copied by dint of dining out says he i run the risk of dying by starvation at home for his worshippers too a most questionable thing if doing heroworship well or badly be the test of vital wellbeing or illbeing to a generation can we say that these generations are very firstrate and yet our heroic men of letters do teach govern are kings priests or what you like to call them intrinsically there is no preventing it by any means whatever the world has to obey him who thinks and sees in the world the world can alter the manner of that can either have it as blessed continuous summer sunshine or as unblessed black thunder and tornado with unspeakable difference of profit for the world the manner of it is very alterable the matter and fact of it is not alterable by any power under the sky light or failing that lightning the world can take its choice not whether we call an odin god prophet priest or what we call him but whether we believe the word he tells us there it all lies if it be a true word we shall have to believe it believing it we shall have to do it what name or welcome we give him or it is a point that concerns ourselves mainly it the new truth new deeper revealing of the secret of this universe is verily of the nature of a message from on high and must and will have itself obeyed my last remark is on that notablest phasis of burnss history his visit to edinburgh often it seems to me as if his demeanour there were the highest proof he gave of what a fund of worth and genuine manhood was in him if we think of it few heavier burdens could be laid on the strength of a man so sudden all common lionism which ruins innumerable men was as nothing to this it is as if napoleon had been made a king of not gradually but at once from the artillery lieutenancy in the regiment la fre burns still only in his twentyseventh year is no longer even a ploughman he is flying to the west indies to escape disgrace and a jail this month he is a ruined peasant his wages seven pounds a year and these gone from him next month he is in the blaze of rank and beauty handing down jewelled duchesses to dinner the cynosure of all eyes adversity is sometimes hard upon a man but for one man who can stand prosperity there are a hundred that will stand adversity i admire much the way in which burns met all this perhaps no man one could point out was ever so sorely tried and so little forgot himself tranquil unastonished not abashed not inflated neither awkwardness nor affectation he feels that he there is the man robert burns that the rank is but the guineastamp that the celebrity is but the candlelight which will show what man not in the least make him a better or other man alas it may readily unless he look to it make him a worse man a wretched inflated windbag inflated till he burst and become a dead lion for whom as some one has said there is no resurrection of the body worse than a living dog burns is admirable here and yet alas as i have observed elsewhere these lionhunters were the ruin and death of burns it was they that rendered it impossible for him to live they gathered round him in his farm hindered his industry no place was remote enough from them he could not get his lionism forgotten honestly as he was disposed to do so he falls into discontents into miseries faults the world getting ever more desolate for him health character peace of mind all gone solitary enough now it is tragical to think of these men came but to see him it was out of no sympathy with him nor no hatred to him they came to get a little amusement they got their amusement and the heros life went for it richter says in the island of sumatra there is a kind of lightchafers large fireflies which people stick upon spits and illuminate the ways with at night persons of condition can thus travel with a pleasant radiance which they much admire great honour to the fireflies but lecture vi the hero as king cromwell napoleon modern revolutionism friday nd may we come now to the last form of heroism that which we call kingship the commander over men he to whose will our wills are to be subordinated and loyally surrender themselves and find their welfare in doing so may be reckoned the most important of great men he is practically the summary for us of all the various figures of heroism priest teacher whatsoever of earthly or of spiritual dignity we can fancy to reside in a man embodies itself here to command over us to furnish us with constant practical teaching to tell us for the day and hour what we are to do he is called rex regulator roi our own name is still better king knning which means canning ableman numerous considerations pointing towards deep questionable and indeed unfathomable regions present themselves here on the most of which we must resolutely for the present forbear to speak at all as burke said that perhaps fair trial by jury was the soul of government and that all legislation administration parliamentary debating and the rest of it went on in order to bring twelve impartial men into a jurybox so by much stronger reason may i say here that the finding of your ableman and getting him invested with the symbols of ability with dignity worship worthship royalty kinghood or whatever we call it so that he may actually have room to guide according to his faculty of doing it is the business well or ill accomplished of all social procedure whatsoever in this world hustingsspeeches parliamentary motions reform bills french revolutions all mean at heart this or else nothing find in any country the ablest man that exists there raise him to the supreme place and loyally reverence him you have a perfect government for that country no ballotbox parliamentary eloquence voting constitutionbuilding or other machinery whatsoever can improve it a whit it is in the perfect state an ideal country the ablest man he means also the truesthearted justest the noblest man what he tells us to do must be precisely the wisest fittest that we could anywhere or anyhow learn the thing which it will in all ways behove us with right loyal thankfulness and nothing doubting to do our doing and life were then so far as government could regulate it well regulated that were the ideal of constitutions alas we know very well that ideals can never be completely embodied in practice ideals must ever lie a very great way off and we will right thankfully content ourselves with any not intolerable approximation thereto let no man as schiller says too querulously measure by a scale of perfection the meagre product of reality in this poor world of ours we will esteem him no wise man we will esteem him a sickly discontented foolish man and yet on the other hand it is never to be forgotten that ideals do exist that if they be not approximated to at all the whole matter goes to wreck infallibly no bricklayer builds a wall perfectly perpendicular mathematically this is not possible a certain degree of perpendicularity suffices him and he like a good bricklayer who must have done with his job leaves it so and yet if he sway too much from the perpendicular above all if he throw plummet and level quite away from him and pile brick on brick heedless just as it comes to hand such bricklayer i think is in a bad way he has forgotten himself but the law of gravitation does not forget to act on him he and his wall rushdown into confused welter of ruin this is the history of all rebellions french revolutions social explosions in ancient or modern times you have put the too unable man at the head of affairs the too ignoble unvaliant fatuous man you have forgotten that there is any rule or natural necessity whatever of putting the able man there brick must lie on brick as it may and can unable simulacrum of ability quack in a word must adjust himself with quack in all manner of administration of human things which accordingly lie unadministered fermenting into unmeasured masses of failure of indigent misery in the outward and in the inward or spiritual miserable millions stretchout the hand for their due supply and it is not there the law of gravitation acts natures laws do none of them forget to act the miserable millions burstforth into sansculottism or some other sort of madness bricks and bricklayers lie as a fatal chaos much sorry stuff written some hundred years ago or more about the divine right of kings moulders unread now in the public libraries of this country far be it from us to disturb the calm process by which it is disappearing harmlessly from the earth in those repositories at the same time not to let the immense rubbish go without leaving us as it ought some soul of it behind i will say that it did mean something something true which it is important for us and all men to keep in mind to assert that in whatever man you chose to lay hold of by this or the other plan of clutching at him and clapt a round piece of metal on the head of and called king there straightway came to reside a divine virtue so that he became a kind of god and a divinity inspired him with faculty and right to rule over you to all lengths this what can we do with this but leave it to rot silently in the public libraries but i will say withal and that is what these divineright men meant that in kings and in all human authorities and relations that men godcreated can form among each other there is verily either a divine right or else a diabolic wrong one or the other of these two for it is false altogether what the last sceptical century taught us that this world is a steamengine there is a god in this world and a godssanction or else the violation of such does lookout from all ruling and obedience from all moral acts of men there is no act more moral between men than that of rule and obedience woe to him that claims obedience when it is not due woe to him that refuses it when it is gods law is in that i say however the parchmentlaws may run there is a divine right or else a diabolic wrong at the heart of every claim that one man makes upon another it can do none of us harm to reflect on this in all the relations of life it will concern us in loyalty and royalty the highest of these i esteem the modern error that all goes by selfinterest and the checking and balancing of greedy knaveries and that in short there is nothing divine whatever in the association of men a still more despicable error natural as it is to an unbelieving century than that of a divine right in people called kings i say find me the true knning king or ableman and he has a divine right over me that we knew in some tolerable measure how to find him and that all men were ready to acknowledge his divine right when found this is precisely the healing which a sick world is everywhere in these ages seeking after the true king as guide of the practical has ever something of the pontiff in him guide of the spiritual from which all practice has its rise this too is a true saying that the king is head of the church but we will leave the polemic stuff of a dead century to lie quiet on its bookshelves certainly it is a fearful business that of having your ableman to seek and not knowing in what manner to proceed about it that is the worlds sad predicament in these times of ours they are times of revolution and have long been the bricklayer with his bricks no longer heedful of plummet or the law of gravitation have toppled tumbled and it all welters as we see but the beginning of it was not the french revolution that is rather the end we can hope it were truer to say the beginning was three centuries farther back in the reformation of luther that the thing which still called itself christian church had become a falsehood and brazenly went about pretending to pardon mens sins for metallic coined money and to do much else which in the everlasting truth of nature it did not now do here lay the vital malady the inward being wrong all outward went ever more and more wrong belief died away all was doubt disbelief the builder cast away his plummet said to himself what is gravitation brick lies on brick there alas does it not still sound strange to many of us the assertion that there is a gods truth in the business of godcreated men that all is not a kind of grimace an expediency diplomacy one knows not what from that first necessary assertion of luthers you selfstyled papa you are no father in god at all you are a chimera whom i know not how to name in polite language from that onwards to the shout which rose round camille desmoulins in the palaisroyal aux armes when the people had burstup against all manner of chimeras i find a natural historical sequence that shout too so frightful halfinfernal was a great matter once more the voice of awakened nations starting confusedly as out of nightmare as out of deathsleep into some dim feeling that life was real that godsworld was not an expediency and diplomacy infernal yes since they would not have it otherwise infernal since not celestial or terrestrial hollowness insincerity has to cease sincerity of some sort has to begin cost what it may reigns of terror horrors of french revolution or what else we have to return to truth here is a truth as i said a truth clad in hellfire since they would not but have it so a common theory among considerable parties of men in england and elsewhere used to be that the french nation had in those days as it were gone mad that the french revolution was a general act of insanity a temporary conversion of france and large sections of the world into a kind of bedlam the event had risen and raged but was a madness and nonentity gone now happily into the region of dreams and the picturesque to such comfortable philosophers the three days of july must have been a surprising phenomenon here is the french nation risen again in musketry and deathstruggle out shooting and being shot to make that same mad french revolution good the sons and grandsons of those men it would seem persist in the enterprise they do not disown it they will have it made good will have themselves shot if it be not made good to philosophers who had madeup their lifesystem on that madness quietus no phenomenon could be more alarming poor niebuhr they say the prussian professor and historian fell brokenhearted in consequence sickened if we can believe it and died of the three days it was surely not a very heroic death little better than racines dying because louis fourteenth looked sternly on him once the world had stood some considerable shocks in its time might have been expected to survive the three days too and be found turning on its axis after even them the three days told all mortals that the old french revolution mad as it might look was not a transitory ebullition of bedlam but a genuine product of this earth where we all live that it was verily a fact and that the world in general would do well everywhere to regard it as such truly without the french revolution one would not know what to make of an age like this at all we will hail the french revolution as shipwrecked mariners might the sternest rock in a world otherwise all of baseless sea and waves a true apocalypse though a terrible one to this false withered artificial time testifying once more that nature is preternatural if not divine then diabolic that semblance is not reality that it has to become reality or the world will takefire under it burn it into what it is namely nothing plausibility has ended empty routine has ended much has ended this as with a trump of doom has been proclaimed to all men they are the wisest who will learn it soonest long confused generations before it be learned peace impossible till it be the earnest man surrounded as ever with a world of inconsistencies can await patiently patiently strive to do his work in the midst of that sentence of death is written down in heaven against all that sentence of death is now proclaimed on the earth against it this he with his eyes may see and surely i should say considering the other side of the matter what enormous difficulties lie there and how fast fearfully fast in all countries the inexorable demand for solution of them is pressing on he may easily find other work to do than labouring in the sansculottic province at this time of day to me in these circumstances that of heroworship becomes a fact inexpressibly precious the most solacing fact one sees in the world at present there is an everlasting hope in it for the management of the world had all traditions arrangements creeds societies that men ever instituted sunk away this would remain the certainty of heroes being sent us our faculty our necessity to reverence heroes when sent it shines like a polestar through smokeclouds dustclouds and all manner of downrushing and conflagration heroworship would have sounded very strange to those workers and fighters in the french revolution not reverence for great men not any hope or belief or even wish that great men could again appear in the world nature turned into a machine was as if effete now could not any longer produce great men i can tell her she may giveup the trade altogether then we cannot do without great men but neither have i any quarrel with that of liberty and equality with the faith that wise great men being impossible a level immensity of foolish small men would suffice it was a natural faith then and there liberty and equality no authority needed any longer heroworship reverence for such authorities has proved false is itself a falsehood no more of it we have had such forgeries we will now trust nothing so many base plated coins passing in the market the belief has now become common that no gold any longer exists and even that we can do very well without gold i find this among other things in that universal cry of liberty and equality and find it very natural as matters then stood and yet surely it is but the transition from false to true considered as the whole truth it is false altogether the product of entire sceptical blindness as yet only struggling to see heroworship exists forever and everywhere not loyalty alone it extends from divine adoration down to the lowest practical regions of life bending before men if it is not to be a mere empty grimace better dispensed with than practised is heroworship a recognition that there does dwell in that presence of our brother something divine that every created man as novalis said is a revelation in the flesh they were poets too that devised all those graceful courtesies which make life noble courtesy is not a falsehood or grimace it need not be such and loyalty religious worship itself are still possible nay still inevitable may we not say moreover while so many of our late heroes have worked rather as revolutionary men that nevertheless every great man every genuine man is by the nature of him a son of order not of disorder it is a tragical position for a true man to work in revolutions he seems an anarchist and indeed a painful element of anarchy does encumber him at every step him to whose whole soul anarchy is hostile hateful his mission is order every mans is he is here to make what was disorderly chaotic into a thing ruled regular he is the missionary of order is not all work of man in this world a making of order the carpenter finds rough trees shapes them constrains them into square fitness into purpose and use we are all born enemies of disorder it is tragical for us all to be concerned in imagebreaking and downpulling for the great man more a man than we it is doubly tragical thus too all human things maddest french sansculottisms do and must work towards order i say there is not a man in them raging in the thickest of the madness but is impelled withal at all moments towards order his very life means that disorder is dissolution death no chaos but it seeks a centre to revolve round while man is man some cromwell or napoleon is the necessary finish of a sansculottism curious in those days when heroworship was the most incredible thing to every one how it does comeout nevertheless and assert itself practically in a way which all have to credit divine right take it on the great scale is found to mean divine might withal while old false formulas are getting trampled everywhere into destruction new genuine substances unexpectedly unfold themselves indestructible in rebellious ages when kingship itself seems dead and abolished cromwell napoleon stepforth again as kings the history of these men is what we have now to look at as our last phasis of heroism the old ages are brought back to us the manner in which kings were made and kingship itself first took rise is again exhibited in the history of these two we have had many civilwars in england wars of red and white roses wars of simon de montfort wars enough which are not very memorable but that war of the puritans has a significance which belongs to no one of the others trusting to your candour which will suggest on the other side what i have not room to say i will call it a section once more of that great universal war which alone makesup the true history of the world the war of belief against unbelief the struggle of men intent on the real essence of things against men intent on the semblances and forms of things the puritans to many seem mere savage iconoclasts fierce destroyers of forms but it were more just to call them haters of untrue forms i hope we know how to respect laud and his king as well as them poor laud seems to me to have been weak and illstarred not dishonest an unfortunate pedant rather than anything worse his dreams and superstitions at which they laugh so have an affectionate lovable kind of character he is like a collegetutor whose whole world is forms collegerules whose notion is that these are the life and safety of the world he is placed suddenly with that unalterable luckless notion of his at the head not of a college but of a nation to regulate the most complex deepreaching interests of men he thinks they ought to go by the old decent regulations nay that their salvation will lie in extending and improving these like a weak man he drives with spasmodic vehemence towards his purpose cramps himself to it heeding no voice of prudence no cry of pity he will have his collegerules obeyed by his collegians that first and till that nothing he is an illstarred pedant as i said he would have it the world was a college of that kind and the world was not that alas was not his doom stern enough whatever wrongs he did were they not all frightfully avenged on him it is meritorious to insist on forms religion and all else naturally clothes itself in forms everywhere the formed world is the only habitable one the naked formlessness of puritanism is not the thing i praise in the puritans it is the thing i pity praising only the spirit which had rendered that inevitable all substances clothe themselves in forms but there are suitable true forms and then there are untrue unsuitable as the briefest definition one might say forms which grow round a substance if we rightly understand that will correspond to the real nature and purport of it will be true good forms which are consciously put round a substance bad i invite you to reflect on this it distinguishes true from false in ceremonial form earnest solemnity from empty pageant in all human things there must be a veracity a natural spontaneity in forms in the commonest meeting of men a person making what we call set speeches is not he an offence in the mere drawingroom whatsoever courtesies you see to be grimaces prompted by no spontaneous reality within are a thing you wish to get away from but suppose now it were some matter of vital concernment some transcendent matter as divine worship is about which your whole soul struck dumb with its excess of feeling knew not how to form itself into utterance at all and preferred formless silence to any utterance there possible what should we say of a man coming forward to represent or utter it for you in the way of upholsterermummery such a man let him depart swiftly if he love himself you have lost your only son are mute struck down without even tears an importunate man importunately offers to celebrate funeral games for him in the manner of the greeks such mummery is not only not to be accepted it is hateful unendurable it is what the old prophets called idolatry worshipping of hollow shows what all earnest men do and will reject we can partly understand what those poor puritans meant laud dedicating that st catherine creeds church in the manner we have it described with his multiplied ceremonial bowings gesticulations exclamations surely it is rather the rigorous formal pedant intent on his collegerules than the earnest prophet intent on the essence of the matter puritanism found such forms insupportable trampled on such forms we have to excuse it for saying no form at all rather than such it stood preaching in its bare pulpit with nothing but the bible in its hand nay a man preaching from his earnest soul into the earnest souls of men is not this virtually the essence of all churches whatsoever the nakedest savagest reality i say is preferable to any semblance however dignified besides it will clothe itself with due semblance by and by if it be real no fear of that actually no fear at all given the living man there will be found clothes for him he will find himself clothes but the suitofclothes pretending that it is both clothes and man we cannot fight the french by threehundredthousand red uniforms there must be men in the inside of them semblance i assert must actually not divorce itself from reality if semblance do why then there must be men found to rebel against semblance for it has become a lie these two antagonisms at war here in the case of laud and the puritans are as old nearly as the world they went to fierce battle over england in that age and foughtout their confused controversy to a certain length with many results for all of us in the age which directly followed that of the puritans their cause or themselves were little likely to have justice done them charles second and his rochesters were not the kind of men you would set to judge what the worth or meaning of such men might have been that there could be any faith or truth in the life of a man was what these poor rochesters and the age they usheredin had forgotten puritanism was hung on gibbets like the bones of the leading puritans its work nevertheless went on accomplishing itself all true work of a man hang the author of it on what gibbet you like must and will accomplish itself we have our habeascorpus our free representation of the people acknowledgment wide as the world that all men are or else must shall and will become what we call free men men with their life grounded on reality and justice not on tradition which has become unjust and a chimera this in part and much besides this was the work of the puritans and indeed as these things became gradually manifest the character of the puritans began to clear itself their memories were one after another taken down from the gibbet nay a certain portion of them are now in these days as good as canonised eliot hampden pym nay ludlow hutchinson vane himself are admitted to be a kind of heroes political conscript fathers to whom in no small degree we owe what makes us a free england it would not be safe for anybody to designate these men as wicked now few puritans of note but find their apologists somewhere and have a certain reverence paid them by earnest men one puritan i think and almost he alone our poor cromwell seems to hang yet on the gibbet and find no hearty apologist anywhere him neither saint nor sinner will acquit of great wickedness a man of ability infinite talent courage and so forth but he betrayed the cause selfish ambition dishonesty duplicity a fierce coarse hypocritical tartufe turning all that noble struggle for constitutional liberty into a sorry farce played for his own benefit this and worse is the character they give of cromwell and then there come contrasts with washington and others above all with these noble pyms and hampdens whose noble work he stole for himself and ruined into a futility and deformity this view of cromwell seems to me the not unnatural product of a century like the eighteenth as we said of the valet so of the sceptic he does not know a hero when he sees him the valet expected purple mantles gilt sceptres bodyguards and flourishes of trumpets the sceptic of the eighteenth century looks for regulated respectable formulas principles or what else he may call them a style of speech and conduct which has got to seem respectable which can plead for itself in a handsome articulate manner and gain the suffrages of an enlightened sceptical eighteenth century it is at bottom the same thing that both the valet and he expect the garnitures of some acknowledged royalty which then they will acknowledge the king coming to them in the rugged unformulistic state shall be no king for my own share far be it from me to say or insinuate a word of disparagement against such characters as hampden eliot pym whom i believe to have been right worthy and useful men i have read diligently what books and documents about them i could come at with the honestest wish to admire to love and worship them like heroes but i am sorry to say if the real truth must be told with very indifferent success at bottom i found that it would not do they are very noble men these step along in their stately way with their measured euphemisms philosophies parliamentary eloquences shipmoneys monarchies of man a most constitutional unblamable dignified set of men but the heart remains cold before them the fancy alone endeavours to getup some worship of them what mans heart does in reality breakforth into any fire of brotherly love for these men they are become dreadfully dull men one breaksdown often enough in the constitutional eloquence of the admirable pym with his seventhly and lastly you find that it may be the admirablest thing in the world but that it is heavy heavy as lead barren as brickclay that in a word for you there is little or nothing now surviving there one leaves all these nobilities standing in their niches of honour the rugged outcast cromwell he is the man of them all in whom one still finds human stuff the great savage baresark he could write no euphemistic monarchy of man did not speak did not work with glib regularity had no straight story to tell for himself anywhere but he stood bare not cased in euphemistic coatofmail he grappled like a giant face to face heart to heart with the naked truth of things that after all is the sort of man for one i plead guilty to valuing such a man beyond all other sorts of men smoothshaven respectabilities not a few one finds that are not good for much small thanks to a man for keeping his hands clean who would not touch the work but with gloves on neither on the whole does this constitutional tolerance of the eighteenth century for the other happier puritans seem to be a very great matter one might say it is but a piece of formulism and scepticism like the rest they tell us it was a sorrowful thing to consider that the foundation of our english liberties should have been laid by superstition these puritans came forward with calvinistic incredible creeds antilaudisms westminster confessions demanding chiefly of all that they should have liberty to worship in their own way liberty to tax themselves that was the thing they should have demanded it was superstition fanaticism disgraceful ignorance of constitutional philosophy to insist on the other thing liberty to tax oneself not to payout money from your pocket except on reason shown no century i think but a rather barren one would have fixed on that as the first right of man i should say on the contrary a just man will generally have better cause than money in what shape soever before deciding to revolt against his government ours is a most confused world in which a good man will be thankful to see any kind of government maintain itself in a not insupportable manner and here in england to this hour if he is not ready to pay a great many taxes which he can see very small reason in it will not go well with him i think he must try some other climate than this taxgatherer money he will say take my money since you can and it is so desirable to you take it and take yourself away with it and leave me alone to my work here i am still here can still work after all the money you have taken from me but if they come to him and say acknowledge a lie pretend to say you are worshipping god when you are not doing it believe not the thing that you find true but the thing that i find or pretend to find true he will answer no by gods help no you may take my purse but i cannot have my moral self annihilated the purse is any highwaymans who might meet me with a loaded pistol but the self is mine and god my makers it is not yours and i will resist you to the death and revolt against you and on the whole front all manner of extremities accusations and confusions in defence of that really it seems to me the one reason which could justify revolting this of the puritans it has been the soul of all just revolts among men not hunger alone produced even the french revolution no but the feeling of the insupportable allpervading falsehood which had now embodied itself in hunger in universal material scarcity and nonentity and thereby become indisputably false in the eyes of all we will leave the eighteenth century with its liberty to tax itself we will not astonish ourselves that the meaning of such men as the puritans remained dim to it to men who believe in no reality at all how shall a real human soul the intensest of all realities as it were the voice of this worlds maker still speaking to us be intelligible what it cannot reduce into constitutional doctrines relative to taxing or other the like material interest gross palpable to the sense such a century will needs reject as an amorphous heap of rubbish hampdens pyms and shipmoney will be the theme of much constitutional eloquence striving to be fervid which will glitter if not as fire does then as ice does and the irreducible cromwell will remain a chaotic mass of madness hypocrisy and much else from of old i will confess this theory of cromwells falsity has been incredible to me nay i cannot believe the like of any great man whatever multitudes of great men figure in history as false selfish men but if we will consider it they are but figures for us unintelligible shadows we do not see into them as men that could have existed at all a superficial unbelieving generation only with no eye but for the surfaces and semblances of things could form such notions of great men can a great soul be possible without a conscience in it the essence of all real souls great or small no we cannot figure cromwell as a falsity and fatuity the longer i study him and his career i believe this the less why should we there is no evidence of it is it not strange that after all the mountains of calumny this man has been subject to after being represented as the very prince of liars who never or hardly ever spoke truth but always some cunning counterfeit of truth there should not yet have been one falsehood brought clearly home to him a prince of liars and no lie spoken by him not one that i could yet get sight of it is like pococke asking grotius where is your proof of mahomets pigeon no proof let us leave all these calumnious chimeras as chimeras ought to be left they are not portraits of the man they are distracted phantasms of him the joint product of hatred and darkness looking at the mans life with our own eyes it seems to me a very different hypothesis suggests itself what little we know of his earlier obscure years distorted as it has come down to us does it not all betoken an earnest affectionate sincere kind of man his nervous melancholic temperament indicates rather a seriousness too deep for him of those stories of spectres of the white spectre in broad daylight predicting that he should be king of england we are not bound to believe much probably no more than of the other black spectre or devil in person to whom the officer saw him sell himself before worcester fight but the mournful oversensitive hypochondriac humour of oliver in his young years is otherwise indisputably known the huntingdon physician told sir philip warwick himself he had often been sent for at midnight mr cromwell was full of hypochondria thought himself near dying and had fancies about the towncross these things are significant such an excitable deepfeeling nature in that rugged stubborn strength of his is not the symptom of falsehood it is the symptom and promise of quite other than falsehood the young oliver is sent to study law falls or is said to have fallen for a little period into some of the dissipations of youth but if so speedily repents abandons all this not much above twenty he is married settled as an altogether grave and quiet man he paysback what money he had won at gambling says the story he does not think any gain of that kind could be really his it is very interesting very natural this conversion as they well name it this awakening of a great true soul from the worldly slough to see into the awful truth of things to see that time and its shows all rested on eternity and this poor earth of ours was the threshold either of heaven or of hell olivers life at st ives or ely as a sober industrious farmer is it not altogether as that of a true and devout man he has renounced the world and its ways its prizes are not the thing that can enrich him he tills the earth he reads his bible daily assembles his servants round him to worship god he comforts persecuted ministers is fond of preachers nay can himself preach exhorts his neighbours to be wise to redeem the time in all this what hypocrisy ambition cant or other falsity the mans hopes i do believe were fixed on the other higher world his aim to get well thither by walking well through his humble course in this world he courts no notice what could notice here do for him ever in his great taskmasters eye it is striking too how he comesout once into public view he since no other is willing to come in resistance to a public grievance i mean in that matter of the bedford fens no one else will go to law with authority therefore he will that matter once settled he returns back into obscurity to his bible and his plough gain influence his influence is the most legitimate derived from personal knowledge of him as a just religious reasonable and determined man in this way he has lived till past forty old age is now in view of him and the earnest portal of death and eternity it was at this point that he suddenly became ambitious i do not interpret his parliamentary mission in that way his successes in parliament his successes through the war are honest successes of a brave man who has more resolution in the heart of him more light in the head of him than other men his prayers to god his spoken thanks to the god of victory who had preserved him safe and carried him forward so far through the furious clash of a world all set in conflict through desperatelooking envelopments at dunbar through the deathhail of so many battles mercy after mercy to the crowning mercy of worcester fight all this is good and genuine for a deephearted calvinistic cromwell only to vain unbelieving cavaliers worshipping not god but their own lovelocks frivolities and formalities living quite apart from contemplations of god living without god in the world need it seem hypocritical nor will his participation in the kings death involve him in condemnation with us it is a stern business killing of a king but if you once go to war with him it lies there this and all else lies there once at war you have made wager of battle with him it is he to die or else you reconciliation is problematic may be possible or far more likely is impossible it is now pretty generally admitted that the parliament having vanquished charles first had no way of making any tenable arrangement with him the large presbyterian party apprehensive now of the independents were most anxious to do so anxious indeed as for their own existence but it could not be the unhappy charles in those final hamptoncourt negotiations shows himself as a man fatally incapable of being dealt with a man who once for all could not and would not understand whose thought did not in any measure represent to him the real fact of the matter nay worse whose word did not at all represent his thought we may say this of him without cruelty with deep pity rather but it is true and undeniable forsaken there of all but the name of kingship he still finding himself treated with outward respect as a king fancied that he might playoff party against party and smuggle himself into his old power by deceiving both alas they both discovered that he was deceiving them a man whose word will not inform you at all what he means or will do is not a man you can bargain with you must get out of that mans way or put him out of yours the presbyterians in their despair were still for believing charles though found false unbelievable again and again not so cromwell for all our fighting says he we are to have a little bit of paper no in fact everywhere we have to note the decisive practical eye of this man how he drives towards the practical and practicable has a genuine insight into what is fact such an intellect i maintain does not belong to a false man the false man sees false shows plausibilities expediences the true man is needed to discern even practical truth cromwells advice about the parliaments army early in the contest how they were to dismiss their citytapsters flimsy riotous persons and choose substantial yeomen whose heart was in the work to be soldiers for them this is advice by a man who saw fact answers if you see into fact cromwells ironsides were the embodiment of this insight of his men fearing god and without any other fear no more conclusively genuine set of fighters ever trod the soil of england or of any other land neither will we blame greatly that word of cromwells to them which was so blamed if the king should meet me in battle i would kill the king why not these words were spoken to men who stood as before a higher than kings they had set more than their own lives on the cast the parliament may call it in official language a fighting for the king but we for our share cannot understand that to us it is no dilettante work no sleek officiality it is sheer rough death and earnest they have brought it to the callingforth of war horrid internecine fight man grappling with man in fireeyed rage the infernal element in man called forth to try it by that do that therefore since that is the thing to be done the successes of cromwell seem to me a very natural thing since he was not shot in battle they were an inevitable thing that such a man with the eye to see with the heart to dare should advance from post to post from victory to victory till the huntingdon farmer became by whatever name you might call him the acknowledged strongest man in england virtually the king of england requires no magic to explain it truly it is a sad thing for a people as for a man to fall into scepticism into dilettantism insincerity not to know a sincerity when they see it for this world and for all worlds what curse is so fatal the heart lying dead the eye cannot see what intellect remains is merely the vulpine intellect that a true king be sent them is of small use they do not know him when sent they say scornfully is this your king the hero wastes his heroic faculty in bootless contradiction from the unworthy and can accomplish little for himself he does accomplish a heroic life which is much which is all but for the world he accomplishes comparatively nothing the wild rude sincerity direct from nature is not glib in answering from the witnessbox in your smalldebt piepowder court he is scouted as a counterfeit the vulpine intellect detects him for being a man worth any thousand men the response your knox your cromwell gets is an argument for two centuries whether he was a man at all gods greatest gift to this earth is sneeringly flung away the miraculous talisman is a paltry plated coin not fit to pass in the shops as a common guinea lamentable this i say this must be remedied till this be remedied in some measure there is nothing remedied detect quacks yes do for heavens sake but know withal the men that are to be trusted till we know that what is all our knowledge how shall we even so much as detect for the vulpine sharpness which considers itself to be knowledge and detects in that fashion is far mistaken dupes indeed are many but of all dupes there is none so fatally situated as he who lives in undue terror of being duped the world does exist the world has truth in it or it would not exist first recognise what is true we shall then discern what is false and properly never till then know the men that are to be trusted alas this is yet in these days very far from us the sincere alone can recognise sincerity not a hero only is needed but a world fit for him a world not of valets the hero comes almost in vain to it otherwise yes it is far from us but it must come thank god it is visibly coming till it do come what have we ballotboxes suffrages french revolutions if we are as valets and do not know the hero when we see him what good are all these a heroic cromwell comes and for a hundredandfifty years he cannot have a vote from us why the insincere unbelieving world is the natural property of the quack and of the father of quacks and quackeries misery confusion unveracity are alone possible there by ballotboxes we alter the figure of our quack but the substance of him continues the valetworld has to be governed by the shamhero by the king merely dressed in kinggear it is his he is its in brief one of two things we shall either learn to know a hero a true governor and captain somewhat better when we see him or else go on to be forever governed by the unheroic had we ballotboxes clattering at every streetcorner there were no remedy in these poor cromwell great cromwell the inarticulate prophet prophet who could not speak rude confused struggling to utter himself with his savage depth with his wild sincerity and he looked so strange among the elegant euphemisms dainty little falklands didactic chillingworths diplomatic clarendons consider him an outer hull of chaotic confusion visions of the devil nervous dreams almost semimadness and yet such a clear determinate mansenergy working in the heart of that a kind of chaotic man the ray as of pure starlight and fire working in such an element of boundless hypochondria unformed black of darkness and yet withal this hypochondria what was it but the very greatness of the man the depth and tenderness of his wild affections the quantity of sympathy he had with things the quantity of insight he would yet get into the heart of things the mastery he would yet get over things this was his hypochondria the mans misery as mans misery always does came of his greatness samuel johnson too is that kind of man sorrowstricken halfdistracted the wide element of mournful black enveloping him wide as the world it is the character of a prophetic man a man with his whole soul seeing and struggling to see on this ground too i explain to myself cromwells reputed confusion of speech to himself the internal meaning was sunclear but the material with which he was to clothe it in utterance was not there he had lived silent a great unnamed sea of thought round him all his days and in his way of life little call to attempt naming or uttering that with his sharp power of vision resolute power of action i doubt not he could have learned to write books withal and speak fluently enough he did harder things than writing of books this kind of man is precisely he who is fit for doing manfully all things you will set him on doing intellect is not speaking and logicising it is seeing and ascertaining virtue virtus manhood herohood is not fairspoken immaculate regularity it is first of all what the germans well name it tugend taugend dowing or doughtiness courage and the faculty to do this basis of the matter cromwell had in him one understands moreover how though he could not speak in parliament he might preach rhapsodic preaching above all how he might be great in extempore prayer these are the free outpouring utterances of what is in the heart method is not required in them warmth depth sincerity are all that is required cromwells habit of prayer is a notable feature of him all his great enterprises were commenced with prayer in dark inextricablelooking difficulties his officers and he used to assemble and pray alternately for hours for days till some definite resolution rose among them some door of hope as they would name it disclosed itself consider that in tears in fervent prayers and cries to the great god to have pity on them to make his light shine before them they armed soldiers of christ as they felt themselves to be a little band of christian brothers who had drawn the sword against a great black devouring world not christian but mammonish devilish they cried to god in their straits in their extreme need not to forsake the cause that was his the light which now rose upon them how could a human soul by any means at all get better light was not the purpose so formed like to be precisely the best wisest the one to be followed without hesitation any more to them it was as the shining of heavens own splendour in the wastehowling darkness the pillar of fire by night that was to guide them on their desolate perilous way was it not such can a mans soul to this hour get guidance by any other method than intrinsically by that same devout prostration of the earnest struggling soul before the highest the giver of all light be such prayer a spoken articulate or be it a voiceless inarticulate one there is no other method hypocrisy one begins to be weary of all that they who call it so have no right to speak on such matters they never formed a purpose what one can call a purpose they went about balancing expediences plausibilities gathering votes advices they never were alone with the truth of a thing at all cromwells prayers were likely to be eloquent and much more than that his was the heart of a man who could pray but indeed his actual speeches i apprehend were not nearly so ineloquent incondite as they look we find he was what all speakers aim to be an impressive speaker even in parliament one who from the first had weight with that rude passionate voice of his he was always understood to mean something and men wished to know what he disregarded eloquence nay despised and disliked it spoke always without premeditation of the words he was to use the reporters too in those days seem to have been singularly candid and to have given the printer precisely what they found on their own notepaper and withal what a strange proof is it of cromwells being the premeditative evercalculating hypocrite acting a play before the world that to the last he took no more charge of his speeches how came he not to study his words a little before flinging them out to the public if the words were true words they could be left to shift for themselves but with regard to cromwells lying we will make one remark this i suppose or something like this to have been the nature of it all parties found themselves deceived in him each party understood him to be meaning this heard him even say so and behold he turnsout to have been meaning that he was cry they the chief of liars but now intrinsically is not all this the inevitable fortune not of a false man in such times but simply of a superior man such a man must have reticences in him if he walk wearing his heart upon his sleeve for daws to peck at his journey will not extend far there is no use for any mans takingup his abode in a house built of glass a man always is to be himself the judge how much of his mind he will show to other men even to those he would have work along with him there are impertinent inquiries made your rule is to leave the inquirer uninformed on that matter not if you can help it misinformed but precisely as dark as he was this could one hit the right phrase of response is what the wise and faithful man would aim to answer in such a case cromwell no doubt of it spoke often in the dialect of small subaltern parties uttered to them a part of his mind each little party thought him all its own hence their rage one and all to find him not of their party but of his own party was it his blame at all seasons of his history he must have felt among such people how if he explained to them the deeper insight he had they must either have shuddered aghast at it or believing it their own little compact hypothesis must have gone wholly to wreck they could not have worked in his province any more nay perhaps they could not now have worked in their own province it is the inevitable position of a great man among small men small men most active useful are to be seen everywhere whose whole activity depends on some conviction which to you is palpably a limited one imperfect what we call an error but would it be a kindness always is it a duty always or often to disturb them in that many a man doing loud work in the world stands only on some thin traditionality conventionality to him indubitable to you incredible break that beneath him he sinks to endless depths i might have my hand full of truth said fontenelle and open only my little finger and if this be the fact even in matters of doctrine how much more in all departments of practice he that cannot withal keep his mind to himself cannot practise any considerable thing whatever and we call it dissimulation all this what would you think of calling the general of an army a dissembler because he did not tell every corporal and private soldier who pleased to put the question what his thoughts were about everything cromwell i should rather say managed all this in a manner we must admire for its perfection an endless vortex of such questioning corporals rolled confusedly round him through his whole course whom he did answer it must have been as a great trueseeing man that he managed this too not one proved falsehood as i said not one of what man that ever wound himself through such a coil of things will you say so much but in fact there are two errors widely prevalent which pervert to the very basis our judgments formed about such men as cromwell about their ambition falsity and suchlike the first is what i might call substituting the goal of their career for the course and starting point of it the vulgar historian of a cromwell fancies that he had determined on being protector of england at the time when he was ploughing the marsh lands of cambridgeshire his career lay all mappedout a program of the whole drama which he then step by step dramatically unfolded with all manner of cunning deceptive dramaturgy as he went on the hollow scheming greek hypokrits or playactor that he was this is a radical perversion all but universal in such cases and think for an instant how different the fact is how much does one of us foresee of his own life short way ahead of us it is all dim an unwound skein of possibilities of apprehensions attemptabilities vaguelooming hopes this cromwell had not his life lying all in that fashion of program which he needed then with that unfathomable cunning of his only to enact dramatically scene after scene not so we see it so but to him it was in no measure so what absurdities would fallaway of themselves were this one undeniable fact kept honestly in view by history historians indeed will tell you that they do keep it in view but look whether such is practically the fact vulgar history as in this cromwells case omits it altogether even the best kinds of history only remember it now and then to remember it duly with rigorous perfection as in the fact it stood requires indeed a rare faculty rare nay impossible a very shakspeare for faculty or more than shakspeare who could enact a brothermans biography see with the brothermans eyes at all points of his course what things he saw in short know his course and him as few historians are like to do half or more of all the thickplied perversions which distort our image of cromwell will disappear if we honestly so much as try to represent them so in sequence as they were not in the lump as they are throwndown before us but a second error which i think the generality commit refers to this same ambition itself we exaggerate the ambition of great men we mistake what the nature of it is great men are not ambitious in that sense he is a small poor man that is ambitious so examine the man who lives in misery because he does not shine above other men who goes about producing himself pruriently anxious about his gifts and claims struggling to force everybody as it were begging everybody for gods sake to acknowledge him a great man and set him over the heads of men such a creature is among the wretchedest sights seen under this sun a great man a poor morbid prurient empty man fitter for the ward of a hospital than for a throne among men i advise you to keepout of his way he cannot walk on quiet paths unless you will look at him wonder at him write paragraphs about him he cannot live it is the emptiness of the man not his greatness because there is nothing in himself he hungers and thirsts that you would find something in him in good truth i believe no great man not so much as a genuine man who had health and real substance in him of whatever magnitude was ever much tormented in this way your cromwell what good could it do him to be noticed by noisy crowds of people god his maker already noticed him he cromwell was already there no notice would make him other than he already was till his hair was grown gray and life from the downhill slope was all seen to be limited not infinite but finite and all a measurable matter how it went he had been content to plough the ground and read his bible he in his old days could not support it any longer without selling himself to falsehood that he might ride in gilt carriages to whitehall and have clerks with bundles of papers haunting him decide this decide that which in utmost sorrow of heart no man can perfectly decide what could gilt carriages do for this man from of old was there not in his life a weight of meaning a terror and a splendour as of heaven itself his existence there as man set him beyond the need of gilding death judgment and eternity these already lay as the background of whatsoever he thought or did all his life lay begirt as in a sea of nameless thoughts which no speech of a mortal could name gods word as the puritan prophets of that time had read it this was great and all else was little to him to call such a man ambitious to figure him as the prurient windbag described above seems to me the poorest solecism such a man will say keep your gilt carriages and huzzaing mobs keep your redtape clerks your influentialities your important businesses leave me alone leave me alone there is too much of life in me already old samuel johnson the greatest soul in england in his day was not ambitious corsica boswell flaunted at public shows with printed ribbons round his hat but the great old samuel stayed at home the worldwide soul wraptup in its thoughts in its sorrows what could paradings and ribbons in the hat do for it ah yes i will say again the great silent men looking round on the noisy inanity of the world words with little meaning actions with little worth one loves to reflect on the great empire of silence the noble silent men scattered here and there each in his department silently thinking silently working whom no morning newspaper makes mention of they are the salt of the earth a country that has none or few of these is in a bad way like a forest which had no roots which had all turned into leaves and boughs which must soon wither and be no forest woe for us if we had nothing but what we can show or speak silence the great empire of silence higher than the stars deeper than the kingdoms of death it alone is great all else is small i hope we english will long maintain our grand talent pour le silence let others that cannot do without standing on barrelheads to spout and be seen of all the marketplace cultivate speech exclusively become a most green forest without roots solomon says there is a time to speak but also a time to keep silence of some great silent samuel not urged to writing as old samuel johnson says he was by want of money and nothing other one might ask why do not you too get up and speak promulgate your system found your sect truly he will answer i am continent of my thought hitherto happily i have yet had the ability to keep it in me no compulsion strong enough to speak it my system is not for promulgation first of all it is for serving myself to live by that is the great purpose of it to me and then the honour alas yes but as cato said of the statue so many statues in that forum of yours may it not be better if they ask where is catos statue but now by way of counterpoise to this of silence let me say that there are two kinds of ambition one wholly blamable the other laudable and inevitable nature has provided that the great silent samuel shall not be silent too long the selfish wish to shine over others let it be accounted altogether poor and miserable seekest thou great things seek them not this is most true and yet i say there is an irrepressible tendency in every man to develop himself according to the magnitude which nature has made him of to speakout to actout what nature has laid in him this is proper fit inevitable nay it is a duty and even the summary of duties for a man the meaning of life here on earth might be defined as consisting in this to unfold your self to work what thing you have the faculty for it is a necessity for the human being the first law of our existence coleridge beautifully remarks that the infant learns to speak by this necessity it feels we will say therefore to decide about ambition whether it is bad or not you have two things to take into view not the coveting of the place alone but the fitness of the man for the place withal that is the question perhaps the place was his perhaps he had a natural right and even obligation to seek the place mirabeaus ambition to be prime minister how shall we blame it if he were the only man in france that could have done any good there hopefuler perhaps had he not so clearly felt how much good he could do but a poor necker who could do no good and had even felt that he could do none yet sitting brokenhearted because they had flung him out and he was now quit of it well might gibbon mourn over him nature i say has provided amply that the silent great man shall strive to speak withal too amply rather fancy for example you had revealed to the brave old samuel johnson in his shroudedup existence that it was possible for him to do priceless divine work for his country and the whole world that the perfect heavenly law might be made law on this earth that the prayer he prayed daily thy kingdom come was at length to be fulfilled if you had convinced his judgment of this that it was possible practicable that he the mournful silent samuel was called to take a part in it would not the whole soul of the man have flamed up into a divine clearness into noble utterance and determination to act casting all sorrows and misgivings under his feet counting all affliction and contradiction small the whole dark element of his existence blazing into articulate radiance of light and lightning it were a true ambition this and think now how it actually was with cromwell from of old the sufferings of gods church true zealous preachers of the truth flung into dungeons whipt set on pillories their ears cropt off gods gospelcause trodden under foot of the unworthy all this had lain heavy on his soul long years he had looked upon it in silence in prayer seeing no remedy on earth trusting well that a remedy in heavens goodness would come that such a course was false unjust and could not last forever and now behold the dawn of it after twelve years silent waiting all england stirs itself there is to be once more a parliament the right will get a voice for itself inexpressible wellgrounded hope has come again into the earth was not such a parliament worth being a member of cromwell threw down his ploughs and hastened thither he spoke there rugged bursts of earnestness of a selfseen truth where we get a glimpse of them he worked there he fought and strove like a strong true giant of a man through cannontumult and all else on and on till the cause triumphed its once so formidable enemies all swept from before it and the dawn of hope had become clear light of victory and certainty that he stood there as the strongest soul of england the undisputed hero of all england what of this it was possible that the law of christs gospel could now establish itself in the world the theocracy which john knox in his pulpit might dream of as a devout imagination this practical man experienced in the whole chaos of most rough practice dared to consider as capable of being realised those that were highest in christs church the devoutest wisest men were to rule the land in some considerable degree it might be so and should be so was it not true gods truth and if true was it not then the very thing to do the strongest practical intellect in england dared to answer yes this i call a noble true purpose is it not in its own dialect the noblest that could enter into the heart of statesman or man for a knox to take it up was something but for a cromwell with his great sound sense and experience of what our world was history i think shows it only this once in such a degree i account it the culminating point of protestantism the most heroic phasis that faith in the bible was appointed to exhibit here below fancy it that it were made manifest to one of us how we could make the right supremely victorious over wrong and all that we had longed and prayed for as the highest good to england and all lands an attainable fact well i must say the vulpine intellect with its knowingness its alertness and expertness in detecting hypocrites seems to me a rather sorry business we have had one such statesman in england one man that i can get sight of who ever had in the heart of him any such purpose at all one man in the course of fifteen hundred years and this was his welcome he had adherents by the hundred or the ten opponents by the million had england rallied all round him why then england might have been a christian land as it is vulpine knowingness sits yet at its hopeless problem given a world of knaves to educe an honesty from their united action how cumbrous a problem you may see in chancery lawcourts and some other places till at length by heavens just anger but also by heavens great grace the matter begins to stagnate and this problem is becoming to all men a palpably hopeless one but with regard to cromwell and his purposes hume and a multitude following him come upon me here with an admission that cromwell was sincere at first a sincere fanatic at first but gradually became a hypocrite as things opened round him this of the fanatichypocrite is humes theory of it extensively applied since to mahomet and many others think of it seriously you will find something in it not much not all very far from all sincere hero hearts do not sink in this miserable manner the sun flings forth impurities gets balefully incrusted with spots but it does not quench itself and become no sun at all but a mass of darkness i will venture to say that such never befell a great deep cromwell i think never natures own lionhearted son antuslike his strength is got by touching the earth his mother lift him up from the earth lift him up into hypocrisy inanity his strength is gone we will not assert that cromwell was an immaculate man that he fell into no faults no insincerities among the rest he was no dilettante professor of perfections immaculate conducts he was a rugged orson rending his rough way through actual true work doubtless with many a fall therein insincerities faults very many faults daily and hourly it was too well known to him known to god and him the sun was dimmed many a time but the sun had not himself grown a dimness cromwells last words as he lay waiting for death are those of a christian heroic man broken prayers to god that he would judge him and this cause he since man could not in justice yet in pity they are most touching words he breathed out his wild great soul its toils and sins all ended now into the presence of his maker in this manner i for one will not call the man a hypocrite hypocrite mummer the life of him a mere theatricality empty barren quack hungry for the shouts of mobs the man had made obscurity do very well for him till his head was gray and now he was there as he stood recognised unblamed the virtual king of england cannot a man do without kings coaches and cloaks is it such a blessedness to have clerks forever pestering you with bundles of papers in red tape a simple diocletian prefers planting of cabbages a george washington no very immeasurable man does the like one would say it is what any genuine man could do and would do the instant his real work were out in the matter of kingship away with it let us remark meanwhile how indispensable everywhere a king is in all movements of men it is strikingly shown in this very war what becomes of men when they cannot find a chief man and their enemies can the scotch nation was all but unanimous in puritanism zealous and of one mind about it as in this english end of the island was far from being the case but there was no great cromwell among them poor tremulous hesitating diplomatic argyles and suchlike none of them had a heart true enough for the truth or durst commit himself to the truth they had no leader and the scattered cavalier party in that country had one montrose the noblest of all the cavaliers an accomplished gallanthearted splendid man what one may call the herocavalier well look at it on the one hand subjects without a king on the other a king without subjects the subjects without king can do nothing the subjectless king can do something this montrose with a handful of irish or highland savages few of them so much as guns in their hands dashes at the drilled puritan armies like a wild whirlwind sweeps them time after time some five times over from the field before him he was at one period for a short while master of all scotland one man but he was a man a million zealous men but without the one they against him were powerless perhaps of all the persons in that puritan struggle from first to last the single indispensable one was verily cromwell to see and dare and decide to be a fixed pillar in the welter of uncertainty a king among them whether they called him so or not precisely here however lies the rub for cromwell his other proceedings have all found advocates and stand generally justified but this dismissal of the rump parliament and assumption of the protectorship is what no one can pardon him he had fairly grown to be king in england chief man of the victorious party in england but it seems he could not do without the kings cloak and sold himself to perdition in order to get it let us see a little how this was england scotland ireland all lying now subdued at the feet of the puritan parliament the practical question arose what was to be done with it how will you govern these nations which providence in a wondrous way has givenup to your disposal clearly those hundred surviving members of the long parliament who sit there as supreme authority cannot continue for ever to sit what is to be done it was a question which theoretical constitutionbuilders may find easy to answer but to cromwell looking there into the real practical facts of it there could be none more complicated he asked of the parliament what it was they would decide upon it was for the parliament to say yet the soldiers too however contrary to formula they who had purchased this victory with their blood it seemed to them that they also should have something to say in it we will not for all our fighting have nothing but a little piece of paper we understand that the law of gods gospel to which he through us has given the victory shall establish itself or try to establish itself in this land for three years cromwell says this question had been sounded in the ears of the parliament they could make no answer nothing but talk talk perhaps it lies in the nature of parliamentary bodies perhaps no parliament could in such case make any answer but even that of talk talk nevertheless the question must and shall be answered you sixty men there becoming fast odious even despicable to the whole nation whom the nation already calls rump parliament you cannot continue to sit there who or what then is to follow free parliament right of election constitutional formulas of one sort or the other the thing is a hungry fact coming on us which we must answer or be devoured by it and who are you that prate of constitutional formulas rights of parliament you have had to kill your king to make prides purges to expel and banish by the law of the stronger whosoever would not let your cause prosper there are but fifty or threescore of you left there debating in these days tell us what we shall do not in the way of formula but of practicable fact how they did finally answer remains obscure to this day the diligent godwin himself admits that he cannot make it out the likeliest is that this poor parliament still would not and indeed could not dissolve and disperse that when it came to the point of actually dispersing they again for the tenth or twentieth time adjourned it and cromwells patience failed him but we will take the favourablest hypothesis ever started for the parliament the favourablest though i believe it is not the true one but too favourable according to this version at the uttermost crisis when cromwell and his officers were met on the one hand and the fifty or sixty rump members on the other it was suddenly told cromwell that the rump in its despair was answering in a very singular way that in their splenetic envious despair to keepout the army at least these men were hurrying through the house a kind of reform bill parliament to be chosen by the whole of england equable electoral division into districts free suffrage and the rest of it a very questionable or indeed for them an unquestionable thing reform bill free suffrage of englishmen why the royalists themselves silenced indeed but not exterminated perhaps outnumber us the great numerical majority of england was always indifferent to our cause merely looked at it and submitted to it it is in weight and force not by counting of heads that we are the majority and now with your formulas and reform bills the whole matter sorely won by our swords shall again launch itself to sea become a mere hope and likelihood small even as a likelihood and it is not a likelihood it is a certainty which we have won by gods strength and our own right hands and do now hold here cromwell walked down to these refractory members interrupted them in that rapid speed of their reform bill ordered them to begone and talk there no more can we not forgive him can we not understand him john milton who looked on it all near at hand could applaud him the reality had swept the formulas away before it i fancy most men who were realities in england might see into the necessity of that the strong daring man therefore has set all manner of formulas and logical superficialities against him has dared appeal to the genuine fact of this england whether it will support him or not it is curious to see how he struggles to govern in some constitutional way find some parliament to support him but cannot his first parliament the one they call bareboness parliament is so to speak a convocation of the notables from all quarters of england the leading ministers and chief puritan officials nominate the men most distinguished by religious reputation influence and attachment to the true cause these are assembled to shapeout a plan they sanctioned what was past shaped as they could what was to come they were scornfully called bareboness parliament the mans name it seems was not barebones but barbone a good enough man nor was it a jest their work it was a most serious reality a trial on the part of these puritan notables how far the law of christ could become the law of this england there were men of sense among them men of some quality men of deep piety i suppose the most of them were they failed it seems and broke down endeavouring to reform the court of chancery they dissolved themselves as incompetent deliveredup their power again into the hands of the lordgeneral cromwell to do with it what he liked and could what will he do with it the lordgeneral cromwell commanderin chief of all the forces raised and to be raised he hereby sees himself at this unexampled juncture as it were the one available authority left in england nothing between england and utter anarchy but him alone such is the undeniable fact of his position and englands there and then what will he do with it after deliberation he decides that he will accept it will formally with public solemnity say and vow before god and men yes the fact is so and i will do the best i can with it protectorship instrument of government these are the external forms of the thing workedout and sanctioned as they could in the circumstances be by the judges by the leading official people council of officers and persons of interest in the nation and as for the thing itself undeniably enough at the pass matters had now come to there was no alternative but anarchy or that puritan england might accept it or not but puritan england was in real truth saved from suicide thereby i believe the puritan people did in an inarticulate grumbling yet on the whole grateful and real way accept this anomalous act of olivers at least he and they together made it good and always better to the last but in their parliamentary articulate way they had their difficulties and never knew fully what to say to it olivers second parliament properly his first regular parliament chosen by the rule laiddown in the instrument of government did assemble and worked but got before long into bottomless questions as to the protectors right as to usurpation and so forth and had at the earliest legal day to be dismissed cromwells concluding speech to these men is a remarkable one so likewise to his third parliament in similar rebuke for their pedantries and obstinacies most rude chaotic all these speeches are but most earnestlooking you would say it was a sincere helpless man not used to speak the great inorganic thought of him but to act it rather a helplessness of utterance in such bursting fulness of meaning he talks much about births of providence all these changes so many victories and events were not forethoughts and theatrical contrivances of men of me or of men it is blind blasphemers that will persist in calling them so he insists with a heavy sulphurous wrathful emphasis on this as he well might as if a cromwell in that dark huge game he had been playing the world wholly thrown into chaos round him had foreseen it all and played it all off like a precontrived puppetshow by wood and wire these things were foreseen by no man he says no man could tell what a day would bring forth they were births of providence gods finger guided us on and we came at last to clear height of victory gods cause triumphant in these nations and you as a parliament could assemble together and say in what manner all this could be organised reduced into rational feasibility among the affairs of men you were to help with your wise counsel in doing that you have had such an opportunity as no parliament in england ever had christs law the right and true was to be in some measure made the law of this land in place of that you have got into your idle pedantries constitutionalities bottomless cavillings and questionings about written laws for my coming here and would send the whole matter into chaos again because i have no notarys parchment but only gods voice from the battlewhirlwind for being president among you that opportunity is gone and we know not when it will return you have had your constitutional logic and mammons law not christs law rules yet in this land god be judge between you and me these are his final words to them take you your constitutionformulas in your hand and i my informal struggles purposes realities and acts and god be judge between you and me we said above what shapeless involved chaotic things the printed speeches of cromwell are wilfully ambiguous unintelligible say the most a hypocrite shrouding himself in confused jesuitic jargon to me they do not seem so i will say rather they afforded the first glimpses i could ever get into the reality of this cromwell nay into the possibility of him try to believe that he means something search lovingly what that may be you will find a real speech lying imprisoned in these broken rude tortuous utterances a meaning in the great heart of this inarticulate man you will for the first time begin to see that he was a man not an enigmatic chimera unintelligible to you incredible to you the histories and biographies written of this cromwell written in shallow sceptical generations that could not know or conceive of a deep believing man are far more obscure than cromwells speeches you look through them only into the infinite vague of black and the inane heats and jealousies says lord clarendon himself heats and jealousies mere crabbed whims theories and crochets these induced slow sober quiet englishmen to lay down their ploughs and work and fly into red fury of confused war against the bestconditioned of kings try if you can find that true scepticism writing about belief may have great gifts but it is really ultra vires there it is blindness layingdown the laws of optics cromwells third parliament split on the same rock as his second ever the constitutional formula how came you there show us some notary parchment blind pedants why surely the same power which makes you a parliament that and something more made me a protector if my protectorship is nothing what in the name of wonder is your parliamenteership a reflex and creation of that parliaments having failed there remained nothing but the way of despotism military dictators each with his district to coerce the royalists and other gainsayers to govern them if not by act of parliament then by the sword formula shall not carry it while the reality is here i will go on protecting oppressed protestants abroad appointing just judges wise managers at home cherishing true gospel ministers doing the best i can to make england a christian england greater than old rome the queen of protestant christianity i since you will not help me i while god leaves me life why did he not give it up retire into obscurity again since the law would not acknowledge him cry several that is where they mistake for him there was no giving of it up prime ministers have governed countries pitt pombal choiseul and their word was a law while it held but this prime minister was one that could not get resigned let him once resign charles stuart and the cavaliers waited to kill him to kill the cause and him once embarked there is no retreat no return this prime minister could retire nowhither except into his tomb one is sorry for cromwell in his old days his complaint is incessant of the heavy burden providence has laid on him heavy which he must bear till death old colonel hutchinson as his wife relates it hutchinson his old battlemate coming to see him on some indispensable business much against his will cromwell follows him to the door in a most fraternal domestic conciliatory style begs that he would be reconciled to him his old brother in arms says how much it grieves him to be misunderstood deserted by true fellowsoldiers dear to him from of old the rigorous hutchinson cased in his republican formula sullenly goes his way and the mans head now white his strong arm growing weary with its long work i think always too of his poor mother now very old living in that palace of his a right brave woman as indeed they lived all an honest godfearing household there if she heard a shot go off she thought it was her son killed he had to come to her at least once a day that she might see with her own eyes that he was yet living the poor old motherwhat had this man gained what had he gained he had a life of sore strife and toil to his last day fame ambition place in history his dead body was hung in chains his place in history place in history forsooth has been a place of ignominy accusation blackness and disgrace and here this day who knows if it is not rash in me to be among the first that ever ventured to pronounce him not a knave and a liar but a genuinely honest man peace to him did he not in spite of all accomplish much for us we walk smoothly over his great rough heroic life stepover his body sunk in the ditch there we need not spurn it as we step on it let the hero rest it was not to mens judgment that he appealed nor have men judged him very well precisely a century and a year after this of puritanism had got itself hushedup into decent composure and its results made smooth in there brokeout a far deeper explosion much more difficult to hushup known to all mortals and like to be long known by the name of french revolution it is properly the third and final act of protestantism the explosive confused return of mankind to reality and fact now that they were perishing of semblance and sham we call our english puritanism the second act well then the bible is true let us go by the bible in church said luther in church and state said cromwell let us go by what actually is gods truth men have to return to reality they cannot live on semblance the french revolution or third act we may well call the final one for lower than that savage sansculottism men cannot go they stand there on the nakedest haggard fact undeniable in all seasons and circumstances and may and must begin again confidently to buildup from that the french explosion like the english one got its king who had no notary parchment to show for himself we have still to glance for a moment at napoleon our second modern king napoleon does by no means seem to me so great a man as cromwell his enormous victories which reached over all europe while cromwell abode mainly in our little england are but as the high stilts on which the man is seen standing the stature of the man is not altered thereby i find in him no such sincerity as in cromwell only a far inferior sort no silent walking through long years with the awful unnamable of this universe walking with god as he called it and faith and strength in that alone latent thought and valour content to lie latent then burst out as in blaze of heavens lightning napoleon lived in an age when god was no longer believed the meaning of all silence latency was thought to be nonentity he had to begin not out of the puritan bible but out of poor sceptical encyclopdies this was the length the man carried it meritorious to get so far his compact prompt everyway articulate character is in itself perhaps small compared with our great chaotic inarticulate cromwells instead of dumb prophet struggling to speak we have a portentous mixture of the quack withal humes notion of the fanatichypocrite with such truth as it has will apply much better to napoleon than it did to cromwell to mahomet or the like where indeed taken strictly it has hardly any truth at all an element of blamable ambition shows itself from the first in this man gets the victory over him at last and involves him and his work in ruin false as a bulletin became a proverb in napoleons time he makes what excuse he could for it that it was necessary to mislead the enemy to keep up his own mens courage and so forth on the whole there are no excuses a man in no case has liberty to tell lies it had been in the longrun better for napoleon too if he had not told any in fact if a man have any purpose reaching beyond the hour and day meant to be found extant next day what good can it ever be to promulgate lies the lies are foundout ruinous penalty is exacted for them no man will believe the liar next time even when he speaks truth when it is of the last importance that he be believed the old cry of wolf a lie is nothing you cannot of nothing make something you make nothing at last and lose your labour into the bargain yet napoleon had a sincerity we are to distinguish between what is superficial and what is fundamental in insincerity across these outer manoeuvrings and quackeries of his which were many and most blamable let us discern withal that the man had a certain instinctive ineradicable feeling for reality and did base himself upon fact so long as he had any basis he has an instinct of nature better than his culture was his savans bourrienne tells us in that voyage to egypt were one evening busily occupied arguing that there could be no god they had proved it to their satisfaction by all manner of logic napoleon looking up into the stars answers very ingenious messieurs but who made all that the atheistic logic runsoff from him like water the great fact stares him in the face who made all that so too in practice he as every man that can be great or have victory in this world sees through all entanglements the practical heart of the matter drives straight towards that when the steward of his tuileries palace was exhibiting the new upholstery with praises and demonstration how glorious it was and how cheap withal napoleon making little answer asked for a pair of scissors clipt one of the gold tassels from a windowcurtain put it in his pocket and walked on some days afterwards he produced it at the right moment to the horror of his upholstery functionary it was not gold but tinsel in saint helena it is notable how he still to his last days insists on the practical the real why talk and complain above all why quarrel with one another there is no result in it it comes to nothing that one can do say nothing if one can do nothing he speaks often so to his poor discontented followers he is like a piece of silent strength in the middle of their morbid querulousness there and accordingly was there not what we can call a faith in him genuine so far as it went that this new enormous democracy asserting itself here in the french revolution is an insuppressible fact which the whole world with its old forces and institutions cannot put down this was a true insight of his and took his conscience and enthusiasm along with it a faith and did he not interpret the dim purport of it well la carrire ouverte aux talens the implements to him who can handle them this actually is the truth and even the whole truth it includes whatever the french revolution or any revolution could mean napoleon in his first period was a true democrat and yet by the nature of him fostered too by his military trade he knew that democracy if it were a true thing at all could not be an anarchy the man had a hearthatred for anarchy on that twentieth of june bourrienne and he sat in a coffeehouse as the mob rolled by napoleon expresses the deepest contempt for persons in authority that they do not restrain this rabble on the tenth of august he wonders why there is no man to command these poor swiss they would conquer if there were such a faith in democracy yet hatred of anarchy it is that carries napoleon through all his great work through his brilliant italian campaigns onwards to the peace of leoben one would say his inspiration is triumph to the french revolution assertion of it against these austrian simulacra that pretend to call it a simulacrum withal however he feels and has a right to feel how necessary a strong authority is how the revolution cannot prosper or last without such to bridlein that great devouring selfdevouring french revolution to tame it so that its intrinsic purpose can be made good that it may become organic and be able to live among other organisms and formed things not as a wasting destruction alone is not this still what he partly aimed at as the true purport of his life nay what he actually managed to do through wagrams austerlitzes triumph after triumph he triumphed so far there was an eye to see in this man a soul to dare and do he rose naturally to be the king all men saw that he was such the common soldiers used to say on the march these babbling avocats up at paris all talk and no work what wonder it runs all wrong we shall have to go and put our petit caporal there they went and put him there they and france at large chiefconsulship emperorship victory over europe till the poor lieutenant of la fre not unnaturally might seem to himself the greatest of all men that had been in the world for some ages but at this point i think the fatal charlatanelement got the upper hand he apostatised from his old faith in facts took to believing in semblances strove to connect himself with austrian dynasties popedoms with the old false feudalities which he once saw clearly to be false considered that he would found his dynasty and so forth that the enormous french revolution meant only that the man was givenup to strong delusion that he should believe a lie a fearful but most sure thing he did not know true from false now when he looked at them the fearfulest penalty a man pays for yielding to untruth of heart self and false ambition had now become his god selfdeception once yielded to all other deceptions follow naturally more and more what a paltry patchwork of theatrical papermantles tinsel and mummery had this man wrapt his own great reality in thinking to make it more real thereby his hollow popesconcordat pretending to be a reestablishment of catholicism felt by himself to be the method of extirpating it la vaccine de la religion his ceremonial coronations consecrations by the old italian chimera in notredame wanting nothing to complete the pomp of it as augereau said nothing but the halfmillion of men who had died to put an end to all that cromwells inauguration was by the sword and bible what we must call a genuinely true one sword and bible were borne before him without any chimera were not these the real emblems of puritanism its true decoration and insignia it had used them both in a very real manner and pretended to stand by them now but this poor napoleon mistook he believed too much in the dupeability of men saw no fact deeper in men than hunger and this he was mistaken like a man that should build upon cloud his house and he fall down in confused wreck and depart out of the world alas in all of us this charlatanelement exists and might be developed were the temptation strong enough lead us not into temptation but it is fatal i say that it be developed the thing into which it enters as a cognisable ingredient is doomed to be altogether transitory and however huge it may look is in itself small napoleons working accordingly what was it with all the noise it made a flash as of gunpowder widespread a blazingup as of dry heath for an hour the whole universe seems wrapt in smoke and flame but only for an hour it goes out the universe with its old mountains and streams its stars above and kind soil beneath is still there the duke of weimar told his friends always to be of courage this napoleonism was unjust a falsehood and could not last it is true doctrine the heavier this napoleon trampled on the world holding it tyrannously down the fiercer would the worlds recoil against him be one day injustice pays itself with frightful compoundinterest i am not sure but he had better have lost his best park of artillery or had his best regiment drowned in the sea than shot that poor german bookseller palm it was a palpable tyrannous murderous injustice which no man let him paint an inch thick could makeout to be other it burnt deep into the hearts of men it and the like of it suppressed fire flashed in the eyes of men as they thought of it waiting their day which day came germany rose round him what napoleon did will in the longrun amount to what he did justly what nature with her laws will sanction to what of reality was in him to that and nothing more the rest was all smoke and waste la carrire ouverte aux talens that great true message which has yet to articulate and fulfil itself everywhere he left in a most inarticulate state he was a great bauche a rudedraught never completed as indeed what great man is other left in too rude a state alas his notions of the world as he expresses them there at st helena are almost tragical to consider he seems to feel the most unaffected surprise that it has all gone so that he is flungout on the rock here and the world is still moving on its axis france is great and allgreat and at bottom he is france england itself he says is by nature only an appendage of france another isle of oleron to france so it was by nature by napoleonnature and yet look how in fact here am i he cannot understand it inconceivable that the reality has not corresponded to his program of it that france was not allgreat that he was not france strong delusion that he should believe the thing to be which is not the compact clearseeing decisive italian nature of him strong genuine which he once had has enveloped itself halfdissolved itself in a turbid atmosphere of french fanfaronade the world was not disposed to be troddendown underfoot to be bound into masses and built together as he liked for a pedestal to france and him the world had quite other purposes in view napoleons astonishment is extreme but alas what help now he had gone that way of his and nature also had gone her way having once parted with reality he tumbles helpless in vacuity no rescue for him he had to sink there mournfully as man seldom did and break his great heart and die this poor napoleon a great implement too soon wasted till it was useless our last great man our last in a double sense for here finally these wide roamings of ours through so many times and places in search and study of heroes are to terminate i am sorry for it there was pleasure for me in this business if also much pain it is a great subject and a most grave and wide one this which not to be too grave about it i have named heroworship it enters deeply as i think into the secret of mankinds ways and vitalest interests in this world and is well worth explaining at present with six months instead of six days we might have done better i promised to breakground on it i know not whether i have even managed to do that i have had to tear it up in the rudest manner in order to get into it at all often enough with these abrupt utterances thrownout isolated unexplained has your tolerance been put to the trial tolerance
