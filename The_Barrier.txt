necia there wasnt any fun in things without you poleon followed her with his eyes an dats de end of it all he mused five year ive wait an jus for dis let me out of here the girl demanded imperiously the combatants were dragged apart i got you bennett cried the trader hoarsely your magic is no good necia saw runnion raise his gun and without thought of her own safety threw herself upon him the barrier chapter i the last frontier many men were in debt to the trader at flambeau and many counted him as a friend the latter never reasoned why except that he had done them favors and in the north that counts for much perhaps they built likewise upon the fact that he was ever the same to all and that in days of plenty or in times of famine his store was open to every man and all received the same measure nor did he raise his prices when the boats were late they recalled one bleak and blustery autumn when the steamer sank at the lower ramparts taking with her all their winters food how he eked out his scanty stock dealing to each and every one his portion month by month they remembered well the bitter winter that followed when the spectre of famine haunted their cabins and when for endless periods they cinched their belts and cursed and went hungry to sleep accepting day by day the rations doled out to them by the grim gray man at the log store some of them had moneybelts weighted low with gold washed from the bars at forty mile and there were others who had wandered in from the koyukuk with the first frosts footsore and dragging the legs of their skin boots eaten to the ankle and the taste of dog meat still in their mouths broken and dispirited these had fared as well through that desperate winter as their brothers from upriver and received pound for pound of musty flour strip for strip of rusty bacon lump for lump of precious sugar moreover the price of no single thing had risen throughout the famine some of them to this day owed bills at old man gales of which they dared not think but every fall and every spring they came again and told of their disappointment and every time they fared back into the hills bearing another outfit for which he rendered no account not even when the debts grew year by year not even to no creek lee the most unlucky of them all who said that a curse lay on him so that when a paystreak heard him coming it got up and moved away and hid itself there were some who had purposely shirked a reckoning in years past but these were few and their finish had been of a nature to discourage a similar practice on the part of others and of a nature moreover to lead good men to care for the trader and for his methods he mixed in no mans business he took and paid his dues unfalteringly he spoke in a level voice and he smiled but rarely he gazed at a stranger once and weighed him carefully thereafter his eyes sought the distances again as if in search of some visitor whom he knew or hoped or feared would come therefore men judged he had lived as strong men live and were glad to call him friend this day he stood in the door of his post staring up the sunlit river absorbing the warmth of the arctic afternoon the yukon swept down around the great bend beneath the high cut banks and past the little town disappearing behind the wooded point below which masked the upcoming steamers till one heard the sighing labor of their stacks before he saw their smoke it was a muddy rushing giant bearing a burden of sand and silt so that one might hear it hiss and grind by stooping at its edge to listen but the slanting sun this afternoon made it appear like a boiling flood of molten gold which issued silently out of a land of mystery and vanished into a valley of forgetfulness at least so the trader fancied and found himself wishing that it might carry away on its bosom the heavy trouble which weighed him down and bring in its place forgetfulness of all that had gone before instead however it seemed to hurry with news of those strange doings upriver news that every downcoming steamboat verified for years he had known that some day this thing would happen that some day this isolation would be broken that some day great hordes of men would overrun this unknown land bringing with them that which he feared to meet that which had made him what he was and now that the time had come he was unprepared the sound of shouting caused him to turn his head downstream a thousand yards away men were raising a flagstaff made from the trunk of a slender fir from which the bark had been stripped heaving on their tackle as they sang in unison they stood well out upon the rivers bank before a group of wellmade houses the peeled timbers of which shone yellow in the sun he noted the symmetrical arrangement of the buildings noted the space about them that had been smoothed for a drillground and from which the stumps had been removed noted that the men wore suits of blue and noted in particular the figure of an officer commanding them the lines about the traders mouth deepened and his heavy brows contracted that means the law he murmured half aloud while in his voice was no trace of pleasure nor of that interest which good men are wont to show at sight of the flag the last frontier is gone the trail ends here he stood so meditating sombrely till the fragment of a song hummed lightly by a girl fell pleasantly on his ears whereupon the shadows vanished from his face and he turned expectantly the edges of his teeth showing beneath his mustache the corners of his eyes wrinkling with pleasure the sight was good to him for the girl approaching down the trail was like some wood sprite lightfooted slender and dark with twin braids of hair to her waist framing an oval face colored by the wind and sun she was very beautiful and a great fever surged up through the old mans veins till he gripped the boards at his side and bit sharply at the pipe between his teeth the salmonberries are ripe she announced and the hills back of the village are pink with them i took constantines squaw with me and we picked quarts and quarts i ate them all her laughter was like the tinkle of silver bells her head thrown back as she laughed gayly displayed a throat rounded and full and smooth and tanned to the hue of her windbeaten cheeks every move of her graceful body was unrestrained and flowing with a hint of indian freedom about it beaded and trimmed like a native princess her garments manifested an ornature that spoke of savagery yet they were neatly cut and held to the pattern of the whites constantine was drunk again last night and i had to give him a talking to when we came back oh but i laid him out hes frightened to death of me when im angry she furrowed her brow in a scowl the daintiest most ridiculous pucker of a brow that ever man saw and drew her red lips into an angry pout as she recounted her temperance talk till the trader broke in his voice very soft his grayblue eyes as tender as those of a woman its good to have you home again necia the old sun dont shine as bright when youre away and when it rains it seems like the moss and the grass and the little trees was crying for you i reckon everything weeps when youre gone girl everything except your old dad and sometimes he feels like hed have to bust out and join the rest of them he seated himself upon the worn sprucelog steps and the girl settled beside him and snuggled against his knee i missed you dreadfully daddy she said it seemed as if those days at the mission would never end father barnum and the others were very kind and i studied hard but there wasnt any fun in things without you i reckon you know as much as a priest now dont you oh lots more she said gravely you see i am a woman he nodded reflectively so you are i keep forgetting that their faces were set towards the west where the low sun hung over a ragged range of hills topped with everlasting white the great valley dark with an untrodden wilderness of birch and spruce and alder lay on this side sombre and changeless like a great darkgreen mat too large for its restingplace its edges turned up towards the line of unmelting snow beyond were other ranges thrust skyward in a magnificent confusion while still to the farther side lay the purple valley of the koyukuk a valley that called insistently to restless men welcoming them in the spring and sending them back in the late summer tired and haggard with the hunger of the north each year a tithe remained behind the toll of the trackless places but the rest went back again and again and took new brothers with them did you like the books i sent you with poleon when he went down to the coast i borrowed them from shakespeare george the girl laughed of course i did that is all but one of them which one i think it was called the age of reason or something like that i didnt get a good look at it for father barnum shrieked when he saw it then snatched it as if it were afire he carried it down to the river with the tongs hm now that i think of it said the old man shakespeare grinned when he gave it to me you see poleon aint much better on the read than i am so we never noticed what kind of a book it was when will poleon get back do you suppose most any day now unless the dawson dancehalls are too much for him it wont take him long to sell our skins if what i hear is true what is that about these cheechakos they say there are thousands of tenderfeet up there and more coming in every day oh if i had only been here in time to go with him breathed the girl i never saw a city it must be just like seattle or new york gale shook his head no theres considerable difference some time ill take you out to the states and let you see the world maybe he uttered the last word in an undertone as if in selfdebate but the girl was too excited to notice you will take mother too and the kiddies wont you of course oh i i the attempt to express what this prospect meant to her was beyond her girlish rapture but her parted lips and shining eyes told the story to gale and poleon must go too we cant go anywhere without him the old man smiled down upon her in reassurance i wonder what hell say when he finds the soldiers have come i wonder if hell like it gale turned his eyes downstream to the barracks and noted that the long flagstaff had at last been erected even as he looked he saw a bundle mounting towards its tip and then beheld the stars and stripes flutter out in the air while the men below cheered noisily it was some time before he answered poleon doret is like the rest of us men up here in the north we have taken care of ourselves so far and i guess were able to keep it up without the help of a smoothfaced yankee kid for guardian lieutenant burrell isnt a yankee said necia he is a bluegrass man he comes from kentucky her father grunted contemptuously i might have known it those rebels are a cultus lazy lot a regular male man with any ginger in him would shed his coat and go to work instead of wearing his clothes buttoned up all day it dont take much savvy to run a handful of thirteendollaramonth soldiers necia stirred a bit restlessly and the trader continued it aint mans work its loafing if he tries to boss us hell get quite a surprise he wont try to boss you he has been sent here to build a military post and to protect the miners in their own selfgovernment he wont take any part in their affairs as long as they are conducted peaceably being at a loss for an answer to this unexpected defence the old man grunted again with added contempt while his daughter continued this rush to the upper country has brought in all sorts of people good bad and worse and the soldiers have been sent to prevent trouble and to hold things steady till the law can be established the canadian mounted police are sending all their worst characters downriver and our soldiers have been scattered among the american camps for our protection i think its fine where did you learn all this lieutenant burrell told me she replied at which her father regarded her keenly she could not see the curious look in his eyes nor did she turn when a moment later he resumed in an altered tone i reckon poleon will bring you something pretty from dawson eh he has never failed to bring me presents no matter where he came from dear old poleon she smiled tenderly do you remember that first day when he drifted singing into sight around the bend up yonder he had paddled his birchbark from the chandelar without a thing to eat hunger and hardship only made him the happier and the closer he drew his belt the louder he sang he was bound for his new country yes he didnt know where it lay but the fret for travel was on him and so he drifted and sang as he had drifted and sung from the foot of lake le barge that was four years ago mused gale and he never found his new country did he no we tied him down and choked it out of him necia laughed dear funny old poleon he loves me like a brother the man opened his lips then closed them as if on second thought and rose to his feet for coming towards them up the trail from the barracks he beheld a trim bluecoated figure he peered at the approaching officer a moment set his jaw more firmly and disappeared into the store well we have raised our flagstaff said the lieutenant as he took a seat below necia its like getting settled to keep house are you lazy inquired the girl i dare say i am he admitted ive never had time to find out why are you going to boss our people around she continued bent on her own investigation no not as long as they behave in fact i hardly know what i am to do maybe you can tell me his smile was peculiarly frank and winning you see its my first command and my instructions although comprehensive are rather vague i am supposed to see that mining rights are observed to take any criminals who kindly offer themselves up to be arrested and to sort of handle things that are too tough for the miners themselves why you are a policeman said necia at which he made a wry face the department in its wisdom would have me a tenderfoot adjust those things that are too knotty for these men who have spent their lives along the frontier i dont believe you will be very popular with our people necia announced meditatively no i can see that already i wasnt met with any brassbands and i havent received any engraved silver from the admiring citizens of flambeau that leaves nothing but the women to like me and as you are the only one in camp you will have to like me very much to make up for its shortcomings she approved of his unusual drawl it gave him a kind of deliberation which every move of his long lithe body belied and every glance of his eyes contradicted moreover she liked his youth so clean and fresh and strange in this land where old men are many and the young ones old with hardship and grave with the silence of the hills her life had been spent entirely among men who were her seniors and although she had ruled them like a spoiled queen she knew as little of their sex as they did of hers unconsciously the strong young life within her had clamored for companionship and it was this that had drawn her to poleon doret who would ever remain a boy and it was this that drew her to the young kentuckian this and something else in him that the others lacked now that i think it over he continued id rather have you like me than have the men do so of course she nodded they do anything i want them to all but father and it isnt that he interrupted quickly it is because you are the only woman of the place because you are such a surprise to think that in the heart of this desolation i should find a girl like like you like the girls i know at home am i like other girls she inquired eagerly i have often wondered you are and you are not you are surprisingly conventional for these surroundings and yet unconventionally surprising for any place who are you where did you come from how did you get here i am just what you see i came from the states and i was carried that is all i can remember then you havent lived here always oh dear no we came here while i was very little but of late i have been away at school some seminary eh at this she laughed aloud hardly that either ive been at the mission father barnum has been teaching me for five years i came upriver a day ahead of you she asked no questions of him in return for she had already learned all there was to know the day before from a grizzled corporal in whom was the hunger to talk she had learned of a family of burrells whose name was known throughout the south and that meade burrell came from the frankfort branch the branch that had raised the soldiers his father had fought with lee and an uncle was now in the service at washington on the mothers side the strain was equally militant but the meades had sought the sea the old soldier had told her much more of which she understood little told her of the young mans sister who had come all the way from kentucky to see her brother off when he sailed from san francisco told her of the lieutenants many friends in washington and of his family name and honor meade burrell was undoubtedly a fine young fellow in his corporals eyes and destined to reach great heights as the other burrells had before him the old soldier furthermore had looked at her keenly and added that the burrells were known as divils among the weemen resting thus on the steps of old man gales store the two talked on till they were disturbed by the sound of shrill voices approaching at which the man looked up coming down the trail from the town was a squaw and two children at sight of necia the little ones shouted gleefully and scampered forward climbing over her like halfgrown puppies they were boy and girl both brown as siwashes with eyes like jet beads and hair that was straight and coarse and black at a glance burrell knew them for breeds and evidently the darker half was closer to the surface now for they choked gurgled stuttered and coughed in their indian tongue while necia answered them likewise at a word from her they turned and saw him then abashed at the strange splendor of his uniform fell silent pressing close to her the squaw also seemed to resent his presence for after a lowering glance she drew the shawl closer about her head and leaving the trail slunk out of sight around the corner of the store burrell looked up at his companions clearcut delicate face at the windtanned cheeks against which her long braids lay like the blueblack locks of an egyptian maid then at her warm dark eyes in which was a hint of the golden light of the afternoon sun he noted covertly the slender lines of her body and the dainty firm brown hands flung protectingly about the shoulders of her little friends who were peering at him owlishly from their shelter the bitter revolt that had burned in him at the prospect of a long exile in this undiscovered spot died out suddenly what a picture she made how fresh and flowerlike she looked and yet the wisdom of her he spoke impulsively i am glad you are here miss necia i was glad the moment i saw you and i have been growing gladder ever since for i never imagined there would be anybody in this place but men and squaws men who hate the law and squaws who slink about like that he nodded in the direction of the indian womans disappearance either that or at best a few breeds like these little fellows she looked at him quickly well what difference would that make ugh squaws and halfbreeds his tone conveyed in full his utter contempt the tiny hands of the boy and girl slid into her own as she arose a curiously startled look lay in her eyes and an inquiring plaintive wrinkle came between her brows i dont believe you understand she said lieutenant burrell this is my sister molly gale and this is my little brother john both roundeyed elfs made a ducking courtesy and blinked at the soldier who gained his feet awkwardly a flush rising into his cheeks from the regions at the rear of the store came the voice of an indian woman calling necia necia coming in a moment the girl called back then turning to the young officer she added quietly mother needs me now goodbye chapter ii poleon dorets hand is quicker than his tongue the traders house sat back of the post farther up on the hill it was a large sleepy house sprawling against the sunny side of the slope as if it had sought the southern exposure for warmth and had dozed off one sultry afternoon and never waked up from its slumber it was of great squarehewn timbers built in the russian style the under side of each log hollowed to fit snugly over its fellow underneath upon which dried moss had previously been spread till in effect the footthick walls were tongued and grooved and through years of seasoning become so tinder dry that no frosts or heats could penetrate them many architects had worked on it as it grew room by room through the years and every man had left behind the mark of his individuality from pretty charlie the pilot who swung an axe better than any indian on the river to larsen the ships carpenter who worked with an adze and who starved the summer following on the koyukuk it had stretched a bit year by year for the traders family had been big in the early days when hunters and miners of both breeds came in to trade to loaf and to swap stories with him through the winter days when the caribou were in the north and the moose were scarce whole families of natives came and camped there for alluna his squaw drew to her own blood and they felt it their due to eat of the bounty of him who ruled them like an overlord but when the first goose honked they slipped away until by the time the salmon showed the house was empty again and silent save for alluna and the youngsters in return these people brought him many skins and much fresh meat for which he paid no price and with the fall his cache was filled with fish of which the bulk were dried king salmon as long as a grown mans leg and worth a dollar apiece to any traveller there are men whose wits are quick as light and whose muscles have been so tempered and hardened by years of exercise that they are like those of a wild animal of such was john gale but with all his intelligence he was very slow at reading hence he chose to spend his evenings with his pipe and his thoughts rather than with a book as lonesome men are supposed to do he did with little sleep and many nights he sat alone till alluna and necia would be awakened by his heavy step as he went to his bed that he was a man who could really think and that his thoughts were engrossing no one doubted who saw him sitting enthralled at such a time for he neither rocked nor talked nor moved a muscle hour after hour and only his eyes were alive tonight the spell was on him again and he sat bulked up in his chair rocklike and immovable from the open door of the next room he could hear necia and the little ones she had made them ready for bed and was telling them the tale of the snowbirds spot so when all the other birds had failed he heard her say the little snowbird asked for a chance to try he flew and flew and just before he came to the edge of the world where the two old women lived he pulled out all of his feathers when he came to them he said i am very cold may i warm myself at your fire they saw how little and naked he was and how he shivered so they did not throw sticks at him but allowed him to creep close he watched his chance and when they were not looking he picked up a redhot coal in his beak and flew back home with it as fast as ever he could and that is how fire came to the indian people of course the coal was hot and it burned his throat till a drop of blood came through so ever since that day the snowbird has had a red spot on his throat the two children spoke out in their mothers tongue clamoring for the story of the good beaver who saved the hunters life and she began this time in the language of the yukon people while gale listened to the low music of her voice muffled and broken by the log partition his squaw came in her arrival unannounced except by the scuff of her moccasins and seated herself against the wall she did not use a chair of which there were several but crouched upon a bearskin her knees beneath her chin her toes a trifle drawn together she sat thus for a long time while necia continued her stories and put the little ones to bed soon the girl came to say goodnight john gale had never kissed his daughter and as it was not a custom of her mothers race she never missed the caresses on rare occasions the old man romped with the little ones and took them in his arms and acted as other fathers act but he had never done these things with her when she had gone he spoke without moving shell never marry poleon doret why inquired alluna he aint her kind poleon is a good man none better but shell marry some some white man poleon is white the squaw declared he is and he aint i mean shell marry an outside man he aint good enough and well he aint her kind allunas grunt of indignation was a sufficient answer to this but he resumed jerking his head in the direction of the barracks shes been talking a lot with this this soldier him good man too i guess said the wife the hell he is cried the trader fiercely he dont mean any good to her him got a woman eh said the other no no i reckon hes single all right but you dont understand hes different from us people hes hes gale paused at a loss for words to convey his meaning well he aint the kind that would marry a halfbreed alluna pondered this cryptic remark unsuccessfully and was still seeking its solution when her lord continued if she really got to loving him it would be bad for all of us evidently alluna read some hidden meaning back of these words for she spoke quickly but in her own tongue now as she was accustomed to do when excited or alarmed then this thing must cease at once the risk is too great better that you kill him before it is too late hardly that said the trader think of the little ones and of me the squaw insisted and encouraged by his silence continued why not soon the nights will grow dark the river runs swiftly and it never gives up its dead i can do it if you dare not no one would suspect me gale rose and laid his big hand firmly on her shoulder dont talk like that there has been too much blood let already well allow things to run along a bit as they are theres time enough to worry he rose but instead of going to his room he strode out of the house and walked northward up the trail passing through the town and out of sight alluna sat huddled up in the doorway her shawl drawn close about her head and waited for him until the late sun which at this time of year revolves in a great circle overhead dipped down below the distant mountains for the midnight hour then rolled slanting out again a few points farther north to begin its long journey anew but he did not return at last she crept stiffly indoors like an old and weary woman the look of fright still staring in her eyes about nine oclock the next morning a faint and longdrawn cry came from the farthest limits of the little camp an instant later it was echoed closer and then a dog began to howl before its voice had died away another took it up sadly and within three breaths from tip and down the halfmile of scanty waterfront came the cry of steambooat cabin doors opened and men came out glanced up the stream and echoed the call while from sleepy nooks and sunwarmed roofs wolfdogs arose yawning and stretching those who had slept late dressed as they hurried towards the landingplace joining in the plaint till men and malamutes united in the shrill slow cry downstream came the faintsighing whoofwhoof of a steamer and then out from behind the bend she burst running on the swift spring current with the speed of a deer she blew hoarsely before the tardy ones had reached the bank and when abreast of the town her bell clanged the patter of her great wheel ceased she reversed her engines and swung gracefully till her bow was up against the current then ploughed back inching in slowly until with much shouting and the sound of many gongs she slid her nose quietly into the bank beneath the tradingpost and was made fast her cabindeck was lined with passengers most of whom were bound for the outside although still clad in mackinaw and overalls they all gazed silently at the hundred men of flambeau who stared back at them till the gangplank was placed when they came ashore to stretch their legs one of them however made sufficient noise to make up for the silence of the others before the steamer had grounded he appeared among the siwash deckhands his head and shoulders towering above them his white teeth gleaming from a face as dark as theirs shouting to his friends ashore and pantomiming his delight to the two gale children who had come with alluna to welcome him whos dose beeg tall people wat stan longside of you miz gale he called to her then shading his eyes elaborately he cried in a great voice wall wal i blieve dats msieu jean an mamselle mollee ba gar dey get so beeg wile im gone i don know dem no more the youthful gales wriggled at this delicious flattery and dug their tiny moccasined toes into the sand molly courtesied nervously and continuously as she clung to her mother and the boy showed a gap where two front teeth had been and was now filled by a very pink tongue wen you goin stop grow anyhow you two eh continued the frenchman and then in a tone of sadness if i tink you ack lak dis i don buy all dese present dese ting ain no good for ole folks i guess ill trow dem away he made as if to heave a bundle that he carried into the river whereupon the children shrieked at him so shrilly that he laughed long and incontinently at the success of his sally lieutenant burrell had come with the others for the arrival of a steamboat called for the presence of every soul in camp and spying necia in the outskirts of the crowd he took his place beside her he felt constrained after what had happened on the previous evening but she seemed to have forgotten the episode and greeted him with her usual frankness even had she remembered it there was nothing he could say in explanation or in apology he had lain awake for hours thinking of her and had fallen asleep with her still in his mind for the revelation of her blood had come as a shock to him the full force of which he could not appreciate until he had given himself time to think of it calmly he had sprung from a race of slaveholders from a land where birth and breed are more than any other thing where a drop of impure blood effects an ineradicable stain therefore the thought of this girls ignoble parentage was so repugnant to him that the more he pondered it the more pitiful it seemed the more monstrous lying awake and thinking of her in the stillness of his quarters it had seemed a very unfortunate and a very terrible thing during his morning duties the vision of her had been fresh before him again and his constant contemplation of the matter had wrought a change in his attitude towards the girl of which he was uncomfortably conscious and which he was glad to see she did not perceive there are some of the lucky men from el dorado creek she informed him pointing out certain people on the deck they are going out to the states to get something to eat they say that nothing like those mines have ever been heard of in the world i wish father had gone up last year when the news came why didnt he asked the lieutenant surely he must have been among the first to learn of it yes stick george sent him word a year ago last fall when he made the first discovery but for some reason father wouldnt go the men were pouring off the boat now and through the crowd came the tall frenchman bearing in the hollow of each arm a child who clasped a bundle to its breast his eyes grew brighter at sight of necia and he broke into a flood of patois they fairly bombarded each other with quick questions and fragmentary answers till she remembered her companion who had fallen back a pace and was studying the newcomer whereupon she turned oh i forgot my manners lieutenant burrell this is napoleon doret our poleon she added with proud emphasis doret checked his volubility and stared at the soldier whom he appeared to see for the first time the little brown people in his arms stared likewise and it seemed to burrell that a certain distrust was in each of the three pairs of eyes only in those of the man there was no shyness instead the canadian looked him over gravely from head to heel seeming to note each point of the unfamiliar attire then he inquired without removing his glance werebouts you live eh i live at the post yonder said the lieutenant wat biznesse you work at i am a soldier wat for you come ere deres nobody fightin roun dis place the lieutenant has been stationed here foolish said necia come up to the store quick and tell me what its like at dawson with a farewell nod to burrell she went off with doret whose speech was immediately released again in spite of the mans unfriendliness burrell watched him with admiration there were no heels to his tufted fur boots and yet he stood a good six feet two as straight as a pine sapling and it needed no second glance to tell of what metal he was made his spirit showed in his whole body in the set of his head and above all in his dark warm face which glowed with eagerness when he talked and that was ever when he was not singing i never see so many people since i lef quebec he was saying shes jus lak beeg city mus be tree four tousan people every day some more dey come an all night dey dance an sing an drink wiskee ba gosh dats fine place are there lots of white women asked the girl yes two tree hondred mos of dem is work in dancehalls deres one fine gal i see name marie bourgette i tell you bout her byanby oh poleon youre in love cried necia no siree he denied deres none of dem gal look half so purty lak you he would have said more but spying the trader at the entrance of the store he went to him straightway launching into the details of their commercial enterprise which happily had been most successful before they could finish the crowd from the boat began to drift in some of them buying drinks at the bar and others making purchases of tobacco and so forth but for the main part merely idling about curiously among the merchandise of the post there were for sale a scanty assortment of firearms cheap shotguns and a winchester or two displayed in a rack behind the counter in a manner to attract the eye of such native hunters as might need them and with the rest hung a pair of colts revolvers one of the new arrivals who had separated from the others at the front now called to gale are those colts for sale mine was stolen the other day evidently he was accustomed to yukon prices for he showed no surprise at the figure the trader named but took the guns and tested each of them whereupon the old man knew that here was no cheechako as tenderfeet are known in the north although the mans garb had deceived him at first glance the stranger balanced the weapons one in either hand then he did the double roll neatly following which he executed a move that gale had not witnessed for many years he extended one of the guns butt foremost as if surrendering it the action being free and open save for the fact that his forefinger was crooked and thrust through the triggerguard then with the slightest jerk of the wrist the gun spun about the handle jumped into his palm and instantly there was a click as his thumb flipped the hammer it was the old roadagent spin which gale as a boy had practised hours at a time but that this man was in earnest he showed by glancing upward sharply when the trader laughed this one hangs all right he said give me a box of cartridges he emptied his goldsack in payment for the gun and ammunition then remarked that pretty nearly cleans me if i had the price id take them both gale wondered what need induced this fellow to spend his last few dollars on a firearm but he said nothing until the man had loosened the bottom buttons of his vest and slipped the weapon inside the band of his trousers concealing its handle beneath the edge of his waistcoat then he inquired bound for the outside no im locating here the trader darted a quick glance at him he did not like this man there aint much doing in this camp its a pretty poor place he said guardedly ill put in with you from its looks agreed the other its got too many soldiers to be worth a damn he snarled this bitterly with a peculiar leering lift of his lip as if his words tasted badly most of the boys are going upriver said gale well those hills look as if they had gold in them said the stranger pointing vaguely im going to prospect gale knew instinctively that the fellow was lying for his hands were not those of a miner but there was nothing to be said his judgment was verified however when poleon drew him aside later and said you know dat feller no hes bad man how do you know shes leave dawson damn queeck dose mounted police trow im on de boat jus before we lef then he told a story that he had heard the man it seemed had left skagway between two suns upon the disruption of soapy smiths band of desperadoes and had made for the interior but had been intercepted at the pass by two members of the citizens committee who came upon him suddenly pretending to yield he had executed some unexpected coup as he delivered his gun for both men fell shot through the body no one knew just what it was he did nor cared to question him overmuch the next heard of him was at lake bennett over the line where the mounted police recognized him and sent him on they marked him well however and passed him on from post to post as they had driven others whose records were known but he had lost himself in the confusion at dawson for a few weeks until the scarletcoated riders searched him out disarmed him and forced him sullenly aboard this steamer the offscourings of the canadian frontier were drifting back into their native country to settle old man gale cared little for this for he had spent his life among such men but as he watched the fellow a scheme outlined itself in his head evidently the man dared not go farther down the river for there was nothing save indian camps and a mission or two this side of st michaels and at that point there was a court and many soldiers where one was liable to meet the penalty of past misdeeds hence he was probably resolved to stop here and judging by his record he was a man of settled convictions continued persecution is wont to stir certain natures to such reckless desperation that interference is dangerous and gale recalling his sullen look and illconcealed contempt for the soldiers put the stranger down as a man of this type furthermore he had been impressed by the fellows remarkable dexterity of wrist the trader stepped to the door and seeing burrell on the deck of the steamer went down towards him it was a long chance but the stakes were big and worth the risk he had thought much during the night previous in fact for many hours and the morning had found him still undecided wherefore he took this course necia tells me that you aim to keep law and order here he began abruptly having drawn the young man aside those are my instructions said burrell but they are so vague well this camp is bigger than it was an hour ago and it aint improved any in the growth yonder goes the new citizen he pointed to the stranger who had returned to the steamer for his baggage and was descending the gangplank beneath them a valise in each hand hes a thief and a murderer and we dont want him here now its up to you i dont understand said the lieutenant whereupon the trader told him dorets tale you and your men were sent here to keep things peaceable he concluded and i reckon when a man is too tough for the canuck police he is tough enough for you to tackle there aint a lock and key in the camp and we aint had a killing or a stealing in ten years wed like to keep it that way well you see i know nothing of that shooting affray so i doubt if my authority would permit me to interfere the soldier mused half to himself i allowed you were to use your own judgment said the elder man so i am i suppose there is one chance mr gale if youll back me up ill send him on down to st michaels that is the most i can do the lieutenant outlined his plan and as he went on the trader nodded approval the young man gazed back at him so squarely his eyes were so pleasant and friendly his whole person breathed such straightup honesty and freshness that shame arose in the old man and he had hard shift to keep his glance from wavering without forethought he answered impulsively hes desperate and hes dangerous i sold him a just now he was about to tell him where the man wore it and to add a word concerning his dexterity with the gun when the very fearless deliberation of the youth deterred him on second thought gale yielded to an impulse to wait and see how meade burrell would act under fire if the soldier emerged scathless it would give him a line on his character if he did not well that would be even better the sight of his blue and brass awoke in the elder man dread and cowardice emotions he had never experienced before anyhow he owed it to himself to necia and to the others to find out what kind of man this soldier was the crowd was coming back to the steamer which had discharged her few bundles of freight and there was no one inside the log post as they entered except doret and the stranger who had deposited his baggage at the rear and was talking with the frenchman at the bar at sight of the lieutenant he became silent and turned carelessly although with a distrustful stare burrell wasted no time are you going to locate here he began yes i notice you go skeletonrigged the soldier continued indicating the mans baggage pretty small outfit for a miner isnt it its plenty for me have you enough money to buy your seasons grub i guess thats my business pardon me it is my business also what is this a holdup the man laughed harshly at the same time swinging around till he faced his questioner gale noted that his right hand now hung directly over the spot where his suspenders buttoned on the right side the trader moved aside and took up a position at some distance my orders are to see that all newcomers either have an outfit or are able to buy one said burrell those that are not equipped properly are to be sent downriver to st michaels where there is plenty of everything and where they will be taken care of by the government mr gale has only sufficient provisions to winter the men already in this district i can take care of myself said the man angrily whether im broke or not and i dont want any of your interference he shot a quick glance at poleon doret but the frenchmans face was like wood and his hand still held the neck of the whiskey bottle he had set out for the stranger before the others entered gale leaned against the opposite counter his countenance inert but for the eyes which were fixed upon the lieutenant come said the officer peremptorily i have heard all about you and you are not the kind of citizen we want here but if you have enough money for an outfit i cant send you away if you havent im broke said the man but at the note in his voice poleon dorets muscles tightened and burrell who also read a sinister message in the tone slid his heavy service revolver from its holster beneath his coat he had never done this thing before and it galled him he had never drawn a weapon on a man and this playing at policeman became suddenly most repugnant stirring in him the uncomfortable feeling that he was doing a mean thing and not only a mean thing but one of which he ought to be heartily ashamed he felt decidedly amateurish especially when he saw that the man apparently intended no resistance and made no move however he was in for it now and must end as he had begun give me your gun he said ill unload it and give it back to you at the gangplank all right youve got the upper hand said the man through lips that had gone white drawing his weapon from beneath his vest he presented it to the officer butt foremost hammer underneath the cylinder reposed naturally in the palm of his hand and the tip of his forefinger was thrust through the triggerguard burrell lowered the barrel of his revolver and put out his left hand for the others weapon suddenly the mans wrist jerked the soldier saw a blue flicker of sunlight on the steel as it whirled saw the arm of poleon doret fling itself across the bar with the speed of a striking serpent heard a smash of breaking glass felt the shock of a concussion and the spatter of some liquid in his face then he saw the mans revolver on the floor halfway across the room saw fragments of glass with it and saw the fellow step backward snatching at the fingers of his right hand a smell of powdersmoke and rank whiskey was in the air there are times when a mans hand will act more swiftly than his tongue napoleon doret had seen the manner of the strangers surrender of his gun and realizing too late what it meant had acted at the very instant of the fellows treachery doret struck with his bottle just in time to knock the weapon from his hand but not in time to prevent its discharge the bullet was lodged in the wall a foot from where gale stood as the stranger staggered back the frenchman vaulted the bar but though swift as a cat the soldier who had also leaped was before him aiming a sweeping downward blow with his colt burrell clipped the skagway man just above the ear and he reeled then as he fell the officer struck wickedly again at his opponents skull but doret seized him by the arm ba gar dont kill im twice burrell wrenched his arm free and turned on doret a face that remained long in the frenchmans memory a face suffused with fury and convulsed like that of a sprinter at the finish of a race the two men stared at each other over the fallen figure for a brief moment until the soldier gained mastery of himself and sheathed his weapon when poleon smiled i spoil a quart of good wiskee on you dats wort five dollar the lieutenant wiped the liquor from his face quick work doret he said i owe you one gales face was hidden as he bent over the prostrate man fingering a long and ragged cut which laid the fellows scalp open from back of the ear to the temple but he mumbled something unintelligible is he hurt badly no you chipped him too low said the trader i told you he was bad hes goin have nice birtmark anyhow said doret going back of the bar for some water they revived the man then bound up his injury hastily and as the steamer cast off they led him to the bank and passed his gripsacks to a roustabout he said no word as he walked unsteadily up the plank but turned and stared malignantly at them from the deck then as the craft swung outward into the stream he grinned through the trickle of blood that stole down from beneath his wide hat if the convulsive grimace he made could be termed a grin and cried id like to introduce myself for im coming back to winter with you lieutenant my name is runnion and until the steamer was hidden behind the bend below they saw him standing there gazing back at them fixedly as burrell left the two men at the store he gave his hand frankly to the frenchcanadian and said while his cheeks flushed i want to thank you for saving me from my own awkwardness doret became even more embarrassed than the lieutenant at this show of gratitude and grunted churlishly but when the young man had gone he turned to gale who had watched them silently and said hes nice young feller ole man sapre wen hes mad his eye got so red lak my ondershirt but the trader made no reply chapter iii without benefit of clergy when the steamer had gone napoleon doret went to look for necia and found her playing with the younger gales who revelled in the gifts he had brought never had there been such a surprise never had there been such gorgeous presents for little folks this was a land in which there were no toys a country too young for babes and any one whose youth had been like that of other children would have seen a pathos in the joy of these two poleon had been hard put to it to find anything suitable for his little friends for although there was all manner of merchandise coming into dawson none of it was designed for tiny people not even clothes it was evident that he had pleased them for when he appeared they ran at his legs like twin cubs incoherent and noisy the pleasure within them too turbulent for expression they had never played with a toy that poleon had not built for them nor worn a garment that alluna had not made this then was a day of revelations for the first thing they beheld upon opening their packs was a pair of rubber boots for each they were ladies kneeboots the smallest size in stock but the gales entered them bodily so to speak moccasins and all clear to their hips like the waders that duckhunters use when they ran they fell down and out of them but their pride remained upright and serene for were not these like the boots that poleon wore and not of indian make with foolish beads on them next the youthful heir had found a straw hat of strange and wondrous fashion with a brim like a board and a band of blue which poleon had bought from a college man who had retained this emblem of his past to the final moment like the boots it was much too large for little john and hard to master but it made a brave display as did a red cravat which covered his front like a baseball catchers harness molly had also two sets of sidecombs gorgeously ornamented with glass diamonds and a silverhandled toothbrush with which she scrubbed the lame puppy this puppy had three legs and the mange and he was her particular pride there were certain other things the use of which they did not understand like queersmelling soft yellow balls which necia said were oranges and good to eat although the skins were leathery and very bitter nor were they nearly so pleasant to the nose as the toilet soap which necia would not allow them even to taste then there was a box of chocolate candies such as the superintendent at st michaels sent them every spring and an atomizer which necia had filled with florida water this worked on the puppy even better than the toothbrush the elder girl laughed gladly as poleon entered though her eyes were wet with the pity of it you seem to bring sunshine wherever you go she said they have never had things to play with like other children and it makes me cry to watch them ho ho he chuckled dis ainno time for cryin ba gosh i guess you don have so much present wen you was lil gal yousef wat mebbe you tink i forget you wal i didnt he began to undo the fastenings of a parcel he carried in his arms for napoleon doret had brought other things from dawson besides his gifts to the children necia snatched at the package dont you dare open it why thats half the fun she was a child herself now her face flushed and her hands atremble taking the package to the table she hurriedly untied the knots while he stood watching her his teeth showing white against his dark face and his eyes half shut as if dazzled by the sight of her oh why didnt you tie more knots in it she breathed as she undid the last and then opening the wrappings slowly she gasped in astonishment she shook it out gently reverently a clinging black lace gown of paris make next she opened a box and took from it a picture hat with long jet plumes which she stroked and pressed fondly against her face there were other garments also a silken petticoat silk stockings and a pair of highheeled shoes to match with certain other delicate and dainty things which she modestly forbore to inspect before the frenchman who said no word but only gazed at her and for whom she had no eyes as yet finally she laid her presents aside and turning to him said in a hushed awestricken voice its all there everything complete oh poleon you dear dear poleon she took his two big hands by the thumbs as had been her custom ever since she was a child and looked up at him her eyes wet with emotion but she could not keep away from the dress for long and returned to feast her eyes upon it the two children standing beside her sprouting out of their rubber boots with eyes and mouths round and protruding you lak it eh pressed poleon hungry for more demonstrative expression ohh she sighed cant you see where on earth did you get it then suddenly realizing its value she cried why it must have cost a fortune a quick reproach leaped into her face but he only laughed again wan night i gamble in beeg saloon yes sir i gamble good dat night too for wile i play roulette den i dance den i play some more an byanby i see a new dance gal shes franche gal from montreal dats de one i tol you bout ba gar shes swell dress too shes name marie bourgette oh ive heard about her said necia she owns a claim on bonanza creek sure

nice of both of you but i cant wear it ive never seen a dress like it except in pictures and i couldnt she saw his face fall and said impulsively ill wear it once anyhow poleon just for you go away quick now and let me put it on dats good he nodded as he moved away i bet you mak dose dancehall women look lak sucker no man may understand the girls feelings as she set about clothing herself in her first fine dress time and again she had studied pictures from the outside showing women arrayed in the newest styles and had closed her eyes to fancy herself dressed in like manner she had always had an instinctive feeling that some day she would leave the north and see the wonderful world of which men spoke so much and mingle with the fine ladies of her picturebooks but she never dreamed to possess an eveninggown while she lived in alaska and now even while she recognized the grotesqueness of the situation she burned to wear it and see herself in the garb of other women so with the morning sun streaming brightly into her room lighting up the mosschinked walls the rough barbarism of fur and head and trophy she donned the beautiful garments poleons eye had been amazingly correct for it fitted her neatly save at the waist which was even more than an inch too large notwithstanding the fact that she had never worn such a corset as the wellformed marie bourgette was accustomed to she pondered long and hesitated modestly when she saw its low cut which exposed her neck and shoulders in a totally unaccustomed manner for it struck her as amazingly indecent until she scurried through her magazines again and saw that its construction as compared with others was most conservative even so she shrank at sight of herself below the line of sunburn for she was ringed about like a bluewinged teal the demarcation being more pronounced because of the natural whiteness of her skin the year previous doret had brought her from the coast a spanish shawl which a saltwater sailor had sold him and which had lain folded away ever since she brought it forth now and arranged it about her shoulders but in spite of this covering the fair flesh beneath peeped through its wide interstices most brazenly she had never paid marked attention to the fairness of her skin till now and all at once this difference between herself and her little brother and sister struck her she had been a mother to them ever since they came and had often laughed when she saw how brown their little bodies were rejoicing in blushing quietude at her own whiteness but today she neither laughed nor felt any joy rather a dim wonder she sat down dress and all in the thick softness of a great brown bearskin and thought it over how odd it was now that she considered it that she needed no aid with these alien garments that she knew instinctively their every feature that there was no intricacy to cause her more than an instants trouble this knowledge must be a piece with the intuitive wit that had been the wonder of father barnum and had enabled her to absorb his teachings as fast as he gave them forth she was interrupted in her reverie by the passing of a shadow across her window and the stamp of a mans feet on the planks at the door of course it was poleon who had come back to see her so she rose hastily gave one quick glance at the mirror above her washstand choosing the side that distorted her image the least and hearing him still stamping perfunctorily called come in ill be right out she kicked the train into place behind her looped the shawl carelessly about her in a way to veil her modesty effectively and with an expectant smile at his extravagance of admiration swept out into the big room very selfconscious and very pleasing to the eye she crossed proudly to the readingtable to give him a fair view of her splendor and was into the middle of the room before she looked up taken aback she uttered a little strangled cry and made a quick movement of retreat only to check herself and stand with her chin high in the air while wave after wave of color swept over her face great lovely dove ejaculated burrell fervently staring at her oh i i thought you were poleon he in spite of herself she glanced towards her room as if to flee she writhed at the utter absurdity of her appearance and knew the lieutenant must be laughing at her but flight would only make it worse so she stood as she was having drawn back as far as she could till the table checked her burrell however was not laughing nor smiling even for his embarrassment rivalled hers i was looking for your father he said wondering if this glorious thing could be the quaint halfbreed girl of yesterday there was nothing of the native about her now for her lithe young figure was drawn up to its height and her head upon which the long black braids were coiled was tipped back in a haughty poise she had flung her hands out to grasp the table edge behind her forgetful of her shawl which drooped traitorously and showed such rounded lines as her ordinary dress scarce hinted at this was no indian maid the soldier vowed no blood but the purest could pulse in such veins no spirit save the highest could flash in such eyes as these a jealous rancor irked him at the thought of this beauty intended for the frenchmans eyes cant you show yourself to me as well as to poleon he said certainly not she declared he bought this dress for me and i put it on to please him now she was herself again for some note in the lieutenants voice gave her dominance over him after he sees it i will take it off and dont dont take it off ever said burrell i thought you were beautiful before because of your quaintness and simplicity but now his chest swelled why this is a breath from home youre like my sister and the girls back in kentucky only more wonderful am i she cried eagerly am i like other girls do i really look as if id always worn clothes like these born to them said he a smile broke over her grave face assuming a hundred different shades of pleasure and making a child of her on the instant all her reserve and hauteur vanished her warmth and unaffected frankness suffused him as she stood out turning to show the beauties of her gown her brown hands fluttering tremulously as she talked its my first partydress you know and im as proud of it as molly is of her rubber boots its too big in here and too small right there that girl must have had a bad chest but otherwise it fits me as if it had been made for me doesnt it and the shoes arent they the dearest things see she held her skirts back showing her two feet side by side her dainty ankles slim and shapely in their silk they wont shed water he said i know and look at the heels i couldnt walk a mile to save my life and they will come off if they get wet but they make me very tall they dont wear as well as moccasins both laughed delightedly till he broke in impulsively oh girl dont you know how beautiful you are of course i do she cried imitating his change of voice then added naively thats why i hate to take it off where did you learn to wear things like that he questioned where did you get that well that air it seems to me ive always known theres nothing strange about it the buttons and the hooks and the eyes are all where they belong its instinct i suppose from fathers side probably i dare say i should understand the mechanism of a dresssuit even if id never seen one said the man amused yet impressed by her argument ive always had visions of women dressed in this kind of clothing white women never natives not dressed like this exactly but in dainty soft things not at all like the ones i wear i seem to have a memory although its hardly that either its more like a dreamas if i were somebody else father says it is from reading too much a memory of what its too vague and tantalizing to tell what it is except that i should be called merridy merridy why that ill show you see she slipped her hand inside the shawl and drew from her breast a thin gold chain on which was strung a band ring it was grandmothers thats where i got the fancy for the name of merridy i suppose may i look of course but i darent take it off i havent had it off my neck since i was a baby she held it out for him to examine and although it brought his head close to hers there was no trace of coquetry in the invitation he read the inscription from dan to merridy but had no realization of what it meant for he glimpsed the milkwhite flesh almost at his lips and felt her breath stirring his hair while the delicate scent of her person seemed to loose every strong emotion in him she was so dainty and yet so virile so innocent and yet so wise so cold and yet so pulsating it is very pretty he said inanely at the look in his eyes as he raised his head her own widened and she withdrew from him imperceptibly dismissing him with a mere inflection i wish you would send poleon here its time he saw his present as burrell walked out into the air he shut his jaws grimly and muttered hold tight young man shes not your kind shes not your kind inside the store he found doret and the trader in conversation with a man he had not met before a ragged nondescript whose overalls were blue and faded and patched particularly on the front of the legs above the knees where a shovelhandle wears hardest whose coat was of yellow mackinaw the sleeves worn thin below the elbows where they had rubbed against his legs in his work as the soldier entered the man turned on him a small shrewd weatherbeaten face with one eye while he went on talking to gale it aint nothin to git excited over but its wuth follerin if i wasnt so cussed unlucky id know there was a pay streak somere close by your luck is bound to change lee said the trader who helped him to roll up a pack of provisions mebbe so whos the dressmaker he jerked his bushy head towards burrell who had stopped at the front door with poleon to examine some yellow grains in a folded paper hes the boss soldier purty aint he if you aint good hell get you said gale a trifle cynically at which lee chuckled i reckon theres several of us in camp that aint been a whole lot too good said he has he tried to git anybody yet no but hes liable to what would happen if he did suppose for instance he went after you or me the oneeyed man snorted derisively it aint wuth considerin why not insisted gale guardedly maybe ive got a record you dont know if you have dont tell me nothin about it hastily observed lee im a godfearin citizen myself leanin ever towards peace and quietudes but whats past is dead and gone and id hate to see a lispin child like that blueandyeller party try to reezureck it hes got the american army to back him up at least five of them five agin a hundred he aims to overawe us dont he snickered the unregenerate lee but his wrinkles changed and deepened as he leaned across the counter confidentially you say the word john and ill take some feller along to help me and well transfer this military post theres plenty that would like the job if you give the wink pshaw im just supposing said the trader as long as they play around and drill and toot that horn and dont bother anybody i allow theyre not in the way all right its up to you however if i happen to leap down on this pay streak before it sees me comin im goin to put my friends in first and foremost and shut out these dressmakers complete so long he thrust his arms beneath the legs of a new pair of blue overalls that formed his packstraps wriggled the burden comfortably into place between his shoulders and slouched out past doret to whom he nodded ignoring the dressmaker having given necias message to poleon the lieutenant took up his business with the trader it concerned the purchase of certain supplies that had been omitted from the military outfit and when this was concluded he referred to the encounter of that morning i dont want you to think i bungle everything in that manner he said for i dont i want to work with you and i want to be friends with you im willing said gale nobody dislikes playing policeman more than i do but its a part of my duty and ill have to do it continued the young man i reckon you simply aim to keep peace eh you aint lookin for nobody in particular of course not outside of certain notorious criminals who have escaped justice and worked north then there is a few that you want eh yes certain oldtimers the officers at every post have descriptions of a few such and if they show up we will take them in and hold them till courts are established if youve got their names and descriptions mebbe i could help you said the trader carelessly thank you ill bring up the list and well go over it together you must have been here a good while about ten years then miss necia was born out in the states gale shot a startled glance at the soldier before he answered in the affirmative but burrell was studying a pattern of sunlight on the floor and did not observe him a moment later he inquired hesitatingly is this your first marriage mr gale when the other did not answer he looked up and quickly added i beg your pardon sir what led me to ask was miss necia she is so well she is such a remarkable girl gales face had undergone a change but he answered quietly i aint never been married what when i took alluna it wasnt the style and neither one of us has thought much about it since oh i see exclaimed burrell hurriedly ill bring that list with me the first time i think about it and nodding amiably he sauntered out but his mind was in a whirl and even after he had reached his quarters he found himself repeating the other was bad enough poor little girl poor little girl gale likewise left the store and went into his house the odd look still strong in his eyes to find necia posing in her new regalia for poleons benefit at sight of her he fell into a strange and unexpected humor and to their amazement commanded her roughly to take the things off his voice and manner were harsh and at utter variance with any mood he had ever displayed before nor would he explain his unreasoning fury but strode out again leaving her in tears and the frenchman staring chapter iv the soldier finds an untrodden valley during the weeks that followed meade burrell saw much of necia at first he had leaned on the excuse that he wanted to study the curious freak of heredity she presented but that wore out quickly and he let himself drift content with the pleasure of her company and happy in the music of her laughter her quick wit and keen humor delighted him and the mystery of her dark eyes seemed to hold the poetry and beauty of all the red races that lay behind her on the maternal side at times he thought of her as he had seen her that morning in the dancegirls dress and remembered the purity of neck and breast it had displayed but he attributed that to the same prank of heritage that had endowed her with other traits alien to her mothers race he had experienced a profound sense of pity for her upon learning her fathers relation to alluna but this also largely vanished when he found that the girl was entirely oblivious to its significance he had tried her in many subtle ways and found that she regarded the matter innocently as customary and therefore in the light of an accepted convention nor did she seem to see anything in her blood or station to render her inferior to other women she questioned him tirelessly about his sister and he was glad of this for it placed no constraint between them so that as he explored her many quaint beliefs and pagan superstitions the delight of being with her grew and he ceased to reason whither it might lead him as for her each day brought a keener delight she unfolded before the kentuckian like some beautiful woodland flower and through innumerable unnoticed familiarities took him into her innermost confidence sharing with him those girlish hopes and beliefs and aspirations she had never voiced till now a month of this went by and then runnion returned he came on an upgoing steamer which panted in for a rest from its thousandmile climb and for breath to continue its fight against the nevertiring sweep of waters the manner of his coming was bold for he stood fairly upon the ships deck staring at the growing picture of the town as he had watched it recede a month before and his smile was evil now as it had been then with him was a stranger when the boat was at rest runnion sauntered down the gangplank and up to the lieutenant who stood above the landingplace and who noted that the scar close up against his hatband was scarce healed he accosted the officer with an insolent assurance well im back again you see and im back to stay very well runnion did you bring an outfit with you the young man addressed him civilly although he felt that the fellows presence was a menace and would lead to trouble yes and im pretty fat besides he shook a wellladen goldsack at the officer i reckon i can rustle thirteen dollars a month most anywhere if im left alone what do you want in this place anyhow demanded burrell curiously none of your damned business the man answered grinning be sure it isnt retorted the lieutenant because it would please me right down to the ground if it were id like to get you im glad we understand each other runnion said and turned to oversee the unloading of his freight falling into conversation with the stranger who had been surveying the town without leaving the boat evidently this man had a voice in runnions affairs for he not only gave him instructions but bossed the crew who handled his merchandise and meade burrell concluded that he must be some incoming tenderfoot who had grubstaked the desperado to prospect in the hills back of flambeau as the two came up past him he saw that he was mistaken this man was no more of a tenderfoot than runnion on the contrary he had the bearing of one to whom new countries are old who had trod the edge of things all his life there was a hint of the meateating animal about him his nose was keen and hawklike his walk and movements those of the predatory beast and as he passed by burrell observed that his eyes were of a peculiar cruelty that went well with his thin lips he was older by far than runnion but while the latter was meanvisaged and swaggering the strangers manner was noticeable for its repression impelled by an irresistible desire to learn something about the man the lieutenant loitered after runnion and his companion and entered the store in time to see the latter greet no creek lee the prospector who had come into town for more food both men spoke with quiet restraint nine years since i saw you stark said the miner where you bound the diggings replied stark as lee addressed the stranger mining now no same old thing but im grubstaking a few men as usual one of them stays here i may open a house in dawson if the camp is as good as they say it is this heres a good place for you stark laughed noiselessly and without mirth fine there must be a hundred people living here never mind you take it from me said the miner positively and get in now on the quiet theres something doing his one sharp eye detected the lieutenant close by so he drew his friend aside and began talking to him earnestly and with such evident effect as to alter starks plans on the moment for when runnion entered the store shortly stark spoke to him quickly following which they both hurried back to the steamer and saw to the unloading of much additional freight and baggage from the volume and variety of this merchandise it was evident that mr stark would in no wise be a burden to the community burrell was not sufficiently versed in the ways of miningcamps to know exactly what this abrupt change of policy meant but that there was something in the air he knew from the mysterious manner of no creek lee and from the suppressed excitement of doret and the trader his curiosity got the better of him finally and he fell into talk with lee inquiring about the stranger by way of an opening thats ben stark i knew him back in the cassiar country said lee is he a mining man well summat hes made and lost a bankroll that a greyhound couldnt leap over in the mining business but it aint his reglar graft he run one of the biggest places in the northwest for years saloon eh saloon and variety house seven bartenders thats all hes the feller that killed the goldcommissioner of course that put him on the hike again how do you mean well he had a record as long as a sick mans drug bill before he went into that country and when he put the commissioner away them canadian officials went after him like they was killin snakes and it cost him all he had made to get clear if it had happened across the line the coroners jury would have freed him cause the commissioner was drunk and started the row but it happened right in starks saloon and you know canucks is stronger than vitriol for law and order not bein his first offence it went hard with him he looks like a killer said burrell yes but he aint the common kind he always lets the other man begin and therefore he aint never done time come now argued the lieutenant if it were the other man who invariably shot first stark would have been killed long ago i dont care what would have happened it aint happened and hes got notches on his gun till it looks like a cub bear had chawed it if you was a western man youd know what they say about him the bullet aint been run to kill him thats the sayin you neednt grin theres many a better man than you believes it who is it that the bullet hasnt been run to kill said the traders deep voice behind them he had finished with his duties and now sauntered forward ben stark said lee turning you know him john no i never saw him but i know who he is used to hear of him in the coeur dalenes thats him i was talking to said the miner hes an old friend of mine and hes going to locate here burrell thought he saw lee wink at the trader but he was not sure for at that moment the man of whom they were speaking reentered lee introduced him and the three men shook hands while the soldier fell into easy conversation with the newcomer gale gazed at him narrowly studying him as he studied all men who came as strangers as he was doing so alluna entered followed by johnny and molly she had come for sugar and asked for it in her native tongue upon her exit stark broke off talking to the lieutenant and turned to the trader your squaw mr gale the old man nodded pahute eh yes why do you savvy the talk some i lived in california once where the question came like a shot oh here and there i followed the mother lode for a spell i dont recall the name said the trader after a bit possibly where were you located i never lit on any one place long enough to call it home it seemed to burrell that both men were sparring cautiously in an indirect impersonal manner those your kids too eh stark continued yes and i got another one besides older a girl shes a pip too said no creek lee fervently shes plumb beautiful all of them halfbreeds questioned stark sure the traders answer was short and when the other showed no intention of pressing the subject further he sauntered away but no sooner was he out of hearing than stark said humph theyre all alike who squawmen this one aint lee declared hes different aint he lieutenant he certainly is agreed burrell this was the first criticism he had heard of necias father and although stark volunteered no argument it was plain that his opinion remained unaffected the old man went through the store at the rear and straightway sought alluna speaking to her with unwonted severity in the pahute language he said i have told you never to use your native tongue before strangers that man in the store understands i only asked for sugar to cook the berries with she replied true but another time you might say more therefore the less you speak it the better he is the kind who sees much and talks little address me in siwash or in english unless we are alone i do not like that man said the woman his eyes are bad like a fish eagles and he has no heart suddenly she dropped her work and came close up to him can he be the one i dont know stark is not the name but he might have changed it he had reasons enough who is this man stark i dont know that either i used to hear of him when i was in british columbia but surely you must know if he is the same she must have told you how he looked others must have told you gale shook his head very little i could not ask her and others knew him so well they never doubted that i had seen him but this much i do know he was dark this man is dark and his spirit was like that of a mad horse this mans temper is black and his eyes were cruel this man has evil eyes he lacked five years of my age said the trader this man is forty years old it must be he said the squaw even necia would have marvelled had she heard this revelation of her fathers age for his hair and brows were grizzled and his face had the look of a man of sixty while only those who knew him well like doret were aware of his great strength and the endurance that belied his appearance we will send necia down to the mission tonight and let father barnum keep her there till this man goes said the squaw after some deliberation no she must stay here gale replied with decision the man has come here to live so it wont do any good to send her away and after all what is to be will be but she must never be seen in that dancegirls dress again at least not till i learn more about this stark it makes no difference whether this one is the man or not he will come and i shall know him for a year i have felt that the time was growing short and now i know it no no alluna cried we have no strangers here no white men except the soldiers and this one have come in a year this is but a little tradingpost it was yesterday but it isnt today lee has made a strike like the one george carmack made on the klondike he came to tell me and poleon and we are going back with him tonight but you must say nothing or it will start a stampede other men will come a great many of them interrogated alluna fearfully ignoring utterly the momentous news yes flambeau will be another dawson if this find is what lee thinks it is i stayed away from the upper country because i knew crowds of men would come from the states and i feared that he might be among them but its no use hiding any longer theres no other place for us to go if lee has got a mine ill have the one next to it for we will be the first ones on the ground what happens after that wont matter much you four will be provided for we are to leave in an hour one at a time to avoid comment but why did this man stop here insisted the woman why did he not stay on the steamboat and go to dawson hes a friend of lees he is going with us then he added almost in a whisper before we return i shall know alluna seized his arm promise to come back john promise that you will come back even if this should be the man i promise dont worry little woman im not ready for a reckoning yet he gave her certain instructions about the store charging her in particular to observe the utmost secrecy regarding the strike else she might precipitate a premature excitement which would go far towards ruining his and poleons chances all of which she noted then as he turned away she laid her hand on his arm and said if you do not know him he will not know you is it not so yes then the rest is easy but he only shook his head doubtfully and answered perhaps i am not sure and went inside where he made up a light pack of bacon flour and tea a pail or two a coffeepot and a fryingpan which he rolled inside a robe of rabbitskin and bound about in turn with a light tarpaulin it did not weigh thirty pounds in all selecting a new pair of waterboots he stuffed dry grass inside them oiled up his sixshooter then slipped out the back way and in five minutes was hidden in the thickets half an hour later having completed a detour of the town he struck the trail to the interior where he found poleon doret equipped in a similar manner resting beside a stream singing the songs of his people when burrell returned to his quarters he tried to mitigate the feeling of lonesomeness that oppressed him by tackling his neglected correspondence somehow today the sense of his isolation had come over him stronger than ever his rank forbade any intimacy with his miserable handful of men who had already fallen into the monotony of routine while every friendly overture he made towards the citizens of flambeau was met with distrust and coldness his stripes of office seeming to erect a barrier and induce an ostracism stronger and more complete than if they had been emblems of the penitentiary he began to resent it keenly even doret and the trader seemed to share the general feeling hence the thought of the long lonesome winter approaching reduced the lieutenant to a state of black despondency deepened by the knowledge that he now had an open enemy in camp in the person of runnion then too he had taken a morbid dislike to the new man stark so that all in all the youth felt he had good reason to be in the dumps this afternoon there was nothing desirable in this place everything undesirable except necia her presence in flambeau went far towards making his humdrum existence bearable but of late he had found himself dwelling with growing seriousness on the unhappy circumstances of her birth and had almost made up his mind that it would be wise not to see her any more the tempting vision of her in the balldress remained vividly in his imagination causing him hours of sweet torment there was a sparkle a fineness a gentleness about her that seemed to make the few women he had known well dull and commonplace and even his sister whom till now he had held as the perfection of all things feminine suffered by comparison with this maiden of the frontier he was steeped in this sweet grave melancholy when a knock came at his door and he arose to here excited and radiant she came in without sign of embarrassment or slightest consciousness of the possible impropriety of her act the most wonderful thing has happened she began at once when she found they were alone youll faint for joy what is it nobody knows except father and poleon and the two new men what is it i teased the news out of mother and then came right here he laughed but what may i ask lee has made a strike a wonderful strike richer than the klondike so the old mans luck has changed im right glad of that said the soldier i came as fast as i could because tomorrow everybody will know about it and it will be too late too late for what for us to get in on it of course oh but wont there be a stampede why all the people bound for dawson on the next boat will pile off here then the news will go upriver and downriver and thousands of others will come pouring in from everywhere and this will be a city then we will stake our town lots and sell them for ever so much money and go around with our noses in the air and they will say to each other who is that beautiful lady with the fine clothes and somebody will answer why that is miss necia gale the mineowner and then you will come along and they will say that is lieutenant burrell the millionaire and hold on hold on said the soldier stopping her breathless patter tell me all about this well no creek came in this morning to tell dad and poleon then the boat arrived with an old friend of lees a mr stark so lee told him too and now theyve all gone back to his creek to stake more claims they slipped away quietly to prevent suspicion but i knew there was something up from the way poleon acted so i made alluna tell me all about it they havent more than two hours start of us and we can overtake them easily we why we are not going yes we are she insisted impatiently you and i thats why i came so you can get a mine for yourself and be a rich man and so you can help me get one i know the way hurry up no said he in as firm a tone as he could command in the first place these men dont like me and they dont want me to share in this what do you care in the second place im not a miner i dont know how to proceed nevermind i do ive heard nothing but mining all my life in the third place i dont think i have the right for im a soldier im working for uncle sam and i dont believe i ought to take up mining claims im not sure there is anything to prevent it but neither am i sure it would be quite the square thing are you why of course its all right said necia her eager face clouding with the look of a hurt child if you dont do it somebody else will but the lieutenant shook his head maybe im foolish but i cant see my way clear much as i would like to oh dear oh dear she exclaimed brokenly i do so want to go i want you to be rich and i want to be rich myself i want to be a fine lady and go outside and live like other girls its the only chance i ever had and ill never have another oh it means so much to me it means life future everything why it means heaven to a girl like me her eyes were wet with the sudden dashing of her hopes and her chin quivered in a sweet girlish way that made the youth almost surrender on the instant but she turned to the window and gazed out over the river continuing after a moments pause please dont mind me but you cant understand what a difference this would make to me we couldnt possibly overtake them if we tried he said as if willing to treat with his conscience no but we could beat them in i know where lee is working for i went up last winter with constantine and his dogteam over a short cut by way of black bear creek we took it coming back and i could find it again but lee doesnt know that route so he will follow the summer trail which is fifteen miles farther you see his creek makes a great bend to the southward and heads back towards the river so by crossing the divide at the source of black bear you drop into it a few miles above his cabin while she made this appeal burrell fought with himself there were reasons why he longed to take this trip more than he had longed for anything since boyhood these men of flambeau had disregarded him and insisted on treating him with contemptuous distrust despite his repeated friendly overtures wherefore he was hungry to beat them at their own game hungry to thrust himself ahead of them and compel them to reckon with him as an equal preferring a state of open enmity if necessary to this condition of indifferent toleration moreover he knew that necia was coveted by half of them and if he spent a night in the woods alone with her it would stir them up a bit he fancied by heaven that would make them sit up and notice him but then it might work a wrong upon her and yet would it he was not so sure that it would she had come to him she was old enough to know her mind and she was but a halfbreed girl after all who doubtless was not so simple as she seemed other men had no such scruples in this or any other land and yet the young man hesitated until encouraged by his silence the girl came forward and spoke again impulsively dont be silly mr burrell come please come with me wont you she took him by the edges of his coat and drew him to her coaxingly it may have been partly the spirit of revolt that had been growing in him all day or it may have been wholly the sense of her there beside him warm and pleading but something caused a great wave to surge up through his veins caused him to take her in his arms fiercely kissing her upturned face again and again crying softly deep down in his throat yes yes yes you little witch ill go anywhere with you anywhere anywhere the impulse was blind and ungovernable and it grew as his lips met hers while strangely enough she made no resistance yielding herself quietly till he found her arms wound softly about his neck and her face nestling close to his neither of them knew how long they stood thus blended together but soon he grew conscious of the beating of her heart against his breast as she lay there like a little fluttering bird and felt the throbbing of his own heart swaying him her arms her lips and her whole body clung to his in a sweet surrender and yet there was nothing immodest or unmaidenly about it for his strength and ardor had lifted her and drawn her to him as on the sweep of a great wave she drew her face free and hid it against his neck breathing softly and with shy timidity as if the sound of the words she whispered half frightened her i love you i love you meade it may happen that a man will spend months in friendly and charming intimacy with a woman and never feel the violence or tenderness of passion till there comes a psychic moment or a physical touch that suddenly enwraps them like a flame so it was with burrell the sweet burden of this girl in his arms the sense of her yielding lips the warmth of her caressing hands momentarily unleashed a leaping pack of mad desires and it was she who finally drew herself away to remind him smilingly that he was wasting time my lips will be here when those mines are worked out she said no no and she held him off as he came towards her again insisting that if they were going they must be off at once and that he could have no more kisses for the present but of course it is a long trip and we will have to sit down now and then to rest she added shyly at which he vowed that he was far from strong and could not walk but a little way at a time yet even so he declared the trail would be too short even though it led to canada then get your pack made up she ordered for we must be well up towards the head of black bear creek before it grows dark enough to camp swiftly he made his preparations a madness was upon him now and he took no pains to check or analyze the reasons for his decision the thought of her loveliness in his arms once more far up among the perfumed wooded heights as the silent darkness stole upon them stirred in him such a fret to be gone that it was like a fever he slipped away to the barracks with instructions for his corporal but was back again in a moment finally he took up his burden of blanket and food then said to her well are you ready little one yes meade she answered simply and you are sure you wont regret it not while you love me he kissed her again before they stepped out on the river trail that wound along the bank a hundred yards beyond they were hidden by the groves of birch and fir two hours later they paused where the foaming waters of black bear creek rioted down across a gravelled bar and into the silent sweeping river standing at the entrance to a wooded grassgrown valley with rolling hills and domes displayed at its head while back of them lay the town six miles away its low squat buildings tiny and toy like but distinctly silhouetted against the evening sky is it not time to rest said the soldier laughingly yet with a look of yearning in his misty eyes as he took the girlish figure in his arms but she only smiled up at him and releasing his hold led the way into the forest he turned for a moment and shook his fist at the village and those in it laughing loudly as if from the feel of the blood that leaped within him then he joined his companion and handinhand they left the broad reaches of the greater stream behind them and plunged into the untrodden valley chapter v a story is begun its fonny ting how two brown eye was changin everything de cloud shes no more on de sky an winters jus lak spring dey mak my pack so very light de trail shes not so long id walk it forty mile tonight for hear her sing wan song but now im busy mak fortune for marry on dat girl an if shes tole me yass dats soon bonheur im own de worl poleon doret sang gayly as the trader came towards him through the open grove of birch for he was happy this afternoon and being much of a dreamer this fresh enterprise awoke in him a boyish pleasure then necia had teased him as he came away and begged him as was always her custom to take her with him no matter whence or whither so long as there was adventure afoot well it would not be long now before he could say yes and he would take her on a journey far longer than either of them had yet taken a journey that would never end had not the gods looked with favor at last upon his long novitiate and been pleased with the faith he had kept had not this discovery of no creek lees been providentially arranged for his own especial benefit a fool could see that this was a mark of celestial approbation and none but a fool would question the wisdom of the gods had he not watched the girl grow from a slip of thirteen and spoken never a word of his love had he not served and guarded her with all the gentle chivalry of an olden knight of course and here was his reward a gift of wealth to crown his service all for her now that she was a woman and had seen him tried and knew he was a man he would bring his burden of prosperity and lay it at her feet saying here is another offering my necia and with it go the laughter and the music and the heart of poleon doret sacre it would not take her long to wake up after that the world was very bright indeed this afternoon and he burst again into song in company with the voices of the forest people chante rossignol chante toi qui d le coeur gai tu as le coeur a rire mai j l aita pleurer il y a longtemps que j taime jamais je ne toublierai footnote sing little bird oh sing away you with the voice so light and gay yours is a heart that laughter cheers mine is a hearts thats full of tears long have i loved i love her yet leave her i can but not forget whew said gale slipping out of his packstraps the skeeters is bad you bet your gum boots said poleon deyre mos so tick as de summer dey kill johnnie platt on de porcupine both men wore gauntleted gloves of caribouskin and head harnesses of mosquitonetting stretched over globelike frames of thin steel bands which they slipped on over their hats after the manner of divers helmets for without protection of some kind the insects would have made travel impossible once the yukon breezes were left behind or once the trail dipped from the high divides where there was no moss lets see it was you that found him wasnt it said gale sure ting im comin down for grub in my canoe wen i see dis feller on de bank

dats orrible sight dem fly is drive im crazee hees nose an ears is look lak holes in beeg red sponge an hees eye are close up tight he died before you got him in didnt he yes he was good man too some tam if i ever have bad enemy wat i like to see catch hell im goin turn im loose mong dose skeeterbug holy mackinaw ejaculated gale whod ever think of that why thats worse than dropping water on his skull till he goes crazy like them chinamen do the frenchman nodded its de wors ting i know dats wy i lak to geeve it to my enemy imagine fightin the little devils till they stung you crazy and pizened your eyes shut gale fell to considering this while poleon filled his pipe and raising his veil undertook to smoke the pests proved too numerous however and forced him to give it up bagosh deyre hongry it will be all right when we get out of the woods said the elder man i guess you been purty glad for havin necia home again eh ventured the other after a while unable to avoid any longer the subject uppermost in his mind yes im glad shes through with her schooling shes gettin purty beeg gal now thats right byanby shes goin marry on some feller wat i suppose so she aint the kind to stay single ha dats right too mebbe you don care if she does get marry eh not if she gets a man that will treat her right wal wal deres no trouble bout dat exclaimed doret fervently no man wats livin could treat her bad shes too good an too purty for have bad husban she is is she gale turned on him with a strange glare in his eyes thems the kind that get the hedevils theres something about a good girl that attracts a bad man particularly if shes pretty and it goes double too the good men get the hellions a fellow cant get so tough but what he can catch a good woman and a decent man usually draws a critter that looks like a sled and acts like a timber wolf necia wouldnt marry on no bad man said doret positively no said gale let me tell you what i saw with my own eyes i knew a girl once that was just as good and pure as necia and just as pretty too yes and a thousand times prettier ho ho laughed doret sceptically she was an eastern girl and she come west where men were different to what shed been used to those were early days and it was a new country where a person didnt know much about his neighbors past and cared less and although there were a heap of girls thereabouts they were the kind youll always find in such communities while this one was plumb different man man but she was different she was a woman two fellows fell in love with her one of them lived in the same camp as her and he was a good man leastways everybody said he was but he wasnt wise to all the fancy tricks that pretty women hanker after and it being his first affair he was right down buffaloed at the very thought of her so he just hung around and slept late so that he might dream about her and feel like he was her equal or that she loved back at him you know the other fellow came from a neighboring town and he wasnt the same kind for hed knocked around more and was a better liar but he wasnt right no sir he was sure a wrong guy as it came out but he was handsomer and younger and the very purity and innocence of the girl drew him i reckon being a change from what he had ever mixed up with wy don dis good man tak a shot at him asked poleon hotly first he didnt realize what was going on being too tied up with dreaming i reckon and second neither man didnt know the other by sight living as they did in different parts third he was an ordinary sort of fellow and hadnt ever had any trouble man to man at that time anyhow the girl up and took the bad one wat does de good man do eh well he was all tore up about it but he went away like a sick quail hides out dats too bad he heard about them now and then and what he heard tore him up worse than the other had for the girls husband couldnt wear the harness long and having taken away what good there was in her he made up in deviltry for the time he had lost she stood it pretty well and never whimpered even when her eyes were open and she saw what a prizepackage she had drawn the fact that she was game enough to stand for him and yet keep herself clean without complaint made the man worse he tried to break her spirit in a thousand ways tried to make her the same as he was tried to make her a bad woman like the others he had known it appeared like the one pleasure he got was to torture her wy don she quit im said doret dat ain wrong for quit a man lak him she couldnt quit on account of the kid they had a youngster then too she had ideas of her own so she stood it for three years living worse than a dog till she saw it wasnt any use till she saw that he would make a bad woman of her as sure as he would make one of the kid till he got rough no no you don mean dat no man don hurt no woman interjected doret by god thats just what i mean the trader answered while his face had grown so gray as to match his brows he beat her poleon broke into french words that accorded well with the traders harsh voice the woman sent for the other man after that for he had been living lonely loving her all the time and youd better believe he went ha dats fine dats dam fine said the other ill bet deres hell to pay den wat yes there was a kind of reckoning the old man lapsed into moody silence the younger one waiting eagerly for him to continue but there came the sound of voices down the trail and they looked up here comes lee said gale wat happen den im got great interes bout dis woman insisted poleon its a long story and i just told you this much to show what i said was true about a good girl and a bad man and to show why i want necia to get a good one the sooner it happens the better it will suit me neither man had ever spoken thus openly to the other about necia before and although their language was indirect each knew the others thought but there was no time for further talk now for the others were close upon them as they came into view gale exclaimed well if he hasnt brought runnion along humph grunted doret i don tink much of dat feller wats de matter wit no creek anyhow the three new arrivals dropped down upon the moss to rest for the uptrail was heavy and the air sultry inside the forest lee was the first to speak did you get away without bein seen he asked sure answered gale poleon has been here two hours thats good i dont want nobody taggin along we came right through the town boldly announced stark but if they had seen you two they would have suspected something sure runnion volunteered nothing except oaths at the mosquitoes and at his packstraps which were new and cut him already as no explanation of his presence was offered neither the trader nor doret made any comment then but it came out later when the old miner dropped far enough behind the others to render conversation possible you decided to take in another one eh gale asked lee it wasnt exactly my doins replied the miner stark asked me to let runnion come long bein as he had grubstaked him and he seemed so set on it that i ackeressed you see its the first chance i ever had to pay him back for a favor he done me in the cassiar country theres plenty of land to go around it was lees affair thought the trader and he might tell whom he liked so he said no more but fell to studying the back of the man next in front who happened to be stark observing every move and trick of him and during the frequent pauses making a point of listening and watching him guardedly all through the afternoon the five men wound up the valley following one anothers footsteps emerging from sombre thickets of fir to flounder across wide pastures of niggerheads that wobbled and wriggled and bowed beneath their feet until at cost of much effort and profanity they gained the firmer footing of the forest occasionally they came upon the stream and found easier going along its gravel bars till a bend threw them again into the meadows and mesas on either hand their course led them far up the big valley to another stream that entered from the right bearing backward in a great bow towards the yukon and always there were dense clouds of mosquitoes above their heads at one point stark hot and irritable remarked there must be a shorter cut than this lee i reckon there is the miner replied but ive always had a pack to carry so i chose the level ground ruther than climb the divides spose dose people at camp hear bout dis strike an beat us in suggested poleon it wouldnt be easy going for them after they got there stark said sourly i for one wouldnt stand for it nor i agreed runnion i dont see how youd help yourself the trader remarked one mans got as good a right as another i guess id help myself all right stark laughed significantly as did runnion who added lee is entitled to put in anybody he wants on his own discovery and if anybody tries to get ahead of us theres liable to be trouble i reckon if i dont know no shortcut nobody else does lee remarked whereupon doret spoke up reassuringly deres no use gettin scare lak dat biccause nobody knows were lees creek shes locate but john an me an deres nobody wat knows he mak de strike but us four thats right said gale the only other way across is by black bear creek and there aint a halfdozen men ever been up to the head of that stream much less over the divide so i dont allow theres any use to fret ourselves they went on their way travelling leisurely until late evening when they camped at the mouth of the valley up which the miners cabin lay they chose a long gravel bar that curved like a scimitar and made down upon its outer tip where the breeze tended to thin the plague of insects they were all oldstagers in the ways of camplife so there was no lost motion or bickering as to their respective duties their preparations were simple first they built a circle of smudges out of wet driftwood and inside this lee kindled a campfire of dry sticks upon which he cooked protected by the smoke of the others while gale went back to the edge of the forest and felled a dozen small firs the branches of which he clipped these poleon and runnion bore down to the end of the spit for bedding while stark chopped a pile of dry wood for the night gale noted that the new man swung an axe with the free dexterity of one to whom its feel was familiar also that he never made a slip nor dulled it on the gravel of the bar displaying an allround completeness and a knack of doing things efficiently that won reluctant approval from the trader despite the unreasoning dislike he had taken to him lee was ready for them by the time they had finished their tasks and fanned by the breeze that sucked up the stream and lulled by the waters they ate their scanty supper their oneeyed guide had lived so long among mosquitoes and had become so inoculated with their poison that he was in a measure impervious to their sting hence the insects gathered on his wrinkled hairgrown hide only to give up in melancholy disgust and fly to other and fullerblooded feedinggrounds camp had been made early at gales suggestion instead of pushing on a few miles farther as lee had intended and now when the cool evening fell and the draught quickened it became possible to lay off gloves and headgear so they sat about the fire talking smoking and rubbing their tired feet it is at such hours and in the smoke of such fires that men hark backward and bring forth the sacred timeworn memories they have treasured to turn them over fondly by the glow of dying embers it is at such times that mens garrulity asserts itself for the barriers of caution are let down as are the gates of remembrance and it is then that friends and enemies are made for there are those who cannot listen and others who cannot understand no creek lee the oneeyed miner who had made this lucky strike told in simple words of his long and solitary quest when illluck had risen with him at the dawn and misfortune had stalked beside him as he drifted and drank from camp to camp while the gloom of a settled pessimism soured him and men began to shun him because of the evil that seemed to follow in his steps ive been rainbowchasin forty years he said and never caught nothin but cramps and epidemics and inflammations im the only miner in alaska that never made a discovery of gold and never had a creek named after him is that how you got your name asked runnion it is i never was no good to myself nor nobody else i just occupied space ive been the vermifuge appendix of the body politic yes worsen that ive been an appendix with a seed in it i made myself sore and everybody around me but im at the bat now and dont you never let that fact escape you how are you going to spend your money inquired stark im goin to eat it up ive fed on dried and desiccated and other disastrous and dissatisfactory diets till im all shrivelled up inside like a dead puffball now its me for the big feed and the long drink im goin to frisco and get full of wasteful and exorbitant grub of one kind and another like tomatters and french vicious water poleon doret laughed with the others he was bubbling with the spirits of a boy whose life is clean for whom there are no eyes in the black dark that lies beyond a campfire and for whom there are no unforgettable faces in its smoke when lee fell silent the trader and stark resumed their talk which was mainly of california it seemed to the frenchman who also noted that it was his friend who subtly shaped the topics in time their stories revived his memory of the conversation in the birch grove that morning and when there occurred a lapse in the talk he said say john wat happen to dat gal we was talkin bout dis mornin gale shook his head and turned again to his companion but the young mans mind was bent on its quest and he continued dat was strange tale for sure what was it questioned runnion john was tell bout a feller he knowed wat marry a good gal jus to mak her bad lak hesef hows that inquired stark turning curiously upon the old man but gale knocked the ashes from his pipe and replied oh its a long story happened when i was in washington state poleon was about to correct him it was california he had said when gale arose remarking sleepily that it was time to turn in if they wished to get any rest before the mosquitoes got bad again then sauntered away from the fire and spread his blanket the rest followed and made down their beds then drawing on gloves and hatnets and rolling themselves up in their coverings fell to snoring all except the trader who lay for hours on his back staring up at the stars as if trying to solve some riddle that baffled him they awoke early and in half an hour had eaten remade their packs and were ready to resume their march as they were about to start gale said i reckon wed better settle right now who has the choice of locations when we get up yonder ive been on stampedes where it saved a heap of hard feeling im agreeable said stark then there wont be any misunderstanding the others being likewise old at the game acquiesced they knew that in such cases grave trouble has often occurred when two men have cast eyes on the same claim and have felt the miners causeless hunch that gold lies here or there or that the ground one of them covets is wanted by the other ill hold the straws said lee and every feller will have an even break turning his back on the others he cut four splinters of varying lengths and arranging them so that the ends peeped evenly from his big hand he held them out the longest one has the first choice and so on he said presenting them to gale who promptly drew the longest of the four he turned to doret but the frenchman waved him courteously to stark and when both he and runnion had made their choice lee handed him the remaining one which was next in length to that of the trader stark and runnion qualified in the order they drew the latter cursing his evil luck never min ole man laughed poleon de las shot shes de sure wan they took up their burdens again and filed towards the narrow valley that stretched away into the hazy distances chapter vi the burrell code not until his dying day will burrell lose the memory of that march with necia through the untrodden valley and yet its incidents were never clearcut nor distinct when he looked back upon them but blended into one dreamlike procession as if he wandered through some calenture where every image was delightfully distorted and each act deliriously unreal yet all the sweeter from its fleeting unreality they talked and laughed and sang with a rush of spirits as untamed as the waters in the course they followed they wandered handinhand into a land of illusions where there was nothing real but love and nothing tangible but joy the touch of their lips had waked that delight which comes but once in a lifetime and then to but few it was like the moonmadness of the tropics or the dementia of the forest folk in spring a gentle frenzy possessed them rendering them insensible to fatigue and causing them to hurry the more breathlessly that they might sooner rest and sit beside each other at times they fell into sweet silences where the waters laughed with them and the trees whispered their secret bowing and nodding in joyous surprise at this invasion or again the breezes romped with them withdrawing now and then to rush out and greet them at the bends in boisterous pleasure they held to the bed of the stream for its volume was low and enabled them to ford it from bar to bar necia had been raised in the open with the wild places for her playground and her muscles were like those of a boy hence the two swung merrily onward as if in playful contest while the youth had never occasion to wait for her or to moderate his gait indeed her footing was more sure than his as he found when she ventured out unhesitatingly upon felled logs that lay across swift brawling depths the wilderness had no mystery for her and no terrors so she was ever at his side or in advance while her eyes schooled in the tints of the forest and more active than those of a bird saw every moving thing from the flash of a camprobbers wing through some hidden glade to the inquisitive nodding of a fool hen where it perched high up against the bole of a spruce they surprised a marten fishing in a driftwood dam but she would not let the soldier shoot and made him pass it by where it sat amazed till it realized that these were lovers and resumed its fishing gradually the stream diminished and its bowldered bed became more difficult to traverse until assuming the airs of a leader the girl commanded him to lay off his pack at which he pretended to obey mutinously though thrilling with the keenest delight at his own submission what are you going to do he inquired mind your own business sir she commanded sternly from her belt she drew a little huntingknife with which she cut and trimmed a slender birch the thickness of his thumb whereupon he pretended great fright and said please please what have i done a great deal you are a most bold and stubborn creature all pack animals are stubborn he declared its the only privilege they have you are much too presumptuous also as i discovered in your quarters my only presumption is in loving you that was not presumption she smiled it was preemption you must be punished i shall run away he threatened i shall gallop right off through the woods and begin to eat grass i am very wild as she talked she drew from her pocket a spool of line and took a flyhook from her hat then in a trice she had rigged a fishingrod and creeping out upon a ledge she whipped the pool below of a halfdozen rainbow trout which she thrust into his coat while they were still wriggling then she as quickly put up her gear and they resumed their journey climbing more steeply now until when the sun was low they quit the streambed and made through the forest towards the shoulder of an untimbered ridge that ran down into the valley and there high up on the edge of the spruce they selected a mossy shelf and pitched their camp they had become so intimate by now as to fall into a whimsical mode of speech and necia reverted to a childish habit in her talk that brought many a smile to the youths face it had been her fancy as a little girl to speak in adjectives ignoring many of her nouns and its quaintness had so amused her father that on rare occasions when the humor was on him he also took it up she now addressed herself to burrell in the same manner i think we are very smarts to come so far she said you travel like a deer he declared admiringly why you have tired me down removing his pack he stretched his arms and shook out the ache in his shoulders which way does our course lie now pathfinder right up the side of this big and then along the ridge in two hours we come to a gully running so she indicated an imaginary direction which we go down till it joins another stream so and right there well find old no creeks cabin so wont they be surprised to see us i think were very cunning to beat them in dont you she laughed a glad little bubbling laugh and he cried oh girl how wonderful you are its getting very dark and fierce she chided and all the housework must be done so he built a fire then fetched a bucket of water from a rill that trickled down among the rocks near by he made as if to prepare their meal but she would have none of it bigs should never cook she declared that work belongs to littles then forced him to vacate her domain and turn himself to the manlier duties of chopping wood and boughs first however she showed him how to place two green footlogs upon which the teapot and the fryingpan would sit without upsetting and how long she wished the sticks of cookingwood then she banished him as it were and he built a wickiup of spruce tops under the shelter of which he piled thick fragrant billows of yukon feathers once while he was busy at his task he paused to revel in the colors that lay against hill and valley and to drink in the splendid isolation of it all below lay the bed of black bear creek silent and sombre in the creeping twilight beyond away beyond across the westward brim of the yukon basin the peaks were blue and ivory and gold in the last rays of the sun while the open slopes behind and all about wore a carpet of fragrant shortlived flowers nodding as if towards sleep and over all was the hush of the lonely hills a gust blew a whiff of the camp smoke towards him and he turned back to watch necia kneeling beside the fire like some graceful virgin at her altar rites while the peculiar acrid outdoor odor of burning spruce was like an incense in his nostrils he filled his chest deeply and leaned on his axe for he found himself shaking as if under the spell of some great expectancy your supper is getting cold she called to him he took a seat beside her on a pile of boughs where the smoke was least troublesome he had chosen a spot that was sheltered by a lichencovered ledge and this low wall behind with the wickiup joining it formed an enclosure that lent them a certain air of privacy they ate ravenously and drank deep cupfuls of the unflavored tea by the time they were finished the night had fallen and the air was just cool enough to make the fire agreeable burrell heaped on more wood and stretched out beside her this day has been so wonderful said the girl that i shall never go to sleep i cant bear to end it but you must be weary little maid he said gently i am wait let me see she stretched her limbs and moved slightly to try her muscles yes i am a very tired but not the kind of tired that makes you want to go to bed i want to talk talk talk and not about ourselves either but about sensibles tell me about your people your sister he had expected her to ask this for the subject seemed to have an inexhaustible charm for her she would sit rapt and motionless as long as he cared to talk of his sister in her wide meditative eyes the shadow of a great unvoiced longing it always seemed to make her grave and thoughtful he had noticed so he had tried lately to avoid the topic and tonight in particular he wanted to do so for this was no time for melancholy he had not even allowed himself to think as yet and there were reasons why he did not wish her to do so thought and realization and a readjustment of their relations would come after tonight but this was the hour of illusion and it must not be broken therefore he began to tell her of other people and of his youth making his tales as fanciful as possible choosing deliberately to foster the merry humor in which they had been all day he told her of his father the crotchety old soldier whose absurd sense of duty and whose elaborate southern courtesy had become a byword in the south he told her household tales that were prized like pieces of the burrell plate beautiful heirlooms of sentiment that mark the honor of highblooded houses following which there was much to recount of the meades from the admiral who fought as a boy in the bay of tripoli down to the cousin who was at annapolis the while his listener hung upon his words hungrily her mind so quick in pursuit of his that it spurred him unconsciously her great dark eyes half closed in silent laughter or wide with wonder and in them always the warmth of the leaping firelight blended with the trust of a newborn virginal love without realizing it the young man drifted further than he had intended and further than he had ever allowed himself to go before for in him was a clean and honest pride of birth like his mothers glory in her forebears the expression of which he had learned to repress inasmuch as it was a dixieland conceit and had been misunderstood when he went north to the academy in some this would have seemed bigoted and feminine this immoderate admiration for his own blood this exaggerated appreciation of his family honor but in this southern youth it was merely the unconscious commendation of an upright manliness for an upright code when he had finished the girl remarked with honest approval what a fine you are those people of yours have all been good men and women havent they most of them he admitted and i think the reason is that weve been soldiers the army discipline is good for a man it narrows a fellow i suppose but it keeps him straight then he began to laugh silently what is it she said curiously oh nothing i was just wondering what my straitlaced ancestors would say if they could see me now what do you mean the girl asked in openeyed wonderment i dont care he went on unheeding her question they did worse things in their time from what i hear he leaned forward to draw her to him worse things but we are doing nothing bad said necia holding him off theres no wrong in loving of course not he assured her i am proud of it she declared it is the finest thing the greatest thing that has ever come into my life why i simply cant hold it i want to sing it to the stars and cry it out to the whole world dont you i hardly think wed better advertise he said dryly why not well i shouldnt care to publish the tale of this excursion of ours would you i dont see any reason against it i have often taken trips with poleon and been gone with him for days and days at a time but you were not a woman then he said softly no not until today thats true dear dear how i did grow all of a sudden and yet im just the same as i was yesterday and ill always be the same just a wild little please dont ever let me be a big tame i dont want to be commonplace and ordinary i want to be natural and good you couldnt be like other women he declared and there was more tenderness than hunger in his tone now as she looked up at him trustingly from the shelter of his arms it would spoil you to grow up it is so good to be alive and to love you like this she continued dreamily staring into the fire i seem to have come out of a gloomy house into the glory of a warm spring day for my eyes are blinded and i cant see half the beautifuls i want to there are so many about me those are my arms interjected the soldier lightly in an effort to ward off her growing seriousness ive never been afraid of anything and yet i feel so safe inside them isnt it queer the young man became conscious of a vague discomfort and realized dimly that for hours now he had been smothering with words and caresses a something that had striven with him to be heard a something that instead of dying grew stronger the more utterly this innocent maid yielded to him it was as if he had ridden impulse with rough spurs in a fierce desire to distance certain voices and in the first mad gallop had lost them but now far back heard them calling again more strongly every moment a mans honor if old may travel feebly but its pursuit is persistent it was the talk about his people that had raised this damned uneasiness and indecision he thought why had he ever started it the marvellous part of it all continued the girl is that it will never end i know i shall love you always do you suppose i am really different from other girls everything is different tonight the whole world he declared impatiently i thought i knew myself but suddenly i seem strange in my own eyes ive had a big handicap she said but you must help me to overcome it i want to be like your sister he rose and piled more wood upon the fire what possessed the girl it was as if she knew each cunning joint of his armor as if she had realized her peril and had set about the awakening of his conscience deliberately and with a cautious wisdom beyond her years well she had done it and he swore to himself then he melted at the sight of her crouched there against the shadows following his every movement with her soul in her eyes the tenderest trace of a smile upon her lips he vowed he was a reprobate to wrong her so it was her white soul and her womans love that spoke when she beheld him gazing at her she tilted her head sidewise daintily like a little bird oh my what a fierce you are all at once her smile flashed up as if illumined by the leaping blaze and he crossed quickly kneeling beside her dear wonderful girl he said it is going to be my hearts work to see that you never change and that you remain just what you are you cant understand what this means to me for i too was blinded but the darkness of the night has restored my vision now you must go to sleep the hours are short and we must be going early he piled up a great sweetscented couch of springy boughs and fashioned her a pillow out of a bundle of smaller ones around which he wrapped his khaki coat then he removed her highlaced boots and taking her tiny feet one in the palm of either hand bowed his head over them and kissed them with a sense of her gracious purity and his own unworthiness he spread one of the big gray blankets over her and tucked her in while she sighed in delightful languor looking up at him all the time ill sit here beside you for a while he said i want to smoke a bit she stole a slim brown hand out from beneath the cover and snuggled it in his and he leaned forward closing her lids down with his lips her utter weariness was manifest for she fell asleep almost instantly her fingers twined about his in a childlike grip at times a great desire to feel her in his arms to have her on his breast surged over him for he had lived long apart from women and the solitude of the night seemed to mock him he was a strong man and in his veins ran the blood of wayward forebears ho were wont to possess that which they conquered in the lists of love mingled with which was the blood of spirited southern women who had on occasion loved not wisely according to kentucky rumor but only too well nevertheless they were honest men and women if oversentimental and had transmitted to him a heritage of chivalry and a high sense of honor and courage strange to say this little simple halfbreed girl had revived this honor and courage even when he tried most stubbornly to smother it if only her love was like her blood he might have had no scruples or if her blood were as pure as her love even then it would be easier but as it was he must give her up tonight and for all time her love had placed a barrier between them greater and more insurmountable than her blood he sat for a long time with the dwindling firelight playing about him his manhood and his desires locked in a grim struggle wondering at the hold this forest elf had gained upon him wondering how it was that she had stolen into his heart and head and taken such utter possession of him it would be no easy task to shut her out of his mind and put her away from him and she he gently withdrew his fingers from her grasp and seeking the other side of the wickiup covered himself over without disturbing her and fell asleep it was early dawn when necia crept to him i dreamed you had gone away she said shivering violently and drawing close oh it was a terrible awakening i was too tired to dream he said so i had to come and see if you were really here he quickly rekindled the fire and they made a hasty breakfast before the warmth of the rising sun had penetrated the cold air they had climbed the ridge and obtained a wondrous view of broken country the hills alight with the morning rays the valleys misty and mystical they made good progress on the summit which was paved with barren rock and sparsely carpeted with short moss while there was never a hint of insects to annoy them merrily they swung along buoyed up by an unnatural exaltation yet now and then as they drew near their destination the young man had a chilling premonition of evil to come and wondered if he had not been foolhardy to undertake this rash enterprise i wish stark was not one of lees party he said once he may misunderstand our being together this way but when he learns that we love each other that will explain everything im not so sure he doesnt know you as lee and poleon and your father do i think we had better say nothing at all about you and me to any one but why questioned the girl stopping abruptly they will know it anyhow when they see us i cant conceal it i am wiser in this than you are the soldier insisted and we mustnt act like lovers trust this to me oh i wont play that cried necia petulantly if all this is going to end when we get to lees cabin well stay right here forever he was not sure of all the logic he advanced in convincing her but she yielded finally saying well i suppose you know best and anyhow littles should always mind they clung to the divide for several hours then descended into the bed of a stream which they followed until it joined a larger one a couple of miles below and there sheltered in a grove of whispering firs they found lees cabin nestling in a narrow forked valley evidently the miner had selected a point on the main creek just below the confluence of the feeders as a place in which to prospect and burrell fell to wondering which one of these smaller streams supplied the run of gold theres no one here said necia gleefully weve beat them in weve beat them in they had been walking rapidly since dawn and although burrells watch showed two oclock she refused to halt for lunch declaring that the others might arrive at any moment so down they went to the lower end of no creek lees location where burrell blazed a smooth spot on the downstream side of a tree and wrote thereon at necias dictation when he had finished she signed her name and he witnessed it then paced off four hundred and forty steps where he squared a sprucetree which she marked lower centre end stake of no i below discovery necia gale locator she was vastly excited and immensely elated at her goodfortune in acquiring the claim next to lees and chattered like a magpie filling the glades with resounding echoes and dancing about in the bright sunlight that filtered through the branches now you stake the one below mine she said its just as good and maybe better nobody can tell but he shook his head im not going to stake anything said he you must she cried quickly the sparkle dying from her eyes you said you would or i never would have brought you i merely said i would come with you he corrected i did not promise to take up a claim for i dont think i ought to do so if i were a civilian it would be different but this is government land and i am a part of the government as it were then too in addition to the question of my right to do it there would be the certainty of making enemies of your people old no creek and the rest and i cant afford that now with you it is different for you are entitled to this ground after lees friends have shared in his discovery i may change my mind all arguments and pleading were in vain he remained obdurate and insisted on her locating two other claims for herself one on each of the smaller creeks where they came together above the house but nobody ever stakes more than one claim on a gulch objected the girl its a custom of the miners then well call each one of these branches a different and separate creek he said the gold was carried down one of those smaller streams and we wont take any chances on which one it was when a fellow plays a big game he should play to win and as this means such a great deal to you we wont overlook any bets necia consented and when her three claims had been properly located the couple returned to the cabin to get lunch and to await with some foreboding the coming of the others and what of good or ill it might bring chapter vii the magic of ben stark before the party came in sight the sound of their voices reached the cabin and burrell rose nervously and sauntered to the door uncertain how this affair might terminate he chose to get first look at his enemies if they should prove to be such realizing the advantage that goes to a man who stands squarely on both feet the trail came through the brush at the rear and he heard lee say this heres the place boys the shack aint fifty yards away likely looking gulch gale was heard to reply in his deep tones there was a crackle of dead brush a sound as of a man tripping and falling heavily then oaths in a voice that made the lieutenant start ha ha laughed doret you mus be tired meestaire rrunnion better you pick up your feet dats free tarn youve they emerged into the open behind the house to pause in line back of lee who was staring at the stovepipe of his cabin from which came a wisp of smoke it seemed to burrell that they held their position for a long time then he heard lee say well ill be damned somebodys here ahead of us weve been beaten growled stark angrily pushing past him and coming round the corner an ugly look in his eyes burrell was standing at ease in the door smoking one forearm resting on the jamb his wide shoulders nearly filling the entrance goodafternoon he nodded pleasantly lee answered him unintelligibly stark said nothing but runnions exclamation was plain its that damned bluebelly when did you get here said stark after a pause a few hours ago how did you come asked lee black bear creek said the soldier curtly at which runnion broke into profanity better hush burrell admonished him theres a lady inside and at that instant necia showed her laughing face under his arm while the trader uttered her name in amazement lunch is ready she said weve been expecting you for quite a while ba gar dats fonny ting for sure said poleon who tol you bout dis strike eh mother i made her the girl answered take off your packs and come in burrell invited but stark strode forward hold on a minute this dont look good to me you say your mother told you i suppose youre old man gales other daughter eh necia nodded what time of day was it when you learned about this cut that out roughly interjected gale do you think i doublecrossed you the other turned upon him it looks that way and i intend to find out you said yesterday you hadnt told anybody i didnt think about the woman said the trader a trifle disconcerted whereupon runnion gave vent to an ironical sneer but heres your girl and this man ahead of us i suppose theres others on the way too nonsense burrell cut in dont quarrel about this miss gale got wind of your secret and beat you at your own game so that ends it but theres plenty of ground left for all of you and no harm done nobody knows of this strike from us i can assure you i call it dam sleeck work chuckled the canadian slipping out of his straps de nex tam i go stampedin i tak you long necia me too said lee an now im goin to tear into some of them beans i smell a bilin in yonder the others followed although stark and runnion looked black and had little to say it was an uncomfortable meal every one was ill at ease gale in particular was quiet and ate less than any of them his eyes sought starks face frequently and once the blood left his cheeks and his eyes blazed as he observed the gambler eying necia gazing at her with the same boldness he would have used in scanning a horse you are a mighty goodlooking girl for a blood remarked stark at last thank you she replied simply and the soldiers vague dislike of the man crystallized into hate on the instant there was a tone back of his words that seemed aimed at the trader meade thought but gale showed no sign of it so the meal was finished in silence after which the five belated prospectors went out to make their locations for the fear of interruption was upon them now first they went downstream and according to their agreement the trader staked first followed by poleon and stark thus throwing runnions claim more than a mile distant from lees discovery from here they went up the creek to find the girls other locations one on each branch at which stark sneeringly remarked that she had preempted enough ground for a fullgrown white woman runnions displeasure was even more open and he fell into foulmouthed mutterings addressing himself to poleon and stark while the trader was out of earshot this affair dont smell right and i still think its a frameup bah exclaimed doret the old man sent the girl on ahead of us to blanket all the good ground thats what he did dats fool talk declared the frenchman im not so sure stark broke in you remember he hung back and wanted to go slow from the start and didnt he ask us to camp early last night looks now as if he did it just to give her time to get in first he admitted that he knew the black bear trail and if he lied about keeping his mouth shut to the squaw hed lie about other wait wan minnit interrupted poleon his voice as soft as a womans i tol you dat i know all bout dis black bear creek too you member eh wal mebbe you tink im traitor too wat wy don you spik out the three of them were alone and only the sound of gales axe came to them but at the light in the canadians face runnion hastily disclaimed any such thought on his part and stark shrugged his denial i don know you feller at all continued poleon but ole man gale hes my frien so i guess you don better talk no more lak dat dont get sore said stark i simply say it looks bad but the other had turned his back and was walking on there are men quite devoid of the ability to read the human face and runnion was of this species moreover malice was so bitter in his mouth that he must have it out so when they paused to blaze the next stake he addressed himself to stark loud enough for poleon to hear that lieutenant is more of a man than i thought he was how so inquired the older man well it takes nerve to steal a girl for one night and then face the father but the old man dont seem to mind it any more than she does i guess he knows what it means all right stark laughed raucously i thought of that myself he said thats probably how gale got his squaw concluded runnion with a sneer it seemed a full minute before the frenchman gave sign that he had heard then a strange cry broke from his throat and he began to tremble as if with cold he was no longer the singer of songs or the man who was forever a boy the mocking anger of a moment ago was gone in its place was a consuming fury that sucked the blood from beneath his tan leaving him the pallor of ashes while his mouth twitched and his head rolled slightly from side to side like a palsied old mans the red of his lips was blanched leaving two white streaks against a faded muddy background through which came strange and frightful oaths in a bastard tongue runnion drew back fearful and the older man ceased chopping and let his axe hang loosely in his hand but evidently poleon meant no violence for he allowed the passion to run from him freely until it had spent its vigor then said to runnion msieu eider you are brave man or dam fool what do you mean frenchy said the man addressed uneasily somebody goin die for wat you say jus now mebbe its goin be you msieu mebbe its goin be him i cant tell yet but im hope an pray its goin be you biccause i tink wat you say is a lie an nobody can spik dose kin of lie bout necia gale he went crashing blindly through the underbrush his head wagging his shoulders slumped loosely forward like those of a drunken man his lips framing words they could not understand when he had disappeared runnion drew a deep breath i guess ive framed something for mister burrell this time you go about it queer said stark id rather tackle a gangsaw than a man like poleon doret your frameup may work double huh no chance the soldier was out all night alone with that halfbreed girl and anybody can see shes crazy about him whats the answer well shes mighty pretty agreed the other most too pretty for a mixed blood but you cant make that frenchman believe shes wrong why he believes it now chuckled runnion or at least hes jealous and thats just as good those two will have trouble before dark i wish they would then id have a chance have you got your eye on her too sure do you blame me no but shes too good for you then shes too good for them i think ill enter the running better stay out the gambler advised youll have sore feet before you finish as a matter of fact i dont like her father any better than you like her lovers well its mutual i can see gale hates you like poison and i dont intend to see him and his tribe hog all the best ground hereabouts theyve already done it you cant stop them before answering stark listened for the trader but evidently gale had finished his task and returned to the shack for there was neither sign nor sound of him yes i can stop them said stark i want the ground that girl has staked and im going to get it it lies next to lees and its sure to be rich ours is so far away it may not be worth the recorders fees this creek may be as spotted as a coachdog so i dont intend to take any chances she made her locations legally said runnion you leave that to me when will the other boys he here tomorrow morning i told them to follow about four hours behind and not to run in on us till we had finished theyll camp a few miles down the creek and be in early you couldnt get but three eh thats all i could find who would agree to give up half can we count on them huh the other grunted they worked with me and soapy on the skagway trail good five against three not counting the girl and the lieutenant stark mused well that will do it he outlined his plan then the two returned to the cabin to find lee cooking supper poleon was there with the others but except for his silence he showed no sign of what had taken place that afternoon stark developed a loquacious mood after supper devoting himself entirely to necia in whom he seemed to take great interest he was an engaging talker with a peculiar knack of suggestion in storytelling an unconscious halting and elusiveness that told more than words could express and knowing his west so well he fascinated the girl who hung upon his tales with flattering eagerness poleon had finished several pipes and now sat in the shadows in the open doorway apparently tired and dejected though his eyes shone like diamonds and roved from one to the other half unconsciously he heard stark saying this girl was about your size but not so dark however you remind me of her in some ways thats why it puts her in my mind i suppose she was about your age at the time nineteen oh im not eighteen yet said necia well she was a fine woman anyhow the best that ever set foot in chandon and there was a great deal of talk when she chose young bennett over the gaylord man for bennett had been running second best from the start and everybody thought it was settled between her and the other one however they were married quietly the story did not interest the canadian his mind was in too great agitation to care for dead tales his heart burned within him too fiercely and he felt too great a desire to put his hands to work as he watched burrell and runnion bend over the table looking at a little can of golddust that lee had taken from under his bunk his eyes grew red and bloodshot beneath his hatbrim which one of the two would it be he wondered from the corner of his eye he saw gale rise from lees bed where he had stretched himself to smoke and take his sixshooter from his belt then remove the knotted bandanna from his neck and begin to clean the gun his head bowed over it earnestly his face in the shadow he had ever been a careful and methodical man reflected poleon and evidently would not go to sleep with his firearm in bad condition nobody imagined that gaylord would cause trouble stark was saying for he didnt seem to be a jealous sort just stupid and kind of heavywitted but one night he took advantage of bennetts absence and sneaked up to the house the storyteller paused and necia who was under the spell of his recital urged him on yes yes what happened then go on but stark stared gloomily at his hands and held his silence for a full minute the tale appearing to have awakened more than a fleeting interest in him it was one of the worst killings that ever happened in those parts he continued bennett came back to find his wife murdered and the kid gone oh said the girl in a shocked voice yes there was the deuce of a time the town rose up in a body and we you see i happened to be there we followed the man for weeks we trailed him and the kid clear over into the nevada desert where we lost them poor man poor man the storyteller raised his eyes and laughed sinisterly i dont see where that comes in and you never caught him no not yet he died of thirst in the desert maybe he and the little one thats what we thought at the time but i dont believe it now how so well ive crossed his trail since then no gaylord is alive today and so is the girl some time well meet his voice gave out and he stared again at the floor couldnt the little girl be traced said necia what was her name stark made to speak but the word was never uttered for there came a deafening roar that caused lees candle to leap and flicker and the air inside the cabin to strike the occupants like a blow instantly there was confusion and each man sprang to his feet crying out affrightedly for the noise had come with utter unexpectedness my god ive killed him cried gale and with one jump he cleared half the room and was beside stark while his revolver lay on the floor where he had been sitting what is it exclaimed burrell but there was no need to ask for powdersmoke was beginning to fill the room and the traders face gave answer it was whiter than that of his daughter who had crouched fearfully against the wall and he shook like a man with ague but stark stood unhurt and more composed than any of them following the first bound from his chair he had relapsed into his customary quiet there had blazed up one momentary flash of suspicion and anger but it died straightway for no man could have beheld the trader and not felt contrition his condition was pitiable and the sight of a strong man overcome is not pleasant when it was seen that no harm had been done the others strove to make light of the accident get together all of you its nothing to be excited over said stark how did it happen runnion finally asked gale who had sunk limply upon the edge of the bunk but when the old man undertook to answer his words were unintelligible and he shook his head helplessly stark laid his finger on the hole that the bullet had bored in the log close to where he was sitting and laughed never mind old man it missed me by six inches you know there never was a bullet that could kill me im sixshooter proof whad i tell you triumphantly ejaculated lee turning his one eye upon the lieutenant you laughed at me didnt you im beginning to believe it myself declared the soldier its a cinch said stark positively doret of all in the cabin had said nothing seated apart from the others he had seen the affair from a distance as it were and now stepped to the bed to lay his hand on gales shoulder brace up john sacre bleu your face look lak flour come outside an get lil air it will do you good father urged necia the trader silently rose picked up his hat and shambled out into the night behind the frenchman the old man takes it hard said lee shaking his head and burrell remarked ive seen things like that in army quarters and the fellow who accidentally discharges his gun invariably gets a greater shock than his companion i call it damned careless begging your pardon miss necia said runnion poleon led his friend down the trail for half a mile without speaking till gale had regained a grip of himself and muttered finally i never did such a thing before poleon never in all my life the young man turned squarely and faced him the starlight illumining their faces dimly why said doret why echoed gale with a start well because im careful i suppose why insisted the frenchman i i i what do you mean don lie wit me john im happen to be watch you underneat my hat wen you turn roun for see if anybody lookin you saw yes i thought you were asleep said gale chapter viii the knife in every community be it never so small there are undesirable citizens and while the little party was still at breakfast on the following morning three such members of society came around the cabin and let fall their packs greeting the occupants boisterously well well said lee coming to the door youre travellin kind of early aint you yes early and late one of them laughed while the other two sprawled about as if to rest how far are you goin not far the spokesman answered now in the north there is one formality that must be observed with friend or enemy and though lee knew these men for what they were he said better have some breakfast anyhow we just ate there was an uncomfortable pause then the speaker continued look here its no use to flush around we want a piece of this creek what are you goin to do with it cut that out lee were on who wised you up to this inquired the miner angrily for he had other friends besides those present whom he wished to profit by this strike and he had hoped to keep out this scum never mind who put us jerry were here aint we stark spoke up you cant keep news of a gold strike when the wind blows lee it travels on the breeze the harm was done and there was no use in concealment so lee reluctantly told them of his discovery and warned them of the stakes already placed and see here you fellers he concluded ive been forty years at this game and never had a creek named after me but this one is goin to be called no creek lee creek or i fight does it go sure thats a good name and well vote for it then go as far as you like said the miner dismissing them curtly ill step along with the boys and show them where our upper stakes are volunteered stark and runnion offered to do the same adding that it were best to make sure of no conflict so early in the game the five disappeared into the woods leaving the others at the cabin to make preparations for the homeward trip that man who did the talking is a tinhorn gambler who drifted in a month ago the same as runnion and the others aint much better said gale when they had gone seems like the crooks always beat the straight men in never knowed it to fail lee agreed theres a dozen good men in camp id like to see in on this find but itll be too late gin we get back dose bum an saloon feller got all de bes claims at klondike said poleon i guess its goin be de same here i dont like the look of this observed the lieutenant thoughtfully im afraid theres some kind of a job on foot theres nothing they can do gale answered weve got our ground staked out and its up to them to choose whats left they were nearly ready to set out for flambeau when the five men returned before you go said stark i think wed better organize our mining district there are enough present to do it we can make the kind of laws we want before the gang comes along runnion chimed in and elect a recorder who will give us a square deal ill agree if we give lee the job said gale its coming to him as the discoverer and i reckon the money will be handy seeing the hard luck hes played in thats agreeable to me stark replied and proceeded forthwith to call a miners meeting being himself straightway nominated as chairman by one of the strangers there was no objection so he went in as did lee who was made secretary with instructions to write out the business of the meeting together with the bylaws as they were passed the group assembled in the cleared space before the cabin to make rules and regulations governing the district for it is a custom in all mining sections removed from authority for the property holders thus to make local laws governing the size of claims the amount of assessment work the size of the recorders fees the character of those who may hold mines and such other questions as arise to affect their personal or property interests in the days prior to the establishment of courts and the adoption of a code of laws for alaska the entire country was governed in this way even to the adjudication of criminal actions it was the primitive majority rule that prevails in every new land and the courts later recognized and approved the laws so made and administered even when they differed in every district and even when these statutes were often grotesque and ridiculous as a whole however they were direct in their effect and worked no hardship in fact government by miners meeting is looked upon to this day by those who lived under it as vastly superior to the complicated machinery which later took its place the law permits six or more people to organize a mining district and adopt articles of government so this instance was quite ordinary and proper lee had come by his learning slowly and he wrote after the fashion of a schoolboy who views his characters from every angle and follows their intricacies with corresponding movements of the tongue hence the business of the meeting progressed slowly it was of wondrous interest to necia to be an integral part of such important matters and she took pride in voting on every question but burrell who observed the proceedings from neutral ground could not shake off the notion that all was not right things moved too smoothly it looked as if there had been a rehearsal poleon and the trader however seemed not to notice it and lee was wallowing to the waist in his own troubles so the young man kept his eyes open and waited the surprise came when they had completed the organization of the district and had nearly finished adopting bylaws it was so boldly attempted and so crude in its workingout that it seemed almost laughable to the soldier until he saw these men were in deadly earnest and animated by the cruelest of motives moreover it showed the first glimpse of starks spite against the trader which the lieutenant had divined runnion moved the adoption of a rule that no women be allowed to locate mining claims and one of the strangers seconded it whats that said lee raising his one eye from the notebook in which he was transcribing it isnt right to let women in on a mans game said runnion thats my idea echoed the seconder i spose this is aimed at my girl said gale springing to his feet i might have known you bums were up to some crooked work poleon likewise rose and ranged himself with the trader ba gar i don stan for dat said he excitedly you want for jump necias claims eh as long as im chairman well have no rough work declared stark glaring at them if you want trouble you two i reckon you can have it but whether you do or not the majority is going to rule and well make what laws we want to he took no pains now to mask his dislike of gale who began to move towards him in his dogged resolute way necia observing them hastened to her fathers side for that which she sensed in the bearing of both men quite overcame her indignation at this blow against herself no no dont have any trouble she pleaded as she clung to the trader for my sake daddy sit down then she whispered fiercely into his ear cant you see hes trying to make you fight theres too many of them wait wait burrell attempted to speak but stark who was presiding turned upon him fiercely now this is one time when you cant butt in mr soldier man this is our business is that plain the lieutenant realized that he had no place in this discussion and yet their move was so openly brazen that he could restrain himself with difficulty a moment later he saw the futility of interference when stark continued addressing the trader this isnt aimed at you in particular gale nor at your girl for a motion to disqualify her isnt necessary she isnt old enough to hold mining property shes eighteen declared the trader not according to her story well i can keep her claims for her till she gets of age weve just fixed it so you cant grinned runnion cunningly no man can hold more than one claim on a creek you voted for that yourself too late gale saw the trick by which stark had used him to rob his own daughter if he and his two friends had declined to be a part of this meeting the others could not have held it and before another assembly could have been called the creek would have been staked from end to end from rim to rim by honest men over whom no such action could pass but as it was his own votes had been used to sew him up in a mesh of motions and resolutions no creek lee had the name of a man slow in speech and action and one who roused himself to anger deliberately much as a serpent stings itself into a painful fury but now it was apparent that he was boiling over for he stammered and halted and blurted explosively youre a bunch of rascals all of you tryin to down a pore girl and get her ground but who put ye wise to this thing in the first place who found this gold just because theres enough of you to vote that motion through that dont make it legal not by a damned sight and it wont hold because i wont write it in the book youyou he glared at them malevolently searching his mind for an epithet sufficiently vile and finding it spat it out dressmakers so this was why both stark and runnion had gone up the creek with the three new men thought burrell no doubt they had deliberately arranged the whole thing so that the new arrivals could immediately relocate each of necias claims the pick of all the ground outside lees discovery and the surest to be valuable and that stark would share in the robbery he or runnion or both of them had broken lees oath of secrecy even before leaving camp which accounted for the presence of these thugs and now as he revolved the situation rapidly in his mind the soldier looked up at a sudden thought poleon had begun to speak and from his appearance it seemed possible that he might not cease with words moreover it was further evident that they were all intent on the excited frenchman and had no eyes for the lieutenant carefully slipping around the corner of the cabin and keeping the house between him and the others burrell broke into a swift run making the utmost possible speed for fear they should miss him and guess his purpose or worse yet finish their discussion and adjourn before he could complete his task he was a light man on his feet and he dodged through the forest running more carelessly the farther he went visiting first the upper claims then making a wide detour of the cabin he came back to the initial stake of necias lower claim staggering from his exertions his lungs bursting from the strain he had covered nearly a mile but even so he laughed grimly as he walked back towards the cabin for it was a game worth playing and he was glad to take a hand on the side of the trader and the girl coming within earshot he heard the meeting vote to adjourn it could not have terminated more opportunely had he held a stopwatch on it from the look of triumph on runnions face the lieutenant needed no glance at gale or poleon or necia to know that the will of the majority had prevailed and that the girls importunities had restrained her advocates from a resort to violence she looked very forlorn like a little child just robbed and deceived with the shock of its first great disillusionment still fresh in its eyes runnion addressed the other conspirators loudly well boys there are three good claims open for relocation im sorry i cant stake one of them they wont lie open long said one of the undesirable citizens starting to turn downstream while his two companions made for the opposite direction but burrell stopped them too late boys your little game went wrong now now dont get excited whew i had quite a run gale paused in his tracks and looked at the young man queerly what do you mean ive jumped those claims myself you jumped them cried necia sure i changed my mind about staking its a lie cried runnion at which burrell whirled on him ive been waiting for this runnion ever since you came back now i mean you havent had time the other temporized hurriedly oh that sounds better if you dont believe me take a look for yourself youll find my notice just beneath miss gales then to no creek lee he continued kindly record them for me so there will be no question of priority ill be damned if i do said the belligerent recorder youre worsen these crooks that ground belongs to necia gale up to this time stark had remained silent his impassive face betraying not a shadow of chagrin for he was a good loser but now he spoke at large anybody who thinks the american army is asleep is crazy then to burrell you certainly are a nice young man to doublecross your friends like that youre no friend of mine meade retorted i what do you mean i doublecrossed you stark nobody else the kentuckian glared at him with a look like that which runnion had seen in his face on that first day at the tradingpost the thought of these five men banded together to rob this little maid had caused a giddiness to rise up in him and his passions were beginning to whirl and dance theres no use mouthing words about it said he these thugs are your tools and you tried to steal that ground because its sure to be rich stark exclaimed angrily but the other gave him no time to break in now dont get rough because that is my game and id be pleased enough to take you back a prisoner then turning to lee he said dont make me force you to record my locations i staked those claims for miss gale and ill deed them to her when she turns eighteen poleon doret called to runnion msieu you member wat i tol you yestidday im begin for tink its goin be you the man paled in his anger but said nothing necia clapped her hands gleefully seeing that the game had gone against him stark got his feelings under control quickly and shrugged his shoulders as he turned away youre in the wrong lieutenant he remarked but i dont want any trouble youve got the law with you then to runnion and the others he said well im ready to hit the trail when they had shouldered their packs and disappeared down the valley gale held out his hand to the soldier young man i reckon you and i will be friends thank you said burrell taking the offer of friendship which he knew was genuine at last im in on that said no creek lee youre all right poleon had been watching starks party disappear but now he turned and addressed the young soldier you mak some enemies today msieu thats right agreed lee ben stark will never let up on you now very well that is his privilege you dont savvy what it means to get him down on you insisted lee hell frame things up to suit himself then pick a row with you hes the quickest man on a trigger in the west but he wont never make no open play only just devil the life out of you with little things till you flare up then hell down you thats how he killed the gold commissioner back in british columbia necia had said little so far but the look in her eyes repaid the soldier for his undertaking in her behalf and for any mischief that might ensue from it she came forward and laid her hands upon his promise that you wont have trouble with him she begged anxiously for its all my fault and id id always blame myself if any hurt came to you promise wont you dont worry daughter reassured gale theres nothing stark can do and whatever happens were with the lieutenant hes our kind of people burrell liked this grizzled old fellow with the watchful eyes and was glad now that he could grip his hand and face him squarely with no guilt upon his conscience by this time doret had finished with their blankets and the four set out for town but instead of following the others they accepted necia as guide and chose the trail to black bear creek they had not gone far before she took occasion to lag behind with the lieutenant i couldnt thank you before all those people they would have read our secret but you know how i feel dont you meade why it was a simple thing it was splendid when you defied them my what a fierce you are oh boy what if something should happen to you over this but theres no chance its all done and youll have your fine dresses and be able to hold your nose just as high as you want whatever i get i will owe to you i ive been thinking suppose well suppose you keep two of those claims they are sure to be rich why necia he exclaimed theyre yours and i have no right to them under the law of course it would be very handsome of you to give me one the poorest you ought to have your ears boxed he laughed at her i dont see why you you may be very poor for all i know i am he declared but not poor enough to take payment for a favor well then if they are really mine to do with as i please ill sell one to you thanks i couldnt avail myself of the offer he said with mock hauteur if you were a business man instead of a fighting person you would listen to my proposition before you declined it ill make the price right and you may pay me when we get behind yonder clump of bushes she pouted her lips invitingly but he declared she was a minor and as such her bargain would not hold it was evidently her mood to reenter the land of whims and travel again as they had on the way from town but he knew that for him such a thing could not be for his eyes had cleared since then he knew that he could never again wander through the happy valley for he vowed this maid should be no plaything for him or for any other man and as there could be no honorable end to this affair it must terminate at once just how this was to be consummated he had not determined as yet nor did he like to set about its solution it hurt him so to think of losing her however she was very young only a child and in time would come to count him but a memory no doubt while as for him well it would be hard to forget her but he could and would he reasoned glibly that this was the only honest course and his reasoning convinced him then all of a sudden the pressure of her warm lips came upon him and the remembrance upset every premise and process of his logic nevertheless he was honest in his stubborn determination to conclude the affair and finally decided to let time show him the way she seemed to be very happy her mood being in marked contrast to that of poleon and the trader both of whom had fallen silent and gloomy and in whom the hours wrought no change the latter had tacitly acknowledged his treachery towards stark on the previous night but beyond that he would not go offering no motive excuse or explanation choosing to stand in the eyes of his friend as an intended murderer notwithstanding which poleon let the matter dropfor was not his friend a good man had he not been tried in a hundred ways the young frenchman knew there must have been strong reason for gales outburst and was content to trust him without puzzling his mind to discover the cause of it now a secret must either grow or die there is no fallow age for it and this one had lived with gale for fifteen years until it had made an old man of him it weighed him down until the desire to be rid of it almost became overpowering at times but his caution was ingrained and powerful and so it was that he resisted the temptation to confide in his partner although the effort left him tired and inert the only one to whom he could talk was alluna she understood and though she might not help the sound of his own voice at least always afforded him some relief as to poleon no one had ever seen him thus never in all his life of dream and song and romance had he known a heavy heart until now for if at times he had wept like a girl it was at the hurts of others he had loved a bit and gambled much with equal misfortune and the next day he had forgotten he had lived the free clean life of a man who wins joyously or goes down with defiance in his throat but this venomous thing that runnion had planted in him had seeped and circulated through his being until every fibre was penetrated with a bitter poison most of his troubles could be grappled with bare hands but here was one against which force would not avail hence he was unhappy the party reached flambeau on the following day sufficiently ahead of stark and his men for lee to make known his find to his friends and by sunset the place was depopulated while a line of men could be seen creeping slowly up the valleys gale found alluna in charge of the store but no opportunity of talking alone with her occurred until late in the evening after necia had put the two little ones to bed and had followed them wearily then he told his squaw she took the news better than he expected and showed no emotion such as other women would have displayed even when he told her of the gunshot instead she inquired why did you try it there before all those others well when i heard him talking the wish to kill him was more than i could stand and it came on me all at once so that i was mad i suppose i never did the like before he half shuddered at the memory i am sorry she said yes so am i sorry that you failed for you will never have as good a chance again what was the matter with your aim i have seen you hit a knothole shooting from the hip the man is charmed declared gale hes bulletproof there are people she agreed that a gunshot will not injure there was a man like that among my people my fathers enemy but he was not proof against steel your old man knifed him eh she nodded ugh the man shivered i couldnt do that a gun is a straight mans friend but a knife is the weapon of traitors i couldnt drive it home does this man suspect no then it is childs play we will lay a trap no by god gale interrupted her hotly i tried that kind of work and it wont do im no murderer those are only words said the woman quietly to kill your enemy is the law the only light in the room came from the stove a great iron cylinder made from a coaloil tank that lay on a rectangular bed of sand held inside of four timbers with a door in one end to take whole lengths of cordwood and which being open lit the space in front throwing the sides and corners of the place into blacker mystery when he made no answer the squaw slipped out into the shadows leaving him staring into the flames to return a moment later bearing something in her hands which she placed in his it was a knife in a scabbard old and worn there is no magic that can turn bright steel she said then squatted again in the dimness outside of the firelight gale slid the case from the long blade and held it in his palm letting the firelight flicker on it he balanced it and tested the feel of its handle against his palm then tried the edge of it with his thumbnail and found it honed like a razor a child could kill with it said alluna both edges of the blade are so thin that a fingers weight will bury it one should hold the wrist firmly till it pierces through the coat that is all after that the flesh takes it easily like butter the glancing glinting light flashing from the deadly thing seemed to fascinate the man for he held it a long while silently then he spoke for fifteen years ive been a haunted man with a soul like a dark and dismal garret peopled with bats and varmints that flap and flutter all the time i used to figger that if i killed this man id kill that memory too and those flitting noiseless things would leave me but the thought of doing it made me afraid every time so i ran away which never did no good you cant outfoot a memory and i knew all the while that wed meet sooner or later now that the day is here at last im not ready for it id like to run away again if there was any place to run to but ive followed frontiers till ive seen them disappear one by one ive retreated till my back is against the circle and there isnt any further land to go to all the time ive prayed and planned for this meeting and yet im undecided kill him said alluna god knows ive always hated trouble whereas its what he lives on ive always wanted to die in bed while hes been a killer all his life and the smoke hangs forever in his eyes only for an accident we might have lived here all our days and never had a runin which makes me wonder if i hadnt better let things go on as they are kill him it is the law repeated alluna stubbornly but he put her aside with a slow shake of the head and arose as if very tired no i dont think i can do it not in cold blood anyhow goodnight im going to sleep on it he crossed to the door of his room but as he went she noted that he slipped the knife and scabbard inside the bosom of his shirt chapter ix the awakening early the next morning corporal thomas came into the store and found necia tending it while gale was out ever since the day she had questioned him about burrell this old man had taken every occasion to talk with the girl and when he asked her this morning about the reports concerning lees strike she told him of her trip and all that had occurred you see im a mineowner now she concluded if it hadnt been a secret i would have told you before i went so you could have been one of the first im goin anyhow he said if the lieutenant will let me and if its not too late then she told him of the trail by black bear creek which would save him several hours so thats how you and he made it he observed gazing at her shrewdly i supposed you went with your father oh no we beat him in she said and fell to musing at the memory of those hours passed alone with meade while her eyes shone and her cheeks glowed the corporal saw the look and it bore out a theory he had formed during the past month so as he lingered he set about a task that had lain in his mind for some time as a rule he was not a careful man in his speech and the delicacy of this manoeuvre taxed his ingenuity to the utmost for he loved the girl and feared to say too much the lieutenant is a smart young fellow he began and it was slick work jumpin all those claims its just like him to befriend a girl like you ive seen him do it before what exclaimed necia befriend other girls or things just like it hes always doing favors that get him into trouble this couldnt cause him trouble could it outside of starks and runnions grudge no i reckon not assented the corporal groping blindly for some way of expressing what he wished to say except of course it might cause a lot of talk at headquarters when its known what hes done for you and how he done it i heard something about it down the street this morning so im afraid it will get to st michaels and then to his folks he realized that he was not getting on well for the task was harder than he had imagined i dont understand said necia he hasnt done anything that any man wouldnt do under the same circumstances no mans got a right to make folks talk about a nice girl said the corporal and the feller that told me about it said he reckoned you two was in love he hurried along now without offering her a chance to speak of course that had to be caught up quick youre too fine a girl for that too fine necia laughed i mean youre too fine and good to let him put you in wrong just as hes too fine a fellow and got too much ahead of him to make what his people would call a messy alliance would his people object to to such a thing questioned the girl they were alone in the store and so they could talk freely im just supposing you know oh lord would they object corporal thomas laughed in a highly artificial manner that made necia bridle and draw herself up indignantly why should they id like to know im just as pretty as other girls and im just as good i know just as much as they do too except about certain things you sure are all of that and more too the corporal declared heartily but if you knowed more about things outside youd understand why it aint possible i cant tell you without hurtin your feelins and i like you too much for that miss necia seems as if im almost a daddy to you and ive only knowed you for a few weeks go ahead and tell me i wont be offended insisted the girl you must i dont know much about such things for ive lived all my life with men like father and poleon and the priests at the mission who treat me just like one of themselves but somebody will want to marry me some day i suppose so i ought to know what is wrong with me she flushed up darkly under her brown cheeks the feeling came over corporal thomas that he had hurt a helpless animal of some gentle kind that he was bungling his work and that he was not of the calibre to go into the social amenities he began to perspire uncomfortably but went on doggedly im goin to tell you a story not because it applies to lieutenant burrell or because hes in love with you which of course he aint any more than you be with him of course said the girl but just to show you what i mean it was a good long spell ago when i was at fort supply which was the frontier in them days like this is now we freighted in from dodge city with bull teams and it was sure the fringe of the frontier no women no society nothin much except a fort a lot of injuns and a few officials with their wives and families now them kind of places is all right for married men but theyre tough sleddin for single ones and after a while a feller gets awful careless about himself he seems to go backward and run down mighty quick when he gets away from civilization and his people and restaurants and such things he gets plumb reckless and forgetful of whats what well there was a captain with us a young feller that looked like the lieutenant here and a good deal the same sort hightempered and chivalrious and all that sort of thing a west pointer too good family and all that and whats more a captain at twentyfive now our head freighter was married to a squaw or leastways he had been but in them days nobody thought much of it any more than they do up here now and particularly because hed had a government contract for a long while ran a big gang of men and critters and had made a lot of money likewise he had a girl who lived at the fort and was mighty nice to look at and restful to the eye after a year or so of cactustrees and mesquite and buffalograss she was twice as nice and twice as pretty as the women at the post and as for money well her dad could have bought and sold all the officers in a lump but they and their wives looked down on her and she didnt mix with them none whatever to make it short the captain married her seemed like he got disregardful of everything and the hunger to have a woman just overpowered him shed been courted by every single man for four hundred miles around she was pretty and full of fire and they was both of an age to love hard so jefferson swore hed make the other women take her but soldierin is a heap different from any other profession and the army has got its own traditions the plan wouldnt work byandby the captain got tired of trying and gave up the attempt just devoted himself to her and then we was transferred all but him we shifted to a better post but captain jefferson was changed to another company and had to stay at supply gee it was a rotten hole influence had been used and there he stuck while the new officers cut him out completely just like the others had done so i was told and it drifted on that way for a long time him forever makin an uphill fight to get his wife reconized and always quittin loser his folks back east was scandalized and froze him cold callin him a squawman and the story went all through the army till his brother officers had to treat him cold in order to keep enough warmth at home to live by one thing leading to another till he finally resented it openly after that he didnt last long they made it so unpleasant that he quit the service crowded him out thats all he was a born soldier too and didnt know nothing else nor care for nothing else as fine a man as i ever served under but it soured him so that a rattlesnake couldnt have lived with him he tried to go into some kind of business after he quit the army but he wasnt cut out for it and never made good as long as i knew of him the last time i seen him was down on the border and he had sure grown cultus he had quit the squaw who was livin with a greaser in tucson and do you think im like that woman said necia in a queer strained voice she had listened intently to the corporals story but he had purposely avoided her eyes and could not tell how she was taking it no youre different but the army is just the same i told you this to show you how it is out in the states it dont apply to you of course of course agreed necia again but what would happen to lieutenant burrell if if well if he should do something like that there are many halfbreed girls i dare say like this other girl or like me she did not flush now as before instead her cheeks were pale it would go a heap worse with him than it did with captain jefferson said the corporal for hes got more ahead of him and he comes from better stock why his family is way up theyre all soldiers and theyre strong at headquarters theyre mighty proud too and they wouldnt stand for his doing such a thing even if he wanted to but he wouldnt try hes got too much sense and loves the army too well for that no sir hell go a long ways that boy will if hes let alone i never thought of myself as an indian said necia dully in this country its a persons heart that counts thats how it ought to be said the corporal heartily and im mighty sorry if ive hurt you little girl im a rough old rooster and i never thought but what you understood all this up here folks look at it right but outside its mighty different even yet you dont half understand im glad im what i am cried the girl theres nothing in my blood to be ashamed of and im white in here she struck her bosom fiercely if a man loves me hell take me no matter what it means to him right for you assented the other and if i was younger myself id sure have a lot of nice things to say to you if id a had somebody like you id a let liquor alone maybe and amounted to something but all im good for now is to give advice and draw my pay he slid down from the counter where he had been sitting im goin to hunt up the lieutenant and get him to let me off mebbe i can stake a claim and sell it the moment he was gone the girls composure vanished and she gave vent to her feelings its a lie its a lie she cried aloud and with her fists she beat the boards in front of her he loves me i know he does then she began to tremble and sobbed im just like other girls she was still wrestling with herself when gale returned and he started at the look in her face as she approached him why did you marry my mother she asked why why did you do it he saw that she was in a rage and answered bluntly i didnt she shrank at this then why didnt you shame shame that makes me worse than i thought i was oh why did you ever turn squawman why did you make me a breed look here what ails you said the trader what ails me she mocked why im neither white nor red im not even a decent indian im a a she shuddered you made me what i am you didnt do me the justice even to marry my mother somebodys been saying things about you said gale quietly taking her by the shoulders who is it tell me who it is no no its not that nobody has said anything to my face theyre afraid of you i suppose but god knows what they think and say to my back ill began the trader but she interrupted him ive just begun to realize what i am im not respectable im not like other women and never can be im a squaw a squaw youre not he cried its a nice word isnt it whats wrong with it no honest man can marry me im a vagabond the best i can get is my bed and board like my mother by god who offered you that gales face was whiter than hers now but she disregarded him and abandoned herself to the tempest of emotion that swept her along he can play with me but nothing more and when he is gone another one can have me and then another and another and another as long as i can cook and wash and work in time my man will beat me just like any other squaw i suppose but i cant marry i cant be a wife to a decent man she was in the clutch of an hysteria that made her writhe beneath gales hand choking and sobbing until he loosed her then she leaned exhausted against a post and wiped her eyes for the tears were coming now thats all damned rot he said theres fifty good men in this camp would marry you tomorrow bah i mean real men not miners i want to be a lady i dont want to pull a handsled and wear moccasins all my life and raise children for men with whiskers i want to be loved i want to be loved i want to marry a gentleman burrell said gale no she flared up not him nor anybody in particular but somebody like him some man with clean fingernails he found nothing humorous or grotesque in her measure of a gentleman for he realized that she was strung to a pitch of unreason and unnatural excitement and that she was in terrible earnest daughter he said im mighty sorry this knowledge has come to you and i see its my fault but things are different now to what they were when i met alluna it wasnt the style to marry squaws where we came from and neither of us ever thought about it much we were happy with each other and weve been man and wife to each other just as truly as if a priest had mumbled over us but why didnt you marry her when i came surely you must have known what it would mean to me it was bad enough without that the old man hesitated ill own i was wrong he said finally staring out into the sunshine with an odd expression it was thoughtless and wrong dead wrong but ive loved you better than any daughter was ever loved in this wide world and ive worked and starved and froze and saved and so has alluna so that you might have something to live on when im gone and be different to us it wont be long now i guess ive given you the best schooling of any girl on the river and id have sent you out to a convent in the states but i couldnt let you go so far away god i loved you too much for that i couldnt do it girl ive tried but youre all ive got and im a selfish man i reckon no no youre not his daughter cried impulsively youre everything thats good and dear but youve lived a different life from other men and you see things differently it was mean of me to talk as i did she put her arms around his neck and hugged him but im very unhappy dad dont you aim to tell what started this he said gently caressing her with his great hard hand as softly as a mother but she shook her head and he continued ill take the first boat down to the mission and marry your ma if you want me to that wouldnt do any good said she wed better leave things as they are then she drew away and smiled at him bravely from the door im a very bad to act this way scuses he nodded and she went out but he gazed after her for a long minute then sighed poor little girl necia was in a restless mood and remembering that alluna and the children had gone berrying on the slopes behind the indian village she turned her way thither all at once a fear of seeing meade burrell came upon her she wanted to think this out to find where she stood before he had word with her she had been led to observe herself from a strange angle and must verify her vision as it were as yet she could not fully understand what if he had changed now that he was alone and had had time to think it would kill her if she saw any difference in him and she knew she would be able to read it in his eyes as she went through the main street of the camp she saw stark occupied near the waterfront where he had bought a building lot he spoke to her as she was about to pass goodmorning miss are you rested from your trip she answered that she was and would have continued on her way but he stopped her i dont want you to think that mining matter was my doing he said ive got nothing against you your old man hasnt wasted any affection on me and i can get along without him all right but i dont make trouble for girls if i can help it the girl believed that he meant what he said his words rang true and he spoke seriously moreover stark was known already in the camp as a man who did not go out of his way to make friends or to render an accounting of his deeds so it was natural that when he made her a show of kindness necia should treat him with less coldness than might have been expected the man had exercised an occult influence upon her from the time she first saw him at lees cabin but it was too vague for definite feeling and she had been too strongly swayed by poleon and her father in their attitude towards him to be conscious of it finding him now however in a gentle humor she was drawn to him unwittingly and felt an overweening desire to talk with him even at the hazard of offending her own people the encounter fitted in with her rebellious mood for there were things she wished to know things she must find out from some one who knew the world and would not be afraid to answer her questions candidly im going to build a big dancehall and saloon here said stark showing her the stakes that he had driven as soon as the rush to the creek is over ill hire a gang of men to get out a lot of house logs ill finish it in a week and be open for the stampede do you think this will be a big town she asked nobody can tell but ill take a chance if it proves to be a false alarm ill move on ive done it before youve been in a great many camps i suppose he said that he had that for twenty years he had been on the frontier and knew it from west texas to the circle and are they all alike very much the land lies different but the people are the same ive never known anything except this she swept the points of the compass with her arm and there is so much beyond that i want to know about oh i feel so ignorant there is something now that perhaps you could tell me you have travelled so much lets have it said he smiling at her seriousness she hesitated at a loss for words finally blurting out what was in her mind my father is a squawman mr stark and ive been raised to think that such things are customary they are in all new countries he assured her but how are they regarded when civilization comes along well they arent regarded as a rule squawmen are pretty shiftless and people dont pay much attention to them i guess if they werent they wouldnt be squawmen my father isnt shiftless she challenged at which he remained silent refusing to go on record isnt a halfbreed just as good as a white look here said he what are you driving at im a blood she declared recklessly and i want to know what people think of me the men around here have never made me feel conscious of it but youre afraid of these new people who are coming eh well dont worry about that miss it wouldnt make any difference to me or to any of your friends whether you were red white black or yellow but it would make a difference with some people insisted the girl oh i reckon it would with eastern people they look at things kind of funny but were not in the east thats what i wanted to know nice people back there wouldnt tolerate a girl like me for a moment would they they wouldnt consider me good enough to associate with them he shrugged his shoulders i guess youd have a hard time breaking in among the bontonners but whats the use of thinking about it this is your country and these are your people a morbid desire was upon her to track down this intangible racial distinction but she saw runnion whom she could not bear coming towards them so thanked stark hurriedly and went on her way been making friends with that squaw eh remarked runnion casually yes replied stark shes a nice little girl and i like her i told her i didnt have any part in that miners meeting affair huh whats the matter with you it was all your doing i know it was but i didnt aim it at her i wanted that ground next to lees and i wanted to throw a jolt into old man gale i couldnt let the girl stand in my way but now that its over im willing to be friends with her me too said runnion looking after necia as her figure diminished up the street by heaven shes as graceful as a fawn shes white too nobody would ever know she was a breed shes a good girl said stark musingly in a gentle tone that runnion had never heard before getting kind of mushy aint you i thought you had passed that stage old man no i dont like her in that way well i do and im dead sore on that soldier shes not your kind said stark a bad man cant hold a good woman he can win one easy enough but he cant keep her i know nobody but a fool would want to keep one runnion replied specially a squaw shes just woke up to the fact that she is a squaw and isnt as good as white shes worried ill lay you a little eight to five that burrell has thrown her down chuckled runnion i never thought of that you may be right if its true ill shuffle up a hand for that soldier if i were you i wouldnt deal it to him said the gambler dryly he may not cut to your break meanwhile necia had passed on out of the town and through the indian village at the mouth of the creek until high up on the slopes she saw alluna and the little ones she climbed up to them and seated herself where she could look far out over the westward valley with the great stream flowing half a mile beneath her she stayed there all the morning and although the day was bright and the bushes bending with their burden of blue she picked no berries but fought resolutely through a dozen varying moods that mirrored themselves in her delicate face it was her first soul struggle but in time the buoyancy of youth and the almighty optimism of early love prevailed she comforted herself with the fond illusion that this man was different from all others that his regard was equal to her own and that his love would rise above such accidental things as blood or breed or birth and so she was in a happier frame of mind when the little company made their descent at midday as they approached the town they heard the familiar cry of steamboooat and by the time they had reached home the little camp was noisy with the plaint of wolfdogs there were few men to join in the welcome today every ablebodied inhabitant having disappeared into the hills but the animals came trooping lazily to the bank and sat down on their haunches watching the approaching steamer in their soft eyes the sadness of a canine race of slaves behind them limped a sick man or two a soldier from the barracks and in the rear a fellow who had drifted in the week before with scurvy it was a pitiful review that lined up to greet the tide of tenderfeet crowding towards their el dorado and unusual also for as yet the sight of new faces was strange in the north the deserted aspect of the town puzzled the captain of the steamer and upon landing he made his way at once to john gales store where he learned from the trader of the strike and of the stampede that had resulted before the recital was finished a man approached and spoke excitedly captain my ticket reads to dawson but im getting off here wont you have my outfit put ashore he was followed by a group of fellowpassengers who made a similar request this place is good enough for me one of them said me too another volunteered this strike is new and weve hit her just in time outside a dozen men had crowded no creek lee against the wall of the store and were clamoring to hear about his find before the tardy ones had cleared the gangplank the news had flashed from shore to ship and a swarm came up the bank and into the post firing questions and answers at each other eagerly elbowing and fighting for a place within earshot of the trader or the ragged man outside the frenzy of a gold stampede is like the rush from a burning building and equally easy to arouse no statement is too wild to lack believers no rumor too exaggerated to find takers within an hour the crew of the steamer was busy unloading countless tons of merchandise and baggage billed to dawson and tents began to show their snowy whiteness here and there as a man saw his outfit appear he would pounce upon it a bundle at a time and pile it by itself which resulted in endless disputes and much confusion but a spirit of youth and expectancy permeated all and prevented more than angry words every hour the heaps of baggage grew larger and the tents more numerous stark wasted no time with money in his hands he secured a dozen men who were willing to work for hire for there are always those who prefer the surety of ten coined dollars to the hope of a hundred he swooped down with these helpers on his pile of merchandise that had lain beneath tarpaulins on the riverbank since the day he and runnion landed and by midafternoon a great tent had been stretched over a framework of peeled poles built on the lot where he and necia had stood earlier in the day before dark his saloon was running to be sure there was no floor and his polished fixtures looked strangely new and incongruous but the town at large had assumed a similar air of incompleteness and crude immaturity and little wonder for it had grown threefold in half a day stark swiftly unpacked his gambling implements keen to scent every advantage and out of the handful of palefaced jackals who follow at the heels of a healthy herd he hired men to run them and to deal by night flambeau was a miningcamp late in the evening the boat swung out into the river and disclosed a strange scene of transformation to the puzzled captain of a few hours ago the riverbank was lined with canvas shelters illumined dully by the tentlights within till they looked like a nest of glowworms in deep grass a long hoarse blast of good wishes rose from the steamer then she sighed her way around the point above bearing forth the message that a new camp had been born chapter x meade burrell finds a path in the moonlight no creek lee had come into his own at last and was a hero for the story of his long illluck was common gossip now and men praised him for his courage he had never been praised for anything before and was uncertain just how to take it say are these people kiddin me he inquired confidentially of poleon wy wat you mean well theres a feller makin a speech about me down by the landing wat he say it aint nothin to fight over he says im another danl boom leadin the march of empire westward dats nice for sure certainly sounds good but is it on the level wal i guess so admitted poleon the prospector swelled with indignation then why in hell didnt you fellers tell me long ago the scanty ounce or two of gold from his claim lay in the scales at the post where every newcomer might examine it and realizing that he was a neverending source of information they fawned on him for his tips bribing him with newspapers worth a dollar each or with cigars which he wrapped up carefully and placed in his mackinaw till every pocket of the rusty garment bulged so that he could not sit without losing them they dwelt upon his lightest word and stood him up beside the bar where they filled him with proofs of friendliness until he shed tears from his one good eye he had formed a habit of parsimony born of his years of poverty and was so widely known as a tight man by the hundreds who had lent to him that his creditors never at any time hoped for a reckoning and he never offered one on the contrary he had invariably flown into a rage when dunned and exhibited such resentment as to discourage the practice now however the surly humor of the man began to mellow and in gradual stages he unloosened the process being attended by a disproportionate growth of the traders cash receipts cautiously at first he let out his wit which was logy from long disuse and as heavy on its feet as the jumping frog of calaveras but when they laughed at its labored leaps and sallies his confidence grew with the regularity of a clock he planted cigars and ordered a little more hard stuff while his roving eye rejoiced in lachrymose profusion its overburden losing itself in the tangle of his careless beard byandby he wandered through the town trailed by a troop of tenderfeet till the women marked him whereupon he fled back to the post and hugged the bar for he was a bashful man when starks new place opened it offered him another retreat of which he availed himself for some time but late in the evening he reappeared at old man gales store walking a bit unsteadily and as he mounted the flight of logs to the door he stepped once too often whats become of that fourth step he demanded sharply of poleon dere she is said the frenchman imdamned if it is you moved it since i was here ill have im put back laughed the other say its a grand thing to be rich aint it i don know i ain never try it well it is and now that ive arrived im goin to change my ways complete no more extravagance in mine ill never lend another cent wats dat ejaculated doret in amazement no more hardluck stories and hurryups for mine im the stonyhearted jailer i am from now henceforth world thout end amen no busted miners need apply ive been a good thing but tonight i turn on the timelock ba gosh youre fonny feller laughed poleon who had lent the oneeyed man much money in the past and like others regarded him not merely as a bad risk but as a total loss mebbe you tink youve been a spentrif all dese year ive certainly blowed a lot of money on my friends lee acknowledged and theyre welcome to what theyve got so far but im goin to chop all them prodigal habits and put on the tin vest ill run the solderiniron up my seams so they cant get to me without a canopener im airtight for life i am he fumbled in his pockets and unwrapped a gift cigar then felt for a match poleon tossed one on the bar and he reached for it twice missing it each time i guess dose new frien of yours is mak you purty full msieu tin vest nothin of the sort ive got a bad dose of indigestion dats orrible disease deres plaintee riche man die on dat seecknesse you better lie down doret took the hero of the day by the arm and led him to the rear of the store where he bedded him on a pile of flour sacks but he had hardly returned to the bar when lee came veering out of the dimness making for the light like a ship tacking towards a beacon what kind of flour is that he spluttered dats just plain weat flour not on your life said the miner with the firmness of a great conviction its full of yeast powders why its rarin and risin like a buckin hoss im plumb seasick he laid a zigzag course for the door were you goin asked poleon im goin to get somethin for this stomach trouble its fierce he descended into the darkness boldly and stepped off with confidence this time too soon poleon heard him floundering about his indignant voice raised irascibly albeit with a note of triumph whad i tell you you put it back while i was ashleep then whistling blithely if somewhat out of tune he steered for the new saloon to get something for his stomach trouble at starks he found a large crowd of the new men who welcomed him heartily plying him with countless questions and harking to his maudlin tales of this new country which to him was old he had followed the muddy river from crater lake to the delta searching the bars and creekbeds in a tireless quest till he knew each stream and tributary for he had been one of the hardy band that used to venture forth from juneau on the spring snows disappearing into the uncharted valley of the yukon to return when the river clogged and grew sluggish and like gale he had lived these many years ahead of the law where each man was his own court of appeals and where crime was unknown he had helped to build camps like forty mile and circle he knew by heart the bylaws and rules that governed every town and mining district in the country he knew every man and child by name but while many of his friends had prospered unceasing illluck had dogged him yet he had held to honesty and hard work measuring a man by his ability to swing an axe or a shovel and despite his impecuniosity regarding theft as the one crime deserving capital punishment oh theres lots of countries worsen this he declared we may not be very hansome to the naked eye and we may not wear our handkchiefs in our shirt cuffs but there aint no widders and orphans doin our washin and a man can walk away from his house stay a month and find it there when he comes back those days are past said stark who had joined in the discussion theres too many new people coming in for all of them to be honest theyd better be said lee aggressively we aint got no room for stealers why i had a hand in makin the bylaws of this camp myself long with john gale and they stiplates that any person caught robbin a cache is to be publicly whipped in front of the tradinpost then if its winter time hes to be turned loose on the ice barefooted or if its summer hes to be set adrift on a log with his shirt off either one would mean certain death said a stranger frost in winter mosquitoes in summer thats all right another bystander declared a mans life depends on his grub up here and id be in favor of enforcing that punishment to the letter if we caught any one thieving all the same i take no chances said stark theres too many strangers here just to show you how i stand ive put runnion on guard over my pile of stuff and ill be glad when its under cover it isnt the severity of punishment that keeps a man from going wrong its the certainty of it well hed sure get it and get it proper in this camp declared lee and at that moment as if his words had been a challenge the flaps of the great tent were thrust aside and runnion half led half threw a man into the open space before the bar lets have a look at you he panted well if it aint a nigger whats up cried the men crowding about the prisoner who crouched terrorstricken in the trampled mud and moss while those playing roulette and bank left the tables followed by the dealers hes a thief said runnion mopping the sweat from his brow i caught him after your grub pile stark in my cache yes he dropped a crate of hams when i came up on him and tried to run but i dropped him he held his colt in his right hand and a trickle of blood from the negros head showed how he had been felled why didnt you shoot growled stark angrily at which the negro half arose and broke into excited denials of his guilt runnion kicked him savagely and cursed him while the crowd murmured approval le me see him said lee elbowing his way through the others fixing his one eye upon the wretch he spoke impressively youre the first downright thief i ever seen was you hungry no hes got plenty answered one of the tenderfeet who had evidently arrived on the boat with the darky hes got a bigger outfit than i have the prisoner drew himself up against the bar facing his enemies sullenly then i reckon its a divine manifestation said no creek lee tearfully this black party is goin to furnish an example as will elevate the moral tone of our community for a year let me take him outside cried stark reaching under the bar for a weapon his eyes were cruel and he had the angry pallor of a dangerous man ill save you a lot of trouble why not do it legal expostulated lee its just as certain yes lee is right echoed the crowd bent on a roman holiday what yall aim to do whined the thief were goin to try you announced the oneeyed miner and if youre found guilty as you certainly are goin to be youll be flogged after which perdicament youll have a nice ride downstream on a sawlog without your laundry but the mosquitoes too bad you didnt think of them before lets get at this boys and have it over with in far countries where mens lives depend upon the safety of their food supply a side of bacon may mean more than a bag of gold therefore protection is a strenuous necessity and though any one of those present would have gladly fed the negro had he been needy each of them likewise knew that unless an example were made of him no tent or cabin would be safe the north being a gameless forbidding country has ever been cruel to thieves and now it was heedless of the black mans growing terror as it set about to try him a miners meeting was called on the spot and a messenger sent hurrying to the post for the book in which was recorded the laws of the men who had made the camp the crowd was determined that this should be done legally and as prescribed by ancient custom up and down the river so to make itself doubly sure it gave runnions evidence a hearing then taking lanterns went down to the big tarpaulincovered pile beside the river where it found the crate of hams and the negros tracks there was no defence for the culprit and he offered none being too scared by now to do more than plead the proceedings were simple and quiet and grim and were wellnigh over when lieutenant burrell walked into the tent saloon he had been in his quarters all day fighting a fight with himself and in the late evening rebelling against his cramped conditions and the war with his conscience he had sallied out and drawn by the crowd in starks place had entered a man replied to his whispered question giving him the story for the meeting was under lees domination and the miners maintained an orderly and businesslike procedure the chairmans indigestion had vanished with his sudden assumption of responsibility and he showed no trace of drink in his bearing beneath a lamp one was binding fourfoot lengths of cotton tentrope to a broomstick for a knout while others whom lee had appointed were drawing lots to see upon whom would devolve the unpleasant duty of flogging the captive the matteroffact relentless expedition of the affair shocked burrell inexpressibly and seeing poleon and gale near by he edged towards them thinking that they surely could not be in sympathy with this barbarous procedure you dont understand lieutenant said gale in a low voice this nigger is a thief you cant kill a man for stealing a few hams it aint so much what he stole its the idea and its the custom of the country whipping is enough without the other dis stealin shes bad biznesse declared poleon mebbe dose ham is save some poor fellers life its mob law said the lieutenant indignantly and i wont stand for it gale turned a look of curiosity upon the officer how are you going to help yourself said he but the young man did not wait to reply quickly he elbowed his way towards the centre of the scene with that air of authority and determination before which a crowd melts and men stand aside gale whispered to his companion keep your eye open lad theres going to be trouble they stood on tiptoe and watched eagerly gentlemen announced burrell standing near the ashengray wretch and facing the tentful of men this man is a thief but you cant kill him stark leaned across the bar his eyes blazing and touched the lieutenant on the shoulder do you mean to take a hand in all of my affairs this isnt your affair its mine said the officer this is what i was sent here for and its my particular business you seem to have overlooked that important fact he stole my stuff and hell take his medicine i say he wont for the second time in their brief acquaintance these two men looked fair into each others eyes few men had dared to look at stark thus and live for when a man has once shed the blood of his fellow a mania obsesses him a disease obtains that is incurable there is an excitation of every sense when a hunter stands up before big game it causes a thrill and flutter of undiscovered nerves which nothing else can conjure up and which once lived leaves an incessant hunger but the biggest game of all is man and the fiercest sensation is hate stark had been a killer and his brain had been seared with the flame till the scar was ineradicable he had lived those lurid seconds when a man gambles his life against his enemys and having felt the great sensation it could never die yet with it all he was a cautious man given more to brooding on his injuries and building up a quarrel than to reckless paroxysms of passion and experience had taught him the value of a wellhandled temper as well as the wisdom of knowing when to use it and put it in action he knew intuitively that his hour with burrell had not yet come the two men battled with their eyes for an opening lee and the others mastered their surprise at the interruption and then began to babble until burrell turned from the gambler and threw up his arm for silence theres no use arguing he told the mob you cant do it ill hold him till the next boat comes then ill send him downriver to st michaels he laid his hand upon the negro and made for the door with face set and eyes watchful and alert knowing that a hairs weight might shift the balance and cause these men to rive him like wolves lees indignation at this miscarriage of justice had him so by the throat as to strangle expostulation for a moment till he saw the soldier actually bearing off his quarry then he broke into a flood of invective stop that he bellowed to hell with your law were goin accordin to our own an ominous echo arose and in the midst of it the miner in his blind fury forgetting his exalted position took a step too near the edge of the bar and fell off into the body of the meeting with him fell the dignity of the assemblage some one laughed another took it up the nervous tension broke and a man cried the soldier is right you cant blame a dinge for stealing and another sure hogs and chickens are legitimate prey lee was helped back to his stand and called for order but the crowd poked fun at him and began moving about restlessly till some one shouted a motion to adjourn and there arose a chorus of seconders a few dissenting voices opposed them but in the meantime burrell was gone and with him the cause of the tumult so the meeting broke up of its own weight a moment later as poleon and gale walked home the frenchman said dat was nervy ting to do the trader made no answer and the other continued stark is goin for kill im sure its a cinch agreed gale unless somebody gets stark first when they were come to his door the trader paused and looking back over the glowing tents and up at the starsprinkled heavens remarked as if concluding some train of thought if that boy has got the nerve to take a nigger thief out of a miners meeting and hold him against this whole town he wouldnt hesitate much at taking a white man would he wal hesitated the other mebbe dat would depen on de crime suppose it was murder ha we ain got no men lak dat in flambeau they said goodnight and the old man entered his house to find alluna waiting for him a look of worry on her stolid face whats wrong he inquired all night necia has been weeping is she sick he started for the girls door but alluna stopped him no it is not that kind of weeping this comes from the heart it is there she is sick i went to her but she grew angry and said i had a black skin and could not understand then she went outdoors and has not returned gale sat down dejectedly yes shes sick in her heart all right and so am i alluna when did she go out an hour ago where is she out by the riverbank i followed her in the shadows it is best for her to stay there till she is calm i know what ails her said the father shes found that shes not like other girls shes found that a white soul doesnt count with white people they never go below the skin then he told her of the scene that morning in the store adding that he believed she loved lieutenant burrell did she say so no she denied it now that she knows she hasnt got his kind of blood in her blood makes no difference said the woman stubbornly if he loves her he will take her if he does not that is all gale looked up at her and was about to explain when the utter impossibility of her comprehending him made him desist and he fell moody again at last he said ive got to tell her alluna no no cried the woman aghast dont tell her the truth nothing could be worse than that but he continued deliberately love is the biggest thing in the world its the only thing worth while and she has got to have a fair show at it this has been on my mind for weeks and ive put it away hoping i wouldnt have to do it but today i came face to face with it again and its up to me shell have to know some time so the sooner the better she would not believe you said the woman at which he started i never thought of that i wonder if she would doubt i couldnt stand that there is no proof and it would mean your life a good mans life is a great price to pay for the happiness of one girl i gave it once before said gale a trifle bitterly and now that the game is started ive got to play the string out but i wonder if she would doubt he paused for a long moment well ill have to risk it however ive got a lot of things to do first you and the youngsters must be taken care of and stark said alluna yes and stark burrell took his prisoner to the barracks where he placed him under guard giving instructions to hold him at any cost not knowing what wild and reckless humor the new citizens of flambeau might develop during the night for it is men who have always lived with the halter of the law tight upon their necks who run wildest when it is removed men grown old on the frontier adhere more closely to a rigid code than do tenderfeet who feel for the first time the liberty and license of utter unrestraint and it was these strangers whom the soldier feared rather than men like gale and no creek lee who would recognize the mercy of his intervention and let the matter drop after he had taken every precaution he went out into the night again and fought with himself as he had fought all that day and all the night before in fact ever since old thomas had come to him after leaving necia and had so cunningly shaped his talk that burrell never suspected his object until he perceived his position in such a clear light that the young man looked back upon his work with startled eyes the corporal had spoken garrulously of his officers family of their pride and of their love for his profession had dwelt enthusiastically upon the lieutenants future and the length he was sure to go and finally drifted into the same story he had told necia burrell at last sensed the meaning of the crafty old soldiers strategy and dismissed him but not before his work had been accomplished if a coarsefibred calloused old campaigner like corporal thomas could recognize the impossibility of a union between necia and himself then the young man must have been blind indeed not to have seen it for himself the kentuckian was a man of strong and virile passions but he was also well balanced and had ever followed his head rather than his heart holding as he did a deepseated contempt for weak men who laid their courses otherwise the generations of discipline back of him spoke to his conscience he had allowed himself to become attached to this girl until yes he knew now he loved her if only he had not awakened her and himself with that first hot kiss if only but there was no going back now no use for regrets only the greater necessity of mapping out a course that would cause her least unhappiness if he could have run away he would have done so gladly but he was bound here to this camp with no possibility of avoiding her when he drove his reason with firm hands he saw but one course to follow but when his mind went slack for a moment the old desire to have her returned more strongly than ever and he heard voices arguing pleading persuading she was the equal of any woman in the world they said in mind in purity and in innocence he hated himself for hesitating he railed at his own indecision and then when he had justified his love and persuaded himself that he was right in seeking this union there would rise again the picture of his people their chagrin and what would result from such a marriage he knew how they would take it he knew what his friends would say and how he would be treated as the husband of a halfbreed indian for in his country one drop of colored blood made a negro and his people saw but little difference between the red and the black it would mean his social ostracism he would be shunned by his brother officers and his career would be at an end he swore aloud in the darkness that this was too great a price to pay for love that he owed it to himself and to his dear ones at home to give up this darkeyed maid who had bewitched him he had wandered far during this debate clear past the town and out through the indian village but now that he believed he had come to an understanding with himself he turned back towards his quarters he knew it would be hard to give her up but he had irrevocably decided and his path began to unfold itself so clear and straight that he marvelled how he could have failed to see it he was glad he had conquered although the pain was still sharp he felt a better man for it and wrapped in this complacent optimism he passed close by the front of the traders store where necia had crept to be alone with her misery the high moon cast a deep wide shadow upon the store steps where the girl sat huddled staring out into the unreal world waiting for the night wind to blow away the fears and forebodings that would not let her sleep it was late and the hush of a summer midnight lay upon the distant hills burrell had almost passed her when he was startled by the sound of his name breathed softly then to his amazement he saw her come forth like a spirit into the silver sheen necia he cried what are you doing here at this hour she looked up at him sadly he saw that her cheeks were wet and something inside him snapped and broke without a word he took her in his arms meeting her lips in a long kiss while she trembling with the joy of his strong embrace drew closer and closer and rested her body wearily against his little girl little girl he whispered over and over his tone conveying every shade of sympathy love and understanding she had craved he knew what had made her sad and she knew that he knew there was no need for words the anguish of this long day had whetted the edge of their desire and they were too deeply too utterly lost in the ecstasy of meeting to care for speech as she lay cradled in his arms which alternately held her with the soft tenderness of a mother and crushed her with the fierce ardor of a lover she lost herself in the bliss of a womans surrender and forgot all her terrifying doubts and fears what were questions of breed or birth or color now when she knew he loved her mere vapors that vanished with the first flutter of warm wings nor did meade burrell recall his recent selfconquest or pause to reason why he should not love this little wisp of the wilderness the barriers he had built went down in the sight and touch of his love and disappeared his hesitation and infirmity seemed childish now yes more than that cowardly he realized all in a moment that he had been supremely selfish that his love was a covenant a compact which he had entered into with her and had no right to dissolve without her consent and strangely enough now that he acknowledged the bond to himself it became very sweet and satisfying your lips cling so that i cant get free sighed the girl at last you never shall he whispered but when she smiled up at him piteously her eyes swimming and said i must he wrenched himself away and let her go as he went lightly towards the barracks through the farstretching shadows for the moon was yellow now meade burrell sighed gladly to himself again his course ran clear and straight before him though wholly at variance with the one he had decided upon so recently but he knew not that his vision was obscured and that the moonmadness was upon him chapter xi where the path led by daylight next morning every man and most of the women among the new arrivals had disappeared into the hills the women in spite of the bylaws of lees creek which discriminated against their sex when a stampede starts it does not end with the location of one streambed nor of two every foot of valley ground for miles on every hand is preempted in the hope that more gold will be found each creek forms a new district and its discoverers adopt laws to suit their whims the women therefore hastened to participate in the discovery of new territory and in the shaping of its government leaving but few of either sex to guard the tents and piles of provisions standing by the riverbank in two days they began to return and straggled in at intervals for a week thereafter for many had gone far and now began a new era for flambeau an era of industry such as the frontier town had never known the woods behind rang with the resounding discords of axes and saws and crashing timber and new cabins appeared on every hand rising in a day the sluggish air was noisy with voices and the edge of the forest receded gradually before the busy pioneers replacing the tall timbers with little highbanked homes of spruce and whitepapered birch from dawn till dark arose the rhythmic rasp of men whipsawing floor lumber to the tune of two hundred dollars per thousand and with the second steamer came a little steam sawmill which raised its shrill complaint within a week punctuating the busy day with its piping whistle the trail along the flambeau was dotted continuously with toiling human beasts of burden that floundered laboriously beneath great packs of provisions and tools and other baggage winding like an endless stream of ants through the hills to no creek lee creek where they reenacted the scenes that were occurring in the town tents and cabins were scattered throughout the length of the valley lumber was sawed for sluiceboxes and the virginal breezes that had sucked through this seam in the mountains since days primeval came to smell of spruce fires and echo with the sounds of life a dozen tents were pitched on lees discovery claim for the owner had been besieged by men who clamored to lease a part of his ground and yielding finally he had allotted to each of them a hundred feet forthwith they set about opening their portions for the ground was shallow and the gold so near the surface that winter would interfere with its extraction wherefore they made haste the owner oversaw them all complacent in the certainty of a steady royalty accruing from the working of his allotments every day there came into flambeau exaggerated reports of new strikes in other spots of strong indications and of rich prospects elsewhere stories grew out of nothing until the camp took an hysterical pleasure in exciting itself and deceiving every stranger who came from north or south for the wine of discovery was in them all and it pleased them to distort and enlarge upon every rumor that came their way such being the temper of new goldfields they knew they were lying and that all other men were lying also and yet they hearkened to each tale and almost deceived themselves burrell sought necia at an early day and in presence of her father told her that he had been approached by men who wished to lease the claims he held for her it would prove an inexpensive way to develop her holdings he said and she would run no risk moreover it would be rapid and insure a quick return for a lease so near to proven territory was in great demand after some discussion this was arranged and meade as trustee allotted her ground in tracts as lee had done poleon followed suit but the trader chose to prospect his own claims and to that end called in a train of stiffbacked indian packers moved a substantial outfit to the creek and thereafter spent much of his time in the hills leaving the store to doret he seemed anxious to get away from the camp and hide himself in the woods stark was almost constantly occupied at his saloon for it was a mint and ran day and night runnion was busy with the erection of a substantial structure of squared logs larger than the tradingpost destined as a dancehall theatre and gamblinghouse flambeau the slumbrous had indeed aroused itself stretched its limbs and sprung into vigorous virile feverish being and the wise prophets were predicting another dawson for it notwithstanding that many blank spots had been found as the creek of lees finding bared its bedrock to the miners these but enhanced the value of the rich finds however for a single stroke of goodfortune will more than offset a dozen disappointments the truth is the stream was very spotted and leo had by chance hit upon one of the bars where the metal had lodged while others above and below uncovered a bedrock as barren as a cleanswept floor in places they crosscut from rim to rim drove tunnels and drains and drifts sunk shafts and opened trenches without finding a color that would ring when dropped in the pan but that was an old old story and they were used to it during these stirring weeks of unsleeping activity burrell saw little of necia for he had many things to occupy him and she was detained much in the store now that her father was away when they met for a moment they were sure to be interrupted while in and around the house alluna seemed to be always near her even so she was very happy for she was sustained by the constant hectic excitement that was in the air and by her brief moments with meade which served to gladden her and make of the days one long delicious hopeful procession of undisturbed dreams and fancies he was the same fond lover as on that adventurous journey up black bear creek and wooed her with a reckless fire that set her aglow and so she hummed and laughed and dreamed the days away her happiness matching the peace and gladness of the season with burrell on the contrary it was a season of penance and flagellations of spirit lightened only by the moments when he was with her and when she made him forget all else this damnable indecision goaded him to selfcontempt he despised himself for his weakness his social instincts and training his sense of duty and the amenities of life that proud men hold dear tugged steadily untiringly at his reason while the little imp of impulse sat grinning wickedly ready to pop out and upset all his high resolutions it raised such a tumult in his ears that he could not hear the other voices it stirred his blood till it leaped and pounded and then ran off with him to find this tiny brown and beaming witch who was at the bottom of it all no months in any clime can compare with an arctic summer when nature is kind for she crowds into this short epoch all the warmth and brightness and splendor that is spread over longer periods in other lands and every growing thing rejoices riotously in scent and color and profusion it was on one of these heavenly days spiced with the faintest hint of autumn that necia received the news of her goodfortune one of her leasers came into the post to show her and poleon a bag of dust he and his partner had found the paystreak finally and he had come to notify her that it gave promise of being very rich and now that its location was demonstrated no doubt the other laymen would have it within a fortnight as all of them were ready to begin sluicing as soon as the ground could be stripped undoubtedly they would be able to take out a substantial stake before winter settled and the first frost closed them down she took the news quietly but with shining eyes though her pleasure was no greater or more genuine than poleons who grasped both her hands in his and shouted gleefully bien im glad youll be riche gal for sure now an wear plaintee fine dress lak i fetch you jus tink you fin gol on your place more queecker dan your fader an hes good miner too ha dats bully oh poleon ill be a fine lady after all she cried just as ive dreamed about wasnt it beautiful that

its impossible youre sure to strike it or if you dont you can have half of what i make ill be too wealthy anyhow so you might as well he laughed again at which she suddenly remembered that he had not laughed very much of late or else she had been too deeply absorbed in her own happiness to mark the lack of his songs and merriment when you do become a flambeau king she continued what will you do with yourself surely you wont continue that search for your far country it could never be so beautiful as this she pointed to the river that never changed and yet was never the same and to the forests slightly tinged with the signs of the coming season just look at the mountains she mused in a hushed voice see the haze that hangs over them the veil that god uses to cover up his treasures she drew a deep breath the breeze fairly tastes with clean things doesnt it do you know ive often wanted to be an animal to have my senses sharpened one of those wild things with a funny sharp cold nose id like to live in the trees and run along the branches like a squirrel and drink in the perfume that comes on the wind and eat the tender growing things the sun is bright enough and the world is good enough but i cant feel enough im incomplete its very fine agreed the canadian i don see wy anybody would care for livin on dem cities wen deres so much nice place outside oh but the cities must be fine also said she though of course they cant be as lovely as this wont i be glad to see them are you goin away he inquired quickly of course then glimpsing his downcast face she hastened to add that is when my

here she laid her hand on her breast father barnum told me the story of your people and how it lives in your blood that hunger to find the far places its what drove the voyageurs and coureur du bois from quebec to vancouver and from the mississippi to hudsons bay the wanderlust was their heritage and they pushed on and on without rest like the salmon in the spring but they were different in this that they never came back to die dats me i never see no place yet wat i care for die on an i never see no place yet wat i care for see again cept dis flambeau i lak it dis one purty good so far but i

you would marry me if i wanted you to youve done everything else ive ever asked but you neednt be afraid i wont take you up in all her life this man had never spoken of love to her and she had no hint of the dream he cherished he had sung his songs to her and told her stories till his frank and boyish mind was like an open page to her she knew the romance that was the very fibre of him and loved his exaggerated chivalry for it minded her of old tales she had read but that he could care for her save as a friend as a brother such a thought had never dawned upon her while they were talking a boat had drawn inshore and made fast to the bank in front of them an indian landed and approaching entered into talk with the frenchman byandby poleon turned to the girl and said dereshondred martenskin come in you min de store wile i mak trade wit dis man together the two went down to the boat leaving necia behind and not long after runnion sauntered up to the store and addressed her familiarly hello necia i just heard about the strike on your claim thats fine and dandy she acknowledged his congratulations curtly for although it was customary for most of the oldtimers to call her by her christian name she resented it from this man she chose to let it pass however i had some good news last night myself he continued one of my men has hit some good dirt and well know what it means in a day or so ill gamble were into the money big though for i always was a lucky cuss say wheres your father hes out at the mine weve used up all of our bar sugar at the saloon and i want to buy what youve got very well ill get it for you he followed her inside watching her graceful movements and attempting with his freeandeasy insolence to make friendly advances but seeing that she refused to notice him he became piqued and grew bolder look here necia youre a mighty pretty girl ive had my eye on you ever since i landed and the more i see of you the better i like you it isnt necessary to tell me that she replied the price of the sugar will be just the same yes and youre bright too he declared thats what i like in a woman good looks and brains i believe in strong methods and straight talk too none of this serenading and moonlight mush for me when i see a girl i like i go and get her thats me i make love like a man ought to are you making love to me she inquired curiously its a little bit sudden i know but a man has to begin some time i think youd just about suit me well both have money before long and ill be good to you the girl laughed derisively in his face now dont get sore i mean business i dont wear a blue coat and use a lot of fancy words and then throw you down when ive had my fun and i dont hang around and spoil your chances with other men either what do you mean well im no softtalking southerner with gold buttons and highfalutin ways i dont care if you are a squaw ill take you dont talk to me she cried in disgust her voice hot with anger and resentment but he continued unheeding now cut out these airs and get down to cases i mean what i say i know youve been casting sheeps eyes at burrell but lord he wouldnt have you no matter how rich you get of course you acted careless in going off alone with him but i dont mind what theyre saying around camp for ive made little slips like that myself and wed get along ill have you killed she hissed through her clinched teeth while her whole body vibrated with passion ill call poleon and have him shoot you she pointed to the riverbank a hundred yards away where the canadian was busy assorting skins but he only laughed at her show of temper and shrugged his shoulders as he answered her roughly understand me im on the square so think it over and dont go up in the air like a skyrocket she cried out at him to go go go and finally he took up his bundle saying as he stepped out slowly all right but im coming back and youll have to listen to me i dont mind being called a squawman youre pretty near white and youre good enough for me ill treat you right why ill even marry you if youre dead set on it sure she could scarcely breathe but checked her first inclination to call poleon knowing that it needed only a word from her to set that nutbrown savage at runnions throat other thoughts began to crowd her brain and to stifle her the fellows words had stabbed her consciousness and done something for her that gentler means would not have accomplished they had opened her eyes to a thing that she had forgotten a hideous thing that had reared its fangs once before to strike but which her dreams of happiness had driven out of her eden all at once she saw the wrong that had been done her and realized from this brutes insult that those early fears had been well grounded it suddenly occurred to her that in all the hours she had spent with her lover in all those unspeakably sweet and intimate hours there had never been one word of marriage he had looked into her eyes and vowed he could not live without her and yet he had never said the words he should have said the words that would bind her to him his arms and his lips had comforted her and stilled her fears but after all he had merely made love a cold fear crept over the girl she recalled the old corporals words of a few weeks ago and her conversation with stark came back to her what if it were true that which runnion implied what if he did not intend to ask her after all what if he had only been amusing himself she cried out sharply at this and when doret staggered in beneath a great load of skins he found her in a strange excitement when he had finished his accounting with the indian and dismissed him she turned an agitated face to the frenchman poleon she said im in trouble oh im in such awful trouble its dat runnion i seen im pass on de store wile im down below his brows knit in a black scowl and his voice slid off a pitch in tone wat he say eh no no its not that he paid me a great compliment she laughed harshly why he asked me to marry him the man beside her cursed at this but she continued dont blame him for liking me im the only woman for five hundred miles around or i was until this crowd came so how could he help himself no he merely showed me what a fool ive been i guess you better tell me all bout dis ting said poleon gravely you know im all tam ready for help you necia wen you was little feller an got bust your finger you run to me queeck an i feex it yes i know dear poleon she assented gratefully youve been a brother to me and i need you now more than i ever needed you before i cant go to father he wouldnt understand or else he would understand too much and spoil it all his temper is so quick im not wat you call easygoin mesef the canadian said darkly and it was plain that he was deeply agitated which added to the girls distress but she began to speak rapidly incoherently her impulsiveness giving significance to her words so that the man had no difficulty in following her drift with quick insight he caught her meaning and punctuated her broken sentences with a series of grave nods assuring her that he knew and understood he had always known he had always understood it seemed dont think im unwomanly poleon for im not i may be foolish and faithful and too trusting but im not unmaidenly you see ive never been like other girls and he was so fine so different he made me love him its part of a soldiers training i suppose it was so sweet to be near him and to hear him tell of himself and all the world he knows i just let myself drift im afraid im afraid i listened too well and my ears heard more than he said my head is so full of books you know he should have know dat too said poleon yes she flared up he knew i was only an indian girl the only color in dorets face lay now in his cheeks where the sun had put it but he smiled at her his warm engaging smile and laid his great brown hand upon her shoulder softly ive look in hees eye an im always tink hes good man i don never tink hell mak fun of poor little gal but he has poleon thats just what he has done she came near to breaking down and finished pathetically theyre telling the story on the street so runnion says dats easy ting for feex he said runnion she don spread no more story lak dat i dont care what they say i want the truth i want to know what he means what his intentions are he swears he loves me and yet he has never asked me to marry him he has gone too far he has made a fool of me to amuse himself and and i couldnt see it until today hes laughing at me poleon hes laughing at me now oh i cant bear it the frenchman took up his wide hat from the counter and placed it carefully upon his head but she stopped him as he moved towards the door for she read the meaning of the glare in his eyes wait till you understand wait i say he hasnt done anything yet dats de trouble im goin mak im do someting no no it isnt that its these doubts that are killing me im not sure i hear plaintee he said deres no tam for monkey roun i tell you he may be honest she declared he may mean to marry me but ive got to know thats why i came to you thats what you must find out for me im good trader necia said the canadian after a moment ill mak bargain wit you now if he say yes hell marry you i don ask no more but if he say no you geeve im to me is it go she hesitated while he continued musingly i don see how no man on all dis worl could lef you go then to her wal is it bargain yes she said the indian blood speaking now but you must learn the truth there must be no mistake that would be terrible dere ain goin be no mistak if he should refuse i ill marry some one quick i wont be laughed at by this camp i wont be a joke oh poleon ive given myself to him just as truly as if well he he has taken my first kiss doret smote his hands together at this and began to roll his head backward from side to side as if in some great pain but his lips were dry and silent after a moment the spell left him the fire died down leaving only a dumb agony in its place she came closer and continued ill never let them point at me and say there goes the squaw that he threw away you mak dis very hard ting for me he said wearily listen she went on lashing herself with pity and scorn you say father barnum will be here on sunday well ill marry some one i dont care who then with a sudden inspiration she cried ill marry you you said i could be a wife to you he uttered a sharp cry you mean dat necia yes she declared why not youll do it for my sake wont you would you stan up wit me longside of de pries lovin dat oder feller all de tam he asked queerly yes yes id rather it was you than anybody but married ill be on sunday ill never let them laugh at me doret held his silence for a moment then he looked up and said in level tones its easy ting for go an ask im but you mus hear hees answer wit your own ears den you cant tink im lyin ill fetch im ere on dis place if you feex it for hide yousef behin dose post he indicated a bundle of furs that were suspended against a pillar and which offered ample room for concealment deres goin be no lies today he pulled himself together and went out with the tired gait of an old man his great shock head bowed low a few moments later he returned ive sent lil jean for im you get in dere out of sight an wait chapter xii a tangled skein when burrell entered he wasted no time in greetings i know why you sent for me poleon ive heard the news and i would have been up anyhow to congratulate her very soon i call it pretty fine yes deres been beeg strike all right an necia is goin be riche gal im as pleased as if the claim were mine and you feel the same way of course the frenchman nodded i love necia very much lak well lak im broder to her the knowledge that she was listening made him very uncomfortable in fact this whole affair savored more of doubledealing and treachery than anything he had ever attempted and it went sorely against his grain but it had presented itself as the only way to help her and he proceeded groping haltingly for fit expression deres ting i want for talk bout wit you but im scare youll tink im butt in nonsense said burrell i know you too well for that you know me for good man eh an you know i ain try for brek up oder fellers biznesse never wal im come to you now lak wan good man to noder biccause im got bad trouble on de min an you musnt get sore theres no danger poleon lets have it if there is anything i can do you may count on me wal he began nervously clearing his throat its lak dis deres feller been talk some bout necia an it ain nice talk neider who is he exclaimed the soldier in a tone that made the girls heart leap wait lemme tol you wat he say den well talk bout feex im plaintee he say deres joke down on starks saloon dat necia gale is mak fool of hersef on you an dat you ain care for marry her runnion cried burrell and started for the door ill settle with him now for fair but poleon blocked his way and observing him gravely continued in a tone that the other could not disregard nor mistake no msieu before you pass on dat place youll tol me if its true true the lieutenant retorted angrily what business is it of yours this concerns me an me too im wat you call gardeen for necia till john gale come back an im broder of her too you promis jus now you don get mad an i don say shes runnion neider wat spik dose ting deres more dan im been talkin is it true his sternness offended burrell for the soldier was not the kind to discuss his affairs in this way therefore he drew back scowling poleon doret he said its not ones enemies who do him injury its his damned fool friends i have learned to regard you highly because you are a brave man and an honest one but it seems that you are a sentimental idiot dem is tough word doret replied but deres reason wy i cant tak on no madnesse you say im hones wal im hones now an i come to you wit fair words an i show my han to you i don hoi out no cards msieu but i don tink it is you who have play square altogeder im necias frien an ill fight for her jus so queecker lak you but i mus know dis ting for sure so if you have de good heart an de courage of good man youll tell me de truth do you have the feelin for marry on her the pause that followed was awkward for both of them while the girl who stood concealed near by held her breath and buried her nails in her palms why did he hesitate would he never speak it seemed not for he swung between diverse emotions anger that this outsider should question him on so intimate a matter chagrin at the knowledge of having injured necia and rage blind rage at the thought of its becoming a barroom topic gradually the conviction grew that it was not a question of idle curiosity with doret and the mans history recurred to him no wonder he was interested in the girl no wonder he wished to guard her he had been a brother indeed even as he said and he could have no motive save an honorable one it never occurred to the soldier that this frenchman could harbor feelings akin to his own the man was rough and foreign his thoughts had been couched in harsher language perhaps than he intended moreover the fellows high sense of honor was a byword and of a sudden the desire to set himself right in this mans eyes dictated his answer i am amazed at myself for listening to you he said at last and quite shocked in fact at my answering your questions but perhaps id better after all first however let me say that the little girl is just as pure now as she was before she knew me poleon threw up his hand msieu dats more closer to de insult dan wat you call me jus now you don need for spoke it youre right theres no need to tell you that as for showing her certain attentions well i admit that i have as you know but thank god i can say ive been a gentleman and addressed her as i would the fairest lady ive known an you mean for marry eh probed the other now no man could have answered such a direct question easily and in this case it was especially hard for the kentuckian who was torn between his ungovernable desire and that decision which cold reason had thrust upon him he wanted to say yes ill marry her tomorrow but something bade him pause before he sacrificed upon this altar of a youthful love his life his hopes his ambitions had he not wrestled with himself for months in thinking it all out until his mind was weary and listless with the effort for the great test that tries a mans soul and compels him to know himself had not yet come to meade burrell wherefore he hesitated long i did not say so he declared at last its a thing i cant well discuss because i doubt if you could understand what i would say this life of yours is different from mine and it would be useless for me to explain the reason why i cannot marry her leaving out all question of my sentiment there are insurmountable obstacles to such a union but as to this talk i think that can be stopped without annoyance to her and as for the rest we must trust to time to bring about a proper adjustment a low discordant sound of laughter arrested his words and turning he beheld necia standing revealed in the dimness what an amusing person you are she said ive had hard work holding in all this time while you were torturing your mind and twisting the honest english language out of shape and meaning i knew i should have to laugh sooner or later what is the meaning of this he demanded is it a joke indeed it is she declared laughing afresh and the best ive ever enjoyed wasnt it funny poleon she turned gayly to the frenchman but he stood like one petrified to see him debating coolly whether he cared for me enough to face the world with me and trying to explain to you that he was too good to marry a squaw oh you were very gentlemanly about it sir and you wouldnt have hurt my feelings for the world necia thats your dixie chivalry i suppose well ive played with you long enough lieutenant burrell im tired of the game and you interest me no longer you you say youve been playing with me stammered the man the bottom of things seemed suddenly to slide from under him he was like one sinking in some hideous quagmire he felt as if he were choking why of course she cried scornfully just as you took me up for amusement you were such a fine welldressed immaculate mound of conceit that i couldnt resist the temptation and you hid your condescension so poorly that i thought you ought to be taken down a peg i knew i was a squaw but i wanted to see if i were not like other women after all and if you were not like other men she was talking rapidly now almost shrilly for she had never attempted to act before while he stood dazed and speechless fumbling at his throat while she railed at him you neednt waste time debating whether im good enough for you because im not decidedly im not your kind and you are a joke to me he uttered an inarticulate cry but she ran on unheeding her eyes wide and glowing like coals her lips chalkwhite you see its time i stopped such foolishness anyhow for im to be married on sunday you are going to be married he muttered laboriously yes to poleon why thats been understood for years he whirled upon the canadian in a fury and his words came hot and tumbling so youre in this doret youre a part of this little farce you trapped me here to make a fool of me did you well i can settle with you ddont blame him cried the girl hysterically it is all my doing he had no part in it burrell wheeled back to the frenchman again is this true yes said doret in a restrained voice dis ain no work of mine youre a liar breathed the kentuckian now fairly wild with anger but the other looked him squarely between the eyes and made no move msieu he cried im livin torty year an never took no nam lak dat before but deres reason here wy i cant mak no answer he inclined his head towards the girl and before burrell could break out again he checked him its no good mak fight wit lesser dan two people youve tol me dat you are gentleman wal i ain nobody but trapper an trader but i don spoil de name of no good girl an i don quarrel in presence of lady so mebbe affer all deres mistak somewere an im gentleman mesef stead of you why you arent really angry lieutenant mocked necia its only the joke of an ignorant halfbreed girl whose sense of humor is all out of gear you mustnt quarrel over a squaw she taunted him like a baited badger for this thing was getting beyond her control and the savage instincts of the wilderness were uppermost you are quite right he replied i am very foolish and the laugh is with you his lips tried to frame a smile but failed and he added your wit is not my kind that is all i beg you both to accept my congratulations on your nuptials undoubtedly you will be happy together two people with such similar ideas of humor must have much to enjoy in common he bowed low and turning walked out the moment he was gone she cried breathlessly you must marry me poleon youve got to do it now do you mean dat for sure he said cant you see theres nothing else for it after this ill show him that he cant make me a toy to suit his convenience ive told him i would marry you on sunday and ill do it or die of course you dont love me for you dont know what love is i suppose how could you she broke down and began to catch her breath amid coughing sobs that shook her slender body though they left her eyes dry and feverish i im very unhappy bbut ill be a good wife to you oh poleon if you only knew he drew a long breath when he spoke his voice had the timbre of some softly played instrument and a tremor ran through his words no i don know wat kin of love is dis for sure de kin of love i know is de kin i sing bout in my songs i spose its different breed to yours an im begin to see it don live nowhere but on dem songs of mine deres long tarn i waste here now five year but tomorrow i go again lookin for my own countree poleon she cried looking up with startled eyes not tomorrow but sunday we will go together he shook his head tomorrow necia an i go alone then you wont marry me she

burst out you think youre doing me a favor but youre not why theres runnion he wants me so much that hed even marry me her wild laughter stabbed the man was ever a girl in such a fix ive been made love to ever since i was half a woman but at thought of a priest men seem to turn pale and run like whipped dogs im only good enough for a bad man and a gambler i suppose she sank to a seat flung out her arms hopelessly and bowing her head began to weep uncontrollably if if i only had a woman to talk to but they are all men all men poleon waited patiently until her paroxysm of sobbing had passed then gently raised her and led her out through the back door into the summer day which an hour ago had been so bright and promising and was now so gray and dismal he followed her with his eyes until she disappeared inside the loghouse an dats de end of it all he mused five year ive wait an jus for dis meade burrell never knew how he gained his quarters but when he had done so he locked his door behind him then loosed his hold on things material he raged about the room like a wild animal and vented his spite on every inanimate thing that lay within reach his voice was strange in his own ears as was the destructive frenzy that possessed him in time he grew quieter as the physical energy of this brutal impulse spent itself but there came no surcease of his mental disquiet as yet his mind grasped but dully the fact that she was to marry another but gradually this thought in turn took possession of him she would be a wife in two days that great roistering brown man would fold her to himself she would yield to him every inch of her palpitant passionate body the thought drove the lover frantic and he felt that madness lay that way if he dwelt on such fancies for long of a sudden he realized all that she meant to him and cursed himself anew while he had the power to possess her he had dallied and hesitated but now that he had no voice in it now that she was irretrievably beyond his reach he vowed to snatch her and hold her against the world as he grew calmer his reason began to dissect the scene that had taken place in the store and he wondered whether she had been lying to him after all no doubt she had been engaged to the frenchman and had always planned to wed poleon for that was not out of reason she might even have set out mischievously to amuse herself with him but at the recollection of those rapturous hours they had spent together he declared aloud that she had loved him and him only every instinct in him shouted that she loved him in spite of her cruel protestations all that afternoon he stayed locked in his room and during those solitary hours he came to know his own soul he saw what life meant what part love plays in it how dwarfed and withered all things are when pitted against it a man came with his supper but he called to him to be gone the night settled slowly and with the darkness came such a feeling of despair and lonesomeness that burrell lighted every lamp and candle in the place to dispel in some measure the gloom that had fallen upon him there are those who believe that in passing from daylight to darkness a subtle transition occurs akin to the change from positive to negative in an electrical current and that this intangible untraceable atmospheric influence exerts a definite psychical effect upon men and their modes of thought be this as it may it is certain that as the night grew darker the lieutenants mood changed he lost his fierce anger at the girl and reasoned that he owed it to her to set himself right in her eyes that in all justice to her he ought to prove his own sincerity and assure her that whatever her own state of mind had been she wronged him when she said he had made sport of her for his own pleasure she might then dismiss him and proceed with her marriage but first she must know this much of the truth at least so he argued insensible to the sophistry of his reasoning which was in reality impelled by the hunger to see her and hear her voice again he snatched his hat and bolted out almost running in his eagerness an upriver steamboat was just landing as he neared the tradingpost a freighter as he noted by her lights in the glare at the riverbank he saw poleon and the trader who had evidently returned from lees creek and without accosting them he hurried on to the store peering in from the darkness he saw alluna no doubt necia was alone in the house behind so he stumbled around to the back to find the window of her room aglow behind its curtain and receiving no answer to his knock he entered for it was customary at gales to waive ceremony inside the big room he paused then stepped swiftly across and rapped at her door falling back a pace as she came out instead of speaking at once as he had planned to prevent her escaping he was struck speechless for the vision that met his eyes was that which he had seen one blithe spring morning three months before but tonight there was no shawl to conceal her sweetly rounded neck and shoulders whose whiteness was startling against the black of the ballroom gown the slim gold chain hung around her neck and her hair was piled high as before he noted every smallest detail as she stood there waiting for him to speak forgetful of everything else she had put on the gown again to see if perchance there might be some mark of her blood or breed that had escaped her previous scrutiny and as there was no one to observe her she had attired herself slowly absorbed in her whimsy her wistful beauty dazed the young man and robbed him of the words he had rehearsed but as she made to flee from him with a pitiful gesture towards her room the fear of losing her aroused him and spurred his wit dont go away i have something i must tell you ive thought it over and youve got to listen necia i am listening she answered very quietly understand me im not whining and im willing to take my medicine i couldnt talk or think very straight this afternoon but you were wrong yes i know now i was wrong it was most unladylike wasnt it but you see i am only a little savage i dont mean that i mean you were wrong when you said i had played with you in the sight of god i swear you were mistaken you have made me love you necia cant you see she made no sign if you cant i owe it to you and to myself to set you right i am not ashamed to acknowledge my love and even when you are married to poleon i want you to know that i shall love you always even yet she made no sign was he not merely repeating the same empty words with which he had so often beguiled her there was no word of marriage he still considered her unworthy beneath him the pain of it caused the girl to wince suddenly and her sensitive face flinched seeing which he broke out you do love me necia you do i see it in your eyes and he started towards her with open arms but she shrank away from him no no dont touch me she almost screamed my dear one he breathed you must listen to me you have nothing to fear for i love you love you love you you were made for me youll be my wife yes youll be married on sunday but to me not to poleon or any other man did she hear aright was he her soldier lover asking her the indian girl you do love me dont you he pleaded but still she could not speak and he tried to read the answer in her swimming eyes you mean you want to marry me she murmured at last hesitating shyly at the word that had come to play so momentous a part in her little world indeed i do he declared with emphasis in spite of everything anything nothing else matters nothing nothing ill quit the army ill give up the service and my people too ill put everything back of me and well start out anew just you and i wait a moment she said retreating a little from his eager outstretched arms why do you need to do all that never mind why its as good as done you wouldnt understand but i think i do understand now do i really mean all that to you yes and more listen to me said the girl quietly i want you to talk slowly so i may not misunderstand if you marry me must you forego all those great things you speak of your profession your family your future dont lets talk about it necia ive got you and please answer me she urged i thought i understood but im afraid i dont i thought it was my being a breed that stood in the way theres nothing in the way that i wasnt good enough i knew i could overcome that i knew i could make myself grow to your level but i didnt think my blood would fetter you and make this difference i suppose i am putting it awkwardly because im not sure that i quite understand it myself yet things seem different now somehow than they did before nonsense exclaimed the soldier if they dont bother me necia why should you worry would you really have to give up your family your sister would those people you are so proud of and who are so proud of you would they cut you off there is no question of cutting off i have no inheritance coming i dont want any i dont want anything except you dear wont you tell me she persisted you see i am dull at these things well what if they do he conceded you more than make it up to me you outweigh a thousand families and would your marriage to a a to me destroy your army career well it will really be much easier for both of us if i resign from the service he finally admitted in fact ive decided to do so at once no no you mustnt do that tonight you think i am worth the price but a day will come he leaned forward and caught her hands in his meade i cant let you do it id like to see you help yourself he said banteringly i can and i will you must not marry me meade its not right it cant be she suddenly realized what this renunciation would mean and began to shiver to think of losing him now after he had come to her freely it would be very hard but to her too there had come the revelation that love means sacrifice and she knew now that she loved her soldier too well to let her shadow darken his bright future too well to ruin him it will be over before you know it she heard him saying in a lame attempt at levity father barnum is an expert and the operation wont occupy him ten minutes meade you must listen to me now she said so earnestly that it sobered him do you think a girl could be happy if she knew a good man had spoiled his life for her i would rather die now than let you do such a thing i couldnt bear to see myself a drag on you oh i know it would be wonderful this happiness of ours for a time and then she was finding it more and more difficult to continue a prisoner grows to hate the chains that bind him when that day came for you i should hate myself no no believe me it cant be youre not of my people and im not of yours at that moment they heard the voices of the trader and his squaw outside approaching the house the girls breath caught in her throat she flung herself recklessly upon her lovers breast and threw her arms around his neck in an agony of farewell meade meade my soldier she sobbed kiss me goodbye for the last time no he said roughly but she dragged his face down to her burning lips now you must go she said tearing herself away and for my sake dont see me again i will i will ill ask your father for you tonight no no dont please dont wait till till tomorrow till i say the word promise me on your love promise her eyes held such a painful entreaty that he nodded acquiescence as the door opened and her father and alluna entered chapter xiii stark takes a hand in the game the old man greeted the lieutenant affably but as his glance fell on his daughter he stopped stockstill on the threshold i told you never to wear that dress again he said in a dry harsh voice the girl made no answer for her heart was breaking but turned and went into her room burrell had an irresistible desire to tell gale that he wanted his daughter for his wife it would be an unwonted pleasure to startle this irongray old man and the shawled and shambling mummy of red with the unwinking eyes that always reminded him of two oxheart cherries but he had given necia his promise so he descended to the exchange of ordinary topics and inquired for news of the creek necias ground is getting better every hour the trader said yesterday they found a sixtydollar pan have you struck pay on yours no poleon and i seem to hold bad hands some of his laymen are quitting work theyve crosscut in half a dozen places and cant find a color but surely they havent fully prospected his claims yet there must be plenty of room for a paystreak somewhere mustnt there it looks like he had drawn three blanks said gale although we cant tell for sure theyre breaking most as bad for me too but ive got a new hunch and im running up a dreen to catch bedrock along the left rim ive got twenty men at work and ill know before long you heard about runnion of course yes the usual story the bad men get the good mines and the good ones get the hungry spots well i might have been one of the unfortunates if i had staked for myself but i hardly think so im pretty lucky he laughingly bade them goodnight content with himself and at peace with the world gale went to necias door and called her but when she appeared he was unprepared for the tragic face with which she greeted him daughter he said dont feel bad over what i said i didnt mean to be cross with you but i dont like that dress were you cross with me daddy she said dully i didnt hear what did you say he looked at her in amazement necia little girl what is the trouble she was staring past him and her fingers were fumbling helplessly with the lace of her gown but she began to show signs of collapse i sent him away i gave him up when he wanted me wanted me oh daddy he wants to marry me and i sent him away alluna uttered a short satisfied exclamation and looking at gale meaningly said it is good it is good he is a stranger but the man disregarded her interruption he asked you to marry him in in in spite of who you are and what i am yes he is ready to give up his ambition his army his future his family everything for me to sacrifice it all and so of course i couldnt let him she spoke simply as if her father would surely understand and approve her action while in her voice was a note of inevitable resignation you see i never understood what my blood would mean to him until tonight ive been selfish and thoughtless i guess i just wanted him and wanted him to take me but now that he is mine i love him more than i thought he is so dear to me that i cant drag him down i cant i cant she went to the open door and stood leaning against the casing facing the cool outer darkness her face hidden from them her form sagging wearily as if the struggle had sapped her whole strength alluna crept to the trader and looked up at him eagerly whispering this will end in a little while john she is young she can go back to the mission tomorrow she will soon forget forget do you think she can forget any woman can forget only men remember it is the red blood in you lying you know you lie it is to save your life she said i know but its no use to necia he said you neednt worry little daughter but her ears were deaf you neednt give him up i say this will end all right seeing that she gave no sign of heeding he stepped closer and swung her about till she faced him cant you trust me this one time you always have before necia i say hell marry you and it will all come out right she raised her hopeless eyes and strove gamely to meet his then failing broke away and turned back to the door i knew you couldnt understand i i oh god i love him so with a cry like that of a wounded animal she fled out into the night where she could give vent to her anguish unseen for she had never wept before her father but always crept away and hid herself until her grief was spent gale would have started after her but alluna dragged him back fiercely no no it means your life john let the secret die and she will forget she is so young time will cure her time cures everything dont tell her dont tell any one and above all dont tell that soldier he would not believe nor would she even i have doubted you yes john and if i dont believe what is a stranger to say no man knowing you would believe the tale without proof suppose she doubted have you ever thought of that would you not rather have her die still loving you than live and disbelieve yes yes of course i ive thought of that but woman youre worse than a rattlesnake even if he knew he might not marry her you at least are clean and that other man was a devil a brave mans life is too great a price to pay for a grief that will die in a year alluna was speaking swiftly in her own language her body tense her face ablaze and no man seeing her could ever again have called her people stolid you think time will cure a love like that he said yes yes thats all you know about it time may act that way perhaps in cities and such places but out in the hills it is different when youve got the breath of the forest in you i say it is different time why ive lived fifteen years in the open with a living memory every night ive dreamed it over every day ive lived it through in every campfire i see a face and every wind from the south brings a voice to me every stormy night a girl with eyes like necias calls to me and i have to follow every patch of moonlight shows her smiling at me just beyond just in the shadows edge love time why alluna love is the only thing in the world that never dies and time only makes it the more enduring he took up the white slouch hat he had thrown down when he came in and stepped to the door where are you going inquired the squaw fearfully to the barracks to give myself up she flung herself at him with a great cry and seized him about the waist you never loved me john but i have been a good woman to you although i knew you were always thinking of her and had no thought of me i have loved this girl because you loved her i have hated your enemies because you hated them and now i remember while you forget forget what do you mean stark the man paused i did almost forget him and after fifteen years let us kill him tonight then we will go to the soldier together side by side i am your woman necia will look after the little ones gale stared at her and as he gazed the red pigment underneath her skin the straighthanging manelike hair the gaudy shawl she never went without the shapeless skinshod feet the slovenly illfitting garb of a miscast woman vanished and he saw her as she was on a day long past a slim shy silent creature with great watchful trusting eyes and a soul unspoiled no woman had ever been so loyal so uncomplaining he had robbed her of her people and her gods he had shifted hither and yon at the call of his uncertain fortune or at a sign of that lurking fear that always dogged him and she had never left his side never questioned never doubted but always served him like a slave without asking for a part in that other love without sharing in the caresses he had consecrated to a woman she had never seen by heaven youre game alluna but theres a limit even to what i can take from you he said at last i dont ever seem to have noticed it before but there is no ive got to do this thing alone tonight all of it for you have no place in it and i cant let the little girl go on like this the sooner that soldier knows the better he leaned down and touched her brown mouth with his grizzled lips thank you alluna for making a man of me when id nearly forgotten now you stay here he knew he could count on her obedience and so he left her when he had gone she drew the shawl up over her face and crouched in the doorway straining her eyes after him through the dark in time she began to rock and sway and then to chant until the night moaned with the deathsong of her people necia had no idea whither she went her only thought was to flee from her kin who could not understand to hide under cover in some solitary place to let the darkness swallow her up so that she might give way to her grief and be just a poor weak woman so with a dull and aching heart she wandered bareheaded barenecked halfdemented and wholly oblivious to her surroundings without sense of her incongruous attire or of the water that squeezed up through the soggy moss at her tread and soaked her frail slippers on she stumbled blindly through the murk like some fair creature of light cast out and banished the night was cloudy and a wind came sighing from the north tossing the girls hair and tugging at the careless folds of her dress but she heard nothing save the devils tattoo that rang in her head and felt nothing beyond the pain at throat and breast which in time became so bitter that the tears were wrung from her dry eyes and she began to weep in a pitiful woman fashion as if her heart would burst the first drops cleared a way for others and soon she was sobbing freely alone and without solace lost in the night she had not succeeded in thoroughly isolating herself however for a man who was steering his course by the sense of feel and the winds direction heard her and paused his steps were muffled in the soft footing so that she had no warning of his presence until he was near enough to distinguish her dimly where she leaned against the log wall of a halfcompleted cabin to his question whats the trouble here she made no answer but moved away whereupon he detained her theres something wrong who are you anyhow its only necia mr stark said the girl at which be advanced and took her by the arm what ails you child what in the world are you doing here come its only a step to my cabin you must come in and rest awhile and youll soon be all right why youll break your neck in this darkness she hung back but he compelled her to go with him in spite of her unwillingness now now he admonished with unusual kindliness for him you know youre my little friend and i cant let you go on this way its scandalous i wont stand for it i like you too much in truth he had done things during these last few weeks to make her think so having never missed an opportunity to stop and pass a word with her at the same time showing her a queer courtesy and consideration quite foreign to his saturnine habits she had never mentioned the fact to her father or the others for she had developed a sort of sympathy for the man and felt that she understood him better than they did he led her inside his cabin and closed the door in the face of the night wind before he struck a light i cant stand to see you cry he repeated as he adjusted the wick now as soon as he stopped in astonishment for he had turned to behold instead of the little halfbreed girl this slender sorrowful stranger in her amazingly wonderful raiment by he checked himself insensibly and stood motionless for a long time while she wiped her eyes and womanlike straightened out her gown and smoothed her hair with little feminine touches i i hope youll excuse me for acting this way she smiled at him piteously then observing his strange features why what is the matter mr stark are you angry his hawklike face was strained and colorless his black eyes fierce and eager his body bent as if to pounce upon a victim in truth he was now the predatory animal no he replied as if her question carried no meaning then coming to himself no no of course not but you gave me a start you reminded me of some one how do you come to be dressed like that i never knew you had such clothes poleon brought them from dawson they are the first i ever had he shook his head in a slow puzzled fashion you look just like a white girl i mean i dont know what i mean this time he roused himself fully the effort being more like a shudder so i have always thought she said and her eyes filled again your skin is like milk beneath your tan and i dont mean any disrespect but well im just so damned surprised come over here and sit down while i mix you something to put the heart back into you he shoved forward a big chair with a wolfskin flung over it into which she sank dejectedly while he stepped to the shelves beside the yukon stove and took down a bottle and some glasses she glanced about with faint curiosity but the interior of the cabin showed nothing out of the ordinary consisting as it did of one room with a cot in the corner upon which were tumbled blankets and above which was a row of pegs opposite was a sheetiron boxstove supported kneehigh on a tincapped framework of wood and in the centre a table with oilcloth cover around the walls were some cooking utensils a few cases of canned goods and clothes hanging in a row im not fixed up very well yet he apologized ive been too busy at the saloon to waste time on living quarters but its comfortable enough for an old roadster like me for ive bruised around the frontier so long that ive learned theres only three things necessary to a mans comfort warm clothes a full stomach and a dry place to sleep all the rest that goes to make a man content he has inside him and im not the kind to be satisfied no matter where i am or what i have i never was that kind so i just dont make the attempt he was talking to give her leeway and when he had concocted a weak toddy insisted that she must drink it which she did listlessly while he rambled on ive noticed a few things in my life miss necia and one of them is that it often does a heap of good to let out and talk things over not that a fellow gains any real advantage from disseminating his troubles but it serves to sort of ease his mind folks dont often come to me for advice or sympathy i dont have it to give but maybe it will help you to tell me what caused this nightmarauding expedition of yours seeing that she hesitated he went on i suppose theres a lot of reasons why you shouldnt confide in me i dont like that old man of yours nor any of your friends but maybe thats why im interested if any of them has upset you ill take particular pleasure in helping you get even i dont want to get even and there is nothing to tell said necia except a girls troubles and i cant talk about them she smiled a painful crooked smile at him your old man has been rough to you no no nothing of that sort then its that soldier he quizzed shrewdly i knew you cared a heap for him dont he love you yes thats the trouble and he wants to many me he swears he will in spite of everything see here i dont quite follow i thought you liked him hes the kind most women go daffy over like him the girl trembled with emotion like him why why i would do anything to make him happy i guess i must be kind of dull stark said perplexedly dont you see ive got to give him up im a squaw squaw hell with those shoulders stark checked himself for he found he was rejoicing in his enemys defeat and was in danger of betraying himself to the girl in every encounter the young man had bested him and these petty defeats had crystallized his antipathy to burrell into a hatred so strong that he had begun to lie awake nights planning a systematic quarrel for he was the kind of man who throve upon contentions so warped in soul that when no man offered him offence he brooded over fancied wrongs and conjured up a cause for enmity goading himself into that sour sullen habit of mind that made him a dread and a menace to all who lacked his favor his path was strewn from the border north with the husks of fierce brawls and he bore the ineradicable mark of the killer carrying always in his brain those scars that hate had seared in his eyes forever slumbered a flame waiting to be blown to life and when embroiled in feuds or bickerings a custom had grown upon him to fight these fights in secret many times until of nights he would lie in solitary darkness writhing in spirit as he hounded his man to desperation or forced him into a corner where he might slake his thirsty vengeance after such black sleepless hours he dragged himself from his battlegrounds of fancy worn and weary and the daylight discovered him more saturnine and moody more menacing than ever he had brooded over his quarrel with gale and the lieutenant ever since their first clash for in this place they furnished the only objects upon which his mania could work and it was a mania the derangement of a diseased distorted mind his regard for necia was a careless whim a rather aimless satisfying hobby not at all serious entirely extraneous to his everyday life and interesting only from its aimlessness being as near to an unselfish and decent motive as the man had ever come but it was not of sufficient consequence to stand out against or swerve the course of a quarrel wherefore he was gladdened by the news of burrells discomfiture so you like him too much to stand in his way he said meditatively how does your father look at it he wants the lieutenant to marry me he says he will fix it up all right but he doesnt understand how could he you are doing just right concurred the man hypocritically and youll live to be glad you stood out now that both his enemies desired this thing he was set on preventing it regardless of the girl how did the lieutenant take it when you refused him he wouldnt take it at all he only laughed and declared he would marry me anyhow the very thought thrilled her does he knew you love him the tender sobbing laugh she gave was ample answer well whats your plan i i i dont know i am so torn and twisted with it all that i cant plan but i have thought i ought to go away good he said quickly but his acquiescence instead of soothing her had the contrary effect and she burst out impulsively oh i cant i cant i cant go away and never see him i cant do it i want to stay where he is she had been holding herself in stubbornly but at last gave way with reckless abandon why wasnt i born white like other girls ive never felt like an indian ive always dreamed and fancied i was different and i am in my soul i know i am the white is so strong in me that it has killed the red and im one of fathers people im not like the other two they are brown and silent and as cold as little toads but im white and full of life all over they never see the men and women that i see in my dreams they never have my visions of the beautiful snowwhite mother with the tender mouth and the sad eyes that always smile at me you have visions of such things eh yes but i came a generation late thats all and ive got that other womans soul im not a halfbreed im not me at all im merridy merridy thats who i am her face was turned away from him so that she did not notice the frightful effect her words had upon stark where did you get that name his voice was pitched in a different key now then after a moment he added from the story i told you at the mine that night i suppose oh no she answered ive always had it though they call me necia merridy was my fathers mother i guess im like her in many ways for i often imagine she is a part of me that her spirit is mine its the only way i can account for the sights i see your fathers mother he said mechanically thats queer he seemed to be trying to shake himself free from something its heredity i suppose you have visions of a white woman a woman named merridy eh suddenly his manner changed and he spoke so roughly that she looked at him in vague alarm how do you know how do you know she was his mother he told me so stark snarled he lied i can show you her weddingring ive always worn it she fumbled for the chain about her neck but it eluded her trembling fingers it has her name in it from dan to merridy starks hand darted forward and tore the thing from her shoulders then he thrust it under the lamp and glared at the inscription while his fingers shook so that he could barely distinguish the words his eyes were blazing and his face livid necia cried out but he dropped the ornament and seized her fiercely lifting her from the chair to her feet then with one swift downward clutch he laid hold of her dress at the left shoulder and ripped it half to her waist a hoarse sound came from his throat a cry half of amazement half of triumph let me go let me go she struggled to free herself but he held her in a viselike grip while he peered closely at a blemish well down upon her back then he let her slip from his grasp and seized with terror she staggered away from him he was leaning heavily with both hands upon the table his face working his head drawn down between his shoulders his thin lips grinning his whole manner so terrifying that she shrank back till she brought up against the bark walls she turned and made for the door whereupon he straightened up and said in a queer commanding voice wait dont go i i you he licked his lips as if they were dust dry passed an uncertain hand across his beaded brow and raising the waterpail beside the door to his mouth drank heavily in great noisy gulps let me out of here the girl demanded imperiously dont be scared he said more quietly now you must excuse me you you gave me an awful fright yes that was it dont worry i didnt mean any harm you hurt my shoulder she said almost ready to cry and you tore my dress she added angrily my fine dress are you crazy you see its like this that name of merridy and that ring well the whole thing was so startling i i went off my head it came sudden and i thought i thought it dont matter what i thought but im sorry ill apologize and ill get you a new dress a whole lot of dresses if you like this seemed to amuse him and he began to laugh silently his first impulse had been to tell her everything but his amazement had rendered him speechless and now he was thankful for it following his discovery of her identity he had been stricken dumb staring at her like one demented then as he was about to explain his mind suddenly grasped the significance of this revelation and the advantage it gave him over his enemies a plan began to unfold vague at first its details not worked out but a plan whereby he could by keeping silent use this knowledge to serve his vengeful ends in an instant his vision cleared and his brain became active and alert like that of a man brought suddenly under the stimulus of strong liquor care must be exercised she must not learn too much for if she suspected the truth she would go to her soldier lover at once and no power on earth could hold her back that would block the vengeance that he saw shaping in the dank recesses of his distorted brain first and above all he must get the girl away from flambeau i went clear off my head he heard himself saying at that name of merridy that ring and all why why i thought you might be the missing girl i told you of you remember that day up on lees creek so i had to see but dear me i should have been more considerate i should have explained the trouble is im a nervous man and i get impulsive streaks on me sometimes that i cant control im sorry i spoiled your dress but ill get you another you bet i will this explanation of his strange behavior seemed plausible enough to banish all personal fears from necias mind indeed stark had now become so gentle and apologetic in his demeanor that her womans curiosity overcame her instinct to flee and she ventured the question so you really thought i was that other girl i did for a minute the mother was a a friend of mine and so i lost my head but im all right now and if youll overlook my roughness well go back to your troubles these last few moments had driven her own worries from her mind but he was bent on recalling them and so continued cautiously you were saying that you thought youd go away i think thats a good plan and youd be wise to do it for more reasons than one it will give you time to think it all over and know your own mind i know my mind now and yet i dont want to go away and it will give burrell a chance to prove himself hell either show that he has got to have you at any cost or that you are right in your decision if the first should happen you can come back to him if the last why it will be better for you anyhow as long as you stay here neither one of you can see clearly she was touched by his interest and realized the force of his argument which strange to say seemed to second her own thoughts yet she hesitated i want to help you im going to help you because ive got an interest in you like you were mine again he betrayed that strange mirthless amusement there is no place for me to go said necia blankly except the mission and i have no way of getting there dont you worry ill furnish the means and youd better go tonight she flinched yes tonight theres no use prolonging your agony ill get a boat ready and send a trusty man with you the current is swift and if he rows well you can make it by tomorrow evening thats only one night out and ill put some blankets aboard so you can wrap up and have a sleep i feel as if id never sleep again she sighed now now this will come out all right yet id take you down there myself but ive got to stay here ive got work to do yes ive sure got work of importance ahead of me i must go back and get some clothes she said at which he would have demurred had he not seen that she could not travel in her present condition very well but dont let anybody see you of course not its getting late and your folks will be abed he looked at his watch midnight be here in an hour and ill have the skiff ready the light of sacrifice was in necias eyes and her cheeks were blanched with the pallor of a great resolution she did not stop to reason why or how she had been led to this disposal of her future but clutched desperately at starks plan of rescue from her agonizing predicament ill be here in an hour she said simply he let her out closed the door after her and locked it then drawing a deep breath he raised his clenched hands above his head and gave a great sigh of exultation next he took out his sixshooter and examined it carefully the shells did not suit him so he filled the gun with new ones loosened the three lower buttons of his vest and slid the weapon inside his trousers band then facing the direction of gales tradingpost he spoke aloud i was a long time coming gaylord but im here and ive got you where ive wanted you these fifteen years yes and ive got you too burrell by god this is my night his lithe body became pantherlike in poise his bearing that of the meateating animal and his face set in a fierce exultant cruelty as he blew out his light and left the cabin chapter xiv a mystery is unravelled lieutenant burrell was considerably taken aback when a quarter of an hour after the young lovers ecstatic return to his quarters gale knocked at his door for the traders visit coupled with the late hour and his sombre countenance forecast new complications hes here to object but it wont go thought the lieutenant as he made his visitor welcome it was the traders first glimpse of the officers quarters and he cast a roving eye over the room as if measuring the owners character by his surroundings ive got to have a long talk with you burrell he began with an effort its liable to take me an hour or two then take this chair and be comfortable meade swung his big readingchair out beneath the hanginglamp and going to the sideboard brought back a bottle some glasses and a pouch of tobacco noting the old mans sigh of fatigue as he sat himself down heavily he remarked sympathetically mr gale youve made a long trip today and you must be tired if this talk is to be as lengthy as you say why not have a drink with me now and postpone it until tomorrow ive been tired for eighteen years the other replied tonight i hope to get rested he lapsed into silence watching his host pour out two glasses of liquor fill his pipe and then stretch himself out contentedly his feet resting on another chair a picture of youthful strength vitality and determination beneath the lieutenants flannel shirt the long slim muscles showed free and full and the firm set of jaw and lip denoted a mind at rest and confident of itself gale found himself for a moment jealously regarding the youth and his enviable state of contentment and decision well lets get at it the younger man finally said i suppose youll want to interrupt and question me a heap but ill ask you to let me tell this story the way it comes to me till i get it out then we can go back and take up the queer stuff it runs back eighteen or twenty years and being as its part of a hidden life it isnt easy to tell youll be the first one to hear it and i reckon youre enough like other men to disbelieve youre not old enough and you havent knocked around enough to learn that nothing is impossible that nothing is strange enough to be unreasonable likewise youll want to know what all this has to do with you and necia yes she told me about you and her and thats why im here he paused you really think you love her do you burrell removed his pipe and gazed at its coal impersonally i love her so well mr gale that nothing you can say will affect me i i hesitated at first about asking her to be my wife becauseyoull appreciate the unusual well her unusual history you see i come from a country where mixed blood is about the only thing that cant be lived down or overlooked and ive been raised with notions of family honor and pride of race and birth and so forth that might seem preposterous and absurd to you but a heap of conceits like that have been bred into me from generations back they run in the blood of every old family in my country and so im ashamed to say i hesitated and tried to reason myself into giving her up but ive had my eyes opened and i see how little those things amount to after all im going to marry necia mr gale id like to do it the day after tomorrow sunday but she isnt of age yet and if you object well have to wait until november when she turns eighteen wed both like your consent of course id be sorry to marry her without it but if you refuse well be forced to displease you he looked up and met the fathers gaze steadily now ill be glad to listen as long as you care to talk but i dont think it will do any good the other mans lips framed a faint smile well see i wish to god id had your decision when i was your age this story would be different and easier to tell he waited a moment then settled to his selfappointed task i was mining at the time up in the mother lode country of california which was the frontier then pretty much as this is now only we had better things to eat i came from the east or my people did but i was ranchraised and loved the hills and woods and places where you dont talk much so i went to prospecting because it took me out where the sun was bright and i could see the wild things at play i was one of the first men into a camp named chandon helped to build it in fact and got hold of some ground that looked real good it was hard mining however and being poor i was still gripping my drill and hammer after the town had grown up a woman came out from the east vermont it was and schoolteaching was her line of business only she hadnt been raised to it and this was her first clatter at the game but things had broke bad for her people and ended in her pulling stakes and coming west all alone her folks died and left her up against it i gathered from what little she told me sort of an old story i guess and usual too only for her she was plumb unusual he seemed to ponder this a moment and then resumed it dont make any difference to you how i first saw her and how i began to forget that anything else in the world was worth having but her id lived in the woods all my life as i said and knew more about birds and bugs and bees than i did about women i hadnt been broke proper and didnt know how to act with them but i laid out to get this girl and i did fairly well theres something wild in every woman that needs to be tamed and it isnt like the wildness that runs in wood critters you can win that over by gentleness but you have to take it away from a woman every live thing that couldnt talk was my friend but i made the mistake of courting my own kind the same way not knowing that when two of any species mate the male must rule i was too gentle even so i reckon id have won out only for another man dan bennett was his name the kind that dumb animals hate and well that takes his measure his range adjoined mine and though id never seen him i heard stories now and then the sort of tales you cant tell to a good woman so it worried me when i heard of his attentions to this girl still i thought shed surely find him out and recognize the kind of fellow he was but lord a woman cant tell a man from a dog and there wasnt any one to warn her there were plenty of women who knew him but they were the ones who flew by night while she lived in the sunshine and women of that kind dont make complaint anyhow this bennett came from the town below where he ran a saloon and a brace game or two but being as he rode into our camp and out again in the night and as i didnt drink nor listen to the music of the little rolling ball why we never met even after he began coming to chandon understand i wasnt too good for those amusements i just didnt happen to hanker after them for i was living with the image of the little schoolmaam in my mind and that destroyed what bad habits id formed it was along in the early spring that she began to see i had notions about her but my damned backwardness wouldnt let me speak and in addition i was getting closer to ore every shot at the mine and was holding off until i could lay both myself and my goldmine at her feet and ask her to take the two of us so if one didnt pan out the other might but it seemed like id never get into pay the closer i got the harder i worked and of course the less i saw of her likewise the oftener bennett came i reckon no man ever worked like i did two shifts a day eighteen hours with six to sleep the skin came off of my hands and i staggered when i came out into the daylight for the rock was hard and i had no money to hire a helper but i was young and strong and the hope of her was like drink and food and sleep to me at last i struck it and still i waited awhile longer till i could be sure then i went down to my little shack and put on my other clothes i remember id gone so thin that they hung loose and my palms were so raw i had hard work handling the buttons and got my shirt all bloody for id been in the drift forty hours without sleep and breathing powder smoke till my knees buckled and wobbled under me to this day the smell of stale powder smoke makes a woman of me but that morning i sang for i was going for my bride and the world was brighter than it has ever been for eighteen years the little schoolhouse was closed at which i remembered that the term was over id been living underground for weeks and lost track of the days so that i had to count them up on my fingers it took me a long time for i was pretty tired in my head but when id figured it out i went on to where she was boarding the woman of the place came to the door a scotchwoman she had a mole on her chin i remember a brownishblack mole with three hairs in it she wore an apron too that was kind of checkered and three buttons were open at the neck of her dress i recall a lot more of little things about her though the rest of what happened is rather dreamy i asked for merridy and she told me shed gone away gone with bennett the night before while i was coughing blood from the powder smoke that they were married in the front room and that the bride looked beautiful she had cried a bit on leaving chandon andand that was about all i counted the buttons on the scotchwomans waist eight or ten times and byandby she asked if i was sick but i wasnt she was a kindhearted woman and id been to her house a good deal so she asked me to come in and rest i wasnt tired so i went away and climbed back up to the little shack and the mine that i hated now the trader paused and reaching for the bottle poured himself out a glass of brandy which he spilled into his throat raw then continued i turned into a kind of hermit after that and i wasnt good to associate with men got so they shunned me and i knew they told strange stories because i heard them whisper when i went to the stores for grub once a month i changed all over till even my squirrels and partridges and other friends quit me once in awhile i got out a ton or two of rock and sold it but i never worked the mine or opened it up i couldnt bear to go inside the drift i tried it time and again but the smell of its darkness drove me out every foot of its ragged walls had left its mark on me and my heart was torn and gouged and shivered worse than its seams and ledges i could have sold it but there was no place for me to go and what did i want with money i was shy of the world like a crippled child that dreads the daylight and i shrank from going out where people might see my scars so i stayed there by myself nursing the hurt that never got any better you see id been raised among the hills and rocks and i was like them in a way i couldnt grow and alter and heal up from time to time i heard of her but the news instead of gladdening me as it would have gladdened some men wrung out what bits of suffering were left in me and i fairly ached for her nobody comes to see clearer than a woman deceived so it didnt take her long to find out the kind of man bennett was he wasnt like her at all and the reason he had courted her so hotly was just that he had had everything that rightly belongs to a man like him and had sickened of it so he wanted her because she was clean and pure and different and realizing that he couldnt get her any other way he had married her but she was a treasure no bad man could appreciate and so he tired quickly even before the little one came when i heard that she had borne him a daughter i wrote her a letter which took me a month to compose and which i tore up one day a story came to me that made me saddle my horse to ride down and kill him and mind you i was a man who made pets of little wild trusting things but i knew she would surely send for me when her pain became too great so i uncinched my gear and hung it up and waited and waited and waited three long endless years i waited almost within sound of her voice without a word from her without a glimpse of her and every hour of that time went by as slowly as if i had held my breath then she called to me and i went i tell you i was thankful that day for the fortune that had made me take good care of my horse for i rode like death on a windstorm it grew moonlight as i raced down the valley and the foam from the animals muzzle lodged on my clothes and made me laugh and swear that the morning sun would show dan bennetts blood in its place i rode through the streets of mesa where they lived and past the lights of his big saloon where i heard the sound of devils revelry and a shrillvoiced woman singing a woman the like of which he had tried to make my merridy i never skulked or sneaked in those days and no man ever made me take back roads so i came up to his house from the front and tied my horse to his gatepost she heard me on the steps and opened the door you sent for me said i where is he but he had gone away to a neighboring camp and wouldnt be back until morning at which i felt the way a thief must feel for id hoped to meet him in his own house and i wasnt the kind to go calling when the husband was out i couldnt think very clearly however because of the change in her she was so thin and worn and sad sadder than any woman id ever seen and she wasnt the girl id known three years before i guess id changed a heap myself anyhow that was the first thing she spoke about and the tears came into her eyes as she breathed poor boy poor boy you took it very hard didnt you you sent for me said i which road did he take theres nothing you can do to him she answered back i sent for you to make sure that you still love me did you ever doubt it said i at which she began to cry sobbing like a woman who has worn out all emotion can you feel the same after what ive made you suffer she said and i reckon she must have read the answer in my eyes for i never was much good at talking and the sight of her so changed had taken the speech out of me leaving nothing but aches and pains and ashes in its place when she saw what she wished to know she told me the story the whole miserable story that id heard enough of to suspect why shed married the other man she couldnt explain herself except that it was a womans whim i had stayed away and he had come the oftener part pique and part the mans daredevil fascination i reckon but a month had shown her how she really stood and had shown him too likewise she saw the sort of man he was and the kind of life he lived at last he got rough and cruel to her trying every way to break her spirit and even the baby didnt stop him it made him worse if anything till he swore hed make them both the kind he was for her goodness seemed to rile and goad him and having lived with the kind of woman you have to beat he tried it on her then she knew her fight was hopeless and she sent for me hes a fiend she told me ive stood all i can hell make a bad woman of me as sure as he will of the little one if i stay on here so i have decided to go and take her with me where said i wherever you say she answered and yet i did not understand not till i saw the look in her eyes then as it dawned on me she broke down for it was a terrible thing for a good woman to offer its all for the little girl she cried more than her life depends upon it we must get her away from him she saw it was her only course and went where her heart was calling the lieutenant met the look of appeal in the traders eyes and nodded to imply his complete understanding and approval we love some women for their goodness others we love for their frailness but there never was one who combined the two like her and now that i knew she loved me i began to believe again there was a god somewhere id never seen the youngster so she led me in where it was sleeping and i remember my boots made such a devil of a thumping on the floor that she laid her slim white finger on her lips and smiled at me all the fingers in the world began to choke at my throat and all the blood in me commenced to pound at my heart when i looked on that little sleeping kiddie the tears began to roll out of my eyes and because they had been dry for four years they scalded like melted metal that was the only time i ever wept the sight of her baby did it i love her already i whispered and ill spend my life making her happy and making a lady of her which clinched what wavering doubt the mother had and she began to plan quickly the fear coming on her of a sudden that our scheme might fail i was for riding away with both of them that night back through the streets of mesa and up into the hills where id have held them singlehanded against man or god or devil but she wouldnt hear of it we must go away she said a long way from here where the world wont find us and the little one can grow to womanhood without knowing she must never learn who her father was or what her mother did we will start all over you and i and the baby and forget do you love me well enough to do it i uttered a cry and took her in my arms the arms that had ached for her all those years then i kissed her for the first time the old man tried to light his pipe which had gone out but his fingers shook so that he dropped the match whereupon without speaking burrell struck another and held it for him the trader drew a noisy puff or two in silence and shot his host a grateful glance her plan was for me to take the youngster away that night and for her to join us later because pursuit was certain and three could be traced where one might disappear she would follow when the opportunity offered i saw that he had instilled a terror into her and that she feared him like death but as i thought it over her scheme seemed feasible so i agreed i was to ride west that hour with the sleeping babe and conceal myself at a place we selected while she would say that the little one had wandered away and been lost in the canon or anything else to throw bennett off after a time she would join us well the little girl never waked when i took her in my arms nor when the mother broke down again and talked to me like a crazy woman her collapse showed the terrible strain she had been living under and the ragged edge where her reason stood she had been brave enough to plan coolly till the hour for giving up her baby but when that came she was seized with a thousand dreads and made me swear by my love for her which was and is the holiest thing in all my life that if anything happened i would live for the other merridy i begged her again to come with me but her fears held her back she vowed however that bennett should never touch her again and i made her swear by her love for the babe that she would die before he ever laid hands on her it woke a savage joy in me to think i had bested him after all i never thought of what i was giving up of the clean name i was soiling of the mine back there that meant a fortune anytime i cared to take it for things like that dont count when a mans blood is hot so i rode away in the yellow moonlight with a sleeping baby on my breast where no child or woman had ever lain except for that minute before i left she stood out from beneath the porch shadow and smiled her goodbye the last i ever saw of her i travelled hard that night and swapped horses at daylight then leaving the wild country behind i came into a region i didnt know and found a mexican woman who tended the child for me for i was close by the place where merridy was to come every night i went into the village in hopes that some word had arrived and i waited patiently for a week then i got the blow i heard it from the loafers around the little postoffice first but it dazed me so i wouldnt believe it till i borrowed the paper and read the whole story with the type dancing and leaping before me it took some hours for it to seep in even after that and for years i recalled every word of the damned lie as if it had been branded on me with hot irons they called it a shocking crime the most brutal murder california had ever known and in the headlines was my name in letters that struck me between the eyes like a hammer mrs dan bennett had been foully murdered by me in a fit of sudden jealousy and i had disappeared with the baby the husband had returned unexpectedly to find her dying so he said but too far gone to call for help and with barely sufficient strength to tell him who did it and how then the paper went on with the tale of my courting her and her turning me down for bennett it told how i had gone off alone up into the hills turning into a bear that nobody man or child could approach it said i had brooded there all this time till the mania got uppermost and so came down to wreak my vengeance they never even did me the credit of calling me crazy i was a fiend incarnate a beast without soul and a lot of things like that and remember i had never harmed a living thing in all my life however that wasnt what hurt what turned me into a dull dead suffering thing was the knowledge that she was gone for hours i couldnt get beyond that fact then came the realization that bennett had done it for i reasoned that he had dragged a hint of the truth from her by very force of the fear he held her in and slain her god the awful rage that came over me but there was nothing to do i had sworn to guard the little one so i couldnt take vengeance on him i couldnt go back and prove my innocence for that would give the child to him what a night i spent the next day i saw i had been indicted by the grand jury and was a wanted man from a distance i watched myself become an outlaw watched the county put a price upon my head which bennett doubled watched public opinion rise to such a heat that posses began to scour the mountains what i noted in particular was a statement in the paper that the sorrowing husband takes his bereavement with the quiet courage which marks a brave man that roused me more than the knowledge that he had made me a wolf and set my friends on my track which i hadnt covered very well having ridden boldly it happened that the mexican woman couldnt read and talked little still i knew theyd find me soon it couldnt be otherwise so i made another run for it swearing an oath however before i left that id come back and have that gamblers heart it was lucky i went for they uncovered my sign the next day and the country where id hidden blazed like a field of dry grass they were close on my heels and they closed in from every quarter but pshaw i knew the woods like an indian and the wild things were my friends again which would have made it play if id been alone but a girl child of three was harder to manage so i cowered and skulked day after day like a thief or the murderer they thought me working always farther into the hidden places travelling by night with the little one asleep on my bosom by day playing with her in some leafy glen with my pursuers so close behind that for weeks i never slept and my love for the child increased daily till it became almost an insanity she was the only woman thing i had ever possessed and it seemed like my love for the mother came back and settled on her and she loved me too and trusted me every little smile every clasp of her tiny dimpled fingers showed it and tied her to me with another knot till the fear of losing her became greater than i could bear till it kept the chill of death in my bones and filled my veins with glacier water i became an animal a cowardly quailing coyote all through the love of a child we had close squeezes many times but i finally won in spite of the fact that they tracked us clear to the edge of the desert for i had hit for the state line knowing that nevada was a wilderness and feeling that id surely lose them there and i did but in doing it i nearly lost merridy you see the constant travel and hardship was too much for a prattling baby and she fell sick from the heat and the dust and the thirst id been going and going till i was a riding skeleton till my arms were crooked and dead from holding her but this new thing frightened me like those men and dogs had never done here was a thing i couldnt hide from nor outride so i doubled back and came boldly into the watered country again expecting they would take me of course for a runaway man with a babe in his arms isnt hard to identify but i didnt care i was bound for the nearest ranch or miningcamp where a woman could be found but as luck would have it i went through without trying i had gone farther from men and things however than i thought and this return pursuit was a million times worse than the other for i couldnt go fast enough to shake death who ran with his hand on my cantle or rode on my horses rump it was then i found alluna she was with a huntingparty of pahutes who knew nothing of me nor of the white mans affairs and cared less and when i saw the little squaw i rode my horse up beside her laid the sick child in her arms then tumbled out of the saddle they had a harder job to pull me through than they did to save merridy for id given the baby all the water and hadnt slept or rested for many years so it seemed the little one was playing around several days before i got back my reason meanwhile the party had moved north taking us with them and as it happened just missing a posse who were returning from the desert when i was able to get about i told alluna that i must be going but as i told her i watched her face and saw the sign i wanted the white girl had clutched at her like she had at me and she couldnt give her up so i made a dicker with her old man it took all the money i had to buy that squaw but i knew the kiddie must have a womans care and the three of us started out soon after alone and broke and aimless and weve been going ever since thats the heart of the story lieutenant and thats how i started to drift since then we three have never rested i left them once in idaho and went back to mesa riding all the way mostly by night but bennett was gone hed run down mighty fast after merridy died so i heard growing sullen and uglier day by day and i reckon i was the only one who knew why till he had a killing in his place it was unprovoked and instead of stopping to face it out the yellow in him rose to the surface and he left before sunup as i had left making a clean getaway too for there was no such hullabaloo raised about killing a man as there was about the other so my trip was all for nothing i was used to disappointment by now so i took it quiet and went back to alluna and the little one knowing that some day we two men would meet you see i figured that god had framed a cold hand for me but he would surely give me a pair before the game closed of course never having seen bennett i was handicapped and added to that he changed his name so the search was mighty slow and blind but i knew the day would come and it would have come only for this there isnt much more to tell i did what most men would have done i reckon because i was just average in every way i took alluna and together we drifted north along the frontier until we landed here every year the little girl got more beautiful and more like her mother and every year we two loved her more we changed her name of course for ive always had the dread of the law back of me and then the other two kiddies came along but we were living pretty easy the woman contented and me waiting for bennett till you stepped in and necia fell in love thats another thing i never counted on it seems like ive always overlooked the plainest kind of facts ive held off telling you the last few weeks hoping you two wouldnt make it necessary for i reckon im sort of a coward but she informed me tonight that she couldnt marry you being what she thinks she is and knowing the blood she has in her i knew she wouldnt i figured it wouldnt be right to either of you to let you go it blind and so i came in to tell you this whole thing and to give myself up gale stopped then poured himself another drink to give yourself up echoed burrell vaguely how do you mean he had sat like one in a trance during the long recital only his eyes alive im under indictment for murder said the trader i have been for fifteen years and theres no chance in the world for me to prove my innocence have you told necia the young man inquired no youll have to do that i never could she might disbelieve whats more you mustnt tell her yet wait till i give the word it wont be long perhaps a day i want to go free a little while yet for ive got some work to do burrell rose to his feet and stamped the cramps from his muscles he was deeply agitated and his mind was groping darkly for light to lay hold of this new thing that confronted him why yes yes of course dont come until youre ready he muttered mechanically as if unaware of the meaning of his words to be sure im a policeman am i not i had forgotten i was a jailer and and all that he said it sneeringly and with a measure of contempt for his office then he turned suddenly to the trader and his voice was rich and deeppitched with feeling john gale he said youre the bravest man i ever knew and the best he choked a bit you sacrificed all that life meant when this girl was a baby and now when she has come into womanhood you give up your blood for her by god you are a man i want your hand in spite of himself he could not restrain the moisture that dimmed his eyes as he gripped the toilworn palm of this great gray hulk of a man so aged and bent beneath the burden of his lifelong fadeless love who in turn was powerfully affected by the young mans impulsive outburst of feeling and his unexpected words of praise the old man looked up a trifle shyly then you dont doubt no part of it certainly not somehow i always figured nobody would believe me if ever i told the whole thing the soldier gazed unseeingly into the flame of his lamp and said i wonder if my love for the daughter is as great and as holy as your love for the mother i wonder if i could give what you have given if i had nothing but a memory to live with me then he inquired irrelevantly but what about bennett mr gale you say you never found him the trader answered after a moments hesitation hes still at large at which his companion exclaimed id love to meet him in your stead gale seemed seized with a desire to speak but even while he hesitated out of the silent night there came the sound of quick footsteps approaching briskly as if the owner were in haste and knew whither he was bound up the steps they came lightly then the room and the whole silence round about rang and echoed with a peremptory signal evidently this man rapped on the board door to awaken and alarm for instead of his knuckles he used some hard and heavy thing like a gunbutt lieutenant burrell lieutenant burrell a gruff voice cried whos there called the young man let me in quick ive got work for you to do open up i say this is ben stark chapter xv and a knot tightened a day of shattered hopes is a desolate thing but the night of such a day is desolate indeed in all his life poleon doret had never sunk to such depths of despondency for his optimistic philosophy and his buoyant faith in the goodness of life forbade it therefore when darkness came it blotted out what little brightness and light and hope were left to him after necias stormy interview with the lieutenant the arrival of the freight steamer afforded him some distraction but there was only a small consignment for the store and that was quickly disposed of so leaving the other citizens of flambeau to wrangle over their private merchandise he went back to his solitary vigil which finally became so unbearable that he sought to escape his thoughts or at least to drown them for a while amid the lights and life and laughter of starks saloon being but a child by nature his means of distraction were primal and elementary and he began to gamble as usual with hard luck for the cards had ever been unkind to him he did not think of winnings or losings however he merely craved the occupation and it was this that induced him to sit at a game in which runnion played although ordinarily he would not have tolerated even tacitly such a truce to his dislikes as it was he crouched in a corner his hat pulled down over his brow his swarthy face a darker hue beneath the shadow losing steadily only now and then showing a flash of white teeth as he saw his money go what mattered loss to him he had no more need of money now than necia had of his love he would spend the dollars he had eked and scraped and saved for her as she had spent the treasures of his heart and now that the one had brought him no return he wished to be rid of the other for he was shortly to go again in search of his new country where no man needs gold half so much as a clean heart it would be a long journey far to the west and north a journey that none of his kind had ever fared back from and he wished to go light as all good adventurers go runnion annoyed him with his volubility for the news of his goodfortune had fired the man with a reckless disregard for money and he turned to gaming as the one natural recourse of his ilk as the irony of fate would have it he won what the canadian lost together with the stakes of various others who played for a time with him and then gave up wagging their heads or swearing softly at the cards it was shortly after midnight that stark came into the place poleon was not too absorbed in his own fortunes to fail to notice the extraordinary ferocity and exhilaration of the saloonkeeper nor that his face was keener his nostrils thinner his walk more nervous and his voice more cutting than usual when he spoke to runnion come here ill be with you when i finish this hand said the player over his shoulder come here stark snapped his command and runnion threw down his cards im right in the middle of a winning streak youll break my luck ben but the other only frowned impatiently and drawing the reluctant gambler aside began to talk rapidly to him almost within earshot of poleon who watched them idly wondering what stark had to say that could make runnion start and act so queerly well it was their affair they made a bad pair to draw to he knew that runnion was the saloonkeepers lieutenant and obeyed implicitly his seniors commands he could distinguish nothing they said nor was he at all curious until a knot of noisy men crowded up to the bar and forcing the two back nearer to the table where he sat his sharp ears caught these words from runnions lips not with me shed never go with me and starks reply shell go where i send her and with anybody i tell her to the frenchman lost what followed for a newly dealt hand required study he scanned his cards and tossed them face up before the dealer then he overheard runnion say its the only one in camp he might sell it if you offered him enough at this stark called one of the men at the bar aside and the three began to dicker not a cent less the third man announced loudly there aint another peterborough in town it was poleons deal now and when he had finished both stark and runnion had disappeared also the man they had accosted which pleased the canadian for now that runnion was eliminated from the game he might win a little a steady unvarying run of bad hands is uninteresting and does not occupy ones mind as well as an occasional change of luck outside runnion was saying again to stark she wont go with me ben she dont like me you see i made love to her and she got mad and wanted me killed shell never know who you are until its too late to turn back said the other and you are the only man i can trust to take her through i can trust you you owe me too much to be crooked oh ill act square with you but look here whats all this about anyhow why do you want that girl you said you didnt care for her that way you told me so yourself been having a change of heart or is it your second childhood he laughed disagreeably its none of your business said the gambler i want her and thats enough all you have to do is to take her to st michaels and keep her there till you hear from me she thinks she is going to the mission and you neednt tell her otherwise until you get her aboard a steamer then take her no matter what kind of a fight she puts up youve got a lightrowing skiff and youd better keep going till youre overtaken by a downriver boat i want her as far away from here as possible theres going to be some hell in this camp now hike and get yourself ready all right but i aint the safest kind of a chaperon for a goodlooking girl stark laid a cold hand on runnions shoulder close up to his neck get that out of your mind she belongs to me you said just now never mind what i said shes mine and youve got to promise to be straight with her ive trusted you before and if youre not on the level now say so it will save you a lot of trouble oh all right exclaimed runnion testily only it looks mighty queer he melted into the darkness and stark returned to his cabin where he paced back and forth impatiently smiling evilly now and then consulting his watch at frequent intervals a black look had begun to settle on his face but it vanished when necia came and he met her with a smile i was afraid you had weakened he said everything is ready and waiting ive got the only canoe in the place a peterborough and hired a good oarsman to put you through instructing him to make as fast time as he can and to board the first steamer that overtakes you too bad this freighter that just got in isnt going the other way however theres liable to be another any hour and if one doesnt come along youll find enough blankets and food in the skiff so you neednt go ashore youll be there before you know it you are very kind said the girl i cant thank you enough she was clothed in her simple everyday dress and looked again the suncolored halfbreed girl with the wide dark eyes and the twin braids of crowblack hair you didnt run into anybody eh she shook her head then he led her out into the darkness and they stumbled down to the riversbank descending to the gravelly waters edge where rows of clumsy handsawed boats and polingskiffs were chafing at their painters the upriver steamer was just clearing starks low whistle was answered a hundred yards below and they searched out a darker blot that proved to be a mans figure is everything ready he inquired at which the shadow grunted unintelligibly so holding necia by the arm stark helped her back to a seat in the stern this man will take you through he said you can trust him all right the oarsman clambered in and adjusted his sweeps then stark laid a hand on the prow and shoved the light boat out into the current calling softly goodbye and goodluck goodbye mr stark thank you ever so much the girl replied too numb and worn out to say much or to notice or care whither she was bound or who was her boatman she had been swept along too swiftly to reason or fear for herself any more half an hour later the scattered lights of the little camp winked and twinkled for the last time turning she set her face forward and adjusting the cushions to her comfort strained her tired eyes towards the rising and falling shadow of her boatman she seemed borne along on a mystic river of gloom that hissed and gurgled about her invisible but allpervading irresistible monstrous only the ceaseless monotonous creak of the rowlocks breaking the silence stark did not return to his cabin but went back instead to his saloon where he saw poleon doret still sprawling with elbows on the table his hat pulled low above his sullen face the owner of the place passed behind the bar and poured himself a full glass of whiskey which he tossed off then without a look to right or left went out and down towards the barracks a light behind the drawn curtains of the officers house told that his man was not abed but he waited a long moment after his summons before the door was opened during which he heard the occupant moving about and another door close in the rear when he was allowed entrance at last he found the young man alone in a smokefilled room with a bottle and two empty glasses on the table for at the sound of his voice gale had whispered to burrell keep him out and the lieutenant had decided to refuse his late visitor admittance when he lighted on the expedient of concealing the trader in the bedroom at the rear it was only natural he reasoned that gale should dislike to face a man like stark before he had regained his composure go in there and wait till i see what he wants he had said and shutting the old man in he had gone forth to admit stark resenting his illtimed intrusion and inquiring brusquely the cause of it before answering stark entered and closed the door behind him ive got some work for you lieutenant i guess it can wait till morning said meade no it cant its got to be done tonight right now you represent the law or at least youve taken every occasion to so declare yourself and to mix in with little things that dont cut much figure so now ive come to you with something big its a serious affair and being as im a peaceful man i want to go by the law his eyes mocked the words he uttered youre mighty prompt and determined when it comes to regulating such affairs you seem to carry the weight of this whole community on your shoulders so im here to give you some information burrell ignored the taunt and said quietly its a little late for polite conversation come to the point ive got a criminal for you what kind murderer youve had a killing in your place eh no ive just made a discovery i found it all out by accident too pure accident by heaven you cant tell me there isnt a beneficent providence overlooking our affairs why this felon has lived here among us all this time and only for the merest chance i never would have recognized him well well go on snapped burrell impatiently hes a friend of yours and a highly respected party hes a glorious example to this whole river the officer started could it be he wondered could knowledge of this affair have reached this man he was uncomfortably aware of that presence in the back room but he had to know the truth who is the man hes your friend hes stark paused gloating over his enemys suspense go on hes everybodys friend hes the shining mark of this whole country hes the benevolent renegade squawman gale john gale gaylord is his name and i was a fool not to know it sooner how did you discover this inquired burrell lamely what proof have you the disclosure had not affected the soldier as stark expected and his anger began to lift itself thats neither here nor there the mans a murderer hes wanted in california where i came from hes been indicted and theres a price on his head hes hidden for fifteen years but hell hang as sure as i stand here disclosures of a complex nature had so crowded on burrell in the last few hours that he saw himself the centre of a most unfortunate and amazing tangle things were difficult enough as it was but to have this man appear and cry for justice this man above all others it was a complication quite unlocked for a hideous mockery he must gain time for thought one false step might ruin all he could not face this on the spur of the moment so shrugging his shoulders with an air of polite scepticism he assumed a tone of goodnatured raillery fifteen years murder john gale a murderer why thats almost pardon me if i smile im getting sleepy what proof have you proof blazed the gambler proof ask gaylord proof why the woman he murdered was my wife it was burrells turn now to fall incoherent and not only did his speech forsake him but his thoughts went madly veering off into a wilderness where there was no trail no light no hope what kind of a coil was this what frightful bones were these he bared this man was bennett this was necias father this man he hated this man who was bad whose name was a curse throughout the length and breadth of the west was the father of the girl he loved his head began to whirl then the story of the trader came back to him and he remembered who and what the bearer of these later tidings was he raised a pair of eyes that had become furious and bloodshot and suddenly realized that the man before him who persisted in saddling upon gale this heinous crime was the slayer of necias mother for he did not doubt gales story for an instant he found his fingers writhing to feel the creatures throat proof stark was growling how much proof do you need ive followed him for fifteen years ive tracked him with men and dogs through woods and deserts and miningcamps ive slept on his trail for five thousand miles and now do you think im mistaken he killed my wife i say and robbed me of my little girl thats her in his house thats her he calls necia shes my girl my girl do you understand and ill have his life it was hate that animated him and nothing more he had no joy in the finding of his offspring no uplifted thought of justice the thirst for revenge personal violent utter was all that prompted this man but burrell had no inkling yet of the fathers wellshaped plans nor how farreaching they were and could barely stammer so you you know yes she wears the evidence around her neck and if that isnt enough i can furnish more evidence enough to smother you my name isnt stark at all i changed it years ago for certain reasons ive changed it more than once but thats my privilege and my own affair her name is merridy bennett i dont suppose you know im going to marry her said the kentuckian irrelevantly no replied the other i wasnt aware of the fact well i am ill be your soninlaw he said this as if it were the statement of an astonishing truth whereat stark grinned a mirthless disquieting sort of grimace and said theres a lot of things for you and me to settle up first for one thing i want those mines of hers why well im her father and shes not of age ill think it over ill take them anyway as her next of kin burrell did not follow up this statement for its truth was incontrovertible and showed that the fathers illwill was too tangible a thing to be concealed so he continued well adjust that after gale is attended to but meanwhile what do you want me to do i want you to arrest the man who killed my wife if you dont take him the miners will ive got a following in this camp and ill raise a crowd in fifteen minutes enough to hang this squawman or batter down your barracks to get him but i dont want to do that i want to go by the law youve talked so much about i want you to do the trick at last burrell saw the gamblers deviltry he knew starks reputation too well to think that he feared a meeting with gale for the man had lived in hope of that these fifteen years and had shaped his life around such a meeting but this indirect method the kentuckian felt a flash of reluctant admiration for a man who could mould a vengeance with such cruel hands and even though he came from a land of feuds where hate is a precious thing the cunning strength of this mans enmity dwarfed any he had ever known stark had planned his settlement coldly and with deliberate malice moreover he was strong enough to stand aside and let another take his place and thus deny to gale the final recourse of a hunted beast the desperate satisfaction that the trader craved he tied his enemys hands and delivered him up with his thirst unsatisfied to whom he thrust a weapon into the hand of his other enemy and bade this other enemy use it worse than that forced him to strike the man he honored the man he loved burrell never doubted that stark had carefully weighed the effect of this upon necia and had reasoned that a girl like her could not understand a soldiers duty if it meant the blood of a parent if he refused to act the gambler could break him while every effort he made to protect gale would but increase the others satisfaction there was no chance of the traders escape stark held him in his hand his followers would do his bidding it was a desperate affair was it impossible the lieutenant wondered to move this man from his purpose have you thought of necia she loves gale what effect will this have on her damn her shes more his brat than mine i want john gaylord at this a vicious frenzy overtook burrell and he thought of the man behind yonder door whom he had forgotten until these words woke something savage in him well why not these two men had stalked each other clear into the farthest places driven by forces that were older than the hills who was he to stand between such passions this was ordained it was the course of nature the clash of elements and this was a fair battleground so why should he undertake to stop a thing decreed the gamblers words rang in his ears i want john gaylord and before he knew what he was doing he had answered very well ill give him to you and crossed quickly to the door of his bedroom and flung it open on the threshold he paused stockstill the place was empty a draught sucked through the open window flirting with the curtain and telling the story of the traders exit if youre looking for your coat its here he heard stark say get into it and well go for him the lieutenants mind was working fast enough now in all conscience and he saw with clear and fateful eyes whither he was being led at which a sudden reckless disregard for consequences seized him he felt a blind fury at being pulled and hauled and driven by this creature and also an unreasoning anger at gales defection but it was the thought of necia and the horrible net of evil in which this man had ensnared them both that galled him most it was all a terrible tangle in which the truth was hopelessly hidden and nothing but harm could come from attempting to unravel it there was but one solution and that though fundamental and effective was not to be expected from an officer of the law nevertheless he chose it for ben stark was too potent a force for evil to be at large and needed extermination as truly as if he were some dangerous beast he determined to finish this thing here and now meade went to his bureau took his revolver from the belt where he had hung it and came out into the other room stark seeing the weapon exclaimed you dont need that he wont resist you ive decided not to take him said burrell decided not to take him shouted the other have you weakened dont you intend to arrest that man no cried the soldier ive listened to your lies long enough now im going to stop them once for all youre too dangerous to have around they faced each other silently a moment then stark spoke in a very quiet voice though his eyes were glittering whats the meaning of this are you crazy gale was here just before you came and told me who killed your wife i know you do i do well its pretty late this place is lonely this is the simplest way the gambler fell to studying his antagonist and when he did not speak burrell continued come brace up im giving you a chance but stark shook his head dont be afraid insisted the lieutenant there are no witnesses if you get me nobody will know and your word is good if not its much simpler than the other then when the gambler still made no move he insisted you wouldnt have me kill you like a rattlesnake you couldnt said the older man youre not that kind and im not the kind to be cheated either listen ive lived over forty years and i never took less than was coming to me i wont begin tonight youll get your share bah you dont know what i mean i dont want you its him im after and when im done with him ill take care of you but i wont run any risk right now i wont take a chance on losing what ive risked so much to gain what ive lived these fifteen years to get you might put me away theres the possibility and i wont let you or any other man or woman either not even my girl cheat me out of gale put up your gun the soldier hesitated then did as he was bidden for this man knew him better than he knew himself i ought to treat you like a mad dog but i cant do it while your hands are up im going to fight for john gale however and you cant take him ill have his carcass hung to my ridgepole before daylight no i say yes stark turned to go but paused at the door and you think youll marry necia do you i know it like hell you will suppose you find her first what do you mean wait but his visitor was gone leaving behind him a lover already sorely vexed and now harassed by a new and sudden apprehension what venom the man distilled could it be that he had sent necia away burrell scouted the idea she wasnt the kind to go at starks mere behest and as for his forcing her why this was not an age of abductions he might aim to take her but it would require some time to establish his rights and even then there were gale and himself to be reckoned with still this was no time for idling and he might as well make certain so the young man put on his coat hurriedly knowing there was work to do there was no telling what this night would bring forth but first he must warn his friend after which they would fight this thing together not as soldier and civilian but as man and man not for the law but against it he smiled as he realized the situation well he was through with the army anyhow his path was strange and new from this time henceforth and led him away from all he had known taking him among other peoples but he did not flinch for it led to her behind him was that former life tonight he began anew stark traced his way back to his cabin in a ten times fiercer mood than he had come reviling cursing hating back past the dark tradingpost he went pausing to shake his clenched fist and grind out an oath between his teeth past the door of his own saloon which was alight and whence came the sound of revelry through the scattered houses where he went more by feel than by sight up to the door of his own shack he fitted his key in the lock but the door swung open without his aid at which he remembered that he had only pulled it after him when he came away with necia he closed it behind him now and locked it for he had some thinking to do then felt through his pockets for a match and striking it bent over his lamp to adjust the wick it flared up steady and strong at last flooding the narrow place with its illumination then he straightened up and turned towards the bed to throw off his coat when suddenly every muscle of his body leaped with an uncontrollable spasm as if he had uncovered a deadly serpent coiled and ready to spring in spite of himself his lungs contracted as if with the grip of giant hands and his breath came forth in a startled cry john gale was sitting at his table barely an armslength away his grayblue eyes fixed upon him and the deep seams of his heavy face set as if graven in stone his huge knotted hands were upon the table and between them lay a naked knife chapter xvi john gales hour it was a heathenish time of night to arouse the girl thought burrell as he left the barracks but he must allay these fears that were besetting him he must see necia at once the low drifting clouds obscured what starglow there was in the heavens and he stepped back to light a lantern by its light he looked at his watch and exclaimed then held it to his ear five hours had passed since he left gales house well the call was urgent and necia would understand his anxiety a few moments later he stood above the squaw who crouched on the traders doorstep wailing her death song into the night he could not check her she paid no heed to him but only rocked and moaned and chanted that strange weird song which somehow gave strength to his fears whats wrong where is necia where is she he demanded and at last seized her roughly facing her to the light but alluna only blinked owlishly at his lantern and shook her head gone away she finally informed him and began to weave again in her despair but he held her fiercely where has she gone when did she go he shook her to quicken her reply i don know i don know long time shes gone now she trailed off into indian words he could not comprehend so he pushed past her into the house to see for himself and without knocking flung necias door open and stepped into her chamber before he had swept the unfamiliar room with his eyes he knew that she had indeed gone and gone hurriedly for the signs of disorder betrayed a reckless haste hanging across the back of a chair was what had once been the wondrous dress poleons gift now a damp and draggled ruin and on the floor were two sodden satin slippers and a pair of wet silk stockings he picked up the lace gown and saw that it was torn from shoulder to waist what insanity had possessed the girl to rip her garment thus she take her nother dress the one i make las summer said alluna who had followed him in and stood staring as he stared when did she go alluna for gods sake what does this mean i don know she come and she go and i don see her mebbe three four hour ago wheres gale hell know hes gone after her eh the upward glow of the lantern heightened the young mans pallor and again the squaw broke into her sad lament john gale hes gone away with the knife of my father i am afraidi am afraid burrell forced himself to speak calmly this was no time to let his wits stampede how long ago long time did he come back here just now no he went to the jailhouse and he would not let me follow he don come back no more this was confusing and meade cried angrily why didnt you give the alarm why didnt you come to me instead of yelling your lungs out around the house he told me to wait she said simply go find poleon quick he told me to wait she repeated stoically and burrell knew he was powerless to move her he saw the image of a great terror in the womans face the night suddenly became heavy with the hint of unspeakable things and he grew fearful suspecting now that gale had told him but a part of his story that all the time he knew starks identity and that his quarry was at hand ready for the kill or if not he had learned enough while standing behind that partition where was he now where was necia what part did she play in this starks parting words struck burrell again like a blow this lifelong feud was drawing swiftly to some tragic culmination and somewhere out in the darkness those two strong hatefilled men were settling their scores all at once a fear for the traders life came upon the young man and he realized that a great bond held them together he could not think clearly because of the dread thing that gripped him at thought of necia was he to lose her after all he gave up trying to think and fled for starks saloon reasoning that where one was the other must be near and there would surely be some word of necia he burst through the door a quick glance over the place showed it empty of those he sought but spying poleon doret he dragged him outside inquiring breathlessly have you seen gale have you seen stark has he been about yes wan hour mebbe two hour ago wy wat for you ask theres the devil to pay those two have come together and necia is gone necia gone the canadian jerked out wat you mean by dat were shes gone to i dont know nobody knows god im shaking like a leaf bah shes feel purty bad shes go out by hersef dats all right i tell you something has happened to her theres hell to pay i found her clothes at the house torn to ribbons and all muddy and wet poleon cried out at this weve got to find her and gale and we havent a minute to lose im afraid were too late as it is i wish it was daylight damn the darkness anyhow it makes it ten times harder his incoherence alarmed his listener more than his words were have you look ive been to the house but alluna is crazy and says gale has gone to kill stark as near as i can make out both of them were at my quarters tonight and im afraid the squaw is right but were is necia we dont know maybe stark has got her the frenchman cursed horribly have you try hees cabane no without answer the frenchman darted away and the lieutenant sped after him through the deserted rows of loghouses ha deres light snarled doret over his shoulder as they neared their goal be careful panted burrell wait dont knock he forced poleon to pause lets find out whos inside remember were working blind he gripped his companions arm with fingers of steel and together they crept up to the door but even before they had gained it they heard a voice within it was starks the walls of the house were of mosschinked logs that deadened every sound but the door itself was of thin whipsawed pine boards with ample cracks at top and bottom and the room being of small dimensions they heard plainly the lieutenant leaned forward then with difficulty smothered an exclamation for he heard another voice now the voice of john gale the words came to him muffled but distinct and he raised his hand to knock when suddenly arrested he seized poleon and forced him to his knees hissing into his ear listen listen for gods sake listen for the first time in his tempestuous life ben stark lost the iron composure that had made his name a byword in the west and at sight of his bitterest enemy seated in the dark of his own house waiting for him he became an ordinary nervous frightened man faced by a great peril it was the utter unexpectedness of the thing that shook him and before he could regain his balance gale spoke ive come to settle bennett what are you doing here the gambler stammered i was up at the soldiers place just now and heard you i didnt want any interruptions so i came here where we can be alone he paused and when stark made no answer continued well lets get at it but still the other made no move youve had all the best of it for twenty years gale went on in his level voice but tonight i get even by god ive lived for this that shot in lees cabin recalled stark with the light of a new understanding you knew me then yes stark took a deep breath what a damned fool ive been your devils magic saved you that time but it wont stop this the trader rose slowly with the knife in his hand youll hang for this said the gambler unsteadily at which gales face blazed ha exclaimed the trader exultingly you can feel it in your guts already eh with an effort stark began to assemble his wits as the trader continued you saddled your dirty work on me ben stark and ive carried it for fifteen years but tonight i put you out the way you put her out an eye for an eye i didnt kill her said the man dont lie this isnt a grand jury were all alone i didnt kill her so the yellow is showing up at last i knew you were a coward but i didnt think youd be afraid to own it to yourself that thing must have lived with you look here said stark curiously do you really think i killed merridy i know it a man who would strike a woman would kill her if he had the nerve stark had now mastered himself and smiled my hate worked better than i thought well well that made it hard for you didnt it he chuckled i supposed of course you knew knew gales face showed emotion for the first time knew what his hands were quivering slightly she killed herself so help you god so help me god there was a long pause why say its kind of funny our standing here talking about that thing isnt it well if you want to know i came home early that night i guess you hadnt been gone two hours and the surprise did it more than anything else i suppose she hadnt prepared a story i got suspicious named you at random and hit the nail on the head she broke down thought i knew more than i did and and then there was hell to pay go on i suppose i talked bad and made threats i was crazy over you till she must have thought i meant to kill her but i didnt no i never was quite that bad anyhow she did it herself gales face was like chalk and his voice sounded thin and dry as he said you beat her thats why she did it stark made no answer the papers said the room showed a struggle when the other still kept silent gale insisted didnt you at this stark flamed up defiantly well i guess i had cause enough no woman except her was ever untrue to me wife or sweetheart you didnt really think think hell i thought so then and i think so now she denied it but and you knew her so well too i guess youve had some bad nights yourself bennett with that always on your mind i swore id have you and so you put her blood on my head and made me an outlaw after an instant why did you tell me this anyhow its our last talk and i wanted you to know how well my hate worked well i guess thats all said gale so far they had watched each other with unwavering unblinking eyes straining at the leash and taut in every nerve now however the traders fingers tightened on the knifehandle and his knuckles whitened with the grip at which starks right hand swept to his waist and simultaneously gale lunged across the table his blade nickered in the light and a gun spoke once twice again and again a cry arose outside the cabin then some heavy thing crashed in through the door bringing light with it for with his first leap gale had carried the lamp and the table with him and the two had clenched in the dark burrell had waited an instant too long for the mens voices had held so steady their words had been so vital that the finish found him unprepared but thrusting the lantern into poleons hand he had backed off a pace and hurled himself at the door he had learned the knack of bunching his weight in football days and the barrier burst and splintered before him he fell to his knees inside and an instant later found himself wrestling for his life between two raging beasts the lieutenant knew doret must have entered too though he could not see him for the lantern shed a sickly gloom over the chaos he was locked desperately with john gale who flung him about and handled him like a child fighting like an old gray wolf hoary with years and terrible in his rage burrell had never been so battered and harried and torn only for the lanterns light gale would doubtless have sheathed his weapon in his new assailant but the more fiercely the trader struggled the more tenaciously the soldier clung as it was gale carried the lieutenant with him and struck over his head at stark poleon had leaped into the room at burrells heels to receive the impact of a heavy body hurled backward into his arms as if by some irresistible force he seized it and tore it away from the thing that pressed after and bore down upon it with the ferocity of a wild beast he saw gale reach over the lieutenants head and swing his arm saw the knifeblade bury itself in what he held then saw it rip away and felt a hot stream spurt into his face so closely was the canadian entangled with stark that he fancied for an instant the weapon had wounded both of them for the trader had aimed at his enemys neck where it joined the shoulder but hampered by the soldier his blow went astray about four inches doret glimpsed burrell rising from his knees his arms about the traders waist and the next instant the combatants were dragged apart the lieutenant wrenched the dripping blade from gales hand it no longer gleamed but was warm and slippery in his fingers poleon held starks gun which was empty and smoking the fight had not lasted a minute and yet what terrible havoc had been wrought the gambler was drenched with his own blood which gushed from him black in the yellow flicker and so plentifully that the frenchman was befouled with it while gale too was horribly stained but whether from his own or his enemys veins it was hard to tell the trader paid no heed to himself nor to the intruders allowing burrell to push him back against the wall the breath wheezing in and out of his lungs his eyes fastened on stark i got you bennett he cried hoarsely your magic is no good his teeth showed through his grizzled muzzle like the fangs of some wild animal bennett or stark as the others knew him lunged about with his captor trying to get at his enemy and crying curses on them all but he was like a child in poleons arms gradually he weakened and suddenly resistance died out of him come away from here the lieutenant ordered gale but the old man did not hear and gathered himself as if to resume the battle with his bare hands whereupon the soldier finding himself shaking like a frightened child and growing physically weak at what he saw doubted his ability to prevent the encounter and repeated his command come away he shouted but the words sounded foolishly flat and inane then stark spoke intelligibly for the first time arrest him youve got to believe what i told you now burrell he poured forth a stream of unspeakable profanity smitten by the bitter knowledge of his first and only defeat youll hang gaylord ill see your neck stretched damn your heart to poleon he panted excitedly i followed him for fifteen years doret he killed my wife dats damn lie said the frenchman no it isnt hes under indictment for it back in california he shot her down in cold blood then ran off with my kid thats her he calls necia shes mine aint i right lieutenant at this final desperate effort to fix the crime upon his rival burrell turned on him with loathing its no use stark we heard you say she killed herself we were standing outside the door both of us and got it from your own lips until this moment the man had stood on his own feet but now he began to sag seeing which poleon supported him to the bed where he sank weakly collapsing in every joint and muscle its a job he snarled you put this up you three and came here to gang me an unnatural shudder convulsed him as his wounds bit at him and then he flared up viciously but ill beat you all ive got the girl ive got her necia cried burrell suddenly remembering for this affray had driven all else from his mind stark crouched on the edge of his bunk a ghastly gray grinning thing one weapon still remained to him and he used it yes ive got my daughter where is she demanded the trader hoarsely wheres my girl the gambler chuckled an agony seized him till he hiccoughed and strangled then as the spell passed he laughed again shes got you in her head like the mother had but ill drive it out ill treat her like i did her gale uttered a terrible cry and moved upon him but burrell shouldered the trader aside himself possessed by a cold fury that intensified his strength tenfold stop it gale let me attend to this ill make him tell oh will you mocked the girls father where is she none of your damned business again he was seized with a paroxysm that left him shivering and his lips colorless the blankets were soaked and soggy with blood and his feet rested in a red pool ben stark said the tortured lover youre a sick man and youll be gone in half an hour at this rate wont you do one decent thing before you die bah im all right ill get you a doctor if youll tell us where she is if you dontill let you die for gods sake man speak up the wounded man strove to rise but could not then considered for a moment before he said i sent her away where upriver on that freighter that left last night shell go out by skagway and ill join her later where i can have her to myself shes forty miles upriver now and getting farther every minute oh you cant catch her the three men stared at one another blankly why did she go said gale dully because i told her who she was and who you are because she thinks you killed her mother because she was glad to get away now that he was grown too weak to inflict violent pain the man lied malevolently gloating over what he saw in the traders face never mind old man ill bring her back said burrell and laid a comforting hand on gales shoulder for the fact that she was safe the fact of knowing something relieved him immensely but starks next words plunged him into even blacker horror than the trader felt you wont want her if you catch her runnion will see to that runnion yes i sent him with her the lover cried out in anguish and hid his face in his hands hes wanted her for a long time so i told him to go ahead none of them noticed poleon doret who upon this unnatural confession alone seemed to retain sufficient control to doubt and to reason he was thinking hard straightening out certain facts and trying to square this horrible statement with things he had seen and heard tonight all of a sudden he uttered a great cry and bolted out into the darkness unheeded by gale and burrell who stood dazed and distraught with a fear greater than that which was growing in stark at sight of his wounds the gambler looked down at his injuries opened and closed the fingers of his hand as if to see whether he still maintained control of them then cried out at the two helpless men well are you going to let me bleed to death it brought the soldier out of his trance why no no well get a doctor but gale touched him on the shoulder and said hes too weak to get out lock him in and let him die in the dark stark cursed affrightedly for it is a terrible thing to bleed to death in the dark and in spite of himself the lieutenant wavered i cant do that i promised he told that lie to my girl he gave her to that hound said the trader but burrell shoved him through the door no i cant do that and then to the wounded man he said ill get a doctor but god have mercy on your soul he could not trust himself to talk further with this creature nor be near him any longer for though he had a slight knowledge of surgery he would sooner have touched a loathsome serpent than the flesh of this monstrous man he pushed gale ahead of him and the old man went like a driven beast for his violence had wasted itself and he was like a person under the spell of a strong drug at the doctors door burrell stopped i never thought to ask you he said wearily but you must be hurt he must have wounded you i reckon he did i dont know then the mans listless voice throbbed out achingly as he cried in despair she believed him boy she believed his lies thats what hurts something like a sob caught in his throat and he staggered away under the weight of his great bereavement chapter xvii the love of poleon doret to the girl crouching at the stern of runnions boat it seemed as if this day and night would never end it seemed as if the procession of natural events must have ceased that there was no longer any time for she had been suffering steadily for hours and hours without end and began to wonder dreamily whether she had not skipped a day in her reckoning between the time when she first heard of the strike on her claim and this present moment it occurred to her that she was a rich girl now in her own right and she smiled her crooked smile as she reflected that the thing she had longed for without hope of attainment had come with confusing swiftness and had left her unhappier than ever would the day never come she pulled the rugs up closer about her as the morning chill made her shiver she found herself keeping mechanical count with the sound of the sweeps they must be making good speed she thought and the camp must be miles behind now had it been earlier in the season when the river ran full of drift they never could have gone thus in the dark but the water was low and the chances of collision so remote as to render blind travel safe even yet she could not distinguish her oarsman except as a black bulk for it had been a lowering night and the approaching dawn failed to break through the blanket of cloud that hung above the great valley he was a good boatman however as she gathered from the tireless regularity of his strokes he was a silent man too and she was grateful for that she snuggled down into her blanket and tried to sleep but she only dozed for a minute it seemed to find her eyes fly wide open again so restless and tired of her lonely vigil she gave a premonitory cough and said to her companion you must be tired rowing so steadily oh i dont mind it he replied at the sound of his voice she sat bolt upright it couldnt be if this were runnion he would have spoken before she ventured again tremulously have you any idea what time it is about three oclock i fancy who are you the question came like a shot dont you know what are you doing here mr runnion im rowing he answered carelessly why didnt you speak a vague feeling of uneasiness came over her a suspicion that all was not right so she waited for him to explain and when he did not she repeated her question what made you keep still so long you knew who i was well its the first time i ever took you on a midnight row and i wanted to enjoy it the mockery in his voice quickened her apprehension of a sudden the fear of being misjudged impelled her to end this flight that had become so distasteful in a moment preferring to face the people at the post rather than continue her journey with this man ive changed my mind mr runnion she said i dont want to go down to the mission i want you to take me back cant do it he said the current is too swift then set me ashore and ill walk back it cant be far to town twentyfive miles weve been out about three hours he kept on rowing steadily and although the distance they had gone frightened her she summoned her courage to say we can make that easily enough come run in to the bank he ceased rowing and let the boat drift with dragging sweeps filled his pipe and lighted it then took up his oars again and resumed his labors please do as i ask you mr runnion ive decided i dont want to go any farther he laughed and the sound aroused her put me ashore this minute she cried indignantly what do you mean youve got a fierce temper havent you will you do it or not when he made no answer except to continue the maddening monotony of his movements she was seized with a rash resolve to wrench the oars out of his hands and made a quick motion towards him at which he shouted sit down do you want to upset us the unstable craft lurched and dipped dangerously and realizing the futility of her mad impulse she sank back on her knees put me ashore no he said not till im ready now keep your seat or well both drown this aint a ferryboat after a few strokes he added well never get along together unless you tame that temper were not going to get along together mr runnion only as far as the mission i dare say you can tolerate me until then can you not she said this bitingly stark told me to board the first boat for st michaels he said disregarding her sarcasm but ive made a few plans of my own the last hour or so st michaels mr stark told you why thats impossible you misunderstood him he told you to row me to the mission im going to father barnums house no youre not and i didnt misunderstand him he wants to get you outside all right but i reckon youd rather go as mrs runnion than as the sweetheart of ben stark are you crazy the girl cried mr stark kindly offered to help me reach the father at his mission im nothing to him and im certainly not going to be anything to you if id known you were going to row the boat i should have stayed at home because i detest you youll get over that im not in the humor for jokes he rested again on his oars and said with deliberation stark kindly offered did he well whenever ben stark kindly offers anything im in on the play hes had his eye on you for the last three months and he wants you but he slipped a cog when he gave me the oars you neednt be afraid though im going to do the square thing by you well stop in at the mission and be married and then well see whether we want to go to st michaels or not though personally im for going back to flambeau during the hours while he had waited for necia to discover his identity the mans mind had not been idle he had determined to take what fortune tossed into his lap had she been the unknown unnoticed halfbreed of a month or two before he would not have wasted thought upon priests or vows but now that a strange fate had worked a change in her before the world he accepted it the girls beauty her indifference the mistaken attitude of stark urged him and strongest of all he was drawn by his cupidity for she would be very rich so the knowing ones said doubtless that was why stark wanted her and being a man who acknowledged no fidelity to his kind or his creator runnion determined to outwit his principal doret burrell and all the rest it was a chance to win much at the risk of nothing and he was too good a gambler to let it pass with his brusque declaration necia realized her position that she was a weak lonely girl just come into womanhood so cursed by good looks that men wanted her so stained by birth that they would not take her honestly realized that she was alone with a dissolute creature and beyond help and for the first time in her life she felt the meaning of fear she saw what a frail and helpless thing she was nothing about her was great save her soul and that was immeasurably vexed and worried she had just lived through a grief that had made her generous and now she gained her first knowledge of the mananimals gross selfishness you are absolutely daft she said you cant force me to marry you i aint going to force you youll do it willingly ill die first ill call the first man we see ill tell father barnum and hell have you run out of the country it would only take a word from me if you havent changed your mind when we get to his place ill run through without stopping but there isnt another priest between there and st mikes and by the time we get to the mouth of the river i guess youll say yes to most anything however id rather marry you at holy cross if youll consent and im pretty sure you will when you think it over we wont discuss it you dont understand yet he continued slowly what will people say when they know you ran away with me ill tell them the truth huh im too well known no man on the river would ever have you after that you you her voice was aquiver with indignation and loathing but her lips could not frame an epithet fit for him he continued rowing for some time then said will you marry me no if this thing is ever known poleon will kill you or father for a third time he rested on his oars now that weve come to threats let me talk i offered to marry you and do the square thing but if you dont want to ill pass up the formality and take you for my squaw the same as your father took alluna i guess youre no better than your mother so your old man cant say much under the circumstances and if he dont object poleon cant just remember youre alone with me in the heart of a wilderness and youve got to make a choice quick because im going ashore and make some breakfast as soon as its light enough to choose a landingplace if you agree to come quietly and go through with this thing like a sensible girl ill do whats right but if you dont then ill do whats wrong and maybe you wont be so damned anxious to tell your friends about this trip or spread your story up and down the river make up your mind before i land the water gurgled at the bow again and the rowlocks squeaked another hour and then another passed in silence before the girl noted that she no longer seemed to float through abysmal darkness but that the river showed in muddy grayness just over the gunwale she saw runnion more clearly too and made out his hateful outlines though for all else she beheld they might have been miles out upon a placid sea and so imperceptible was the laggard days approach that she could not measure the growing light it was a desolate dawn and showed no glorious gleams of color there was no rosepink glow no merging of a thousand tints no final burst of gleaming gold the night merely faded away changing to a sickly pallor that grew to ashen gray and then dissolved the lowhung distorted shadows a quarter of a mile inland on either hand into a forbidding row of unbroken forest backed by plain morass and distant hills untipped by slanting rays overhead a bleak ruin of clouds drifted underneath the river ran a bilious yellow the whole country so far as the eye could range was unmarred by the hand of man untracked save by the feet of the crafty forest people she saw runnion gazing over his shoulder in search of a shelving beach or bar his profile showing more debased and mean than she had ever noticed it before they rounded a bend where the left bank crumbled before the untiring teeth of the river forming a bristling chevauxdefrise of leaning fallen firs awash in the current the short side of the curve the one nearest them protected a gravel bar that made downstream to a daggerlike point and towards this runnion propelled the skiff the girls heart sank and she felt her limbs grow cold the mind of poleon doret worked in straight lines moreover his memory was good starks statement which so upset gale and the lieutenant had a somewhat different effect upon the frenchman for certain facts had been impressed upon his subconsciousness which did not entirely gibe with the gamblers remarks and yet they were too dimly engraved to afford foundation for a definite theory what he did know was this that he doubted why because certain scraps of a disjointed conversation recurred to him a few words which he had overheard in starks saloon something about a peterborough canoe and a woman he knew every skiff that lay along the waterfront and of a sudden he decided to see if this one was where it had been at dusk for there were but two modes of egress from flambeau and there was but one canoe of this type if necia had gone upriver on the freighter pursuit was hopeless for no boatman could make headway against the current but if on the other hand that cedar craft was gone he ran out of starks house and down to the riverbank then leaped to the shingle beneath it was just one chance and if he was wrong no matter the others would leave on the next upriver steamer whereas if his suspicion proved a certainty if stark had lied to throw them off the track and runnion had taken her downstream well poleon wished no one to hinder him for he would travel light the boat was gone he searched the line backward but it was not there and his excitement grew now likewise his haste still on the run he stumbled up to the tradingpost and around to the rear where bottom up lay his own craft the one he guarded jealously a birch canoe frail and treacherous for any but a man schooled in the ways of swift water and indian tricks he was very glad now that he had not told the others of his suspicions they might have claimed the right to go and of that he would not be cheated he swung the shell over his shoulders then hurried to the bank and down the steep trail like some great misshapen turtle he laid it carefully in the whispering current then stripped himself with feverish haste for the driving call of a hot pursuit was on him and although it was the cold raw hours of late night he whipped off his garments until he was bare to the middle he seized his paddle stepped in then knelt amidships and pushed away the birchbark answered him like a living thing leaping and dancing beneath the strokes which sprung the spruce blade and boiled the water to a foam while rippling rising ridges stood out upon his back and arms as they rose and fell stretched and bent and straightened a halfluminous opaque glow was over the waters but the banks quickly dropped away until there was nothing to guide him but the suck of the current and the sight of the dimset stars his haste now became something crying that lashed him fiercely for he seemed to be standing still and so began to mutter at the crawling stream and to complain of his thews which did not drive him fast enough only the sound he made was more like the whine of a hound in leash or a wolf that runs with hot nostrils close to the earth runnion drove his peterborough towards the shore with powerful strokes and ran its nose up on the gravel rose stretched himself and dragged it farther out then looked down at necia well what is it yes or no do you want me for a husband or for a master she cowered in the stern a pale fearful creature finally murmuring you you must give me time not another hour heres where you declare yourself and remember i dont care which you choose only youd better be sensible she cast her despairing eyes up and down the river then at the wilderness on either shore but it was as silent and unpeopled as if it had been created that morning she must have time she would temporize pretending to yield and then betray him to the first comer a promise exacted under duress would not be binding ill go quietly she said in a faint voice i knew youd see that im acting square come get the cramp out of yourself while i make a pot of coffee he held out his hand to assist her and she accepted it but stumbled as she rose for she had been crouched in one position for several hours and her limbs were stiff he caught her and swung her ashore then instead of putting her feet to the ground he pressed her to himself roughly and kissed her she gave a stifled cry and fought him off but he laughed and held her the closer aint i good for one kiss say this is the deuce of an engagement come now no no no she gasped writhing like a wild thing but he crushed his lips to hers again and then let her go whereupon she drew away from him panting dishevelled her eyes wide and filled with horror she scrubbed her lips with the back of her hand as if to erase his mark while he reached into the canoe and brought forth an axe a bundle of food and a coffeepot then still chuckling he gathered a few sticks of driftwood and built a fire she had a blind instinct to flee and sought for a means of escape but they were well out upon the bar that stretched a distance of three hundred feet to the wooded bank on one side of the narrow spit was the scarcely moving halfstagnant water of a tiny bay or eddy on the other the swift gliding current tugging at the beached canoe while the outer end of the gravelled ridge dwindled down to nothing and disappeared into the river at sight of the canoe a thought struck her but her face must have shown some sign of it for the man chanced to look at the moment and seeing her expression straightened himself then gazed about searchingly without a word he stepped to the boat and seizing it dragged it entirely out upon the bar where her strength would not be equal to shoving it off quickly and not content with this he made the painter fast then went back to his fire the eagerness died out of her face but an instant later when he turned to the clearer water of the eddy to fill the coffeepot she seized her chance and sped up the bar towards the bank the shingle under foot and her noisy skirts betrayed her and with an oath he followed it was an unequal race and he handled her with rough strong hands when he overtook her so you lied to me well im through with this foolishness if youll go back on your word like this youll bawl me out before the priest so ill forget my promise too and youll be glad of the chance to marry me let me go she panted ill marry you yes yes ill do it only dont touch me now he led her back to the fire which had begun to crackle she was so weak now that she sank upon the stones shivering thats right sit down and behave while i make you something hot to drink youre all in after a time he continued as he busied himself about his task say you ought to be glad to get me ive got a lot of money or i will have and once youre mrs runnion nobodyll ever know about this or think of you as a squaw he talked to her while he waited for the water to boil his assurance robbing her of hope for she saw he was stubborn and reckless determined to override her will as well as to conquer her body while under his creed the creed of his kind a woman was made from the rib of man and for his service he conveyed it to her plainly he ruled horses with a hard hand he drove his dog teams with a biting lash and he mastered women with a similar lack of feeling or consideration he was still talking when the girl sprang to her feet and sent a shrill cry out over the river but instantly he was up and upon her his hand over her mouth while she tore at it screaming the name of poleon doret he silenced her to a smothered sobbing mumble and turned to see far out on the bosom of the great soiled river a man in a bark canoe the craft had just swung past the bend above and was still a long way off so far away in fact that necias signal had not reached it for its occupant held unwaveringly to the swiftest channel his body rising and falling in the smooth unending rhythm of a masterboatman tinder great haste his arms upflung now and then as the paddle glinted and flashed across to the opposite side runnion glanced about hurriedly then cursed as he saw no place of concealment the peterborough stood out upon the bar conspicuously as did he and the girl but the chance remained that this man whoever he was would pass by for his speed was great the river a mile in width and the bend sharp necia had cried poleons name but her companion saw no resemblance to the frenchman in this strangelooking voyager in fact he could not quite make out what was peculiar about the man perhaps his eyes were not as sharp as hers and then he saw that the boatman was naked to the waist by now he was drawing opposite them with the speed of a hound the girl gagged and held by her captors hands struggled and moaned despairingly and crouching back of the boat they might have escaped discovery in the gray morning light had it not been for the telltale fire a tiny crackling blaze no larger than a mans hat it betrayed them the dancing craft upon which their eyes were fixed whipped about almost leaping from the water at one stroke then came towards them now nothing but a narrow thing half again the width of a mans body the current carried it down abreast of them then past and runnion rose releasing the girl who cried out with all her might to the boatman he made no sound in reply but drove his canoe shoreward with quicker strokes it was evident he would effect his landing near the lower end of the spit for now he was within hearing distance and driving closer every instant necia heard the gambler call sheer off doret you cant land here she saw a gun in runnions hand and a terrible sickening fear swept over her for he was slowly walking down the spit keeping abreast of the canoe as it drifted she could see exactly what would happen no man could disembark against the will of an armed marksman and if poleon slackened his stroke or stopped it to exchange his paddle for a weapon the current would carry him past in addition he would have to fire from a rocking paper shell harried by a boiling current whereas the other man stood flat upon his feet keep away or ill fire threatened runnion again and she screamed dont try it poleon hell kill you at her words runnion raised his weapon and fired she heard the woods behind reverberate with the echoes like a soundingboard saw the white spurt of smoke and the skitter of the bullet as it went wide it was a long shot and had been fired as a final warning but doret made no outcry nor did he cease coming instead his paddle clove the water with the same steady strokes that took every ounce of effort in his body runnion threw open his gun and replaced the spent shell on came the careening crazy craft in a sidewise drift and with it the girl saw coming a terrible tragedy she started to run down the gravelled ridge behind her enemy not realizing the value or moment of her action nor knowing clearly what she would do but as she drew near she saw runnion raise his gun again and without thought of her own safety threw herself upon him again his shot went wide as he strove to hurl her off but his former taste of her strength was nothing to this now that she fought for poleons life runnion snarled angrily and thrust her away for he had waited till the canoe was close let me go you devil he cried and aimed again but again she ran at him this time however she did not pit her strength against his but paused and as he undertook to fire she thrust at his elbow then dodged out of his way her blow was crafty and welltimed and his shot went wild again he took aim and again she destroyed it with a touch and danced out of his reach she was nimble and light and quickened now by a cold calculation of all that depended upon her three times in all she thwarted runnion while the canoe drove closer every instant on the fourth as she dashed at him he struck to be rid of her cursing wickedly struck as he would have struck at a man silently she crumpled up and fell a pitiful draggled awkward little figure sprawled upon the rocks but the delay proved fatal to him for though the canoe was close against the bank and the huge man in it seemed to offer a mark too plain to be missed he was too close to permit careful aim runnion heard him giving utterance to a strange feral whining sound as if he were crying like a fighting boy then as the gambler raised his arm the canadian lifted himself up on the bottom of the canoe until he stood stretched to his full height and leaped as runnion fired he sprang out and was into the water to his knees his backward kick whirling the craft from underneath him out into the current where the river seized it he had risen and jumped all in one moment launching himself at the shore like a panther the gun roared again but poleon came up and on with the rush of the great brown grizzly that no missile can stop runnions weapon blazed in his face but he neither felt nor heeded it for his bare hands were upon his quarry the impact of his body hurling the other from his feet and neither of them knew whether any or all of the last bullets had taken effect poleon had come like an arrow straight for his mark the instant he glimpsed it an insensate unreasoning raging thing that no weight of lead nor length of blade could stop in his haste he had left flambeau without weapon of any kind for in his mind such things were superfluous and he had never fought with any but those god gave him nor found any living thing that his hands could not master therefore he had rushed headlong against this armed and waiting man reaching for him ever closer and closer till the burning powder stung his eyes they grappled and fought alone and unseen and yet it was no fight for runnion though a vigorous heavymuscled man was beaten down smothered and crushed beneath the onslaught of this great naked fellow who all the time sobbed and whined and mewed in a panting fury they swung half across the spit to the farther side where they fell in a fantastic convulsion slipping and sliding and rolling among the rocks that smote and gouged and bruised them the gambler fought for his life against the naked flesh of the other against the distorted face that snapped and bit like the muzzle of a wolf while all the time he heard that fearful inarticulate note of bloodhunger at his ear the canadians clenched hands crushed whatever they fell upon as if mailed with metal the fingers were like tearing tongs that could not be loosed it was a frightful combat hideous from its inequality like the battle of a man against a maddened beast whose teeth tore and whose claws ripped whose every move was irresistible and so it was over shortly poleon rose and ran to the fallen girl leaving behind him a huddled and twisted likeness of a man he picked her up tenderly moaning and crooning but as her limp head lolled back throwing her pale blind features up to the heavens he began to cry this time like a woman tears fell from his eyes burning tears the agony of which seared his soul he laid her carefully beside the waters edge and holding her head and shoulders in the crook of his left arm he wet his right hand and bathed her face crouching over her half nude dripping with the sweat of his great labors a tender palpitating figure of bronzed muscle and sinew with all his fury and hate replaced by apprehension and pity the short moments that he worked with her were ages to him but she revived beneath his ministrations and her first frightened look of consciousness was changed to a melting smile wwhat happened poleon she said i was afraid he stood up to his full height shaking and weak as the water that dripped from him the very bones in him dissolved for the first time he uttered words tank god ba gosh and ran his hand up over his wet face where is he she started to her knees affrightedly then seeing the twisted sprawling figure beyond began to shudder he hes dead i don know said poleon carelessly you feel it purty good now eh wat yes i he struck me the remembrance of what had occurred surged over her and she buried her face in her hands oh poleon poleon he was a dreadful man he don trouble you no more he tried he ugh i im glad you did it she broke down trembling at her escape until her selfishness smote her and she was up and beside him on the instant are you hurt oh i never thought of that you must be wounded the frenchman felt himself over and looked down at his limbs for the first time no i guess not he said at which necia noticed his meagre attire and simultaneously he became conscious of it he fell away a pace casting his eyes over the river for his canoe which was now a speck in the distance ba gosh im hell of a ting for lookin at he said im paddle hard dats wy sacre how i sweat he hitched nervously at the band of his overalls while necia answered thats all right poleon then without warning her face froze with mingled repulsion and wonder look look she whispered pointing past him runnion was moving slowly crawling painfully into a sitting posture uplifting a terribly mutilated face dazed and half conscious groping for possession of his wits he saw them and grimaced frightfully cowering and cringing poleon felt the girls hand upon his arm and heard her crying in a hard sharp voice he needs killing put him away he stared down at his gentle necia and saw the loathing in her face and the look of strange ferocity as she met his eyes boldly you dont know what he what he did she said through her shut teeth he but the man waited to hear no more runnion saw him coming and scrambled frantically to allfours then got on his feet and staggered down the bar as poleon overtook him he cried out piteously a shrill scream of terror and falling to his knees grovelled and debased himself like a foul cripple at fear of the lash his agony dispelled the savage taint of allunas aboriginal training in necia and the pure white blood of her ancestors cried out poleon poleon not that she hurried after him to where he paused above the wretch waiting for her you mustnt she said that would be murder and and its all over now the frenchman looked at her wonderingly not comprehending this sudden leniency let him alone youve nearly killed him thats enough whereat runnion broken in body and spirit began to beg for his life wats dat you say jus now doret asked the girl was dat de truth for sure wat you speak yes but youve done your work dont touch him again he hesitated and runnion quick to observe it added his entreaty to hers im beaten doret you broke me to pieces i need help i im hurt wat you spec i do wit im the canadian asked and she answered i suppose well have to take him where he can get assistance dat skiff ain carry all free of us ill stay here groaned the frightened man ill wait for a steamer to pick me up but for gods sake dont touch me again poleon looked him over carefully and made up his mind that the man was more injured in spirit than in body for outside of his battered muscles he showed no fatal symptoms although the voyageur was slower to anger than a child a grudge never died in him and his simple selftaught creed knew no forgiveness for such men as runnion cherished no mercy for preying men or beasts he glanced towards the wooded shores a stonesthrow above then back at the coward he had beaten and whose life was forfeit under the code there was a queer light in his eyes leave him here poleon well go away you and i in the canoe and the first boat will pick him up come necia tugged at his wrist for fear she might not prevail but he was bent on brushing away a handful of hungry mosquitoes which warmed by the growing day had ventured out on the river his face became wrinkled and set bien he grunted we lef im here biccause dere aint nough room in de batteau eh all right dats good ting but hes seeck man so mebbe i feex it him nice place for stop till dem boats come yes yes leave me here ill make it through all right begged runnion better you camp yonder on de point were you can see dose steamboat wen she comes roun de ben dis is bad place he indicated the thicket a quarter of a mile above which ran out almost to the cut bank come i help you get feex runnion shrank from his proffered assistance half fearfully but reassured allowed the frenchman to help him towards the shore we tell it de first boat bout you an dey pick you up you wait here necia the girl watched her rescuer guide runnion up to the level of the woods then disappear with him in the firs and was relieved to see the two emerge upon the riverbank again farther on for she had feared for an instant that poleon might forget there seemed to be no danger however for he was crashing through the brush in advance of the other who followed laboriously once runnion gained the high point he would be able to command a view of both reaches of the river and could make signals to attract the first steamboat that chanced to come along without doubt a craft of some sort would pass from one direction or the other by tomorrow at latest or if not she and poleon could send back succor to him from the first habitation they encountered the two men disappeared again and her fears had begun to prey on her a second time when she beheld the big canadian returning he was hurrying a bit apparently to be rid of the mosquitoes that swarmed about him and she marked that in addition to whipping himself with a handful of blueberry bushes he wore runnions coat to protect his shoulders woof dose skeeter bug is hongry he cried lets we pass on de river queeck you didnt touch him again no no im trough wit im she was only too eager to be away from the spot and an instant later they were afloat in the peterborough dis nice batteau poleon remarked critically i mak it go fas and began to row swiftly seeking the breeze of the open river in which to shake off the horde of stinging pests that had risen with the sun i come way queeck witout tinkin bout gun or skeeter net or notin runnion shes len me dis coat so mebbe i don look so worse lak i do jus now eh how did you leave him is he badly injured no i bus it up on de face an de rib but shes feelin good now yes im leave im nice place for stop an wait on de steamboat plaintee spruce bough for set on she began to shudder again and sensitive to her every motion he asked solicitously if she were sick but she shook her head i i was thinking what supposing you hadnt come oh poleon you dont know what you saved me from she leaned forward and laid a tiny grateful hand on the huge brown paw that rested on his oar i wonder if i can ever forget she noted that they were running with the current and inquired where are we going wal i cant pull dis boat gainst dat current so i guess we pass on till i fin my shirt den bimebye we pick it up some steamboat an go home five miles below his quick eye detected his halfsubmerged bark lodged beneath some overhanging firs which from the waters action had fallen forward into the stream and by rare goodfortune it was still upright although awash he towed it to the next sandbar where he wrung out and donned his shirt then tipped the water from the smaller craft and making it fast astern of the peterborough set out again towards noon they came in sight of a little sternwheeled craft that puffed and pattered manfully against the sweeping current hiding behind the points and bars and following the slackest water its the mission boat cried necia its the mission boat father barnum will be aboard she waved her arms madly and mingled her voice with poleons until a blackrobed figure appeared beside the pilothouse father barnum she screamed and recognizing her he signalled back soon they were alongside and a pair of siwash deckhands lifted necia aboard doret following after the painter of the peterborough in his teeth he dragged both canoes out of the boiling tide and laid them bottom up on the forward deck then climbed the narrow little stairs to find necia in the arms of a benignant whitehaired priest the bestbeloved man on the yukon who broke away from the girl to greet the frenchman his kind face alight with astonishment what is all this i hear slowly doret slowly my little girl is talking too furiously for these poor old wits to follow i cant understand i am amazed what is this tale together they told him while his blue eyes now opened wide with wonder now grew soft with pity then blazed with indignation when they had finished he laid his hand upon dorets shoulder my son i thank god for your good body and your clean heart you saved our necia and you will be rewarded as to this this man runnion we must find him and he must be sent out of the country this new clean land of ours is no place for such as he you will be our pilot poleon and guide us to the spot it required some pressure to persuade the frenchman but at last he consented and as the afternoon drew to a close the little steamboat came squattering and wheezing up to the bar where runnion had built his fire that morning and a long shrill blast summoned him from the point above when he did not appear the priest took poleon and his roundfaced silent crew of two and went up the bank but they found no sign of the crippled man only a few rags a trampled patch of brush at the forests edge and that was all the springy moss showed no trail the thicket gave no answer to their cries although they spent an hour in a scattered search and sounded the steamboats whistle again and again hes try for walk it back to camp said doret mebbe he ain hurt so much after all you must be right said father barnum we will keep the steamer close to this shore so that he can hail us when we overtake him and so they resumed their toilsome trip but mile after mile fell behind them and still no voice came from the woods no figure hailed them doret inscrutable and silent lounged against the pilothouse smoking innumerable cigarettes which he rolled from squares of newspaper his keen eyes apparently scanning every foot of their slow way but when night fell at last and the bank faded from sight he tossed the last butt overboard smiled grimly into the darkness and went below chapter xviii runnion finds the singing people no creek lee came into the tradingpost on the following morning and found gale attending store as if nothing unusual had occurred say whats this about you and stark i hear you had a horrible runin and that you split him up the back like a quail we had a row admitted the trader its been a long time working out and last night it came to a head lordee and to think of ben starks bein licked why the whole camps talkin about it they say he emptied two sixshooters at you but you kept acomin and when you did get to him you just carved your initials on him like he was a basswood tree say john hes a goner sure do you mean hes passing out oh no i reckon hell get well from what i hear though he wont let nobody come near him except old doc but hes lost a battle and that ends him dont you savvy whenever a killer quits second best it breaks his hoodoo why theres been men laying for him these twenty years from here to the rio grande and every feller he ever bested will hear of this and begin to grease his holster then the first shavetail desperado that meets him will spit in his eye just to make a name for himself no sir hes a spent shell hes got to fight all his battles over again and this time the other feller will open the ball oh ive seen it happen before you killed him last night just as sure as if youd hung up his hide to dry and he knows it im a peaceable man said gale on the defensive i had to do it i know i know there was witnesses this dressmaker at the fort seen it so i hear the other acquiesced silently well well ben stark licked i cant get over that it must a been somethin powerful strong to make you do it john it was as close to a question as the miner dared come although he was avid with curiosity and like the entire town was in a fret to know what lay back of this midnight encounter concerning which the most exaggerated rumors were rife these stories grew the more grotesque and ridiculous the longer the truth remained hidden for stark could not be seen and neither gale nor burrell would speak all that the people knew was that one lay wounded to death behind the dumb walls of his cabin and that the other had brought him down when the old man vouchsafed no more than a nod to his question the prospector inquired wheres poleon ive got news for him from the creek i dont know hes gone back soon i dont know why his laymen have give up theyve crosscut his ground and the pay aint there so theyve quit work for good he drew a blank eh worsen that three of them the creek is spotteder than a leopard runnions men for instance are into it bigger than a house while poleons people cant raise a color i call it tough luck yes worsen tough its hardbiled and pickled to them as has shall it be given and to them as hasnt shall be took even what they aint got as the poet says look at necia shell be richer than a cream puff guess ill step around and see her shes gone said the trader wearily turning his haggard face from the prospector gone where upriver with runnion they got her away from me last night sufferin snakes ejaculated lee so thats why then he added simply lets go and git her john the trader looked at him queerly maybe i wont on the first boat im eating my heart out hour by hour waiting waiting waiting for some kind of a craft to come and so is burrell whats he got to do with it said the oneeyed miner jealously cant you and me bring her back hell marry her god wont there never be a boat for the hundredth time that morning he went to the door of the post and strained his eyes downstream well well them two goin to be married said lee stark licked and necia goin to be married all at once i hate to see it john he aint good enough she could a done a heap better theres a lot of reglar men around here and she could a had her pick of course always bein broke like a dog myself i aint kept up my personal appearance like id ought but ive got some new clothes now and you wouldnt know me i bought em off a tenderfoot with cold feet but theyre the goods and youd see a big improvement in me hes a good man said gale better than you or me and hes all torn up over this i never saw a man act so when he learned about it i thought hed go mad hes haunted the riverbank ever since raging about for some means of following her and if i hadnt fairly held him hed have set out singlehanded im still strong in the belief that necia could have bettered her hand by stayin out awhile longer declared lee stubbornly but if she wants a soldier why well get one for her only id rather have got her somethin real good and pronounced in the military line like an agitantgenral or a walkin delegate while they were talking burrell came in and no creek saw that the night had affected the youth even more than it had gale or at least he showed the marks more plainly for his face was drawn his eyes were sunken as if from hunger and his whole body seemed to have fallen away till his uniform hung upon him loose unkempt and careless it was as if hope had been a thing of avoirdupois and when taken away had caused a shrinkage he had interrogated stark again after getting the doctor but the man had only cursed at him declaring that his daughter was out of reach where he would take care to keep her and torturing the lover anew by linking runnions name with the girls till the young man fled from the sound of the monsters voice back to his own quarters he strove to keep the image of runnion out of his mind for his reason could not endure it at such times he cried aloud cursing in a way that was utterly strange to a godfearing man only to break off and rush to the other extreme praying blindly beseechingly for the girls safekeeping at intervals an unholy impulse almost drove him to starks cabin to finish the work gale had begun to do it coldly as a matter of justice for was he not the one who had put necia into the hands of that ruffian greeting lee mechanically he said to gale i cant wait much longer and sank wearily into a seat almost the next instant he was on his feet again saying to the trader as he had said it a score of times already runnion comes to me gale you understand hes mine dont you the old man nodded yes you can take him well who do i git asked lee you cant come along the trader said we may have to follow the hound clean to the states think of your mine to hell with the mine exploded the shaggy prospector i reckon im kind of a daddy to your gal and im goin to be in at the finish back and forth paced the lieutenant restlessly pausing every now and then to peer down the river suddenly he uttered a cry and with a bound gale was beside him lee at his shoulder look over the point down yonder i saw smoke the three stared at the distant forest fringe that masked the bend of the river until their eyes ached and the darkgreen grew black and wavered indistinctly youre tired my boy said gale wait they obeyed and finally over the treetops saw a faint streamer of black it is it is cried the soldier im going for my war bag and before the steamboat had hove into sight he was back with his scanty bundle of baggage behaving like one daft talking and laughing and running here and there lee watched him closely then went behind the bar and poured out a stiff glass of whiskey which he made burrell drink to gale he whispered a moment later keep your eye on him john hell go mad at this rate they waited it seemed interminably until at last a white hull slowly rounded the point then shaped a course across the current towards the other bank where the water was less swift as it came fully into sight gale swore aloud in despair its the mission boat well what of that said burrell well hire it buy it take it its no use she aint got but three dogpower to her engines lee explained shes a downriver boat has to run with the current to move we cant use her gale gave in reluctantly shed only lose time for us weve got to wait for one of the a c boats wait cried burrell good god weve done nothing but wait wait wait lets do something you go back yonder and set down commanded lee well have a boat before long the arrival of the tiny mission steamer was never of sufficient importance to draw a crowd to the riverbank so the impatient men at the post relaxed interest in her as she came creeping up abreast of the town it was little johnny gale who first saw necia and poleon on board for he had recognized father barnums craft at a distance and stationed himself at the bank handinhand with molly to bid the good kind old man welcome the men inside the house did not hear the boy crying necias name for his voice was small and they had gone to the rear of the store understand you leave runnion to me burrell was saying no man shall lay hands on him except me his voice trailed away he rose slowly to his feet a strange light on his face the others turned to see what sight had drawn his eyes in the opening all splendid with the golden sunlight stood necia and poleon doret who had her by the hand and she was smiling gale uttered a great cry and went to meet them but the soldier could move nothing save his lips and stood dazed and disbelieving he saw them dimly coming towards him and heard poleons voice as if at a great distance saw that the frenchmans eyes were upon him and that his words were directed to him i bring her back to you msieu doret laid necias hand in that of her lover and burrell saw her smiling shyly up at him something gripped him chokingly and he could utter no sound there was nothing to sayshe was here safe smiling that was all and the girl beholding the glory in his eyes understood gale caught her away from him then and buried her in his arms a woman came running into the store and seeing the group paused at the door a shapeless silent shawled figure in silhouette against the day the trader brought the girl to her fostermother who began to talk in her own tongue with a rapidity none of them had ever heard before her voice as tender as some wild birds song then the two women went away together around the store into the house poleon had told necia all the amazing story that had come to him that direful night all that he had overheard all that he knew and much that he guessed the priest came into the store shortly and the men fell upon him for information for nothing was to be gained from poleon who seemed strangely fagged and weary and who had said but little yes yes yes laughed father barnum ill tell you all i know of course but first i must meet lieutenant burrell and take him by the hand the story did not lose in his telling particularly when he came to describe the fight on the gravel bar which no man had seen and of which poleon had told him little but the good priest was of a militant turn and his blue eyes glittered and flashed like an old crusaders it was a wondrous combat he declared with all the spirit of a spectator for poleon advanced barehanded and beat him down even as the man fired into his face it is due to the goodness and mercy of god that he was spared a single wound from this desperado a miracle vouchsafed because of his clean heart and his righteous cause but where is runnion broke in burrell nursing his injuries at some woodcutters camp no doubt but god be praised for that double spirit of generosity and forgiveness which prompted our poleon to spare the wretch no finer thing have i known in all my life doret even though you have ever been an ungodly fellow the frenchman moved uneasily wal i don know he ain fight so dam hard you couldnt find no trace of him said lee no trace whatever father barnum replied but he will surely reach some place of refuge where we can pick him up for the days are still mild and the woods full of berries and as you know the streams overflow with salmon which he can kill with a stick why a man might live a fortnight without inconvenience ill be on the lookout for him said the lieutenant grimly tonight ill send thomas and a couple of men down the river when the voluble old priest had at last exhausted his narrative he requested of burrell the privilege of a few words and drew him apart from the others his face was shrewdly wrinkled and warm with understanding i had a long conversation with my little girl for she is like a daughter to me and i discovered the depth of her love for you do you think you are worthy of her no do you love her as much as you should as much as i can they dont make words or numbers big enough to tell you how dear she is to me then why delay tomorrow i leave again and one never knows what a day may bring forth but stark the young man cried hes her father you know hes like a madman and shes still under age i know very little of law outside of the church the father observed but as i understand it if she marries before he forbids her the law will hold him powerless now he has never made himself known to her he has never forbidden her anything and although my conclusion may not be correct i believe it is and you have a chance if you make haste at your age my boy i never needed a spur a spur good lord im from kentucky once she is yours before god your hold will be stronger in the eyes of men if i am wrong and he takes her from you well may some other priest rewed you two i shant dont worry laughed burrell ablaze at the thought youre the only preacher wholl kiss my bride for im a jealous man and all the starks and all the fathers in the world wont get her away from me do you think shell do it a woman in love will do anything burrell seized the little man by the hand if i had known more law you neednt have given me this hint i must go now to this stark said the father he may need me but first i shall talk with necia poor child she is in a difficult position standing between the love of john gale and the loyalty she owes her father i i fear i cannot counsel her as well as i ought for i am very weak and human you had better come with me perhaps the plea of a lover may have more weight than the voice of reason as they started towards the house he continued energetically young man im beginning to live once more do you know sometimes i think i was not designed for this vocation and just between you and me there was a day when he paused and coughed a trifle then said sharply well what are you waiting for together they went into the traders house back in the store there was silence after the priest and the soldier went out which gale broke at last this forgiveness talk is all right i suppose but i want runnion well git him too growled lee at which poleon uttered a curt exclamation no why not said the miner wal the canadian drawled slowly then paused to light the cigarette he had rolled in a bit of wrappingpaper inhaled the smoke deeply to the bottom of his lungs held it there a moment and blew it out through mouth and nostrils before adding youll jus be wastin tam gale looked up from beneath his thatch of brow and asked quietly why you member story i tol you wan day two tree mont ago poleon remarked with apparent evasion bout johnny platt wat i ketch on de porcupine all et up by skeeterbugs i do answered gale wal he met their eyes squarely then drew another long breath from his cigarette im jus hopin nobody don pick it up dis runnion feller de same way mebbe dey fin hees hans tie behin im wit piece of hees shirt good god cried the trader starting to his feet you you of course im jus sposin he was feel purty good wen i lef he was feel so good i tak hees coat for keepin off dem bugs from me biccause i lef it my own shirt on de canoe hes nice feller dat way he give up easy ba gosh i never see worse place for skeeters gale fell silent and no creek lee began to swear in little useless ineffective oaths which were but two ways of showing similar emotions then the former stepped up and laid a big hand upon poleons shoulder that saves us quite a trip he said but no creek lee continued to swear softly it seemed that poleons wish was to be gratified for no news of the missing man came through in the days that followed only at a fishing village far down the river where a few native families had staked their nets and weirs for salmon a hunter told a strange tale to his brothers a tale of the white mans idiosyncrasies in sooth they were a strange people he observed surpassing wise in many things yet ignorant and childish in all others else why should a halfnaked man go wandering idly through the thickets holding a knotted rag behind his back and that when the glades were dense and the mosschinks filled with the singing people who lived for blood the elders of the village nodded their heads sagely and commended the hunter for holding aloof from the inert body for the foolishness of this man was past belief and well his people were swift and cruel in their vengeance and sometimes doubted an indians word wherefore it were best to pay no heed to their ways and say nothing but they continued to wonder why father barnum found the three still talking in the store when he had finished an hours counsel with necia so came straight to the point it was work that delighted his soul for he loved the girl and had formed a strong admiration for burrell two of them took his announcement quietly the other cried out strenuous objections it was the oneeyed miner right away not on your life its too onexpected youve got to hold em apart for an hour anyhow till i get dressed he slid down from his seat upon the counter what do you reckon i got all them clothes for come as you are urged the father but lee fought his point desperately ill bust it up if you dont gimme time whats an hour or two when theyve got a life sentence comin to em dammit you jest ought to see them clothes and by very force of his vociferations he succeeded in exacting the promise of a brief stay in the proceedings before he bolted out the rags of his yellow mackinaw flapping excitedly the priest returned to necia leaving the trader and poleon alone i spose its best said the former yes beats the deuce though how things work out dont it im glad for see dis day said the frenchman hes good man an he ain never goin to hurt her none he paused deres jus wan ting i want for ask it of you john you member dat day we stop on de birch grove an you spik bout her an tol me dose story bout her moder wal i was dreamin dat tam so im goin ask it you now don never tell her wat i said doesnt she know my boy no i ain never spoke bout love she tinks im broder wit her an dats wat i am ba gar he could not hold his voice even it broke with him but he avoided the old mans gaze gale took him by the shoulders there aint nothing so cruel in the world as a gentle woman said he but she wouldnt hurt you for all the world poleon only the blaze of this other thing has blinded her she cant see nothing for the light of this new love of hers i know dats wy nobody onderstans but you an me gale looked out through the open door past the sunlit river which came from a land of mystery and vanished into a valley of forgetfulness past the forest and the hills in his deepset eyes the light of a wondrous love that had lived with him these many weary years and said nobody else can understand but me i know how it is i had even a harder thing to bear for youll know shes happy at least while i his voice trembled but after a pause he continued they neither of them understand what youve done for them for it was you that brought her back but some time theyll learn how great their debt is and thank you itll take them years and years however and when they do theyll tell their babes of you poleon so that your name will never die i loved her mother but i dont think i could have done what you did shes purty hard ting for sure but i ain tink bout poleon doret none wen im doin it no im tink bout her all de tarn shes lil gal an im beeg strong feller wat don matter much an wat ain know much cept singin an lovin her im see for sure now dat i ain fit for her im beeg rough fightin feller wat cant read an shes de beam of sunlight wat blin my eyes if i was a fool id say youd forget in time but ive lived my life in the open and i know you wont i didnt i don want to forget the brown man cried hurriedly le bon dieu would not let me forget its all ive got to keep wit me wen im lookin for my new countree youre not goin to look for that new country any more gale replied today said the other quietly no

sundown i want for see the campfire trough de brush wen i come from trap de fox an dem little wild fellers i want to smell smoke in de dusk my work shes finish here so im paddle away today an ill fin dat place dis tam for sure shes over dere he raised his long arm and pointed to the dim mountains that hid the valley of the koyukuk the valley that called good men and strong year after year and took them to itself while in his face the trader saw the hunger of his race the unslaked longing for the wilderness the driving desire that led them ever north and west and seeing it he knew the man would go have you heard the news from the creeks no your claims are blanks your men have quit the frenchman shook his head sadly then smiled a wistful little smile wal its better i lose dan you or necia i ain de lucky kin dats all an affer all wat good to me is riche golmine i ain got no use for money any more they stood in the doorway together two rugged stalwart figures different in blood and birth and every other thing yet brothers withal whom the ebb and flow of the far places had thrown together and now drew apart again and they were sad these two for their love was deeper than comes to other people and they knew this was farewell so they remained thus side by side two dumb sorrowful men until they were addressed by a person who hurried from the town he came as an apparition bearing the voice of no creek lee the mining king but in no other way showing sign or symbol of their old friend its style of face and curious outfit were utterly foreign to the miner for he had been bearded with the robust unkempt growth of many years tanned to a leathery hue and garbed perennially in the habit of a scarecrow while this creature was shaved and clipped and curried and the clothes it stood up in were of many startling hues its face was scraped so clean of whiskers as to be a pallid white but lack of adornment ended at this point and the rest was overladen wondrously while from the centre of the halfbrown halfwhite face the long red nose of lee ran out beside it rolled his lonesome eye alive with excitement he came up with a strut illumining the landscape and inquired well how do i look im darned if i know said gale but its plumb unusual these here shoes leak said the spectacle pulling up his baggy trousers to display his tan footgear because they was made for dry goin thats why they left the tops off but theyve got a nice healthy color aint they as a whole it seems to me im sort of nifty he revolved slowly before their admiring gaze and while to one versed in the manners of the far east it would have been evident that the original owner of these clothes had come from somewhere beyond the susquehanna and had either been a football player or had travelled with a glee club to these three northmen it seemed merely that here was the modish echo of a distant civilization wats de matter on your face said poleon you been fightin i aint shaved in a long time and this here excitement has kind of shattered my nerves i didnt have no lookinglass neither in my shack so i had to use a lardcan cover does it look bad not to my way of thinkin said gale allaying no creeks anxiety its more desprate than bad but it sort of adds expression at which the miners pride burst bounds ill kindly ask you to note the shirt ten dollars a copy thats all i got it from the little jew down yon der see them red spearheads on the boosum flower dee lizzies which means calla lilies in french every one of em cost me four bits on the levelhow am i i never see no harness jus lak it mesef exclaimed doret you look good nough for tinhorn gambler say don you wear no necktie wit dem kin of clothes no sir not me im a rude rough miner and i dress the part lowcut blushin shoes and straw hats i can stand for likewise collars they go handinhand with paystreaks but a necktie aint neither wore for warmth nor protection its a pomp and a vanity and im a plain man without conceit now lets proceed with the obsequies it was a very simple unpretentious ceremony that took place inside the long low house of logs and yet it was a wonderful thing to the dark shy maid who hearkened so breathlessly beside the man she had singled out the cleancut man in uniform who stood so straight and tall making response in a voice that had neither fear nor weakness in it when they had done he turned and took her reverently in his arms and kissed her before them all then she went and stood beside gale and the red wife who was no wife and said simply i am very happy the old man stooped and for the first time in her memory pressed his lips to hers then went out into the sunlight where he might be alone with himself and the memory of that other merridy the woman who to him was more than all the women of the world the woman who each day and night came to him and with whom he had kept faith the burden she had laid upon him had been heavy but he had borne it long and uncomplainingly and now he was very glad for he had kept his covenant the first word of the wedding was borne by father barnum who went alone to the cabin where the girls father lay entering with trepidation for in spite of the pleas of justice and humanity this stonyhearted amply hated man had certain rights which he might choose to enforce hence the good priest feared for the peace of his little charge and approached the stricken man with apprehension he was there a long time alone with stark and when he returned to gales house he would answer no questions he is a strange man a wonderfully strange man unrepentant and wicked but i cant tell you what he said have a little patience and you will soon know the mail boat which had arrived an hour after the mission boat was ready to continue its run when just as it blew a warning blast down the street of the camp came a procession so strange for this land that men stopped eyed it curiously and whispered among themselves it was a blanketed man upon a stretcher carried by a doctor and a priest the face was muffled so that the idlers could not make it out and when they inquired they received no answer from the carriers who pursued their course impassively down the runway to the waters edge and up the gangplank to the deck when the boat had gone and the last faint cough of its towering stacks had died away father barnum turned to his friends he has gone away not for a day but for all time he is a strange man and some things he said i could not understand at first i feared greatly for when i told him what had occurred of necias return and of her marriage he became so enraged i thought he would burst open his wounds and die from his very fury but i talked a long long time with him and gradually i came to know somewhat of his queer disordered soul he could not bring himself to face defeat in the eyes of men or to see the knowledge of it in their bearing therefore he fled he told me that he would be a hunted animal all his life that the news of his whipping would travel ahead of him and that his enemies would search him out to take advantage of him this i could not grasp but it seemed a big thing in his eyes so big that he wept he said the only decent thing he could or would do was to leave the daughter he had never known to that happiness he had never experienced and wished me to tell her that she was very much like her mother who was the best woman in the world chapter xix the call of the oreads there was mingled rejoicing and lamentation in the household of john gale this afternoon molly and johnny were in the throes of an overwhelming sorrow the noise of which might be heard from the barracks to the indian village they were sparing of tears as a rule but when they did give way to woe they published it abroad yelling with utter abandon their black eyes puckered up their mouths distended into squares from which came such a measure of sound as to rack the ears and burden the air heavily with sadness poleon was going away their own particular poleon something was badly askew in the general scheme of affairs to permit of such a thing and they manifested their grief so loudly that burrell who knew nothing of dorets intention sought them out and tried to ascertain the cause of it they had found the frenchcanadian at the river with their father loading his canoe and they had asked him whither he fared when the meaning of his words struck home they looked at each other in dismay then bred as they were to mask emotion they joined hands and trudged silently back up the bank with filling eyes and chins aquiver until they gained the rear of the house here they sat down all forlorn and began to weep bitterly and in an ascending crescendo whats the matter with you tikes anyhow inquired the lieutenant he had always filled them with a speechless awe and at his unexpected appearance they began the slow and painful process of swallowing their grief he was a nice man they had both agreed long ago and very splendid to the eye but he was nothing like poleon who was one of them only somewhat bigger come now tell me all about it the soldier insisted has something happened to the threelegged puppy molly denied the occurrence of any such catastrophe then youve lost the little shiny rifle that shoots with air but johnny dispelled this horrible suspicion by drawing the formidable weapon out of the grass behind him well there isnt anything else bad enough to cause all this outlay of anguish cant i help you out poleon they wailed in unison exactly what about him hes goin away said johnny hes goin away echoed molly now thats too bad of course the young man assented but think what nice things hell bring you when he comes back he aint comin back announced the heir with the tone that conveys a sorrow unspeakable he aint comin back wailed the little girl and being a woman yielded again to her weakness unashamed burrell tried to extract a more detailed explanation but this was as far as their knowledge ran so he sought out the canadian and found him with gale in the store a scanty pile of food and ammunition on the counter between them poleon said he youre not going away yes said doret im takin lil trip but when are you coming back the man shrugged his shoulders dats hard ting for tellin im resless in my heart so im goin travel some i ain never pass on de back trail yet so i spect i keep goin oh but you cant cried burrell i i he paused awkwardly while down the breeze came the lament of the two little gales well i feel just as they do he motioned in the direction of the sound i wanted you for a friend doret i hate to lose you i ain never got my satisfy yet so im pass on all de tam pass on mebbe dis trip i fin de place im sorry because well im a selfish sort of cuss and burrell pulled up blushingly with a strong mans display of shame at his own emotion i owe all my happiness to you old man i cant thank you neither of us can we shall never live long enough for that but you mustnt go without knowing that i feel more than ill ever have words to say he was making it very hard for the frenchman whose heart was aching already with a dull unending pain poleon had hoped to get away quietly his heart was too heavy to let him face necia or this man and run the risk of their reading his secret so a plaintive wrinkle gathered between his eyes that grew into a smile and then as if he were not tried sufficiently the girl herself came flying in whats this i hear she cried alluna tells me she saw the telltale pile on the counter and her face grew white then its true oh poleon he smiled and spoke cheerily yes i been tinkin bout dis trip long tam when are you coming back wal if i fin dat new place wat im lookin for i don never come back you people was good frien to me but im kin of shifless feller you know mebbe i forget all bout flambeau an stop on my new countree you never can tol wat dose franchemans goin do its the wanderlust murmured burrell to himself hell never rest what a child you are cried necia half angrily cant you conquer that roving spirit and settle down like a man she laid her hand on his arm appealingly havent i told you there isnt any far country havent i told you that this path leads only to hardship and suffering and danger the land you are looking for is there she touched his breast so why dont you stay in flambeau and let us help you to find it he was deeply grateful for her blindness and yet it hurt him so that his great heart was nigh to bursting why couldnt she see the endless hopeless yearning that consumed him and know that if he stayed in sight and touch of her it would be like a living death perhaps then she would have given over urging him to do what he longed to do and let him go on that search he knew was hopeless and in which he had no joy but she did not see she would never see he laughed aloud for all the world as if the sun were bright and the fret for adventure were still keen in him then picking up his bundle said deres no use argue wit canayen man mebbe some day i come paddle back roun de ben down yonder an you hear me singin dose chanson but now de day shes too fine de river shes laugh too loud an de birds shes sing too purty for francheman to stop on shore ba gosh im glad he began to hum and they heard him singing all the way down to the riverbank as if the spirit of youth and hope and gladness were not dead within him chante rossignal chante toi qui a le coeur gai tu as le coeur a rire mai j l aita pleurer il y a longtemps que j taime jamais je ne toublierai footnote sing little bird oh sing away you with the voice so light and gay yours is a heart that laughter cheers mine is a heart thats full of tears long have i loved i love her yet leave her i can but not forget a moment later they heard him expostulating with some one at the waters edge and then a childs treble rose on high no no im goin too im goin tooooo hey john gale called poleon come ere ba gosh you better horry too i cant hol dis feller long when they appeared on the bank above him he continued look ere wat i fin on my batteau and held up the wriggling form of johnny gale hes stow hissef away onder dem blanket sacre hes bad feller dis man don pay for hees ticket at all hes reglar toff mug i want to go long yelled the incorrigible stowaway he had brought his gun with him and this weapon peeping forth from under poleons blanket had betrayed him i want to go long shrieked the little man i like you best of all at which doret took him in his arms and hugged him fiercely wal i guess you don tink bout dem beeg black bear at night eh but this only awoke a keener distress in the junior gale oh maybe de bear will get you poleon let me go long and ill keep dem off two men is better dan one please poleon it took the efforts of necia and the trader combined to tear the lad from the frenchman and even then the foul deed was accomplished only at the cost of such wild acclaim and evidence of undying sorrow that little molly came hurrying from the house her round face stained and tearful her mouth an inverted crescent she had gone to the lame puppy for comfort and now strangled him absentmindedly in her arms clutching him to her breast so tightly that his tongue lolled out and his three legs protruded stiffly pawing an aimless pantomime when johnny found that no hope remained he quelled his demonstrations of emotion and as befitted a stouthearted gentleman of the woods bore a final present to his friend he took the little airgun and gave it into poleons hands against that black night when the bears would come and no man ever made a greater sacrifice doret picked him up by the elbows and kissed him again and again then set him down gently at which molly scrambled forward and without word or presentation speech gave him her hearts first treasure she held out the threelegged puppy for a gun and a dog should ever go together then being of the womankind aforesaid she began to cry as she kissed her pet goodbye on its cold wet nose wats dis said poleon and his voice quavered for these childish fingers tore at his heartstrings terribly hes a very brave doggie said the little girl he will scare de bears away and then she became dissolved in tears at the anguish her offering cost her doret caressed her as he had her brother then placed the puppy carefully upon the blankets in the canoe where it wagged a grateful and amiable stump at him and regained its breath it was the highest proof of mollys affection for her poleon that she kept her teardimmed eyes fixed upon the dog as long as it was visible the time had come for the last goodbye that awkward moment when human hearts are full and spoken words are empty burrell gripped the frenchmans hand he was grateful but he did not know goodluck and better hunting he said a heavy purse and a light heart for you always poleon i have learned to love you i want you to be good husban msieu dats de bes ting i can wish for you gale spoke to him in patois and all he said was may you not forget my son they did not look into each others eyes there was no need the old man stooped and taking both his children by the hand walked slowly towards the house dis tam ill fin it for sure smiled poleon to necia her eyes were shining through the tears and she whispered fervently i hope so brother god love you always it was grief at losing a playmate a dear and wellbeloved companion he knew it well and he was glad now that he had never said a word of love to her it added to his pain but it lightened hers and that had ever been his wish he gazed on her for a long moment taking in that blessed image which would ever live with himin his eyes was the light of a love as pure and clean as ever any maid had seen and in his heart a sorrow that would never cease goodbye lil gal he said then dropped her hand and entered his canoe with one great stroke he drove it out and into the flood then headed away towards the mists and colors of the distant hills where the oreads were calling to him he turned for one last look and flung his paddle high then fearing lest they might see the tears that came at last unhindered he began to sing chante rossignol chante toi qui a le coeur gai tu as le coeur a rire mai j l aita pleurer he sang long and lustily keeping time to the dip of his flashing paddle and defying his bursting heart after all was he not a voyageur and life but a song and a tear and then a dream or two i wish i might have known him better sighed meade burrell as he watched the receding form of the boatman you would have loved him as we do said necia and you would have missed him as we will i hope some time he will be happy as happy as you my soldier yes but that he can never be said her husband for no man could love as i love you yours is a heart that laughter cheers mine is a heart thats full of tears long have i loved i love her yet leave her i can but not forget came the voice of the singer far down the stream and thus poleon of the great heart went away the end
