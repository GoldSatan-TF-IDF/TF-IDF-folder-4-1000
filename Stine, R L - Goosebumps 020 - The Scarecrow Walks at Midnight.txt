hey jodie wait up i turned and squinted into the bright sunlight my brother mark was still on the concrete train platform the train had clattered off i could see it snaking its way through the low green meadows in the distance i turned to stanley stanley is the hired man on my grandparents farm he stood beside me carrying both suitcases look in the dictionary for the word slowpoke i said and youll see marks picture stanley smiled at me i like the dictionary jodie he said sometimes i read it for hours hey mark get a move on i cried but he was taking his good time walking slowly in a daze as usual i tossed my blond hair behind my shoulders and turned back to stanley mark and i hadnt visited the farm for a year but stanley still looked the same hes so skinny like a noodle my grandma always says his denim overalls always look five sizes too big on him stanley is about forty or fortyfive i think he wears his dark hair in a crewcut shaved close to his head his ears are huge they stick way out and are always bright red and he has big round brown eyes that remind me of puppy eyes stanley isnt very smart grandpa kurt always says that stanley isnt working with a full one hundred watts but mark and i really like him he has a quiet sense of humor and he is kind and gentle and friendly and always has lots of amazing things to show us whenever we visit the farm you look nice jodie stanley said his cheeks turning as red as his ears how old are you now twelve i told him and mark is eleven he thought about it that makes twentythree he joked we both laughed you never know what stanley is going to say i think i stepped in something gross mark complained catching up to us i always know what mark is going to say my brother only knows three words cool weird and gross really thats his whole vocabulary as a joke i gave him a dictionary for his last birthday youre weird mark said when i handed it to him what a gross gift he scraped his white hightops on the ground as we followed stanley to the beatup red pickup truck carry my backpack for me mark said trying to shove the bulging backpack at me no way i told him carry it yourself the backpack contained his walkman about thirty tapes comic books his game boy and at least fifty game cartridges i knew he planned to spend the whole month lying on the hammock on the screenedin back porch of the farmhouse listening to music and playing video games well no way mom and dad said it was my job to make sure mark got outside and enjoyed the farm we were so cooped up in the city all year thats why they sent us to visit grandpa kurt and grandma miriam for a month each summer to enjoy the great outdoors we stopped beside the truck while stanley searched his overall pockets for the key its going to get pretty hot today stanley said unless it cools down a typical stanley weather report i gazed out at the wide grassy field beyond the small train station parking lot thousands of tiny white puffballs floated up against the clear blue sky it was so beautiful naturally i sneezed i love visiting my grandparents farm my only problem is im allergic to just about everything on it so mom packs several bottles of my allergy medicine for me and lots of tissues gesundheit stanley said he tossed our two suitcases in the back of the pickup mark slid his backpack in too can i ride in back he asked he loves to lie flat in the back staring up at the sky and bumping up and down really hard stanley is a terrible driver he cant seem to concentrate on steering and driving at the right speed at the same time so there are always lots of quick turns and heavy bumps mark lifted himself into the back of the pickup and stretched out next to the suitcases i climbed beside stanley in the front a short while later we were bouncing along the narrow twisting road that led to the farm i stared out the dusty window at the passing meadows and farmhouses everything looked so green and alive stanley drove with both hands wrapped tightly around the top of the steering wheel he sat forward stiffly leaning over the wheel staring straight ahead through the windshield without blinking mr mortimer doesnt farm his place anymore he said lifting one hand from the wheel to point to a big white farmhouse on top of a sloping green hill why not i asked because he died stanley replied solemnly see what i mean you never know what stanley is going to say we bounced over a deep rut in the road i was sure mark was having a great time in back the road leads through the small town so small that it doesnt even have a name the farmers have always called it town it has a feed store a combination gas station and grocery store a whitesteepled church a hardware store and a mailbox there were two trucks parked in front of the feed store i didnt see anyone as we barreled past my grandparents farm is about two miles from town i recognized the cornfields as we approached the corn is so high already i exclaimed staring through the bouncing window have you eaten any yet just at dinner stanley replied suddenly he slowed the truck and turned his eyes to me the scarecrow walks at midnight he uttered in a low voice huh i wasnt sure id heard correctly the scarecrow walks at midnight he repeated training his big puppy eyes on me i read it in the book i didnt know what to say so i laughed i thought maybe he was making a joke days later i realized it was no joke watching the farm spread out in front of us filled me with happiness its not a big farm or a fancy farm but i like everything about it i like the barn with its sweet smells i like the low mooing sounds of the cows way off in the far pasture i like to watch the tall stalks of corn all swaying together in the wind corny huh i also like the scary ghost stories grandpa kurt tells us at night in front of the fireplace and i have to include grandma miriams chocolate chip pancakes theyre so good i sometimes dream about them back home in the city i also like the happy expressions on my grandparents faces when we come rushing up to greet them of course i was the first one out of the truck mark was as slow as usual i went running up to the screen porch in back of their big old farmhouse i couldnt wait to see my grandparents grandma miriam came waddling out her arms outstretched the screen door slammed behind her but then i saw grandpa kurt push it open and he hurried out too his limp was worse i noticed right away he leaned heavily on a white cane hed never needed one before i didnt have time to think about it as mark and i were smothered in hugs so good to see you its been so long so long grandma miriam cried happily there were the usual comments about how much taller we were and how grown up we looked jodie whered you get that blond hair there arent any blonds in my family grandpa kurt would say shaking his mane of white hair you must get that from your fathers side no i know i bet you got it from a store he said grinning it was his little joke he greeted me with it every summer and his blue eyes would sparkle excitedly youre right its a wig i told him laughing he gave my long blond hair a playful tug did you get cable yet mark asked dragging his backpack along the ground cable tv grandpa kurt stared hard at mark not yet but we still get three channels how many more do we need mark rolled his eyes no mtv he groaned stanley made his way past us carrying our suitcases into the house lets go in ill bet youre starving grandma miriam said i made soup and sandwiches well have chicken and corn tonight the corn is very sweet this year i know how you two love it i watched my grandparents as they led the way to the house they both looked older to me they moved more slowly than i remembered grandpa kurts limp was definitely worse they both seemed tired grandma miriam is short and chubby she has a round face surrounded by curly red hair bright red theres no way to describe the color i dont know what she uses to dye it that color ive never seen it on anyone else she wears squareshaped eyeglasses that give her a really oldfashioned look she likes big roomy housedresses i dont think ive ever seen her in jeans or pants grandpa kurt is tall and broadshouldered mom says he was really handsome when he was young like a movie star she always tells me now he has wavy white hair still very thick that he wets and slicks down flat on his head he has sparkling blue eyes that always make me smile and a white stubble over his slender face grandpa kurt doesnt like to shave today he was wearing a longsleeved redandgreenplaid shirt buttoned to the collar despite the hot day and baggy jeans stained at one knee held up by white suspenders lunch was fun we sat around the long kitchen table sunlight poured in through the big window i could see the barn in back and the cornfields stretching behind it mark and i told all our news about school about my basketball team going to the championships about our new car about dad growing a mustache for some reason stanley thought that was very funny he was laughing so hard he choked on his splitpea soup and grandpa kurt had to reach over and slap him on the back its hard to know what will crack stanley up as mark would say stanley is definitely weird all through lunch i kept staring at my grandparents i couldnt get over how much they had changed in one year they seemed so much quieter so much slower thats what it means to get older i told myself stanley will have to show you his scarecrows grandma miriam said passing the bowl of potato chips wont you stanley grandpa kurt cleared his throat loudly i had the feeling he was telling grandma miriam to change the subject or something i made them stanley said grinning proudly he turned his big eyes on me the book it told me how are you still taking guitar lessons grandpa kurt asked mark i could see that for some reason grandpa kurt didnt want to talk about stanleys scarecrows yeah mark answered with a mouthful of potato chips but i sold my acoustic i switched to electric you mean you have to plug it in stanley asked he started to giggle as if he had just cracked a funny joke what a shame you didnt bring your guitar grandma miriam said to mark no it isnt i teased the cows would start giving sour milk shut up jodie mark snapped he has no sense of humor they already do give sour milk grandpa kurt muttered lowering his eyes bad luck when cows give sour milk it means bad luck stanley declared his eyes widening his expression suddenly fearful its okay stanley grandma miriam assured him quickly placing a hand gently on his shoulder grandpa kurt was only teasing if you kids are finished why not go with stanley grandpa kurt said hell give you a tour of the farm you always enjoy that he sighed id go along but my leg its been acting up again grandma miriam started to clear the dishes mark and i followed stanley out the back door the grass in the back yard had recently been mowed the air was heavy with its sweet smell i saw a hummingbird fluttering over the flower garden beside the house i pointed it out to mark but by the time he turned it had hummed away at the back of the long green yard stood the old barn its white walls were badly stained and peeling it really needed a paint job the doors were open and i could see square bales of straw inside far to the right of the barn almost to the cornfields stood the small guest house where stanley lived with his teenage son sticks stanley wheres sticks i asked why wasnt he at lunch went to town stanley answered quietly went to town riding on a pony mark and i exchanged glances we never can figure stanley out poking up from the cornfield stood several dark figures the scarecrows grandma miriam had started to talk about i stared out at them shielding my eyes from the sun with one hand so many scarecrows i exclaimed stanley last summer there was only one why are there so many now he didnt reply he didnt seem to hear me he had a black baseball cap pulled down low over his forehead he was taking long strides leaning forward with that storklike walk of his his hands shoved into the pockets of his baggy denim overalls weve seen the farm a hundred times mark complained whispering to me why do we have to take the grand tour again mark cool your jets i told him we always take a tour of the farm its a tradition mark grumbled to himself he really is lazy he never wants to do anything stanley led the way past the barn into the cornfields the stalks were way over my head their golden tassels gleamed in the bright sunlight stanley reached up and pulled an ear off the stalk lets see if its ready he said grinning at mark and me he held the ear in his left hand and started to shuck it with his right after a few seconds he pulled the husk away revealing the ear of corn inside i stared at it and let out a horrified cry ohhhh its disgusting i shrieked gross i heard mark groan the corn was a disgusting brown color and it was moving on the cob wriggling squirming stanley raised the corn to his face to examine it and i realized it was covered with worms hundreds of wriggling brown worms no stanley cried in horror he let the ear of corn drop to the ground at his feet thats bad luck the book says so thats very bad luck i stared down at the ear of corn the worms were wriggling off the cob onto the dirt its okay stanley i told him i only screamed because i was surprised this happens sometimes sometimes worms get into the corn grandpa told me no its bad stanley insisted in a trembling voice his red ears were aflame his big eyes revealed his fear the book it says so what book mark demanded he kicked the wormy ear of corn away with the toe of his hightop my book stanley replied mysteriously my superstition book uhoh i thought stanley shouldnt have a book about superstitions he was already the most superstitious person in the world even without a book youve been reading a book about superstitions mark asked him watching the brown worms crawl over the soft dirt yes stanley nodded his head enthusiastically its a good book it tells me everything and its all true all of it he pulled off his cap and scratched his stubby hair ive got to check the book ive got to see what to do about the corn the bad corn he was getting pretty worked up it was making me feel a little scared ive known stanley my whole life i think hes worked for grandpa kurt for more than twenty years hes always been strange but ive never seen him get so upset about something as unimportant as a bad ear of corn show us the scarecrows i said trying to get his mind off the corn yeah lets see them mark joined in okay the scarecrows stanley nodded then he turned still thinking hard and began leading the way through the tall rows of cornstalks the stalks creaked and groaned as we passed by them it was kind of an eerie sound suddenly a shadow fell over me one of the dark scarecrows rose up in front of us it wore a tattered black coat stuffed with straw its arms stretched stiffly out at its sides the scarecrow was tall towering over my head tall enough to stand over the high cornstalks its head was a faded burlap bag filled with straw evil black eyes and a menacing frown had been painted on thickly in black paint a battered oldfashioned hat rested on its head you made these i asked stanley i could see several other scarecrows poking up from the corn they all stood in the same stiff position they all had the same menacing frown he stared up the scarecrows face i made them he said in a low voice the book showed me how theyre pretty scary looking mark said standing close beside me he grabbed the scarecrows straw hand and shook it whats up mark asked it the scarecrow walks at midnight stanley said repeating the phrase he had used at the train station mark was trying to slap the scarecrow a highfive what does that mean i asked stanley the book told me how stanley replied keeping his eyes on the darkpainted face on the burlap bag the book told me how to make them walk huh you mean you make the scarecrows walk i asked very confused stanleys dark eyes locked on mine once again he got that very solemn expression on his face i know how to do it the book has all the words i stared back at him totally confused i didnt know what to say i made them walk jodie stanley continued in a voice just above a whisper i made them walk last week and now im the boss huh the boss of the sscarecrows i stammered do you mean i stopped when out of the corner of my eye i saw the scarecrows arm move the straw crinkled as the arm slid up then i felt rough straw brush against my face as the dry scarecrow arm moved to my throat the prickly straw poking out of the sleeve of the black coat scraped against my neck i let out a shrill scream its alive i cried in panic diving to the ground scrambling away on all fours i turned back to see mark and stanley calmly watching me hadnt they seen the scarecrow try to choke me then stanleys son sticks stepped out from behind the scarecrow a gleeful grin on his face sticks you creep i cried angrily i knew at once that he had moved the scarecrows arm you city kids sure scare easy sticks said his grin growing wider he reached down to help me to my feet you really thought the scarecrow moved didnt you jodie he said accusingly i can make the scarecrows move stanley said pulling the cap down lower on his forehead i can make them walk i did it its all in the book stickss smile faded the light seemed to dim from his dark eyes yeah sure dad he murmured sticks is sixteen he is tall and lanky he has long skinny arms and legs thats how he got the nickname sticks he tries to look tough he has long black hair down past his collar which he seldom washes he wears tight muscle shirts and dirty jeans ripped at the knees he sneers a lot and his dark eyes always seem to be laughing at you he calls mark and me the city kids he always says it with a sneer and hes always playing stupid jokes on us i think hes kind of jealous of mark and me i dont think its been easy for sticks to grow up on the farm living in the little guest house with his dad i mean stanley is more like a kid than a father i saw you back there mark told sticks well thanks for warning me i snapped at mark i turned back angrily to sticks i see you havent changed at all great to see you too jodie he replied sarcastically the city kids are back for another month with the hicks sticks whats your problem i shot back be nice stanley muttered the corn has ears you know we all stared at stanley had he just made a joke it was hard to tell with him stanleys face remained serious his big eyes stared out at me through the shade of his cap the corn has ears he repeated there are spirits in the field sticks shook his head unhappily dad you spend too much time with that superstition book he muttered the book is all true stanley replied its all true sticks kicked at the dirt he raised his eyes to me his expression seemed very sad things are different here he murmured huh i didnt understand what do you mean sticks turned to his father stanley was staring back at him his eyes narrowed sticks shrugged and didnt reply he grabbed marks arm and squeezed it youre as flabby as ever he told mark want to throw a football around this afternoon its kind of hot mark replied he wiped the sweat off his forehead with the back of his hand sticks sneered at him still a wimp huh no way mark protested i just said it was hot thats all hey youve got something on your back sticks told mark turn around mark obediently turned around sticks quickly bent down picked up the wormy corncob and stuffed it down the back of marks tshirt i had to laugh as i watched my brother run screaming all the way back to the farmhouse dinner was quiet grandma miriams fried chicken was as tasty as ever and she was right about the corn it was very sweet mark and i each ate two ears dripping with butter i enjoyed the dinner but it upset me that both of my grandparents seemed so changed grandpa kurt used to talk nonstop he always had dozens of funny stories about the farmers in the area and he always had new jokes to tell tonight he barely said a word grandma miriam kept urging mark and me to eat more and she kept asking us how we liked everything but she too seemed quieter they both seemed tense uncomfortable they both kept glancing down the table at stanley who was eating with both hands butter dripping down his chin sticks sat glumly across from his father he seemed even more unfriendly than usual stanley was the only cheerful person at the table he chewed his chicken enthusiastically and asked for a third helping of mashed potatoes is everything okay stanley grandma miriam kept asking biting her bottom lip everything okay stanley burped and smiled not bad was his reply why do things seem so different i wondered is it just because grandma and grandpa are getting old after dinner we sat around the big comfortable living room grandpa kurt rocked gently back and forth in the antique wooden rocking chair by the fireplace it was too hot to build a fire but as he rocked he stared into the dark fireplace a thoughtful expression on his whitestubbled face grandma miriam sat in her favorite chair a big green overstuffed armchair across from grandpa kurt she had an unopened gardening magazine in her lap sticks who had barely said two words the whole evening disappeared stanley leaned against the wall poking his teeth with a toothpick mark sank down into the long green couch i sat down at the other end of it and stared across the room yuck that stuffed bear still gives me the creeps i exclaimed at the far end of the room an enormous stuffed brown bear about eight feet tall stood straight up on its hind legs grandpa kurt had shot it many years ago on a hunting trip the bears huge paws were extended as if ready to pounce that was a killer bear grandpa kurt remembered rocking slowly his eyes on the angrylooking beast he mauled two hunters before i shot him i saved their lives i shuddered and turned away from the bear i really hated it i dont know why grandma miriam let grandpa kurt keep it in the living room how about a scary story i asked grandpa kurt he stared back at me his blue eyes suddenly lifeless and dull yeah weve been looking forward to your stories mark chimed in tell us the one about the headless boy in the closet no tell a new one i insisted eagerly grandpa kurt rubbed his chin slowly his eyes went to stanley across the room then he cleared his throat nervously im kind of tired kids he said softly think ill just go to bed but no story i protested he stared back at me with those dull eyes i dont really know any stories he murmured he slowly climbed to his feet and headed toward his room what is going on here i asked myself what is wrong upstairs in my bedroom later that night i changed into a long nightshirt the bedroom window was open and a soft breeze invaded the room i stared out the open window a broad apple tree cast its shadow over the lawn where the grass ended the cornfields stretched out under the glow of the full moon the pale moonlight made the tall stalks shimmer like gold the stalks cast long blue shadows over the field across the wide field the scarecrows poked up stiffly like darkuniformed soldiers their coat sleeves ruffled in the light breeze their pale burlap faces seemed to stare back at me i felt a cold chill run down my back so many scarecrows at least a dozen of them standing in straight rows like an army ready to march the scarecrow walks at midnight thats what stanley had said in that low frightening tone i had never heard him use before i glanced at the clock on the bed table just past ten oclock ill be asleep by the time they walk i thought a crazy thought i sneezed it seems im allergic to the farm air both day and night i stared at the long shadows cast by the scarecrows a gust of wind bent the stalks making the shadows roll forward like a dark ocean wave and then i saw the scarecrows start to twitch mark i screamed mark come here hurry under the light of the full moon i stared in horror as the dark scarecrows started to move their arms jerked their burlap heads lurched forward all of them in unison all of the scarecrows were jerking twitching straining as if struggling to pull free of their stakes mark hurry i screamed i heard footsteps clomping rapidly down the hall mark burst breathlessly into my room jodie what is it he cried i motioned frantically for him to come to the window as he stepped beside me i pointed to the cornfields look the scarecrows he gripped the windowsill and leaned out the window over his shoulder i could see the scarecrows twitch in unison a cold shudder made me wrap my arms around myself its the wind mark said stepping back from the window whats your problem jodie its just the wind blowing them around you youre wrong mark i stammered still hugging myself look again he rolled his eyes and sighed but he turned back and leaned out the window he gazed out at the field for a long time dont you see i demanded shrilly theyre all moving together their arms their heads all moving together when mark pulled back from the window his blue eyes were wide and fearful he stared at me thoughtfully and didnt say a word finally he swallowed hard and his voice came out low and frightened weve got to tell grandpa kurt he said we rushed downstairs but our grandparents had gone to bed the bedroom door was closed it was silent on the other side maybe wed better wait till tomorrow morning i whispered as mark and i tiptoed back upstairs to our rooms i think well be safe till then we crept back to our rooms i pushed the window shut and locked it out in the fields the scarecrows were still twitching still pulling at their stakes with a shudder i turned away from the window and plunged into the bed pulling the old quilt up over my head i slept restlessly tossing under the heavy quilt in the morning i jumped eagerly from bed i ran a brush through my hair and hurried down to breakfast mark was right behind me on the stairs he was wearing the same jeans as yesterday and a redandblack nirvana tshirt he hadnt bothered to brush his hair it stood straight up in back pancakes he managed to choke out mark is only good for one word at a time this early in the morning but the word instantly cheered me up and made me forget for a moment about the creepy scarecrows how could i have forgotten about grandma miriams amazing chocolate chip pancakes they are so soft they really do melt in your mouth and the warm chocolate mixed with the sweet maple syrup makes the most delicious breakfast ive ever eaten as we hurried across the living room toward the kitchen i sniffed the air hoping to smell that wonderful aroma of pancake batter on the stove but my nose was too stuffed up to smell anything mark and i burst into the kitchen at the same time grandpa kurt and stanley were already at the table a big blue pot of coffee stood steaming in front of them stanley sipped his coffee grandpa kurt had his face buried behind the morning newspaper he glanced up and smiled as mark and i entered everyone said good morning to everyone mark and i took our places at the table we were so eager for the famous pancakes we were practically rubbing our hands together the way cartoon characters do imagine our shock when grandma miriam set down big bowls of cornflakes in front of us i practically burst into tears i glanced across the table at mark he was staring back at me his face revealing his surprise and disappointment cornflakes he asked in a highpitched voice grandma miriam had gone back to the sink i turned to her grandma miriam no pancakes i asked meekly i saw her glance at stanley ive stopped making them jodie she replied her eyes still on stanley pancakes are too fattening nothing like a good bowl of cornflakes in the morning stanley said with a big smile he reached for the cornflakes box in the center of the table and filled his bowl up with a second helping grandpa kurt grunted behind his newspaper go ahead eat them before they get soggy grandma miriam urged from the sink mark and i just stared at each other last summer grandma miriam had made us a big stack of chocolate chip pancakes almost every morning what is going on here i wondered once again i suddenly remembered sticks out in the cornfields the day before whispering to me things are different here they sure were different and not for the better i decided my stomach grumbled i picked up the spoon and started to eat my cornflakes i saw mark glumly spooning his and then i suddenly remembered the twitching scarecrows grandpa kurt i started last night mark and i we were looking out at the cornfields and we saw the scarecrows they were moving we i heard grandma miriam utter a low gasp from behind me grandpa kurt lowered his newspaper he narrowed his eyes at me but didnt say a word the scarecrows were moving mark chimed in stanley chuckled it was the wind he said his eyes on grandpa kurt it had to be the wind blowing them around grandpa kurt glared at stanley you sure he demanded yeah it was the wind stanley replied tensely but they were trying to get off their poles i cried we saw them grandpa kurt stared hard at stanley stanleys ears turned bright red he lowered his eyes it was a breezy night he said they move in the wind its going to be a sunny day grandma miriam said brightly from the sink but the scarecrows mark insisted yep looks like a real pretty day grandpa kurt mumbled ignoring mark he doesnt want to talk about the scarecrows i realized is it because he doesnt believe us grandpa kurt turned to stanley after you take the cows to pasture maybe you and jodie and mark can do some fishing at the creek maybe stanley replied studying the cornflakes box maybe we could just do that sounds like fun mark said mark likes fishing its one of his favorite sports because you dont have to move too much theres a really pretty creek behind the cow pasture at the far end of grandpa kurts property its very woodsy back there and the narrow creek trickles softly beneath the old shade trees and is usually filled with fish finishing my cereal i turned to grandma miriam at the sink and what are you doing today i asked her maybe you and i could spend some time together and i stopped as she turned toward me and her hand came into view ohhhh i let out a frightened moan when i saw her hand it it was made of straw jodie whats the matter grandma miriam asked i started to point to her hand then it came into sharp focus and i saw that her hand wasnt straw she was holding a broom she had gripped it by the handle and was pulling lint off the ends of the straw nothings wrong i told her feeling like a total jerk i rubbed my eyes ive got to take my allergy medicine i told her my eyes are so watery i keep seeing things i was seeing scarecrows everywhere i looked i scolded myself for acting so crazy stop thinking about scarecrows i told myself stanley was right the scarecrows had moved in the wind last night it was just the wind stanley took us fishing later that morning as we started off for the creek he seemed in a really cheerful mood he smiled as he swung the big picnic basket grandma miriam had packed for our lunch she put in all my favorites stanley said happily he patted the basket with childish satisfaction he had three bamboo fishing poles tucked under his left arm he carried the big straw basket in his right hand he refused to let mark and me carry anything the warm air smelled sweet the sun beamed down in a cloudless blue sky blades of recently cut grass stuck to my white sneakers as we headed across the back yard the medicine had helped my eyes were much better stanley turned just past the barn and began walking quickly along its back wall his expression turned solemn he appeared to be concentrating hard on something hey where are we going i called hurrying to keep up with him he didnt seem to hear me taking long strides swinging the straw picnic basket as he walked he headed back in the direction we started from hey wait up mark called breathlessly my brother hates to hurry when he can take his time stanley wait i cried tugging his shirtsleeve were going around in circles he nodded his expression serious under the black baseball cap we have to circle the barn three times he said in a low voice huh why i demanded we started our second turn around the barn it will bring us good luck with our fishing stanley replied then he added its in the book everything is in the book i opened my mouth to tell him this was really silly but i decided not to he seemed so serious about that superstition book of his i didnt want to spoil it for him besides mark and i could use the exercise a short while later we finished circling and started walking along the dirt path that led past the cornfields to the creek stanleys smile returned immediately he really believes the superstitions in the book i realized i wondered if sticks believed them too wheres sticks i asked kicking a big clump of dirt across the path doing chores stanley replied sticks is a good worker a real good worker but hell be along soon i bet sticks never likes to miss out on a fishing trip the sun began to feel really strong on my face and on my shoulders i wondered if i should run back and get some sunblock the darksuited scarecrows appeared to stare at me as we walked past the tall rows of cornstalks i could swear their pale painted faces turned to follow me as i went by and did one of them lift its arm to wave a straw hand at me i scolded myself for such stupid thoughts and turned my eyes away stop thinking about scarecrows jodie i told myself forget your bad dream forget about the dumb scarecrows its a beautiful day and you have nothing to worry about try to relax and have a good time the path led into tall pine woods behind the cornfields it got shady and much cooler as soon as we stepped into the woods cant we take a taxi the rest of the way mark whined a typical mark joke he really would take a taxi if there was one stanley shook his head city kids he muttered grinning the path ended and we continued through the trees it smelled so piney and fresh in the woods i saw a tiny brownandwhite chipmunk dart into a hollow log in the near distance i could hear the musical trickle of the creek suddenly stanley stopped he bent and picked up a pinecone the three fishing poles fell to the ground he didnt seem to notice he held the pinecone close to his face studying it a pinecone on the shady side means a long winter he said turning the dry cone in his hand mark and i bent to pick up the poles is that what the book says mark asked stanley nodded he set the pinecone down carefully where he found it the cone is still sticky thats a good sign he said seriously mark let out a giggle i knew he was trying not to laugh at stanley but the giggle escaped somehow stanleys big brown eyes filled with hurt its all true mark he said quietly its all true i id like to read that book mark said glancing at me its a very hard book stanley replied i have trouble with some of the words i can hear the creek i broke in changing the subject lets go i want to catch some fish before lunchtime the clear water felt cold against my legs the smooth rocks of the creek bed were slippery under my bare feet all three of us had waded into the shallow creek mark had wanted to lie down on the grassy shore to fish but i convinced him it was much more fun and much easier to catch something if you stand in the water yeah ill catch something he grumbled as he rolled up the cuffs of his jeans ill catch pneumonia stanley let out a loud laugh it sounded like har har har he set the big picnic basket down carefully on the dry grass then he rolled up the legs of his denim overalls carrying a pole high in one hand he stepped into the water ooooh its cold he cried waving his arms above his head nearly losing his balance on the slippery rocks stanley didnt you forget something i called to him he turned confused his big ears became bright red what did i forget jodie i pointed to his fishing pole how about some bait i called he glanced at the empty hook on the end of his line then he made his way back to shore to get a worm to bait his hook a few minutes later all three of us were in the water mark complained at first about how cold it was and about how the rocks on the bottom hurt his delicate little feet but after a while he got into it too the creek at this point was only about two feet deep the water was very clear and trickled rapidly making little swirls and dips over the rocky bottom i lowered my line into the water and watched the red plastic float bob on the surface if it started to sink id know i had a bite the sun felt warm on my face the cool water flowed past pleasantly i wish it were deep enough to swim here i thought hey ive got something mark cried excitedly stanley and i turned and watched him tug up his line mark pulled with all his might it its a big one i think he said finally he gave one last really hard tug and pulled up a thick clump of green weeds good one mark i said rolling my eyes its a big one all right youre a big one mark shot back a big jerk dont be such a baby i muttered i brushed away a buzzing horsefly and tried to concentrate on my line but my mind started to wander it always does when im fishing i found myself thinking about the tall scarecrows in the field they stood so darkly so menacingly so alert their painted faces all had the same hard stare i was still picturing them when i felt the hand slip around my ankle the straw scarecrow hand it reached up from the water circled my ankle and started to tighten its cold wet grip around my leg i screamed and tried to kick the hand away but my feet slipped on the smooth rocks my hands shot up as i toppled backwards ohh i cried out again as i hit the water the scarecrow hung on on my back the water rushing over me i kicked and thrashed my arms and then i saw it the clump of green weeds that had wrapped itself around my ankle oh no i moaned out loud no scarecrow only weeds i lowered my foot to the water i didnt move i just lay there on my back waiting for my heart to stop pounding feeling once again like a total jerk i glanced up at mark and stanley they were staring down at me too startled to laugh dont say a word i warned them struggling to my feet im warning you dont say a word mark snickered but he obediently didnt say anything i didnt bring a towel stanley said with concern im sorry jodie i didnt know you wanted to swim that made mark burst out in loud guffaws i shot mark a warning stare my tshirt and shorts were soaked i started to shore carrying the pole awkwardly in front of me i dont need a towel i told stanley it feels good very refreshing you scared away all the fish jodie mark complained no you scared them away they saw your face i replied i knew i was acting like a baby now but i didnt care i was cold and wet and angry i stomped onto the shore shaking water from my hair i think theyre biting better down here i heard stanley call to mark i turned to see him disappear around a curve of the creek stepping carefully over the rocks mark followed after him they were both hidden from view behind the thick trees i squeezed my hair trying to get the creek water out finally i gave up and tossed my hair behind my shoulder i was debating what to do next when i heard a crackling sound in the woods a footstep i turned and stared into the trees i didnt see anyone another chipmunk scurried away over the blanket of dead brown leaves had someone or something frightened the chipmunk i listened hard another crackling footstep rustling sounds who whos there i called the low bushes rustled in reply sticks is that you sticks my voice trembled no reply it has to be sticks i told myself this is grandpa kurts property no one else would be back here sticks stop trying to scare me i shouted angrily no reply another footstep the crack of a twig more rustling sounds closer now sticks i know its you i called uncertainly im really tired of your dumb tricks sticks my eyes stared straight ahead into the trees i listened silence now heavy silence and then i raised my hand to my mouth as i saw the dark figure poke out from the shade of two tall pines sticks i squinted into the deep blue shadows i saw the bulging dark coat the faded burlap head the dark fedora hat tilted over the black painted eyes i saw the straw poking out under the jacket the straw sticking out from the long jacket sleeves a scarecrow a scarecrow that had followed us followed us to the creek squinting hard into the shadows staring at its evil frozen grin i opened my mouth to scream but no sound came out and then a hand grabbed my shoulder ohh i let out a cry and spun around stanley stared at me with concern he and mark had come up behind me jodie whats the matter stanley asked mark and i we thought we heard you calling whats up mark asked casually the line on his fishing pole had become tangled and he was working to untangle it did you see a squirrel or something no i i my heart was pounding so hard i could barely speak cool your jets jodie mark said imitating me i saw a scarecrow i finally managed to scream stanleys mouth dropped open mark narrowed his eyes suspiciously at me a scarecrow here in the woods it it was walking i stammered i heard it i heard it walking a choking sound escaped stanleys open mouth mark continued to stare at me his features tight with fear its over there i cried right there look i pointed but it was gone stanley stared hard at me his big brown eyes tilled with confusion i saw it i insisted between those two trees i pointed again you did a scarecrow really stanley asked i could see he was really starting to get scared well maybe it was just the shadows i said i didnt want to frighten stanley i shivered im soaked ive got to get back in the sunlight i told them but did you see it stanley asked his big eyes locked on mine did you see a scarecrow here jodie i i dont think so stanley i replied trying to calm him down im sorry this is very bad he murmured talking to himself this is very bad i have to read the book this is very bad then muttering to himself he turned and ran stanley stop i called stanley come back dont leave us down here but he was gone vanished into the woods im going after him i told mark and then im going to tell grandpa kurt about this can you carry back the fishing poles by yourself do i have to mark whined my brother is so lazy i told him he had to then i went running along the path through the woods toward the farmhouse my heart pounded as i reached the cornfields the darkcoated scarecrows appeared to stare at me as my sneakers thudded on the narrow dirt path i imagined the straw arms reaching for me reaching to grab me and pull me into the corn but the scarecrows kept their silent still watch over the cornstalks they didnt move or twitch as i hurtled past up ahead i saw stanley running to his little house i cupped my hands over my mouth and called to him but he disappeared inside i decided to find grandpa kurt and tell him about the scarecrow i saw moving through the woods the barn door was open and i thought i saw someone moving around inside grandpa kurt i called breathlessly are you in there my wet hair bounced on my shoulders as i ran into the barn i stood in the rectangle of light that stretched from the doorway and stared into the darkness grandpa kurt i called struggling to catch my breath my eyes slowly adjusted to the dim light i stepped deeper into the barn grandpa kurt are you here hearing a soft scraping sound against the far wall i made my way toward it grandpa kurt can i talk to you i really need to talk to you my voice sounded tiny and frightened in the big dark barn my sneakers scraped over the dry straw floor as i walked toward the back i spun around as i heard a rumbling sound the light grew dimmer hey i shouted too late the barn door was sliding shut hey whos there i cried out in stunned anger hey stop i slipped over the straw as i started to lurch toward the sliding door i fell down hard but quickly scrambled to my feet i darted toward the door but i wasnt fast enough as the heavy door rumbled shut the rectangle of light grew narrower narrower the door slammed with a deafening bang the darkness slid around me circled me covered me hey let me out i screamed let me out of here my scream ended in a choked sob my breath escaped in noisy gasps i pounded on the wooden barn door with both fists then i frantically swept my hands over the door searching blindly for a latch for something to pull some way to open the door when i couldnt find anything i pounded on the door until my fists hurt then i stopped and took a step back calm down jodie i told myself calm down youll get out of the barn youll find a way out its not like youre trapped in here forever i tried to force away my panic i held my breath waiting for my heart to stop racing then i let my breath out slowly slooooowly i was just starting to feel a little better when i heard the scraping sound a dry scraping the sound of a shoe crunching over straw oh i let out a sharp cry then raised both hands to my face and listened scrape scrape scrape the sound of footsteps slow steady footsteps so light on the barn floor footsteps coming toward me in the darkness who whos there i choked out my voice a hushed whisper no reply scrape scrape scrape the soft scratchy footsteps came closer who is it i cried shrilly no reply i stared into the darkness i couldnt see a thing scrape scrape whoever or whatever was moving steadily toward me i took a step back then another i tried to cry out but my throat was choked with fear i let out a terrified gasp as i backed into something in my panic it took me a few seconds to realize that it was only a wooden ladder the ladder that led up to the hayloft the footsteps crunched closer closer please i uttered in a tiny choked voice please dont closer closer scraping toward me through the heavy darkness i gripped the sides of the ladder please leave me alone before i realized what i was doing i was pulling myself up the ladder my arms trembled and my legs felt as if they each weighed a thousand pounds but i scrambled rung by rung toward the hayloft away from the frightening scraping footsteps down below when i reached the top i lay flat on the hayloft floor i struggled to listen to hear the footsteps over the loud pounding of my heart was i being followed was the thing chasing me up the ladder i held my breath i listened scrabbling sounds scraping footsteps go away i screamed frantically whoever you are go away but the sounds continued dry and scratchy like straw brushing against straw scrambling to my knees i turned to the small square hayloft window sunlight filtered in through the window the light made the hay strewn over the floor gleam like slender strands of gold my heart still pounding i crawled to the window yes the heavy rope was still tied to the side the rope that mark and i always used to swing down to the ground i can get out of here i told myself happily i can grab the rope and swing out of the hayloft i can escape eagerly i grabbed the rope with both hands then i poked my head out the window and gazed down to the ground and let out a scream of surprise and horror gazing down i saw a black hat beneath it a black coat a scarecrow perched outside the barn door as if standing guard it jerked its arms and legs at the sound of my scream and as i stared in disbelief it hurried around the side of the barn hobbling on its straw legs its arms flapping at its sides i blinked several times was i seeing things my hands were cold and wet i gripped the rope more tightly taking a deep breath i plunged out of the small square window the heavy rope swung out over the front of the barn down down i hit the ground hard landing on my feet ow i cried out as the rope cut my hands i let go and ran around to the side of the barn i wanted to catch up to that scarecrow i wanted to see if it really was a scarecrow a scarecrow that could run ignoring my fear i ran as fast as i could no sign of him on this side of the barn my chest began to ache my temples throbbed i turned the corner and headed around the back of the barn searching for the fleeing scarecrow and ran right into sticks hey we both shouted in surprise as we collided i frantically untangled myself from him staring past him i saw that the scarecrow had vanished whats the hurry sticks demanded you practically ran me over he was wearing faded denim jeans slashed at both knees and a faded purple muscle shirt that only showed off how skinny he was his black hair was tied back in a short ponytail a a scarecrow i stammered and then that instant i knew in that instant i solved the whole mystery of the scarecrows it hadnt been a scarecrow it was sticks in the woods down by the creek and now outside the barn sticks playing another one of his mean tricks and i was suddenly certain that sticks had somehow made the scarecrows twitch and pull on their stakes last night sticks just loved fooling the city kids ever since mark and i had been little hed played the scariest meanest practical jokes on us sometimes sticks could be a nice guy but he had a real cruel streak i thought you were fishing he said casually well im not i snapped sticks why do you keep trying to scare us huh he pretended he didnt know what i was talking about sticks give me a break i muttered i know you were the scarecrow just now im not stupid scarecrow what scarecrow he asked giving me a wideeyed innocent expression you were dressed as a scarecrow i accused him or else you carried one here and pulled it on a string or something youre totally crazy sticks replied angrily have you been out in the sun too long or something sticks give up i said why are you doing this why do you keep trying to scare mark and me you scared your dad too jodie youre nuts he exclaimed i really dont have time to be dressing up in costumes just to amuse you and your brother sticks youre not fooling me i insisted you i stopped short when i saw stickss expression change dad he cried suddenly frightened dad you say he was scared i nodded ive got to find him sticks exclaimed frantically he he could do something terrible sticks your joke has gone far enough i cried just stop it but he was already running toward the front of the barn calling for his father his voice shrill and frantic sticks didnt find his dad until dinnertime thats the next time i saw him too just before dinner he was carrying his big superstition book holding it tightly under his arm jodie he whispered motioning for me to come close his face was red his dark eyes revealed his excitement hi stanley i whispered back uncertainly dont tell grandpa kurt about the scarecrow stanley whispered huh stanleys request caught me off guard dont tell your grandpa stanley repeated it will only upset him we dont want to frighten him do we but stanley i started to protest stanley raised a finger to his lips dont tell jodie your grandpa doesnt like to be upset ill take care of the scarecrow i have the book he tapped the big book with his finger i started to tell stanley that the scarecrow was only sticks playing a mean joke but grandma miriam called us to the table before i could get the words out stanley carried his superstition book to the table every few bites he would pick up the big black book and read a few paragraphs he moved his lips as he read but i was sitting down at the other end of the table and couldnt make out any of the words sticks kept his eyes down on his plate and hardly said a word i think he was really embarrassed that his father was reading the superstition book at the dinner table but grandpa kurt and grandma miriam didnt act the least bit surprised they talked cheerfully to mark and me and kept passing us more food as if they didnt even notice stanleys behavior i really wanted to tell grandpa kurt about how sticks was trying to scare mark and me but i decided to listen to stanley and not upset my grandfather besides i could deal with sticks if i had to he thought he was so tough but i wasnt the least bit afraid of him stanley was still reading jabbering away as he read as grandma miriam cleared the dinner dishes mark and i helped then we took our seats as grandma miriam carried a big cherry pie to the table weird mark whispered to me staring at the pie he was right doesnt grandpa kurt like apple pie i blurted out grandma miriam gave me a tense smile too early in the year for apples she murmured but isnt grandpa kurt allergic to cherries mark asked grandma miriam started cutting the pie with a silver pie cutter everyone loves cherry pie she replied concentrating on her work then she raised her eyes to stanley isnt that right stanley stanley grinned over his book its my favorite he said grandma miriam always serves my favorite after dinner grandpa kurt once again refused to tell mark and me a scary story we were sitting around the fireplace staring at the crackling yellow flames even though it had been so hot the air had grown cool this evening cool enough to build a nice toasty fire grandpa kurt was in his rocking chair at the side of the hearth the old wooden chair creaked as he rocked slowly back and forth he had always loved to gaze at the fire and tell us one of his frightening stories you could see the leaping flames reflected in his blue eyes and his voice would go lower and lower as the story got scarier but tonight he shrugged when i asked him for a story he stared dully at the huge stuffed bear on its pedestal against the wall then he glanced across the room at stanley wish i knew some good stories grandpa kurt replied with a sigh but ive clean run out a short while later mark and i trudged upstairs to our bedrooms what is his problem mark whispered as we climbed i shook my head beats me he seems so different mark said everyone here does i agreed except for sticks hes still trying to scare us city kids lets just ignore him mark suggested lets just pretend we dont see him running around in his stupid scarecrow costume i agreed then i said goodnight and headed into my room ignore the scarecrows i thought as i arranged the blankets on the bed just ignore them im not going to think about scarecrows again i told myself sticks can go jump in the creek climbing into bed i pulled the quilt up to my chin i lay on my back staring up at the cracks in the ceiling trying to figure out what kind of picture they formed there were three jagged cracks i decided they looked like bolts of lightning if i squinted i could make them look like an old man with a beard i yawned i felt really sleepy but i couldnt get to sleep it was only my second night here at the farm it always takes me awhile to adjust to being in a new place and sleeping in a different bed i closed my eyes through the open window i could hear the soft mooing of cows from the barn and i could hear the whisper of the wind as it brushed through the tall cornstalks my nose was totally stuffed up bet i snore tonight i thought that is if i ever get to sleep i tried counting sheep it didnt seem to be working so i tried counting cows big bulky bouncing sloooooowmoooooving cows i counted to a hundred twelve before i decided that wasnt working either i turned onto my side then after a few minutes i tried my other side i found myself thinking about my best friend shawna i wondered if shawna was having a good time at camp i thought about some of my other friends most of them were just hanging around this summer not doing much of anything when i glanced at the clock i was surprised to see it was nearly twelve ive got to get to sleep i told myself ill be wrecked tomorrow if i dont get some sleep i settled onto my back pulling the soft quilt up to my chin again i closed my eyes and tried to picture nothing just empty black space endless empty space the next thing i knew i was hearing scratching sounds i ignored them at first i thought the curtains were flapping against the open window got to get to sleep i urged myself got to get to sleep the scratching grew louder closer i heard a scraping sound from outside the window i opened my eyes shadows danced on the ceiling i realized i was holding my breath listening hard another scrape more scratching dry scratching i heard a low groan huh a startled gasp escaped my lips i pulled myself up against the headboard i tugged the quilt up to my chin gripping it tightly with both hands i heard more dry scraping like sandpaper i thought suddenly the room grew darker i saw something pull itself up to the window a dark figure blocking the moonlight who whos there i tried to call but my voice came out a choked whisper i could see a shadowy head black against the purple sky it rose up in the window dark shoulders followed by a darker chest black against black a silent shadow slipping into my room hhelp another stammered whisper my heart had stopped beating i couldnt breathe couldnt breathe it slid over the windowsill brushed away the curtains as it lowered itself into my room its feet scraped over the bare floorboards scratch scratch scratch it moved slowly steadily toward my bed i struggled to get up too late my feet tangled in the quilt i fell to the floor landing hard on my elbows i raised my eyes to see it move closer i opened my mouth to scream as it emerged from the shadows and then i recognized him recognized his face grandpa kurt i cried grandpa kurt what are you doing here why did you climb in the window he didnt reply his cold blue eyes glared down at me his whole face twisted into an ugly frown and then he raised both arms above me and i saw that he had no hands clumps of straw poked out from his jacket sleeves only straw grandpa no i shrieked grandpa please no i shrieked as he lowered his straw arms toward me he bared his teeth like an angry dog and let out a sharp frightening growl the straw hands reached down for me grandpa kurts face was the same the face i had always known except that his eyes were so cold so cold and dead the straw hands brushed over my face as i climbed to my feet i took a step back raising my hands like a shield grandpa whats wrong whats happening i whispered my temples were pounding my entire body shook his cold eyes narrowed in fury as he reached for me again noooo i let out a long wail of terror then i turned and stumbled to the door his feet scraped over the bare floor as he lurched toward me glancing down i saw the straw poking out from the cuffs of his pants his feet they were straw too grandpa kurt grandpa kurt what is happening was that really my voice so shrill and frightened he swung an arm the straw scratched my back as it swept over me i grabbed for the doorknob twisted it pulled open the door and cried out again as i collided with grandma miriam oh help please help grandma miriam hes chasing me i cried her expression didnt change she stared back at me in the dim light of the hallway her face came into focus and i saw that her glasses were painted on and her eyes and mouth and big round nose her entire face was painted on youre not real i cried and then darkness swept over me as grandpa kurts straw hands wrapped around my face i woke up coughing and choking surrounded by darkness heavy darkness it took me a few seconds to realize that id been sleeping with the pillow over my face tossing it to the foot of the bed i pulled myself up breathing hard my face was hot my nightshirt stuck wetly to my back i glanced at the window suddenly afraid that id see a dark figure climbing in the curtains fluttered gently the early morning sky was still gray i heard the shrill cry of a rooster a dream it had all been a frightening nightmare taking a deep breath and letting it out slowly i lowered my feet to the floor i stared at the gray morning light through the window just a dream i assured myself calm down jodie it was just a dream i could hear someone moving around downstairs staggering over to the dresser i pulled out some fresh clothes a pair of faded denim cutoffs a sleeveless blue tshirt my eyes were watery everything was a blur my allergies were really bad this morning rubbing my eyes i made my way to the window and peered out a red ball of a sun was just peeking over the broad apple tree a heavy morning dew made the grass of the back yard sparkle like emeralds the sea of cornstalks rose darkly behind the grass the scarecrows stood stiffly over them arms outstretched as if welcoming the morning the rooster crowed again what a stupid nightmare i thought i shook myself as if trying to shake it from my memory then i ran a brush through my hair and hurried down to breakfast mark was just entering the kitchen as i came in we found grandma miriam by herself at the table a mug of tea steamed in front of her as she gazed out the window at the morning sunlight she turned and smiled at us as we entered good morning sleep well i was tempted to tell her about my scary nightmare but instead i asked wheres grandpa kurt i stared at his empty chair the newspaper lay unopened on the table they all went off early grandma miriam replied she stood up walked to the cabinets and brought a big box of cornflakes to the table she motioned for us to take our places pretty day she said cheerfully no pancakes mark blurted out grandma miriam stopped halfway across the room ive completely forgotten how to make them she said without turning around she set two bowls down and made her way to the refrigerator to get the milk you kids want orange juice this morning its fresh squeezed grandma miriam set the milk carton down beside my bowl she smiled at me her eyes remained dull behind her squarerimmed glasses i hope you two are enjoying your visit she said quietly we would be if it werent for sticks i blurted out her expression turned to surprise sticks hes trying to scare us again i said grandma miriam tsktsked you know sticks she replied softly she pushed at her red hair with both hands what are you two planning for today she asked brightly its a beautiful morning to go riding before they left this morning grandpa kurt had stanley saddle up betsy and maggie in case you wanted to ride sounds like fun i told her what do you say mark before it gets really hot out i guess mark replied you two always enjoyed riding along the creek grandma miriam said putting the cornflakes box away i stared across the room at her stared at her red curly hair her pudgy arms her flowered housedress are you okay grandma miriam i asked the words just tumbled out of my mouth is everything okay here she didnt reply instead she lowered her eyes avoiding my gaze go have your ride she said quietly dont worry about me grandpa kurt always called betsy and maggie the old gray mares i guess because they were both old and they were both gray and they were as grumpy as can be when mark and i climbed onto their saddles and started to urge them from the barn they were the perfect horses for us city kids the only time we ever got to ride horses was during our summers at the farm so we were not exactly the most skillful riders in the world bumping along on these two old nags was just our speed and even as slow as we were moving i dug my knees into betsys sides and held onto the saddle horn for dear life we followed the dirt path past the cornfields toward the woods the sun was still climbing a hazy yellow sky but the air was already hot and sticky flies buzzed around me as i bounced on top of betsy i removed one hand from the saddle horn to brush a big one off betsys back several scarecrows stared back at us as mark and i rode past their black eyes glared at us from under their floppy hats mark and i didnt say a word we were keeping to our promise of not talking about scarecrows i turned my eyes to the woods and tossed the reins urging betsy to move a little faster she ignored me of course and kept clopping along over the path at her slow steady pace i wonder if these horses can still get up to a trot mark called he was a few paces behind me on the narrow dirt path lets give it a try i called back grabbing the reins tighter i dug my sneaker heels into betsys side go girl go i cried slapping her gently with the reins whoooa i let out a startled cry as the old horse obediently began to trot i really didnt think she would cooperate all right cool i heard mark shout behind me their hooves clopped loudly on the path as the two horses began to pick up speed i was bouncing hard over the saddle holding on tightly offbalance beginning to wonder if this was such a hot idea i didnt have a chance to cry out when the dark figure hurtled across the path it all happened so fast betsy was trotting rapidly i was bouncing on the saddle bouncing so hard my feet slipped out of the stirrups the dark figure leaped out right in front of us betsy let out a shrill startled whinny and reared back as i started to fall i saw immediately what had jumped onto the path it was a grinning scarecrow betsy rose up with a high whinny my hand grabbed for the reins but they slipped from my grasp the sky appeared to roll over me then tilt away i slid backwards out of the saddle off the horse my feet thrashing wildly for the flapping stirrups the sky tilted even more i hit the ground hard on my back i remember only the shock of stopping so abruptly the surprise at how hard the ground felt how so much pain shot through my body so quickly the sky turned bright red a glowing scarlet like an explosion and then the scarlet faded to deep deep endlessly deep black i heard low moans before i opened my eyes i recognized the voice marks voice my eyes still shut i opened my mouth to call to him my lips moved but no sound came out ohhhh another low groan from him not far from me mark i managed to choke out my back ached my shoulders hurt my head throbbed everything hurt my wrist i think i broke it mark said his voice shrill and frightened you fell too i asked yeah i fell too he groaned i opened my eyes finally i opened my eyes and saw the hazy sky all a blur everything was a watery blur i stared at the sky trying to get it in focus and then saw a hand in front of the sky a hand lowering itself toward me a bony hand stretching out from a heavy black coat the hand of the scarecrow i realized staring up helplessly at it the hand of the scarecrow coming down to grab me the hand grabbed my shoulder too terrified to cry out too dazed to think clearly my eyes followed the dark coat sleeve up to the shoulder up to the face a blur all a frightening blur and then the face became clear stanley i cried he leaned over me his red ears glowing his face tight with worry he gently grabbed my shoulder jodie are you all right stanley its you i exclaimed happily i sat up i think im okay i dont know everything hurts what a bad fall stanley said softly i was in the field and i saw it i saw the scarecrow his voice trailed off i followed his frightened gaze up ahead of me on the dirt path the scarecrow lay facedown across the path i saw it jump out stanley uttered with a shudder that shook his whole body my wrist mark moaned from nearby i turned as stanley hurried over to him mark was sitting up in the grass at the side of the path holding his wrist look its starting to swell up he groaned oooh thats bad thats bad stanley said shaking his head maybe its just a sprain i suggested yeah stanley quickly agreed wed better get you to the house and put ice on it can you get back up on maggie ill ride behind you wheres my horse i asked searching both ways along the path i climbed unsteadily to my feet she galloped back to the barn stanley replied pointing fastest ive seen her go in years he glanced down at the scarecrow and shuddered again i took a few steps stretching my arms and my back im okay i told him take mark on the horse ill walk back stanley eagerly started to help mark to his feet i could see that stanley wanted to get away from here away from the scarecrow as fast as possible i watched as they rode off down the path toward the house stanley sat behind mark in the saddle holding the reins keeping maggie at a slow gentle pace mark held his wrist against his chest and leaned back against stanley i stretched my arms over my head again trying to stretch the soreness from my back my head ached but other than that i didnt feel bad guess im lucky i murmured out loud i took a long glance at the scarecrow sprawled facedown across the path cautiously i walked over to it i poked its side with the toe of my sneaker the straw beneath the coat crinkled i poked it harder pushing my sneaker hard into the scarecrows middle i dont know what i expected to happen did i think the scarecrow would cry out try to squirm away with an angry cry i kicked the scarecrow hard i kicked it again the burlap bag head bounced on the path the scarecrows ghastly painted grin didnt move its just a scarecrow i told myself giving it one last kick that sent straw falling out from the jacket front just a scarecrow that sticks tossed onto the path mark and i could have been killed i told myself were lucky we werent sticks it had to be sticks but why this wasnt a joke why was sticks trying to hurt us stanley and sticks werent at lunch grandpa kurt said they had to go into town for supplies marks wrist was only sprained grandma miriam put an ice bag on it and the swelling went right down but mark was groaning and complaining he was really making the most of it guess ill have to lie on the couch and watch tv for a week or so he moaned grandma miriam served ham sandwiches and homemade coleslaw mark and i gobbled down our lunches all that excitement had made us really hungry as we ate i decided to tell grandpa kurt everything that had been happening i couldnt hold it in any longer i told him about how sticks was making the scarecrows move at night and how he was trying to frighten us trying to make us think the scarecrows were alive i caught a glimpse of fear in grandpa kurts blue eyes but then he rubbed his whitestubbled cheeks and he got a faraway look on his face sticks and his little jokes he said finally a smile spreading across his face that boy sure likes his jokes hes not joking i insisted hes really trying to frighten us grandpa we could have been killed this morning mark joined in he had mayonnaise smeared on his cheek sticks is a good boy grandma miriam murmured she was smiling too she and grandpa kurt exchanged glances sticks wouldnt really hurt you grandpa kurt said softly he just likes to have his fun great fun i muttered sarcastically rolling my eyes yeah great fun mark groaned i almost broke my wrist grandpa kurt and grandma miriam just smiled back at us their faces frozen like the painted scarecrow faces after lunch mark slumped to the couch where he planned to spend the rest of the afternoon staring at the tv he loved having an excuse not to go outdoors i heard stanleys truck pull up the drive i decided to go find sticks and tell him how fed up we were with his stupid scarecrow tricks i didnt think his jokes were all in fun i really believed he was trying to frighten us or hurt us and i wanted to find out why i didnt see sticks or stanley out in the yard so i made my way across the grass to the guest house where they lived it was a warm beautiful day the sky was clear and bright the air smelled fresh and sweet but i couldnt enjoy the sunshine all i could think about was letting sticks know how angry i was i knocked on the guest house door i took a deep breath and tossed my hair behind my shoulders listening for signs of life inside i tried to think of what i was going to say to sticks but i was too angry to plan it my heart started to pound i realized i was breathing hard i knocked on the door again harder this time there was no one inside i turned my gaze to the cornfields the stalks stood stiffly watched over by the motionless scarecrows no sign of sticks i turned to the barn across the wide grass from the guest house maybe sticks is in there i thought i jogged to the barn two enormous crows hopped along the ground in front of the open barn doors they flapped their wings hard and scrambled out of my way hey sticks i shouted breathlessly as i stepped inside no reply the barn was dark i waited for my eyes to adjust remembering my last creepy visit to the barn i stepped reluctantly my sneakers scraping over the straw on the floor sticks are you in here i called staring hard into the deep shadows a rusted baling machine stood to one side of the straw bales a wheelbarrow tilted against the wall i hadnt noticed them before guess he isnt here i said to myself out loud i walked past the wheelbarrow i saw something else i hadnt noticed before a pile of old coats on the barn floor empty burlap bags were stacked beside them i picked one up it had a frowning face painted on it in black paint i dropped the bag back onto the pile these must be stanleys scarecrow supplies i realized how many more scarecrows did he plan to build then something in the corner caught my eye i walked quickly over the straw then i bent down to examine what i saw torches at least a dozen torches stacked in the corner hidden by the darkness next to them i spotted a large bottle of kerosene what on earth are these doing here i asked myself suddenly i heard a scraping sound i saw shadows slide against shadows and i realized that once again i was no longer alone i jumped to my feet sticks i cried you scared me his face was half hidden in darkness his black hair fell over his forehead he didnt smile i warned you he said menacingly feeling the fear rise to my throat i stepped out of the corner and moved past him into the light from the doorway i i was looking for you i stammered sticks why are you trying to scare mark and me i warned you he said lowering his voice to a whisper i warned you to get away from here to go back home but why i demanded whats your problem sticks what did we do to you why are you trying to scare us im not sticks replied he glanced back nervously to the barn doors huh i gaped at him im not trying to scare you really he insisted liar i muttered angrily you must really think im a moron i know you threw that scarecrow onto our path this morning it had to be you sticks i really dont know what youre talking about he insisted coldly but im warning you a sound at the doorway made him stop we both saw stanley step into the barn he shielded his eyes with one hand as his eyes adjusted to the darkness sticks are you in here he called stickss features tightened in sudden fear he let out a low gasp i ive got to go sticks whispered tensely to me he turned and started jogging toward stanley here i am dad he called is the tractor ready i watched the two of them hurry from the barn sticks didnt look back i stood in the darkness my eyes on the empty doorway thinking hard i know sticks was lying to me i thought i know he made the scarecrows move at night i know he dressed as a scarecrow to scare me in the woods and at the barn and i know he tossed that scarecrow in front of the horses this morning i know hes trying to frighten mark and me but enough is enough i decided now its payback time now its time for sticks to be frightened really frightened i cant do this mark protested of course you can i assured him this is going to be really cool but my wrist hurts again my brother whined it just started hurting i cant use it no problem i told him you wont have to use it he started to protest some more but then a smile spread across his face and his eyes lit up gleefully its kind of a cool idea he said laughing of course its an awesome idea i agreed i thought of it we were standing in the doorway to the barn the white light from a full moon shone down on us owls hooted somewhere nearby it was a cool clear night the grass shimmered from a heavy dew a soft wind made the trees whisper the moonlight was so bright i could see every blade of grass after grandpa kurt and grandma miriam had gone to bed i dragged mark from the house i pulled him across the yard to the barn wait right here i said then i hurried into the barn to get what we needed it was a little creepy in the dark barn at night i heard a soft fluttering sound high in the rafters probably a bat my sneakers were wet from the grass i slid over the straw on the barn floor the bat swooped low over my head i heard a highpitched chittering up in the rafters more bats i grabbed one of the big old coats from the pile then i pulled up one of the burlap bag faces and slung it on top of the coat ignoring the fluttering wings swooping back and forth back and forth across the barn i hurried outside to mark and explained my plan my plan to get our revenge on sticks it was actually a very simple plan wed dress mark up as a scarecrow hed stand with the other scarecrows in the cornfield id go to the guest house and get sticks id tell sticks i saw something weird in the field id pull sticks out to the field mark would start to stagger toward him and sticks would be so freaked hed have a cow a simple plan and a good one sticks deserved it too i pulled the burlap bag over marks head the black painted eyes stared back at me i reached down picked up a handful of straw and began stuffing it under the bag stop squirming i told mark but the straw itches he cried youll get used to it i told him i grabbed his shoulders stand still dont move why do i need straw he whined mark you have to look like all the other scarecrows i told him otherwise sticks wont be fooled i stuffed the burlap face with straw then i held up the old overcoat for mark to put on i cant do this he wailed im going to itch to death i cant breathe you can breathe perfectly fine i told him i stuffed straw into the sleeves i was careful to let clumps of straw hang from the cuffs covering marks hands then i stuffed more straw into the jacket will you stand still i whispered angrily this is a lot of hard work you know he grumbled in a low voice to himself as i continued to work just keep thinking how great itll be when sticks sees you and thinks youre a scarecrow thats really coming to life i said i had straw stuck to my hands straw all down the front of my sweatshirt and jeans i sneezed once twice im definitely allergic to the stuff but i didnt care i was so excited i couldnt wait to see stickss terrified face i couldnt wait to pay him back for trying to frighten us all week i need a hat mark said he was standing stiffly afraid to move under all the straw hmmmm i thought hard there werent any hats in the barn with the other scarecrow supplies well just take one off a real scarecrow i told mark i stepped back to see my handiwork mark looked pretty good but he still needed more straw i set to work stuffing him making the old coat bulge now dont forget to stand straight and stiff with your arms straight out i instructed do i have a choice mark complained i i cant move at all good i said i arranged the straw that stuck out of his sleeves then stepped back okay youre ready i told him how do i look he asked like a short scarecrow i told him im too short he replied dont worry mark i said grabbing his arm im going to stick you up on a pole huh i laughed gotcha i muttered im kidding i started to lead him to the cornfields think this is going to work mark asked walking stiffly think were really going to scare sticks i nodded an evil grin spread over my face i think so i told my brother i think sticks is in for a terrifying surprise little did i know that we all were i gripped marks arm with both hands and led him to the cornfields the bright moon bathed us in white light the tall cornstalks shivered in a light breeze mark looked so much like a scarecrow it was scary tufts of straw stuck out at his neck and the cuffs of his coat the enormous old coat hung loosely over his shoulders and came down nearly to his knees we stepped into the field our sneakers crunched over the dry ground as we edged through a narrow row the cornstalks rose above our heads the breeze made them lean over us as if trying to close us in i let out a gasp as i heard a rustling sound along the ground footsteps mark and i both froze and listened the tall stalks bent low as the wind picked up they made an eerie creaking sound as they moved the ripe corn sheaths bobbed heavily creeeeak creeeeak the stalks shifted back and forth then we heard the rustling again a soft brushing sound very nearby ow let go mark whispered i suddenly realized i was still gripping his arm squeezing it tightly i let go and listened do you hear it i whispered to mark that brushing sound creeeeak creeeeak the cornstalks leaned over us shifting in the wind a twig cracked so nearby i nearly jumped out of my skin i held my breath my heart was racing another soft rustling sound i stared down at the ground trying to follow the sound oh a large gray squirrel scampered across the row and disappeared between the stalks i burst out laughing mostly from relief just a squirrel i said do you believe it just a squirrel mark let out a long relieved sigh from under the burlap bag jodie can we get going he demanded impatiently this thing itches like crazy he raised both hands and tried to scratch his face through the bag but i quickly tugged his arms down mark stop youll mess up the straw but my face feels like a hundred bugs are crawling all over it he wailed and i cant see you didnt cut the eyeholes big enough just follow me i muttered and stop complaining you want to scare sticks dont you mark didnt reply but he let me lead him deeper into the cornfield suddenly a black shadow fell over our path i let out a sharp gasp before i realized it was the long shadow of a scarecrow how do you do i said reaching out and shaking its straw hand may i borrow your hat i reached up and pulled the brown floppy hat off the burlap head then i lowered it over marks burlap head and pulled it down tight hey mark protested i dont want it to fall off i told him im never going to stop itching mark whined can you scratch my back please my whole back is itching i gave the back of the old coat a few hard rubs turn around i instructed him i gave him a final inspection excellent he looked more like a scarecrow than the scarecrows did stand right here i told him moving him into a small clearing between two rows of cornstalks good now when you hear me bringing sticks over put your arms straight out and dont move a muscle i know i know mark grumbled think i dont know how to be a scarecrow just hurry okay okay i told him i turned and made my way quickly along the shifting rows of cornstalks dry straw and leaves crackled beneath my sneakers i was breathing hard by the time i reached the guest house the doorway was dark but an orange light glowed dimly behind the pulled shade in the window i hesitated at the doorway and listened silence inside how was i going to get sticks to come out alone without his father i didnt want to frighten stanley he was a really nice man who would never think of playing mean jokes on mark and me and i knew how scared and upset he could get i only wanted to frighten sticks to teach him a lesson to teach him he had no business getting on our case just because mark and i are city kids the wind fluttered through my hair i could hear the cornstalks creaking behind me in the fields i shivered taking a deep breath i raised my fist to knock on the door but a sound behind me made me spin around hey i choked out someone was moving across the grass half running half stumbling my eyes were all watery it was hard to see was it mark yes i recognized the floppy hat the bulky dark overcoat falling down past his knees what is he doing i asked myself watching him approach why is he following me hes going to ruin the whole joke as he came closer he raised a straw hand as if pointing at me mark whats wrong i called in a loud whisper he continued to gesture with his straw hand as he ran mark get back in the field i whispered youre not supposed to follow me youre going to ruin everything mark what are you doing here i motioned with both hands for him to go back to the cornfield but he ignored me and kept coming trailing straw as he ran mark please go back go back i pleaded but he stepped up in front of me and grabbed my shoulders and as i stared into the cold painted black eyes i realized to my horror that it wasnt mark i cried out and tried to pull away but the scarecrow held on to me tightly sticks is that you i cried in a trembling voice no reply i stared into the blank painted eyes and realized there were no human eyes behind them the straw hands scratched against my throat i opened my mouth to scream and the door to the guest house swung open sticks i managed to choke out sticks stepped out onto the small stoop what on earth he cried he leaped off the stoop grabbed the scarecrow by the coat shoulders and heaved it to the ground the scarecrow hit the ground without making a sound it lay sprawled on its back staring up at us blankly who who is it i cried rubbing my neck where the straw hands had scratched it sticks bent down and jerked away the burlap scarecrow head nothing underneath nothing but straw it it really is a scarecrow i cried in horror but it walked i warned you sticks said solemnly staring down at the headless dark figure i warned you jodie you mean it wasnt you i demanded it wasnt you trying to scare mark and me sticks shook his head he raised his dark eyes to mine dad brought the scarecrows to life he said softly last week before you came he used his book he chanted some words and they all came to life oh no i murmured raising my hands to my face we were all so frightened sticks continued especially your grandparents they begged dad to recite the words and put the scarecrows back to sleep did he i asked yes sticks replied he put them back to sleep but first he insisted your grandparents make some promises they had to promise not to laugh at him anymore and they had to promise to do everything he wanted from now on sticks took a deep breath he stared toward the guest house window havent you noticed how different things are at the farm havent you noticed how frightened your grandparents are i nodded solemnly of course i have theyve been trying to keep dad happy sticks continued theyve been doing everything they can to keep him from getting upset or angry your grandmother fixes only his favorite food your grandfather stopped telling scary stories because dad doesnt like them i shook my head theyre that afraid of stanley theyre afraid hell read the chant in the book again and bring the scarecrows back to life sticks said he swallowed hard theres only one problem he murmured whats that i asked well i havent told dad yet but his voice trailed off but what i demanded eagerly some of the scarecrows are still alive sticks replied some of them never went back to sleep we both let out short cries as the front door to the house swung open startled i leaped away from the doorway as the door pulled open it revealed a rectangle of orange light stanley stepped into the light he held on to the door and peered out his eyes showed surprise as they landed on sticks and me but then he goggled and uttered a choking sound as he spotted the headless scarecrow on the ground nno stanley sputtered he pointed a trembling finger at the scarecrow it it walks the scarecrow walks no dad sticks cried but stanley didnt hear him stanley had already dived back into the house sticks started after him but stanley reappeared in the doorway as he stepped outside i saw that he was carrying the big superstition book the scarecrows walk stanley screamed i must take charge i must take charge of them all now his eyes were wild his entire skinny body was trembling he started toward the cornfields totally crazy sticks tried to calm him down no dad sticks cried desperately hurrying after him the scarecrow was dropped here i dropped it here dad it didnt walk it didnt walk stanley kept walking taking long rapid strides he didnt seem to hear sticks i must take charge now stanley declared i must be the leader i will bring the others back to life and take control he turned and glanced at sticks who was hurrying to catch up to him stay back stanley shouted stay back until i read the chant then you can follow dad please listen to me sticks cried the scarecrows are all asleep dont wake them stanley finally stopped a few yards from the edge of the cornfields he turned to sticks and studied his face youre sure youre sure theyre not out of my control youre sure theyre not walking sticks nodded yes im sure dad im really sure stanleys face filled with confusion he kept staring hard at sticks as if not believing him i dont have to read the chant stanley asked confused his eyes on the swaying cornstalks i dont have to take charge no dad sticks replied softly the scarecrows are all still you can put the book away the scarecrows are not moving stanley sighed with relief he lowered the book to his side none of them he asked warily none of them sticks replied soothingly and thats when mark in full scarecrow costume decided to come staggering out of the cornfield whereve you been mark called stanleys eyes went wide and he opened his mouth in a high shriek of terror dad please sticks pleaded too late stanley took off heading into the cornfields the big book raised high in front of him the scarecrows walk they walk he cried mark tucked at the burlap bag face did we blow it he called is the joke over whats happening there was no time to answer him sticks turned to me his features tight with fear weve got to stop dad he cried he started running to the swaying cornstalks stanley had already disappeared between the tall rows of corn my allergies were really bad i kept rubbing my eyes trying to clear them but as i followed sticks everything was a shimmering blur of grays and blacks ow i cried out as i stumbled in a soft hole and fell mark right behind me nearly toppled over me he reached down and helped pull me up i had landed hard on both knees and they were throbbing with pain which way did they go i asked breathlessly searching the dark swaying rows of creaking cornstalks i im not sure mark stammered whats going on jodie tell me not now i told him we have to stop stanley we have to stanleys voice high and excited rose up from somewhere nearby mark and i both froze as we listened to the strange words he was chanting is he reading something from that weird book mark demanded without answering i headed in the direction of stanleys voice it was easy to follow him he was chanting the strange words at the top of his lungs where was sticks i wondered why hadnt sticks been able to stop his father i pushed frantically through the tall stalks i was moving blindly my eyes watered over brushing the stalks out of the way with both hands in a small clearing i found stanley and sticks they were standing in front of two scarecrows on poles stanley held the book up close to his face as he chanted moving his finger over the words sticks stood frozen a blank expression on his face a face of cold terror had the words of the chant somehow frozen him there like that the scarecrows stood stiffly on their poles their painted eyes staring lifelessly out from under their floppy black hats mark and i stepped into the clearing just as stanley finished his chant he slammed the big book shut and tucked it under one arm theyre going to walk now stanley cried excitedly theyre going to come alive again sticks suddenly seemed to come back to life he blinked several times and shook his head hard as if trying to clear it we all stared at the two scarecrows they stared back at us lifeless unmoving the clouds floated away from the moon the shadow over the cornfields rolled away i stared into the eerie pale light a heavy silence descended over us the only sounds i could hear were stanleys shallow breathing tense gasps as he waited for his chant to work for his scarecrows to come to life i dont know how long we stood there none of us moving a muscle watching the scarecrows watching watching it didnt work stanley moaned finally his voice came out sad and low i did something wrong the chant it didnt work a smile grew on stickss face he gazed at me it didnt work sticks exclaimed happily and then i heard the scratch scratch scratch of dry straw i saw the scarecrows shoulders start to twitch i saw their eyes light up and their heads lean forward scratch scratch scratch the dry straw crinkled loudly as they both squirmed off their poles and lowered themselves silently to the ground go warn your grandparents sticks cried hurry go tell them what my dad has done mark and i hesitated we stared at the scarecrows as they stretched their arms and rolled their burlap bag heads as if waking up after a long sleep jodie look mark choked out in a hushed whisper he pointed out to the fields i gasped in horror as i saw what mark was staring at all over the field darkcoated scarecrows were stretching squirming lowering themselves from their poles more than a dozen of them silently coming to life run sticks was screaming go tell your grandparents stanley stood frozen in place gripping the book in both hands he stared in amazement shaking his head enjoying his triumph stickss face was knotted with fear he gave my shoulders a hard shove run the scarecrows were rolling their heads back and forth stretching out their straw arms the dry scratch of straw filled the night air i forced myself to take my eyes off them mark and i turned and started running through the cornfield we pushed the tall stalks away with both hands as we ran we ducked our heads low running in terrified silence we ran across the grass past the guest house past the dark silent barn the farmhouse loomed darkly ahead of us the windows were dark a dim porch light sent a circle of yellow light over the back porch hey mark shouted pointing grandpa kurt and grandma miriam must have heard our shouts back in the cornfields they were waiting for us in the back yard they looked frail and frightened grandma miriam had pulled a flannel bathrobe over her nightdress she had a scarf tied over her short red hair grandpa kurt had pulled his overalls on over his pajamas he leaned heavily on his cane shaking his head as mark and i came running up the scarecrows i exclaimed breathlessly theyre walking mark cried stanley he did you get stanley upset grandpa kurt asked his eyes wide with fear who got stanley upset he promised us he wouldnt do it again he promised if we didnt upset him it was an accident i told him we didnt mean to really weve worked so hard to keep stanley happy grandma miriam said sadly she chewed her lower lip so hard i didnt think hed do it grandpa kurt said his eyes on the cornfields i thought we convinced him it was too dangerous why are you dressed like that grandma miriam asked mark i was so frightened and upset i had completely forgotten that mark was still dressed as a scarecrow mark did you dress like that to scare stanley grandma miriam demanded no mark cried it was supposed to be a joke just a joke we were trying to scare sticks i told them but when stanley saw mark he my voice trailed off as i saw the dark figures step out of the cornfields in the silvery moonlight i saw stanley and sticks they were running hard leaning forward as they ran stanley held the book in front of him his shoes slipped and slid over the wet grass behind them came the scarecrows they were moving awkwardly staggering lurching silently forward their straw arms stretched straight forward as if reaching to grab stanley and sticks their round black eyes glowed blankly in the moonlight staggering tumbling falling they came after stanley and sticks a dozen twisted figures in black coats and hats leaving clumps of straw as they pulled themselves forward grandma miriam grabbed my arm and squeezed it in terror her hand was as cold as ice we watched stanley fall then scramble to his feet sticks helped pull him up and the two of them continued to run toward us in terror the silent scarecrows lurched and staggered closer closer help us please stanley called to us what can we do i heard grandpa kurt mutter sadly the four of us huddled close together staring in helpless horror as the scarecrows made their way chasing stanley and sticks across the moonlit lawn grandma miriam held on to my arm grandpa kurt leaned heavily squeezing the handle of his cane they wont obey me stanley screamed breathlessly he stopped in front of us holding the book in one hand his chest was heaving up and down as he struggled to catch his breath despite the coolness of the night sweat poured down his forehead they wont obey me they must obey me the book says so stanley cried frantically waving the book in the air sticks stopped beside his father he turned to watch the scarecrows approach what are you going to do he asked his father you have to do something theyre alive stanley shrieked alive what does the book say grandpa kurt demanded theyre alive theyre all alive stanley repeated his eyes wild with fright stanley listen to me grandpa kurt yelled he grabbed stanley by the shoulders and spun him around to face him stanley what does the book say to do how do you get them in control alive stanley murmured his eyes rolling in his head theyre all alive stanley what does the book say to do grandpa kurt demanded once again i i dont know stanley replied we turned back to the scarecrows they were moving closer spreading out forming a line as they staggered toward us their arms reached forward menacingly as if preparing to grab us clumps of straw fell from their sleeves straw spilled from their coats but they continued to lurch toward us closer closer the black painted eyes stared straight ahead they leered at us with their ugly painted mouths stop stanley screamed raising the book high over his head i command you to stop the scarecrows lurched slowly steadily forward stop stanley shrieked in a high frightened voice i brought you to life you are mine mine i command you i command you to stop the blank eyes stared straight at us the arms reached stiffly forward the scarecrows pulled themselves closer closer stop i said stop stanley screeched mark edged closer to me behind his burlap mask i could see his eyes terrified eyes ignoring stanleys frightened pleas the scarecrows dragged themselves closer closer and then i did something that changed the whole night i sneezed mark was so startled by my sudden loud sneeze that he let out a short cry and jumped away from me to my amazement the scarecrows all stopped moving forward and jumped back too whoa i cried whats going on here the scarecrows all seemed to have trained their painted eyes on mark mark quick raise your right hand i cried mark gazed at me through the burlap bag i could see confusion in his eyes but he obediently raised his right hand high over his head and the scarecrows all raised their right hands mark theyre imitating you grandma miriam cried mark raised both hands in the air the scarecrows copied him again i heard the scratch of straw as they lifted both arms mark tilted his head to the left the scarecrows tilted their heads to the left mark dropped to his knees the scarecrows sank in their straw slaves to my brothers every move they they think youre one of them grandpa kurt whispered they think youre their leader stanley cried staring wideeyed at the scarecrows slumped on the ground but how do i make them go back to their poles mark demanded excitedly how do i make them go back to being scarecrows dad find the right chant sticks yelled find the right words make them sleep again stanley scratched his short dark hair i im too scared he confessed sadly and then i had an idea mark i whispered leaning close to him pull off your head huh he gazed at me through the burlap mask pull off your scarecrow head i urged him still whispering but why mark demanded he waved his hands in the air the scarecrows obediently waved their straw hands in the air everyone was staring at me eager to hear my explanation if you pull off your scarecrow head i told mark then they will pull off their heads and theyll die mark hesitated huh you think so its worth a try grandpa kurt urged go ahead mark hurry sticks cried mark hesitated for a second then he stepped forward just inches from the darkcoated scarecrows hurry sticks urged him mark gripped the top of the burlap bag with both hands i sure hope this works he murmured then he gave the bag a hard tug and pulled it off the scarecrows stopped moving they stood still as statues as they watched mark pull off his scarecrow head mark stared back at them holding the burlap bag between his hands his hair was matted wetly to his forehead he was dripping with sweat the scarecrows hesitated for a moment more a long silent moment i held my breath my heart was pounding then i let out a happy cry as the scarecrows all reached up with their straw hands and pulled off their heads the dark hats and burlap heads fell silently to the grass none of us moved we were waiting for the scarecrows to fall waiting for the headless scarecrows to collapse and fall but they didnt go down instead they reached out their arms and moved stiffly menacingly forward they theyre coming to get us stanley cried in a high trembling voice mark do something i shouted shoving him forward make them stand on one foot or hop up and down stop them the headless figures dragged themselves toward us arms outstretched mark stepped forward he raised both hands over his head the scarecrows didnt stop didnt copy him hey hands up mark shouted desperately he waved his hands above his head the scarecrows edged forward silently steadily ththeyre not doing it mark wailed theyre not following me you dont look like a scarecrow anymore grandma miriam added they dont think youre their leader closer they came staggering blindly closer they formed a tight circle around us a scarecrow brushed its straw hand against my cheek i uttered a terrified cry noooooo it reached for my throat the dry straw scratching me scratching my face scratching scratching the headless scarecrows swarmed over mark he thrashed and kicked but they were smothering him forcing him to the ground my grandparents cried out helplessly as the darkcoated figures surrounded them stanley let out a silent gasp sticks help me i shrieked as the straw hands wrapped around my neck sticks sticks i glanced frantically around sticks help me please where are you then i realized to my horror that sticks was gone sticks i let out a final muffled cry the straw hands wrapped around my throat the scarecrow rolled over me my face was pressed into the dry straw of its chest i tried to squirm free but it held on surrounded me choked me the straw smelled sour decayed i felt sick a wave of nausea swept over me let go let go i heard stanley pleading the scarecrow was surprisingly strong it wrapped its arms around me tightly smothering me in the disgusting straw i made one last attempt to pull free struggling with all my might i raised my head and saw two balls of fire orange streaks of light floating closer and in the orange light i saw stickss face hard and determined i gave another hard tug and tumbled backwards sticks i cried he was carrying two blazing torches the torches from the barn i realized i was saving these just in case sticks called the scarecrows seemed to sense danger they let go of us tried to scramble away but sticks moved quickly he swept the two torches swinging them like baseball bats a scarecrow caught fire then another sticks made another wide swing the fire crackled a streak of orange against the darkness the dry straw burst into flame the old coats burned quickly the scarecrows twisted and writhed as the bright flames danced over them they sank to their backs on the ground burning burning so brightly so silently so fast i took a step back staring in horror and fascination grandpa kurt had his arm around grandma miriam they leaned close together their faces reflecting the flickering flames stanley stood tensely his eyes wide he hugged the book tightly to his chest he was murmuring to himself but i couldnt make out the words mark and i stood beside sticks who held a torch in each hand watching with narrowed eyes as the scarecrows burned in seconds there was nothing left but clumps of dark ashes on the ground its over grandma miriam murmured softly gratefully never again i heard stanley mutter the house was quiet the next afternoon mark was out on the screen porch lying in the hammock reading a stack of comic books grandpa kurt and grandma miriam had gone in for their afternoon nap sticks had driven into town to pick up the mail stanley sat at the kitchen table reading his superstition book his finger moved over the page as he muttered the words aloud in a low voice never again he had repeated at lunch ive learned my lesson about this book ill never try to bring any scarecrows to life again i wont even read the part about scarecrows we were all glad to hear that so now on this lazy peaceful afternoon stanley sat at the table quietly reading some chapter of the big book and i sat alone on the couch in the living room hearing stanleys gentle murmurings from the kitchen thinking about the night before it felt good to have a quiet afternoon to be all alone to think about what had happened all alone the only one in the room the only one to hear stanleys low mumbling as he read the book the only one to see the gigantic stuffed brown bear blink its eyes the only one to see the bear lick its lips step off its platform snarl and paw the air with its enormous claws the only one to hear its stomach growl as it stared down at me the only one to see the hungry look on its face as it magically came out of its long hibernation stanley i called in a tiny high voice stanley what chapter have you been reading
