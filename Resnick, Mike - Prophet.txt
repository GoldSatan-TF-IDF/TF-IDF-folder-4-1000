prophet by mike resnick prologue it was a time of giants there was no room for them to breathe and flex their muscles in mankind s sprawling democracy so they gravitated to the distant barren worlds of the inner frontier drawn ever closer to the bright galactic core like moths to a flame oh they fit into human frames most of them but they were giants nonetheless no one knew what had brought them forth in such quantity at this particular moment in human history perhaps there was a need for them in a galaxy filled to overflowing with little people possessed of even smaller dreams possibly it was the savage splendor of the inner frontier itself for it was certainly not a place for ordinary men and women or maybe it was simply time for a race that had been notably short of giants in recent eons to begin producing them once again but whatever the reason they swarmed out beyond the farthest reaches of the explored galaxy spreading the seed of man to hundreds of new worlds and in the process creating a cycle of legends that would never die as long as men could tell tales of heroic deeds there was faraway jones who set foot on more than five hundred new worlds never quite certain what he was looking for always sure that he hadnt yet found it there was a shadowy figure known only as the whistler who had killed more than one hundred men and aliens there was friday nellie who turned her whorehouse into a hospital during the war against the setts and finally saw it declared a shrine by the very men who once tried to close it down there was jamal who left no fingerprints or footprints but had plundered palaces that to this day do not know they were plundered there was betaworld murphy who at various times owned nine different goldmining worlds and lost every one of them at the gaming tables there was backbreaker ben ami who wrestled aliens for money and killed men for pleasure there was the marquis of queensbury who fought by no rules at all and the white knight albino killer of fifty men and sally the blade and the forever kid who reached the age of nineteen and just stopped growing for the next two centuries and catastrophe baker who made whole planets shake beneath his feet and the exotic pearl of maracaibo whose sins were condemned by every race in the galaxy and father christmas and the onearmed bandit with his deadly prosthetic arm and the earth mother and lizard malloy and the deceptively mildmannered cemetery smith giants all yet there was one giant who was destined to tower over all of the others to juggle the lives of men and worlds as if they were so many toys to rewrite the history of the inner frontier and the outer frontier and the spiral arm and even the allpowerful democracy itself at various times in her short turbulent life she was known as the soothsayer and the oracle and the prophet by the time she had passed from the galactic scene only a handful of survivors knew her true name or her planet of origin or even her history for such is the way with giants and legends but she had an origin and a history and a name this is her story part the gravedancers book a hot dry wind swept across the surface of last chance a remote world on the edge of the inner frontier dust devils swirled up to heights of sixty feet breathing became almost impossible and the few indigenous animals burrowed into the ground to wait out the dust storm a lone figure his clothing nondescript his face protected against the elements by a dust mask walked down the main street of the planet s only tradertown looking neither right nor left the door of an abandoned building suddenly buckled from the force of the wind and he quickly crouched withdrew a hand weapon and fired at the source of the noise the door briefly turned a bright blue and then vanished the man remained motionless for a moment then holstered his weapon and continued walking toward the brightly lit building at the end of the street he came to a stop about twenty yards from his destination then placed his hands on his hips and studied the structure before him the walls were made of a titanium alloy with a tight molecular bonding finished to look like wood the front veranda possessed two large doorways both leading to the crowded interior of the end of the line from where he was standing he couldnt tell which section was the bar and which was the casino though he suspected the casino was at the back where it could be more easily protected against potential robberies a door slid open for a moment and the man ducked behind a vehicle and withdrew his weapon again as a tall woman emerged took one step into the dust then shook her head and went back into the building coughing heavily the man strode back out into the middle of the street and continued staring at the building finally he began walking again turning to his left after a moment and circling the entire building there werent any windows which didnt surprise him given the force of the dust storm but he hadnt survived this long by not being thorough and he methodically checked out every means of ingress all the various doors were closed probably locked certainly tied into a security system briefly he considered climbing to the roof it was not beyond his capabilities to scale the side of the building made rough by the abrasive action of the wind and the dust but he couldnt see any advantage to be gained and he rejected the idea he finally decided that he had no choice but to enter through one of the doorways at the front of the building he was unhappy about it not that he minded being identified after his work was done but he preferred not to call any attention to himself before hed earned his money but no viable alternative had presented itself and the dust mask made him feel constricted even claustrophobic he realized that he was still holding his weapon in his hand that he had been holding it since the woman had temporarily emerged from the building and he once again replaced it in his holster then he climbed the three stairs to the veranda walked across it entered the end of the line and removed his mask he would get the feel of the place spot his quarry wash the dust in his mouth away with a beer or two and then go to work the place was as crowded as he had anticipated a long chrome bar lined the left side of the front room with perhaps a dozen tables scattered around the right side the clientele was primarily human for this was a human outpost world but here and there were canphorites lodinites and a pair of beings of a type he had never seen before the back room was as large as the tavern and even more crowded there were roulette tables dice tables poker tables two tables boasting alien games of chance he scanned the faces at the tables wondering which of them if any was his quarry then finally he turned and walked over to the bar a balding overweight man with a slight limp approached him from the other side of the bar good evening he said what can i get for you a beer coming right up said the man behind the bar placing a mug under a tap and activating it i havent seen you around here before i just got here sorry we have such lousy weather today continued the bartender usually last chance is a pretty pleasant place even a bit on the cool side i didnt come here for the weather good then you wont be disappointed the man lifted the mug to his lips and downed half of it in a single long swallow i need a little information he said wiping his mouth with the back of his hand if its mine to give replied the bartender im looking for someone well i know almost everyone here who is it a man named carlos mendoza some people call him the iceman mendoza eh said the bartender he looked around the room you owe him some money i can give it to him for you just point him out to me i hope youre not looking for trouble said the bartender they say mendoza is a pretty tough customer what im looking for is none of your business said the man coldly fine by me said the bartender with a shrug i just figured that since you dont know him probably youve been hired by someone who does know him thought i could save you a little misery save your thoughts for mendoza well said the bartender with another shrug at least youve been warned all right ive been warned said the man now point him out to me see that fellow sitting by himself in the corner asked the bartender the one dressed all in black the man nodded hes armed like hes going into battle he said laser pistol sonic gun projectile pistol probably got a knife tucked into that boot too actually hes got a knife in each boot said the bartender he paused are you really sure you want to go through with this its my work said the man turning to face his prey you could talk suggested the bartender the icemans always willing to talk instead of fight he is huh thats what i hear i dont get paid to talk answered the man he took a few steps toward the man in black then stopped mendoza he said in a loud voice most of the action at the gaming tables stopped as the man in black looked up at him curiously are you talking to me the mans fingers hovered above the hilt of his sonic pistol time to die mendoza do i know you asked the man in black all you have to know is that im the last thing youre ever going to see suddenly the newcomer flinched and a puzzled expression crossed his face he blinked his eyes rapidly as if trying to comprehend what had happened then groaned once and pitched forward on his face a large knife protruding from his back the bartender limped over to him withdrew the knife he had thrown with deadly accuracy and wiped it off on a bar towel they get younger and dumber every week he said turning the dead man onto his back with a foot no problem friends he announced raising his voice just our weekly visitor from wherever and because of who he was most of the patrons took his word for it and returned to their drinks and their gambling the man in black walked over and stared at the corpse ever see him before asked the bartender no said the man in black you know who he is iceman the iceman shook his balding head no idea but thats four of them this month somebody really wants me dead he paused i just wish i knew why i havent been off the planet in damned near four years if you hadnt killed him maybe we could have found out said the man in black after all thats what you hired me for youre not making my job any easier i made your job easier replied the iceman he would have taken you the man in black frowned what makes you think so the iceman knelt down gripped the corpses left hand in his own and displayed the index finger prosthetic he said i spotted it at the bar and when he turned his back i saw the power pack under his shirt while you were drawing your weapon hed have just pointed at you and bumed a hole right through your chest well ill be damned muttered the man in black i guess you did make my job easier at that ill take it out of your pay said the iceman wryly you know one of these days someones going to come out here who knows what you look like said the man in black what are you going to do then duck i suppose replied the iceman in the meantime lets move our late friend here into my office and see what we can learn about him i have a feeling hes going to be just like the others you described to me predicted the man in black no identification no fingerprints surgically altered retinagram probably agreed the iceman but lets do it anyway the man in black shrugged and gestured for a couple of other men to pick up the corpse they began carrying it toward the casino the iceman immediately barred their way out the front and around to the side he said weve got customers here how would you like it if someone dragged a dead body right in front of you while you were drinking he paused then sighed deeply dont answer just do it they reversed their direction and carried the dead man out the front door well said the man in black are you finally going to tell me what this is all about i wish to hell i knew answered the iceman limping back to the bar and pouring himself a beer he offered one to the man in black who turned it down dont kill the next one and maybe youll find out anyone who comes after me on last chance dies answered the iceman firmly thats part of the myth i spent three decades creating if i let even one of these bastards live the myth becomes a fairy tale and theyll be coming after me every hour instead of every week lord knows ive made enough enemies over the years then why did you hire me at all asked the man in black in frustrated tones as you say one of them may know who i amand i happen to be a seventyoneyearold man with a beer belly and an artificial leg when i finally need you youll earn your money never fear you ought to let me cripple one of them said the man in black then wed get some answers you want to cripple one asked the iceman he gestured to the door youve got the whole damned planet on which to do it but once they walk through that door my first concern is staying alive he finished his beer now if you want to practice on men who are here to kill you thats your privilege and good luck to you but i didnt get to be this old by taking chances they say there was a time when you took chances replied the man in black lots of em i was young i learned better thats not the way i heard it then someone must have lied to you said the iceman they even say continued the man in black that youre the only man who ever took on the oracle and won the iceman grimaced i didnt win anything is she still alive i suppose so replied the iceman i cant imagine anything being able to kill her has the thought crossed your mind that shes behind all this not for an instant why not because if she was id be dead said the iceman with absolute certainty you faced her before and youre still alive persisted the man in black forget about her replied the iceman shes got nothing to do with this youre sure to her im about as insignificant as a grain of sand on a deserted beach he paused if shes still alive shes got more important things on her mind what kind of things i hope to hell i never find out answered the iceman seriously come on he added lets take a look at the body they walked over to his office and entered it where they found the corpse laid out on a broad wooden desk the man in black examined the corpses fingers closely no prints he announced damned nice job on that fake finger i never spotted it he looked down at the dead mans face got an ophthalmoscope a small one inside the center drawer of the desk said the iceman going over the body for scars or identifying marks but its not tied into any computers the man in black walked to the desk and returned with the instrument i have a feeling that tying into a computer wont do you a bit of good with this guy but lets see he stared through the scope for a moment then put it away yeah theres some scar tissue on the rods and cones fivell get you ten theyre not on record anywhere in the galaxy no serial numbers on any of the weapons either noted the iceman strange out here on the inner frontier most killers pick colorful names and brag about their accomplishments but this is the fourth one in a row who has no name no identification no reputation nice boots though said the man in black i suppose so very nice i checked for labels or manufacturers marks said the iceman there arent any the man in black continued staring at the boots do you see something im missing asked the iceman suddenly interested its possible said the man in black taking a boot from the corpses foot and examining it looks sort of blue when the light hits it commented the iceman i know said the man in black he handed the boot to the iceman there arent a lot of blue reptiles on the inner frontier and i only know of one thats got this circular pattern of scales oh the man in black nodded big sonuvabitch it lives on a world called greycloud out by the quinellus cluster he paused they call it a bluefire dragon it could swallow you whole and then look around for the main course how big a world is greycloud about the size of last chance maybe a little smaller oxygen world yes any sentient lifeforms asked the iceman not since we pacified it a few centuries ago answered the man in black how many men maybe seven thousand mostly miners and aquaculturalists its mostly freshwater ocean with a batch of islands and one very small continent does it do much exporting the man in black shook his head too small probably doesnt get a mail or cargo ship more than seven or eight times a year so continued the iceman if our killer was wearing boots made from the local lizard theres a pretty good chance that he bought them there concluded the man in black they look relatively new said the iceman studying the boots i think maybe youd better pay a little visit to greycloud take a couple of holos of our friend here before we bury him and see if anyone knows who he was or who he worked for i assume youll be all right while im gone ill make do replied the iceman dryly by the way if greycloud is so far off the beaten track how come you know about this bluefire dragon ive been there when the man in black shrugged oh about eight or ten years ago on business in a manner of speaking said the man in black noncommittally good said the iceman youll have some contacts there some people you can talk to the man in black shook his head everyone i knew there is dead recently about eight or ten years ago the iceman smiled in grim amusement no wonder they call you the gravedancer his real name was felix lomax and he used it for the first twentysix years of his life but names have a way of changing on the inner frontier metamorphosing to fit the natures of the men and women theyre attached to originally hed been a pioneer one of that group of highly trained specialists that opened new worlds for the democracy terraforming them when necessary cataloging the various lifeforms designing settlements analyzing soils and minerals and water samples to determine exactly what type of colonists would be the most productive miners farmers aquaculturalists whatever his specialty was pacification a euphemism for decimating native populations until such time as they were willing to allow colonization or in some instances until there were none left to object during that period of his life he had been known as double x an easily identifiable code name based on the spelling of his given name after four years of pacifying alien populations something happened on the planet of innisfree he never spoke of it never referred to it in any official document but right in the middle of the campaign he quit and went off to the inner frontier he bought a large ranch on backgammon ii and spent the next two years raising mutated cattle huge pound specimens that he sold to the navy during this time he was felix longface for he never smiled never joked never seemed to take much of an interest in anything then he finally put whatever demons were bothering him to rest and went farther into the inner frontier returning to the trade he knew best killing for a while he was known as the man in black for it was the only color he ever wore but there were four other men in black on the frontier and before long he picked up the sobriquet of gravedancer and that was the name that stuck not that he ever danced or visited cemeteries but when he landed on a planet it was only a matter of time before someone would be visiting a graveyard never to return his personality didnt change much he still didnt smile and he seemed to take no pride in his craft which was strange for a man in his occupation but before long his reputation preceded him and he didnt lack for customers he picked and chose those that interested him which was how he came to work for the iceman who was as close to a living legend as a man could become on the inner frontier where most legends died just about the time that they were recognized as legends he didnt know much about the iceman no one didbut he knew that he had in his day faced both the soothsayer and the oracle and had lived to tell about it which was more than anyone else could claim he would have thought that the iceman would be the very last person on the frontier to require protection so when the offer came his interest was sufficiently aroused to accept the commission he hadnt realized at the time that it would require him to pay a return visit to greycloud but it wouldnt have made any difference to him if he had known it as his ship braked to sublight speeds and the water world came up on his viewscreen he checked out his arsenal selected those weapons that he thought would be most effective in this environment and requested permission to land on the single continents tiny spaceport please identify yourself said a metallic voice crackling with static this is the peacekeeper felix lomax commanding five days out of last chance permission denied why you are the felix lomax who is also known as the gravedancer are you not ive been called that yes there are nine outstanding arrest warrants in your name each for the crime of murder all the more reason why you should want to get your hands on me replied lomax we have no one here capable of taking you into custody against your will gravedancer said the voice i assume you have not come to give yourself up to the authorities a fair assumption then permission to land is denied if you attempt to land on greycloud we will fire on your ship and destroy it before it can touch down one moment said lomax breaking the connection he had his computer scan the spaceport and surrounding vicinity searching for weaponry it found none nor had he expected so thinly populated a world to have any defensive capabilities nice try greycloud he said reactivating his radio now please give me landing coordinates denied im landing whether you like it or not if you wont give me coordinates youd better clear the sky or risk a collision over the landing field this is the peacekeeper over and out he broke out of orbit and entered an elliptical path toward the spaceport touching down about twenty minutes later once on the ground he had the ships sensors scan the area for armed personnel found none activated a number of security devices and finally emerged through the hatch the boots and a holograph of the dead man secured in a leather holdall that he slung over his left shoulder he walked about half a mile past two small hangars to the main traffic control and reception building and entered warily there were four clerks going about their business one man and three women none of them looked up at him or gave any indication that they were aware of his presence until he cleared his throat and three of them fidgeted nervously he walked up to the fourth a grayhaired woman and stood before her yes she said coldly i need transportation into town he said do i look like a chauffeur she demanded if i cant find one youll do go away and leave me alone mr lomax she said i want nothing to do with you do i know you he asked no but i know you she said her eyes reflecting her hatred then tell me where i can find a ride into town and you wont have to keep looking at me i wouldnt help you if you were bleeding to death on the street she said he stared at her for a long moment have it your way he said at last before i leave though he added i should point out that if anyone touches my ship the ensuing explosion will flatten the spaceport and everything else within a radius of two miles then he turned on his heel and walked out the main entrance the parking lot was almost empty the planet had a tiny population and relatively little commerce with the rest of the galaxy but as he stood hands on hips wondering what to do next a small groundcar pulled up he walked over to it before the driver could get out and opened the passengers door whats going on here demanded the driver a young man in his early twenties im paying you fifty credits to take me into town said lomax the hell you are snapped the young man ive got a shipment of computer parts to pick up they can wait lomax sat down next to the driver pulled out a sonic pistol and pointed it at him that wasnt a request he said calmly who are you demanded the driver what the hell is this all about im just a guy who needs a ride to town said lomax now drive why dont you take an aircab said the young man turning the car around i wasnt aware you had any we do i can drive you to their hangar i wouldnt want to put you to the trouble said lomax just get going the young man stared at him and suddenly his expression changed youre him arent you he said im whom the gravedancer some people call me that damn said the young man grinning and slamming his hand against the dashboard the gravedancer himself in my groundcar he turned to lomax what are you here for business who are you going to kill asked the young man eagerly no one you can tell me persisted the young man im on your side im just here to talk to the local bootmaker the young man snorted contemptuously come on gravedancer do you expect me to believe you flew all the way to greycloud for a pair of boots what you believe makes no difference to me said lomax just take me where i want to go he paused you can start by driving into town the young man put the vehicle in motion and a moment later they were traveling on a road that paralleled an ocean shoreline ive been wondering if youd ever come back youre too young to remember me said lomax i was twelve when you were here the last time replied the young man i saw you take on nine men at once he paused then extended his hand my names neil neil cayman lomax looked at his hand for a moment then took it briefly im felix lomax neil shook his head youre the gravedancer he paused where are you going from here lomax shrugged it all depends on what i learn while im here neil seemed lost in thought for a moment then spoke up do you want some company where out there he said waving his hand toward the sky ive spent my whole life on this world id like to see something different i work alone i could be useful to you every damned world i touch down on theres always some kid who wants to go out and make a name for himself on the inner frontier answered lomax most of em die before the undertaker knows what name to put on their headstones im different said neil yeah i know said lomax youre all different ive spent my whole life on greycloud continued neil i want to see whats out there book passage with a tour group answered lomax youll live longer i dont want to see what tourists see persisted neil i want to see the way the worlds really are the way the people really live he paused ive got some money saved i could be ready to go by this afternoon not with me said lomax id do any kind of work you asked me to do anything at all not interested the road turned inland and was now lined by thick tropical foliage which began thinning out as they moved farther away from the ocean there have to be places where your face is known where people run when they see you coming i could go to those places and get information for you today is an exception said lomax usually im after men not information i could spot them for you let you know what their habits are where theyre likely to be i wouldnt ask for any pay or anything like that continued the young man just a chance to get off this boring little world and travel with someone like you i admire your persistence said lomax but the answer is the same youre making a mistake gravedancer lomax shrugged its possible ive made em before then let me come with you ive also learned to live with the consequences of my mistakes said lomax the subject is closed they came to a tiny town composed of a broad single street lined with some four dozen stores and shops an old hotel and a pair of restaurants one of which was serving its customers in a shaded outdoor patio area neil drove more than halfway down the street and pulled up to a storefront ill wait here for you he announced lomax left the groundcar without a word and entered the store a warm dusty singlestory building that displayed a number of leather goods in the windows coats jackets belts hats boots toward the back were sheets of various leathers and hanging carefully from the walls were a number of pelts yes said a thin balding man walking out from a back room can i help you possibly said lomax reaching into his leather holdall and withdrawing one of the dead mans boots do you recognize this the old man held it up to the light for a moment made from a bluefire dragon he said you made it if anyone else on the frontier makes em i sure as hell havent heard about it he examined it further this was a custom job too my label s not in it how many custom boots do you make in a years time oh maybe fifty from bluefire dragons maybe two or three good said lomax pulling out the holograph and handing it over to the old man do you recognize him looks dead noted the old man he is do you know him the old man nodded yeah i made some boots for him maybe seven eight months ago what can you tell me about him he wasnt real talkative said the old man seems to me he spent most of the day waiting in the bar across the street then picked up his boots paid for em and left did he have a name let me check my records said the old man activating his computer yeah his name is was cole jason cole did he pay cash asked lomax yes so you dont know what world he banked on probaly olympus answered the old man thats let me think now alpha hayakawa iv what makes you think he did his banking on olympus he liked the boots so much he ordered a second pair had me ship them to an address on olympus what address well now thats privileged information isnt it said the old man staring at lomax id call it expensive information said lomax placing a pair of twohundredcredit notes on the counter well considering that the poor man has passed on i suppose theres no harm in it said the old man greedily snatching up the money and stuffing it into a leather pouch that he wore around his neck computer print out jason coles address the address emerged an instant later and the old man handed it to lomax id say good hunting said the old man but it appears to me that your hunting is already done i have a feeling its just starting well in that case good luck gravedancer you know me said lomax sharply itd be hard to forget you said the old man you were the only exciting thing to happen to greycloud in half a century he paused dont worry about me alerting the authorities or nothing first they probably couldnt stop you from whatever youre doing and second most of them you killed deserved what they got thanks but let me give you a word of advice gravedancer what is it would i be right in figuring you plan to take a trip to olympus next you might be id be real careful there if i were you oh the old man nodded now and then i hear things from people who are passing through what kind of things oh i dont put much stock in the details answered the old man you know how people tend to exaggerate out here but those who are willing to talk about it at all dont make it sound like a real friendly place ill keep it in mind said lomax walking to the door can i interest you in a pair of boots while youre here the old man called after him or maybe a new holster for all those weapons maybe next time answered lomax men in your line of work dont usually live long enough for there to be a next time said the old man with a halfamused smile this is your second trip here so youre already on borrowed time next time repeated lomax walking out into the street neil was waiting for him and opened the door did you find out what you needed to know he asked possibly said lomax settling back on his seat at least i know where im going next where lomax looked over at him and smiled elsewhere he said they drove to the spaceport in silence then neil parked the groundcar youre sure you wont take me youll live longer on greycloud kid i thought the quality of life was supposed to be important said neil sardonically youve been misinformed neil left the vehicle and walked to the cargo area while lomax entered the main building the grayhaired woman who had refused to help him earlier glared at him but beneath the mask of hatred he thought he saw a certain smugness a brief look of triumph before the mask was fully in place he walked slowly to the door leading to the landing field scrutinizing the area carefully a pair of leadsuited mechanics were gingerly bringing out a small packet of plutonium to fuel an ancient cargo ship that was still powered by a nuclear pile and a crew of three men were fixing a couple of cracks and potholes at the adjoining landing strip but otherwise the place seemed deserted then suddenly he saw a brief movement out of the corner of his eye coming from the roof of a hangar he turned to face it but couldnt spot anything out of the ordinary he lit a cigar leaned lazily against a wall and continued scanning the strip a moment later the sun glinted off some metal on the roof of another hangar he walked to a vidphone directory and picked out a name at random then approached the grayhaired woman call jonathan sturm and tell him that the gravedancers on his way he said walking out the front entrance before she could utter a reply or a refusal hes got until dark to put his affairs in order and make his peace with whatever god he worships he walked directly to the groundcar entered it and waited for neil cayman to emerge from the cargo area carrying a box of computer parts i thought youd be gone by now said neil surprised change of plans said lomax do you own a ship neil seemed amused where would i get a spaceship how about your parents or your employer well yeah my boss has a little fourman job here yes said the young man its in one of the hangars will they let you move it out to the landing field i suppose so lomax peeled off five largedenomination notes itll be sundown in about three hours do it then once they find out that i helped you ill be arrested lomax shook his head youll have plenty of time to fabricate an alibi almost every cop on the planet is going to be waiting for me at jonathan sturms house sturm what have you got against him nothing answered lomax i never met the man then why just do what i said okay neil stared at him i take it theyve set a trap for you he asked at last lomax nodded will you help me i cant believe someone like you couldnt take them all out maybe i could agreed lomax but no one is paying me to do it and when you put your life on the line often enough you learn just how valuable a commodity it is if i have to fight my way to my ship i will but if theres an easier way ill take it he paused i need to hide until sunset and then i need you to move your ship he stared at the young man now are you going to help me or not yeah ill help you gravedancer good on one condition added neil oh take me with you ive had it with this planet i told you neil handed the money back to him thats my price lomax grimaced all right its a deal he said at last neil withdrew all his money from his bank then parked in a secluded spot where he and lomax waited until nightfall then they drove back to the spaceport where neil approached the hangar and had them bring his employers ship out onto the reinforced pavement of the takeoff strip while the ships computer was waiting for takeoff clearance the young man raced out of the cockpit and stopped the first security man he could find somethings wrong he panted what asked the man someones hiding in the cargo compartment of my ship the computer spotted the extra weight i just got a glimpse of him hes dressed all in black you keep away from the ship the security man instructed him well take it from here lomax watched from the shadows until he was convinced all the security personnel had surrounded neils employers ship then he walked briskly and silently to his own ship where he found the young man waiting at the hatch nothing to it grinned neil as lomax uttered the proper code words to open the hatch without detonating the security system within the ship lets go said lomax entering the ship the second i activate the ignition theyre going to know they were duped grab a seat strap yourself in and keep your fingers crossed that no one is approaching on our exit path no one ever comes here said neil seating himself in the cramped cockpit thats why i want to get the hell out of here lomax fed the coordinates of olympus into the navigational computer waited until it had chosen a flight path then hit the ignition as he had predicted it brought all the armed security men back from the other ship but he managed to take off before they could get off any damaging shots so where are we going asked neil cayman when they had left the system and achieved light speeds olympus answered lomax the young man had the computer cast a cartographic hologram in the air above his seat i cant find it he announced after a moments scrutiny try alpha hayakawa iv suggested lomax right here it is i wonder why the difference in names standard replied lomax most of the planets are named after the head of the pioneer team that opened them up roman numerals indicate how far out from the sun it is any other number tells you how many prior planets the man had opened i dont follow you this is alpha hayakawa iv explained lomax that means it was first charted by a man or woman named hayakawa and that its the fourth planet from a binary sun but if you look elsewhere you might also find that its jones or jones which means that its the thirtyninth or twentysecond planet opened up by some guy from the pioneer corps named jones he paused and of course the first thing the settlers did was change the name probably its got some mountain that looks like a holo of mount olympus back on earth or maybe the first governor was a greek scholar or maybe they had a civil war and the general on the winning side was named olympus it gets confusing doesnt it said neil all these names to learn even more so when the native lifeforms have their own name for their world said lomax with a smile you get the hang of it after awhile i like the notion of the inhabitants choosing their own name for their world said neil now that im going out to the frontier i want to pick my own name youve got one i dont like it i want something colorful like gravedancer or catastrophe baker or cemetery smith thats your right i suppose lomax converted to autopilot unstrapped himself and stood up stretching his arms you suppose asked neil following him back to the cargo area which he had converted into a small lounge with a pair of comfortable chairs secured to the deck lomax sat down and lit a thin cigar if youre any good at anything usually youll find someone has picked your name for you and youre pretty much stuck with it whether you like it or not i could wait a long time said the young man ruefully as he sat down opposite lomax the only thing im really good at is wishing i was somewhere else thats a start it is ever hear of faraway jones asked lomax no who is he an old man whos probably been to six seven hundred worlds is he an explorer no a cartographer lomax shook his head people say that when he was as young as you are he fell in love with a girl on binder x nobody knows what happened but evidently he did something to make her leave him and hes been hunting for her ever since lomax paused he must have been searching for her for oh close on to seventy years now do you think shes still alive asked neil dubiously probably not seventy years is a long time for anyone to survive on the inner frontier then why does he keep looking lomax shrugged youd have to ask him will i ever see him hit enough worlds out there and youll run into him sooner or later who else will i see asked the young man eagerly i dont know who do you want to see everyone all the colorful characters ive heard about and read about he smiled at lomax they all seem so much bigger than life lomax returned the smile i know how you feel when i was your age i wanted to go out to the frontier and see all my heroes too he paused after awhile you learn that they all bleed and they all die what about the prophet whos he i dont know just someone i heard about on the video this years outlaw hero snorted lomax take my word for it kid some bounty hunter will bring him down just like they brought down santiago and all the rest of em still i want to see them all for myself neil paused youre the only famous person ive ever met lomax smiled ruefully let me tell you fame isnt everything its cracked up to be especially out on the frontier you say that because you see famous people all the time protested the young man but no one else special has ever come to greycloud theres nothing very special about pointing a weapon and killing people said lomax sure there is argued neil how many men can do it too damned many still i want to go out there and see them for myself you may be disappointed said lomax i doubt it what do you think that there are a couple of thousand worlds out there populated only by killers and folk heroes kid the inner frontier is filled with miners and farmers and merchants and doctors and everything else you need to run a planet i know that said neil irritably but theyre not the ones who interest me something tells me that youll find all the colorful characters youre looking for lomax paused kids like you usually do maybe i can even become one myself said neil trying to hide his eagerness if you live long enough said lomax now lets start taking care of business what business do we have before we reach olympus well to begin with said lomax theyve probably issued a kidnapping warrant for me i want you to radio olympus and tell them youve come with me of your own volition they wont believe me perhaps not but i want it on the record neil nodded all right and then since youre going to have to start earning your keep i want you to go into the galley and make me up some dinner he paused soya products only no red meat no dairy products i dont see how that makes you a better killer said neil it makes me a healthier one responded lomax ive got high blood pressure and a high cholesterol count no sense letting these control patches i wear do all the work the young man smiled youre kidding why should you think so i just cant imagine the gravedancer sticking medical patches in his body for that stuff an amused smile crossed lomaxs face you probably cant imagine that ive got a prosthetic eye and that my current set of teeth is three years old either is that true kid there are very few whole men walking around the inner frontier answered lomax now go send those messages neil activated the radio and spoke briefly to his father who was alternately distressed and enraged but finally realized that there was nothing he could do about the situation and even volunteered to send some money ahead to olympus an offer the young man refused then they ate the young man insisting on having the same bland food as lomax finally they strapped themselves into the bunks that folded out from the bulkhead in the short corridor between the galley and the cargo area and went to sleep lomax awoke with a start an hour later shit he muttered what is it asked neil sitting up abruptly i put us on autopilot but i forgot to activate the avoidance sensors were probably okay but itd be just my luck to smash into the only damned meteor within five parsecs ill take care of it said neil walking to the control panel wait a minute and ill hit the lights said lomax not necessary came the answer even if you know where the sensor control is you still have to be able to see it to make the adjustment its done said neil returning to his cot in total darkness how the hell did you do it asked lomax i thought i told you i work with computers i was picking up some parts when i met you so a couple of years ago i programmed a pair of microchips for infrared vision and had them surgically inserted in my eyes you can really see in the dark sure said neil amazing muttered lomax oh thats nothing ive got chips in me that enhance my hearing and my sense of smell too you designed em yourself it s what i do i suppose if you had to you could probably design one that would speed up all your reactions said lomax given enough time i probably could why it might prove useful where youre going you know it never occurred to me admitted neil thoughtfully well its an idea anyway said lomax lying back down on his cot its a damned good idea gravedancer said neil if im going to live on the frontier i ought to be well prepared nothing wrong with that agreed lomax out here you need any edge you can get i just went up against a man who had a laser built into a fake finger never spotted it if the fat old man im working for hadnt been a little more alert than i was i wouldnt have lived long enough to get to greycloud a weapon in a prosthetic finger mused neil i could do that he considered the proposition hell i could turn my whole body into a killing machine who do you plan on killing asked lomax no one then why bother because one of these days someone may want to kill me and its best to be prepared contrary to what you may have seen on the video life on the inner frontier isnt one prolonged gunfight said lomax yours is my life is like anyone else s in my profession replied lomax endless stretches of boredom punctuated by very brief periods of danger that make you wonder what was so wrong with the boredom in the first place well it cant hurt to be prepared said the young man stubbornly after all you suggested it i know said lomax sleepily you do what you want to do ill start designing what i need on the ships computer in the morning fine yawned lomax at least i know what to call you now you do yeah from this day forward youre the silicon kid neil smiled happily in the darkness i like that somehow i thought you might said lomax olympus was a rugged little world filled with too many mountains and too little farmland saltwater oceans that tended to produce tidal waves and freshwater lakes and rivers that tended to dry up every summer at first view there was no reason why anyone should have wanted to settle there let alone produce a sprawling megalopolis between two of the larger mountain ranges but it happened that the planet was almost ideally located between the democracy and that section of the inner frontier dominated by the binder system originally it housed a single tradertown but as commerce grew between the democracy and the worlds of the inner frontier the tradertown began growing in all directions including up and one day without anyone knowing quite how it had happened it had become a huge city encompassing almost two million humans and perhaps fifty thousand aliens of various races a shipping and trading center of truly homeric proportions there were four spaceports two orbiting hangars each capable of accommodating more than one thousand ships that were too big or too heavy to land on the planets surface and some forty square miles just to the north of the city for storing grain that was enroute to the democracy the city was named appropriately enough athens and most of the major thoroughfares bore names taken from the iliad and the odyssey it possessed many of the conveniences of the democracy but despite its size and affluence it still retained more than a little of the feel of a tradertown gaily costumed miners and gamblers rubbed shoulders with conservatively clad businessmen grimfaced bounty hunters and killers inhabited the bars and drugdens entrepreneurs of all types were constantly scheming to share in some of the billions that sat in the vaults of two dozen major and minor banks this is some place this olympus said the silicon kid as he and lomax rode a slidewalk down one of the main thoroughfares look at these buildings gravedancer theyre just buildings said lomax with a shrug you arent impressed they blot out the sun lomax paused it looks like any other gateway world gateway world between the inner frontier and the democracy answered lomax there are about fifty of em well ive never seen anything like this one worlds pretty much like the next replied lomax this ones a little warm for my taste could use a touch more gravity too i like the lighter gravity enthused the kid i feel like im floating suddenly he paused you have to make adjustments every time the gravity changes right lomax nodded on a world like this your tendency is to shoot too high yeah mused the kid i hadnt thought of that another pause maybe i can come up with some chips that will make all the worlds feel the same to you you come up with a chip like that and youll never run out of friends replied lomax where are we going asked the kid watching a monorail race above them to see where jason cole used to live hes the guy with the laser in his finger that s right said lomax then what then i ask some questions lomax turned to the silicon kid you dont have to come along we can make an arrangement to meet somewhere and miss the chance of seeing you in action said the kid watching a pair of silent hovercrafts race for a single landing space atop a nearby roof not a chance not much action involved in asking questions what if they dont answer lomax stepped aside as two young boys raced past him toy guns blazing coles dead why shouldnt they maybe whoever he lived with will be just a little upset that you killed him answered the kid i didnt kill him maybe they wont believe you said the kid after all youre the gravedancer lomax grimaced if he lived with anyone they must have known what kind of work he did he lit a thin cigar in this business if you go out often enough there comes a time when you dont return thats a given ill come along anyway said the kid you just might need some help lomax shrugged its been known to happen the kid frowned as they passed a multienvironmental hotel that seemed to specialize in chlorinebreathers you know he said every time i think ive got you pegged you come up with an answer that throws me oh youre the gravedancer you shouldnt want help from anybody you see enough men get blown to bits and before long you find that youre willing to take all the help you can get answered lomax checking each street sign as they came to it well it seems wrong i suppose itd make a lousy video agreed lomax with an amused smile it sure as hell would agreed the kid seriously welcome to the real world they rode in silence for a few more minutes until hector boulevard crossed helen street lomax managed the change of slidewalks easily but had to reach out and steady the silicon kid who had never been on a slidewalk before and almost lost his balance thanks muttered the kid thatd be a hell of a way to get killed my first day on a new world dont jump lomax cautioned just step onto the thin strip of pavement between them with one foot and then step onto the next slidewalk stupid way to travel easier than walking five miles answered lomax do all the frontier worlds have these things hardly any of them do said lomax olympus isnt really a frontier world the charts say it is oh its in the inner frontier agreed lomax but its too built up too civilized the real frontier keeps moving toward the core while the democracy keeps absorbing the worlds on the outskirts thats what i want to see said the kid the real inner frontier lomax jerked his thumb in the direction of a travel agency they were passing be my guest i can wait a few days how comforting lomax checked a street number were coming to another change of slidewalks get ready this time the kid moved as gracefully as lomax and after a short interval they stepped onto the pavement in front of the hotel apollo is this the place asked the kid looking at the steel and glass structure confronting them if my information is correct said lomax the kid grimaced who could live in buildings like this theres no room to turn around lomax looked amused oh no more than thirty or forty trillion people you belong to a race of social animals kid not me answered the silicon kid living like this would drive me crazy lomax walked up to the main entrance the kid was about to try to step into the lobby but lomax reached out a hand and restrained him whats the matter asked the kid wait said lomax youre not on greycloud any longer an alien doorman reddish and mildly humanoid nodded a pleasant greeting and uttered a single command dispersing the energy field that protected the entrance welcome to the hotel apollo the finest hostelry on all of olympus it said in heavily accented terran how may i be of assistance to you weve come to visit a friend said lomax excellent said the doorman everyone should have friends his name is jason cole alas jason cole is not in residence at this moment well wait he has been gone for twentythree days answered the doorman he may be gone for twentythree more no problem i am afraid that we empty the lobby every night at midnight continued the doorman you cannot wait here that was never our intention said lomax well wait in his room that is not permitted sure it is said lomax pulling out a large bankroll and thumbing through it hardly ever said the alien youre sure asked lomax peeling off a pair of bills i am almost certain what a shame said lomax adding a third bill to the two except on special occasions answered the alien grabbing the bills and tucking them into its uniform how lucky for you that this is a special occasion whats his room number i will take you there myself said the doorman it s not necessary ah but it is why because if you do not need my help to gain entrance to jason coles room then i cannot permit you to wander the corridors of our establishment without supervision lomax smiled well follow you this way please said the alien waddling off to the airlift they floated up to the fortythird floor then emerged into a slowmoving corridor that took them past a number of rooms until they reached the one they wanted and stepped off we are here it announced allowing the doors sensors to examine his palm and retina finally it uttered a code in its own tongue and the door dilated revealing the interior of a small apartment i will leave you now said the alien but i must warn you that i will have our security forces monitor your movements once you emerge from jason coles apartment lomax nodded i would expect no less from the finest hostelry on all of olympus the alien bared its teeth in what passed for a grin one question said lomax as the alien was about to leave yes lomax held up another bank note who is jason coles employer the doorman eyed the note with almost human sadness i do not know sir pity said lomax putting the bill back into one of his many pockets he and the kid entered the room and a moment later the door closed behind them well he said lets see what we can learn about the late mr cole lomax walked into the bedroom and checked the closet there were two rather gaudy outfits there and nothing else the dresser had some undergarments but three of the four drawers were empty the bathroom looked like it had never been used the medicine cabinet was completely bare he walked back into the living room where he found the kid going through a holodisk library the guy liked pornography announced the kid if he had any other interests you cant prove it by whats here you checked the kitchen and the foyer asked lomax yes what do you find theres some beer in the kitchen nothing else and a pair of thermal garments in the closet either this world has a hell of a winter or he sometimes goes to a planet thats a lot colder than this one lomax doublechecked the rooms the kid had inspected as far as i can tell he said at last he just used this as a mailing address and maybe a place to spend an occasional night when he was on the planet his gaze fell on a computer screen that was built into the wall okay lets check his mail he walked over to the screen computer activate activated replied a metallic voice please bring up all mail that youve received since i last activated you there are eightyseven parcels mr cole eliminate all advertisements there are two parcels mr cole read the oldest of them working once you have proof that your assignment has been successfully carried out report to me in person at my office and payment will be made in the usual way who signed the letter there is no signature is there a return address no wonderful muttered lomax im delighted that you are pleased said the computer lomax grimaced now read the second letter dear mr cole this is to inform you that you have exceeded your credit limit of twentyfive hundred credits until this has been made good we can no longer accept your custom please make arrangements to have the money transferred to our account first planetary bank of olympus thank you for your prompt attention and payment is there a signature the manager is there a return address the blue pavilion achilles street thank you deactivate thats our next stop asked the silicon kid i think so said lomax did you notice anything peculiar about the wording of the first letter not especially answered the kid just that hes done business with this guy before it sounded formal said lomax like whoever wrote it is a businessman and makes this kind of assignment all the time probably he does answered the kid after all killings a business just like any other lomax shook his head thats not what i meant then i dont follow you i have a feeling that my employer is up against a very professional organization said lomax the kind of organization that authorizes killings every day payment will be made in the usual way from some guys office thats the last place youd want a killer to show up for his money unless your primary business is hiring killers that still doesnt tell us whether this guy is a middleman or whether hes the one who initiated the assignment i know so what do we do now asked the kid let s find out what cole knew how do we do that if were lucky we just ask the computer lomax turned back to the screen computer activate activated please bring up the last letter i posted from this address working tell the anointed one i accept the assignment for the usual price lomax frowned the anointed one that is correct what is the address on the letter electronic mailbox j in whose name is it registered working i am unable to retrieve that information mr cole the owner of the box has asked that his name be unlisted is there any way i can find out who owns it if you are a legitimate creditor you can go to claims court and fill out a form f after an appropriate investigation the authorities will release the name to you there s no faster way no mr cole thank you computer deactivate the anointed one repeated the kid as the screen went dark you ever hear of anyone with that name never what about your employer hed have told me if hed ever come across it there was a momentary silence which was finally broken by the silicon kid now we go to the blue pavilion he asked lomax nodded his agreement now we go to the blue pavilion the blue pavilion was a nightclub atop one of the taller buildings in the city an enormous glass wall some forty feet high afforded a breathtaking view of mount olympus the other three walls were covered with mirrors that reflected the deep blue sky the mountain and the huge pool that dominated the middle of the club the pool itself was filled with a dozen dolphinlike creatures that had been imported from sylestria ii they were thought to be sentient but as yet no common language had been developed and in common with all aquatic species their inability to work with fire had hindered any attempts they might have made to develop a recognizable technology still they were capable of intricate maneuvers that seemed almost like precision dancing and just about the time the audience was becoming bored or jaded twelve nude girls dove into the water climbed aboard the creatures and rode them as they performed yet another water ballet there was a long chrome bar on one side of the room and a number of tables most of them filled with patrons who were dressed more for show than for comfort obviously the blue pavilion was a place to see and be seen waiters and waitresses all in elegant silken outfits moved rapidly about the room filling empty glasses taking orders occasionally bringing out dinners as well as drinks a sixpiece orchestra hovered above the pool their glittering platform floating in midair as lomax and the silicon kid walked up to the entrance a tall formally clad man approached them may i be of service to you gentlemen he said his expression displaying his disapproval of their clothing wed like a table please said lomax im afraid we have no available tables this evening there are five empty tables said lomax all reserved lomax pulled out a hundredcredit note not too close to the pool he said im afraid its out of the question said the man hey this is the gravedancer youre talking to snapped the kid i am aware of his identity answered the man calmly he turned to lomax your reputation precedes you mr lomax please excuse my friend said lomax adding two more notes to the original one hes new to your world you really must teach him some manners mr lomax said the man taking the bank notes and leading them to an empty table near the bar as they were being seated lomax laid three more notes on the table we could use a little information he said the man eyed the notes then bowed deeply if its mine to give i gather that jason cole used to frequent this place thats correct sir said the man reaching for the notes lomax covered the notes with his hand i know that he said i need to know who he used to meet here the man looked nervously at the money i would love to help you mr lomax but lomax added three more notes to the pile the man looked again then sighed and shook his head he would probably kill me if i pointed him out to you id love to do business with you mr lomax but id love to wake up tomorrow morning even more tell you what said lomax picking up the pile of notes and placing them into the mans hand you tell him that i know jason cole and id like to speak to him and let him decide whether to come over and talk to me will that get you off the hook admirably said the man pocketing the money he signaled to a waitress who immediately approached the table what can i get you gentlemen to drink she asked as the maitre d walked off champagne said the kid champagne for him fruit juice for me said lomax what type lomax shrugged whatevers available you dont drink either asked the kid as the waitress walked away not when im working i think its almost criminal coming to a place like this and not having a drink you just watch the naked ladies and leave the thinking to me ive been watching them said the kid we dont allow nudity on greycloud is it common on the frontier it varies from world to world answered lomax there are even a couple of colony worlds run by nudists id like to see them lomax shrugged take it from me most people look better with their clothes on still you do what you want no ones keeping you here why do i get the feeling that youre trying to get rid of me look said lomax i brought you here that ought to be enough any minute now it could start getting dangerous i can take care of myself said the kid you dont have to protect me i have no intention of protecting you said lomax i just dont want you getting in my way thats a hell of a thing to say replied the kid more than half seriously i thought we were supposed to be friends friends arent compatible with the business im in what about the man youre working for persisted the kid you make him sound like a friend the iceman hes me thirtyfive or forty years from now if i survive the iceman repeated the kid youre working for him yeah why does he need you hes the man who beat the oracle hes an old man now with a bum leg if its his leg at all my guess is that its prosthetic lomax paused and according to him he didnt beat her he seems to think he was lucky to come out of it alive no he beat her said the kid firmly everyone knows the story he could barely contain his enthusiasm just think of it the iceman what i wouldnt give to meet him are all the other stories they tell about him true probably not they say he killed threefisted charlie and that he found the soothsayer when hundreds of bounty hunters couldnt and lower your voice and calm down said lomax in amused tones or the band just might sue you for unfair competition im sorry said the kid but the iceman hes one of my heroes he paused what is he like hes a fat balding old man with a limp said lomax but ill give him this hes sharp he doesnt miss a trick why are you working for him i would think that of all the men on the frontier the iceman would be the last to hire someone like you people get old kid even the iceman the waitress returned with their drinks and a moment later the maltre d approached them i delivered your message mr lomax and the man shrugged and now its up to the gentleman you wish to speak to lomax nodded all right you did your part one more thing mr lomax yeah we are civilized people here and olympus is a civilized planet the law is enforced very strictly here if there is to be violence it would be most unfortunate for all parties concerned if it were to occur in the blue pavilion he looked meaningfully at the security cameras which were clearly visible above each table ill keep that in mind thank you mr lomax the man retreated toward the kitchen and lomax took a sip of his juice then made a face is something wrong asked the kid ive tasted this before said lomax some kind of mutated citrus from the altair system it probably costs more than your champagne but i cant stand the stuff he pushed the glass to the middle of the table you want it the kid shook his head ill stick with what ive got thanks thats up to you said lomax the kid downed half his glass in a single swallow good stuff you ever drink champagne before sure said the kid defensively lots of times yeah i could tell by the way you gulped it down suddenly lomax tensed take a walk kid what you heard me why whats going on i think im about to have a visitor said lomax staring at a dapper middleaged man who was making his way across the floor toward their table id rather stay lomax stared at him all right but you dont say a word you dont contradict anything i say and you dont make any sudden movements you got it lomax studied the man as he approached them he was of medium height and build with meticulously groomed gray hair and mustache pale blue eyes and an aquiline nose there was a bulge in his pocket that he made no attempt to hide but if it was a weapon it looked like it would be very difficult to withdraw it without a great deal of fumbling around you are mr lomax asked the man coming to a stop behind an empty chair thats right and this is my associate mr the silicon kid interjected the young man i dont believe ive heard of you sir said the man you will responded the kid i am milo korbekkian may i sit down please do said lomax korbekkian seated himself do you mind if i smoke be my guest the dapper man lit up a thin cigar and lomax wrinkled his nose it contains a mild stimulant explained korbekkian the odor is an unfortunate side effect i can put it out if you wish suit yourself said lomax i can stand it if you can then with your kind permission i shall continue to smoke korbekkian leaned forward slightly i understand that you are an acquaintance of jason coles that s right dear jason said korbekkian signaling to a passing waiter to bring him a dnnk the last i heard of him he was leaving for some little world on the inner frontier he paused how is he getting along about as well as most corpses i suppose poor boy said korbekkian with no show of surprise or regret you should never send a boy to do a mans job continued lomax oh he never had a chance against the iceman lomax stared into his eyes neither did the other three you sent what other three asked korbekkian innocently as his drink arrived mr korbekkian were never going to come to a satisfactory arrangement unless we put our cards on the table i know youve sent four men to kill the iceman i know that all four are buried on last chance assuming that i did send four men out there why should the notorious gravedancer if i may use your professional sobriquet come all the way to olympus to tell me that theyve failed you can keep wasting your money sending cannon fodder out after the iceman said lomax or he added you can buy the best and get the job accomplished the silicon kid seemed about to say something but lomax stared him down i see said korbekkian finally lifting his drink to his lips and downing it in a single swallow you have come seeking employment ive come to discuss the matter replied lomax i dont come cheap no i imagine you dont he placed his glass down on the table and stared intently at it on the other hand youve seen what happens to those who do a telling point mr lomax agreed korbekkian looking across the table at lomax a telling point indeed he paused how much would you require and when could you be ready to leave ill want two million credits or its equivalent in maria theresa dollars said lomax and ill be ready to leave as soon as ive spoken to the anointed one lomax studied him carefully for a reaction surprise that he knew the name of korbekkians employer shock fear anything but the mans face was an emotionless mask that may be difficult to arrange mr lomax no more difficult than terminating the iceman ill venture responded lomax the anointed one does not like to be directly involved in such matters i dont like dealing with middlemen i assure you that i am far more than a middleman said korbekkian what are your assurances worth asked lomax i dont believe i understand you mr lomax if i deal directly with you my fee is three million said lomax now is ten minutes of the anointed ones time worth a million credits or not korbekkian stared at him for a long moment why do you wish to see him i have my reasons i will be happy to transmit them to him lomax shook his head thats not the way i do business may i give you a piece of friendly advice mr lomax im always happy to get advice replied lomax easily if i were you i would not make any demands or set any conditions that might annoy the anointed one said korbekkian even someone as accomplished as yourself cannot withstand his anger im a lot more accomplished than the iceman and hes withstood it pretty well noted lomax he is a minor irritant who probably does not even know of the anointed ones existence answered korbekkian he lives on the inner frontier and his influence on events is absolutely minimal then why have you gone to such lengths to have him killed that mr lomax is none of your business if i accept the anointed one s commission it is said lomax korbekkian put out his cigar and immediately lit up another one i do not think we can do business mr lomax he said at last of course we can said lomax you just take my message to the anointed one and bring me his answer korbekkian shook his head i dont think so mr lomax you ask too many questions you make too many demands i can be very demanding when its my life that will be on the line responded lomax if the iceman was easy to kill hed be dead by now i dont see what killing the iceman has to do with meeting the anointed one said korbekkian irritably you dont have to answered lomax i see it and thats enough i very much doubt that hell speak to you mr lomax yes he will korbekkian made no attempt to hide his curiosity what makes you so certain mr lomax because youre going to tell him that if he doesnt i just might offer my services to the iceman korbekkian stared at him expressionlessly for a long minute where can i get in touch with you right here tomorrow night the dapper man stood up ill have an answer for you at that time he turned on his heel and walked out of the blue pavilion youre not really going to hire on to kill the iceman said the kid dont be stupid then why didnt you kill him right here lomax smiled i promised the maitre d that we wouldnt get any blood on the tablecloths whats to stop us from following him out right now and blowing him away nothing but common sense answered lomax hes just a hireling if i take him out this anointed one will just find someone else to hire his killers so what do we do now i stay here and enjoy the show what about me you said lomax you take your seeinthedark eyes and follow mr korbekkian where do i follow him to asked the kid lomax shrugged to wherever hes going then what then remember how to find it in case the anointed one decides not to meet with me the kid left the club and lomax feeling he had put in a useful evening settled back to watch the entertainment it was just after sunrise when the hotel rooms vidphone began buzzing lomax sat up swung his feet to the side of the bed and ordered the machine to activate an instant later a holograph of milo korbekki an stared out at him good morning mr lomax how did you find me asked lomax i didnt use my real name when i checked in i have my sources whats up i thought we were meeting at the blue pavilion tonight that wont be necessary i have spoken to him and he has agreed to see you mr lomax when ill pick you up in front of your hotel at noon precisely said korbekkian just you no one else have your luggage with you you will not be returning hes not on olympus just be ready mr lomax right said lomax one more thing mr lomax said korbekkian what is it i do not appreciate being followed if your companion ever attempts to do so again i cannot be held responsible for what happens to him lomax allowed himself the luxury of a smile hes very young if he wants to get older he had best heed what i just said ill pass your message on to him lomax paused do you want him to remain on olympus whether he stays on olympus or not is of no import to me mr lomax but he cannot accompany us lomax nodded ill see you at noon at noon echoed korbekkian breaking the connection lomax got up walked into the bathroom took a brief shower ran a comb through his hair and began getting dressed when he was finished he left his room took the airlift down two levels rode the corridor to the kids room and knocked at the door open said the kid s voice and the door slid back good morning said lomax walking into the room good morning answered the kid who was fully dressed and watching a holographic video he commanded the set to deactivate was the address i gave you last night any use to you not yet said lomax he stared at the kid you were spotted impossible said the kid i was never within a hundred yards of him ill swear he never saw me probably it was one of his bodyguards then he has bodyguards said the kid surprised i never saw any lomax smiled theyre the best kind he told you that lomax nodded when asked the kid he called me about ten minutes ago how did he find you were using phony names olympus is his home world replied lomax if he wasnt good enough to find us he wouldnt have lasted this long at his job the kid stared at lomax for a moment then spoke so whats the story he asked are we going to meet the anointed one i am what about me korbekkian says no what am i then a hostage lomax chuckled he doesnt need a hostage he has me then what do i do lomax stared at him for a moment do you really want to get involved in this kid i am involved if you wanted to back out this would be a good time said lomax right now youre a civilian you stay in you become a warrior and youre fair game im in said the kid firmly okay said lomax lets get some breakfast and discuss it they left the room took the airlift down to the mezzanine level and walked over to a small restaurant the kid ordered a full breakfast while lomax contented himself with a cup of coffee and a roll i never saw a restaurant like this enthused the kid referring to the holographic representations of the various dishes that hovered above the table this is really interesting commonplace said lomax what you saw last night printed menus and live waiters is the rarity their meal was conveyed to their table on an automated cart that waited until they had removed all their dishes then rolled back to the kitchen well said the kid lets get down to business just a minute said lomax pulling a small oblong mechanism out of one of his pockets what s that asked the kid just a scrambler answered lomax activating it by pressing a small button there are security devices all over the main floor here he continued jerking his head in the direction of a camera that was positioned in a corner of the restaurant if anyone s trying to listen to us this will stop them you think someones trying to monitor us lomax shrugged who knows he paused youll live a lot longer if you assume the worst and try to prepare for it ill remember that said the kid see that you do lomax looked around casually scanning the faces of passersby trying to match them with anyone he had seen at the blue pavilion the night before finally he turned back to the kid youre sure you want to get involved theres still time for you to walk away from this not a chance said the kid all right said lomax taking a sip of his coffee theres nothing further to be learned on olympus so theres no reason for you to wait for me here what do you want me to do you always wanted to meet the iceman didnt you said lomax i want you to go to last chance and deliver a message i want to meet him sure said the kid but it sounds like youre sending me there just to make me feel useful why cant you just send it via subspace radio personally i dont give a damn whether you feel useful or not answered lomax seriously im sending you in person because it will almost certainly cost me my life if its intercepted is that reason enough for you what s the message asked the kid i want you to tell him that no matter what he hears im still working for him what is he likely to hear if he hears anything at all itll be that the anointed one hired me to kill him why should he believe me lomax took a ring off the little finger of his left hand give him this he knows it belongs to me all right said the kid he stared across the table at lomax more to the point why should he believe you damned good question admitted lomax have you got an answer lomax grimaced not really he said at last sounds to me like you could have a problem on your hands offered the kid lomax sighed deeply thats what i get paid for overcoming he finished his roll and got to his feet ive got a couple of things to do ill pay for your room through noon if you stay any longer it comes out of your pocket what about the hangar and exit fees ill take care of them answered lomax ill see you around kid right lomax held a credit cube up to a scanner waited until it registered and then left the restaurant he settled his bill at the hotel desk then stopped by a vidphone and took care of the charges at the spaceport then he checked the directory paid a connect fee for the main branch of the planetary library and accessed the newstape division bring up any information concerning the anointed one he ordered there are six articles about the anointed one dating from ge to the present give me hard copies of all six that will be an extra fee of credits new stalin rubles or far london pounds if your home bank deals in any other currency there will be a three percent conversion fee do you accept the charges i do working done the six articles emerged from a slot beneath the screen and lomax broke the connection he found a comfortable chair in a comer of the lobby sat down and started reading them the earliest mention of the anointed one identified him as the leader of a small religious cult far out on the rim he had been arrested for murdering one of his subordinates but the case was dismissed for lack of evidence when the two eyewitnesses disappeared five months later he had moved his base of operations to the spiral arm not that far from earth itself and now the democracy was after him for the nonpayment of million credits in taxes a year later he had set up temples and recruiting stations on some twenty planets in the heart of the democracy and was said to have a following numbering in the millions no mention was made of the disposition of the tax suit the final three articles each spaced a month apart concerned politicians and other public figures speaking out against the anointed one his sects supposed excesses his refusal to pay taxes and his growing power in the most recent article there was a list of five people who had publicly opposed him and had since vanished there was no holograph or photograph of the anointed one nor any information or even conjecture about his origins lomax was mildly surprised that he hadnt heard about a man with such a large organization but of course that organization had started on the rim and had spread only to the democracy not yet reaching those worlds toward the galactic core that formed the inner frontier and the men and women of the frontier paid scant attention to those developments that didnt directly affect them the real question decided lomax was not how the anointed one had gathered such power so quickly but rather what the iceman a saloon owner on an obscure frontier world who himself hadnt set foot on a democracy world in almost three decades had done to attract the attention and the obvious enmity of a man who had yet to get within five thousand lightyears of the inner frontier lomax checked his timepiece saw that he still had a couple of hours before he had to meet korbekkian and strolled out into the cool crisp olympus morning he walked aimlessly for a few blocks pausing to look at a window here a holographic display there a street vendor selling exquisite alien stone carvings a psychic forecasting the fall of the democracy a street musician of an unknown race playing an atonal but haunting melody on a string instrument of strange design he stopped at a weapon shop studied their display with an expert eye saw nothing superior to his own armaments and finally began walking back to his hotel he noted with approval that olympus like most inner frontier worlds disdained most of the new nanotechnology of the democracy and swept its streets with sleek machines rather than using the new dirteating microbes that had been developed on deluros viii he reached the hotel about twenty minutes before noon had a quick cup of coffee and stood just inside the front entrance a few moments later a splendid latemodel groundcar pulled up the door opened and milo korbekkian summoned him with a gesture good morning mr lomax said korbekkian as lomax entered the vehicle good morning i assume you had the good sense to tell your young companion not to follow us hes lightyears from here by now he had better be we have your ships registration number and if we should encounter it during our voyage we will not hesitate to blow it to pieces is that understood its understood said lomax leaning back on the plush seat have you any questions asked korbekkian as his driver pulled the vehicle away from the hotel and into the light morning traffic ill ask them as i think of them you will be thoroughly scanned before boarding my ship and any weapons you are carrying will be confiscated he paused if you reach an accommodation with the anointed one they will be returned to you fair enough i think we understand each other said korbekkian with a satisfied smile no reason why we shouldnt mr korbekkian answered lomax after all were going to be on the same team i sincerely hope so said korbekkian i would relish working with a man of your qualifications i think i can say the same about your boss korbekkian looked idly at the oncoming traffic what do you know about the anointed one he asked at last just what i managed to learn from the newstapes said lomax i wouldnt believe everything i read in the public press mrlomax said korbekkian no definitely not does that mean he pays his taxes asked lomax with a smile korbekkian turned to lomax one does not joke about the anointed one mr lomax the press doesnt begin to understand what theyre dealing with i got the impression that they thought he was a pretty powerful man if not an altogether desirable or lawabiding one if i told you the true extent of his political and financial power mr lomax you would think me either a fool or a liar its possible agreed lomax pleasantly if you believe nothing else i tell you believe this mr lomax said korbekkian you would be wrong he paused dead wrong lomax had been confined to his quarters aboard the ship and hence had no idea of how many multiples of the speed of light they were traveling or how far they had gone when the ship finally touched down we have arrived mr lomax announced korbekkian unlocking his door please do exactly as you are instructed once we leave the ship what about my weapons they will be returned to you after your interview your boss may want to see if i know how to use them korbekkian smiled you are the gravedancer that is sufficient lomax shrugged and walked out of his cabin what s the gravity here ninetyseven point two percent standard you will require no protective outfit no breathing apparatus no stimulants or depressants i assume that if you wanted me to know what world i was on youd have told me remarked lomax that is correct well lets get going follow me please korbekkian led him to the hatch and a moment later he found himself standing on a bleak sunbaked patch of ground there were enormous sand dunes in the distance and the wind created reddish dust devils near the horizon the air was hot and dry it may or may not have been a desert world probably there was an ocean somewhere for the air had a fair oxygen content but there was no question that he was in the middle of a desert one that extended in every direction as far as the eye could see youll adjust to the heat said korbekkian if you should begin feeling lightheaded let me know where are we going asked lomax it looks awfully empty were going to meet the anointed one answered korbekkian please bear with me mr lomax our transportation will arrive shortly lomax moved out of the direct sunlight into the shadow of the ship and lit a small cigar when it was half done a sleek armored vehicle approached them coming to a stop about ten yards away korbekkian gestured lomax to enter the vehicle then joined him it immediately took off at high speed and lomax settled back and relaxed watching the seemingly endless desert landscape go by neither korbekkian nor the driver said a word and the silent journey continued for the better part of thirty minutes at which time the vehicle suddenly slowed down and came to a stop korbekkian and lomax got out and the vehicle immediately sped away i take it were here wherever here is said lomax thats right mr lomax lomax stood hands on hips and surveyed his surroundings they were at an oasis whether natural or manmade he could not tell there was a large tent some thirty yards away made of a metallic fabric that seemed to soak up the sunlight and reflect it back in all the colors of the spectrum each time a breeze would pass over it the colors would change deepen combine and then separate again as if the tent itself were some kind of giant prism the tent was surrounded by some two dozen armed guards each with identical sonic rifles but possessing no common uniform about a mile to the west on a flat strip of sunbaked ground that ran between two small dunes was a large building though lomax could not tell if it was a garage or a hangar there was no landing strip but the ground was so flat and hard that he suspected none was really required atop the building was a very tall cylindrical antenna the sign of a subspace sending and receiving station which was doubtless tied into the nearby tent i expected something a little more elaborate commented lomax this is only one of some fifty outposts we have throughout the democracy and the inner frontier answered korbekkian it is merely a convenience he paused i would be surprised if the anointed one spends as much as three days a year at this location lomax made no reply let s move to the shade of a tree mr lomax said korbekkian theres no reason why we shouldnt be comfortable while awaiting your audience makes sense to me said lomax following korbekkian as the latter sought out a shady spot beneath the sparse branches of a desert tree that grew a few feet from the water not that we shall have to wait long added korbekkian after a moments silence oh im sure he will want to conclude your interview in time for us to depart from the planet before dark he smiled theres no sense giving you a chance to see the stellar configurations and possibly determine where you are i plan to be working for him long before dark answered lomax i certainly hope so im tired of sending overrated incompetents against the iceman the man should have been dead two months ago a young woman emerged from the tent and approached them he will see you now she said good said korbekkian starting forward just mr lomax she added korbekkian turned to him good luck i hope when you emerge that we are on the same team lomax followed her to the doorway of the tent where she stopped and turned to him you will address him as my lord she said because you are not yet a member of the faith you will not be required to kneel before him she continued you will bow when you are introduced and you will never turn your back to him and will back out of the tent when your meeting is concluded do you understand i understand answered lomax then enter said the woman stepping aside lomax lowered his head and stepped through the doorway where he was immediately greeted by two burly men who wore loosefitting outfits of some gleaming metallic fabric they indicated that he should walk between them and they escorted him through another doorway to the inner section of the tent the floors were covered with exquisitely woven rugs from a dozen worlds and the walls composed of a titanium alloy which made the room virtually impervious to assault displayed paintings and holograms from human and alien worlds there was a faint scent of incense in the air and the soft melody of an exotic alien symphony emanated from a silver cube that hovered a few feet above the floor near one of the holograms in the middle of the room was a jeweled chair and upon it sat a tall ascetic man with an aquiline nose high protruding cheekbones and large coalblack eyes he wore a robe of white and around his neck hung a single gold chain from which were suspended a number of jeweled religious charms sitting next to the chair was a huge animal basically feline in character possessed of sleek rolling muscles wickedlooking claws and enormous fangs its green eyes narrowed as lomax approached and it began uttering a series of deep growls the man in the white robe uttered a sharp command and the animal lay down still glaring at the bounty hunter when lomax finally came to a halt a few feet away the man in the white robe stood up welcome to my humble quarters he said in a rich deep voice i am moses mohammed christ known to true believers as the anointed one im pleased to meet you my lord answered lomax bowing deeply at the waist does my pet disturb you not if hes a pet no one else may approach him without losing a limb said the anointed one gently stroking the creatures head but as you see i touch him with impunity so i see said lomax if i were to tell him to attack you he would tear your throat out in less than a second continued the anointed one perhaps agreed lomax but if you told him to attack me who will you get to kill the iceman for you the anointed one smiled i like you mr lomax thank you my lord the smile vanished why do you wish to kill carlos mendoza i dont especially want to kill him replied lomax killing people is dangerous work id be just as happy to take a million credits from you not to kill him but i dont suppose youd care to pay me for not working would you this is not a matter for levity mr lomax said the anointed one sternly and the feline creature sensing his anger fidgeted uneasily it is essential that carlos mendoza be eliminated why that is none of your concern before i accept a commission i always like to know why im being asked to kill someone thus far you have accepted commissions only from normal men and you are not a normal man the anointed one opened his mouth between my teeth is the space he pointed to his ear on my left ear is the mole on my right shoulder is the birthmark i was born on the fourth day of the fourth month and the sun was hidden by the moon there can be no doubt that i am the anointed one meaning no disrespect my lord said lomax but granting that you are the anointed one just what exactly does that mean i am he whom the race of man has awaited for lo these many eons it is my destiny to unite the race to bring order out of chaos to expand mans dominion to the farthest reaches of the galaxy i thought the democracy was doing just that i forgive you your disrespect for you are not yet a true believer said the anointed one but know that the democracy is merely my forerunner that now that i have arrived upon the scene the democracys days are numbered god has chosen me to be his conduit to the race of man to rule them as he wishes them ruled do you see the throne upon which i sit yes the anointed ones face took on a fanatical glow god has instructed me to rule the galaxy from this throne to bring it with me to sirius v and to earth and ultimately to place it in a palace that i will build upon deluros viii from which i shall finally fulfill my destiny and rule his vast domain it sounds as if youve got your work cut out for you said lomax noncommittally i am closer to completion of the almightys design than you might think replied the anointed one with absolute conviction more than two hundred worlds have already pledged their allegiance to me and even as we speak my followers are converting the masses upon thousands more why should a man who controls hundreds of worlds and tens of millions of followers and who plans to take over the capital world of the democracy be concerned with a tavern owner far out at the edge of the inner frontier asked lomax honestly curious what kind of threat can the iceman possibly present to you mendoza repeated the anointed one he himself presents no threat at all then why do you want him dead i told you before it is not your concern perhaps not but if you want me to kill him youre going to have to tell me do you dare give orders to moses mohammed christ demanded the anointed one no my lord said lomax bowing once again please be assured that i meant no offense he paused i thought we could do business together i was mistaken the anointed one stared long and hard at lomax why should i believe that you can kill him when so many others have failed first because im the best there is answered lomax promptly and second because ive been to last chance before my presence wont alert him i can hire other men who have been to last chance true agreed lomax but last chance is the iceman s world and hes well protected they wont be able to kill him he paused i will the anointed one placed a fist to his chin and stared at lomax again even longer this time finally he spoke if you carry out this assignment successfully he said slowly as if weighing each word there will be others you will find that i can be as generous when rewarding success as i can be unforgiving when dealing with failure he paused because you cannot yet comprehend the true extent of my power and because you are not yet conversant in the ways of the one faith and because carlos mendoza must die i shall forgive you your transgression this one time and tell you what you want to know thank you my lord but thereafter should you fulfill your commission you will never question an order or an assignment again continued the anointed one is that clear perfectly my lord then listen closely for i will not repeat myself said the anointed one eventually the democracy will yield to my will even the billion ships of its vaunted navy will be unable to oppose me he paused for a moment looking at some distant point that only he could see in the entire galaxy there is only one force capable of standing against me of subverting the will of god and stopping me from bringing my throne to deluros viii the iceman said lomax frowning in disbelief i told you to listen not to speak said the anointed one harshly carlos mendoza presents no threat to me whatsoever but he is the only person ever to survive an encounter with my only true opponent if she has a reason to let him live then i care not what that reason is i want him dead she asked lomax like myself she is committed to the death of the democracy and yet she has chosen to align herself against me as well which will eventually cost her her life but not before millions have spilled their blood answered the anointed one who are you talking about her given name is unimportant he continued but in the past four years she has emerged from obscurity and assumed her true identity she is the prophet part the icemans book the silicon kid resplendent in a colorful new outfit and shining black boots walked into the end of the line tavern waited for the doors to slide shut behind him and looked around this was more what the inner frontier was supposed to look like he decided gamblers and whores miners and adventurers all of them armed all of them real or potential killers the blue pavilion really belonged in the democracy the end of the line belonged exactly where it was in a tradertown on a tiny frontier world called last chance he looked around the room once more happily aware that a number of the clients were staring at him curiously and nodded his head in satisfied approval finally he walked over to the bar whatll it be asked the iceman limping over to serve him a beer coming right up the iceman took an empty glass over to a tap murmured pour waited a moment ordered it to stop and slid the glass down the bar to the silicon kid want to run a tab asked the iceman no one beers all i want said the kid sliding some hexagonal coins down the bar he paused and stared intently at the iceman is something wrong asked the iceman eyeing the kid suspiciously thats funny said the kid what is you sure as hell dont look like a living legend well to tell you the truth i dont feel much like one answered the iceman but just out of curiosity what does a living legend look like i dont know said the kid but not like you he paused still you must be as formidable as they say just to get as old as you are son let me give you a little friendly advice if i may said the iceman studying the kid intently what is it whether or not im as formidable as they say im formidable enough he paused you cant see them but there are four guns trained on you at this very moment so my advice to you is not to do anything you might not live long enough to regret four said the kid surprised he looked around the room once more where are they that said the iceman with a grim smile would be telling he paused again and speaking of telling perhaps youd like to tell me just what youre doing on last chance i came here to find you okay you found me said the iceman what now now i deliver the gravedancers message the iceman stared at him what do you know about the gravedancer he asked at last you might say that were partners in a manner of speaking answered the kid no i dont think id say that replied the iceman men like lomax dont take on partners well said the kid mildly flustered he gave me his ship and he trusted me to deliver a message to you okay said the iceman what is it right here asked the kid at the bar the iceman looked amused theres no one within thirty feet of us would you rather tell me next to the roulette wheel or maybe in the men s room the kid shrugged and leaned on the bar the man who put out the hit on you is a religious cult leader called the anointed one the iceman frowned i never heard of him why does he want me dead i dont know the iceman began drying a glass with a bar towel while he considered what hed been told why didnt lomax just radio me the message he asked why send you he was going off to meet with the anointed one and well and you werent invited the kid nodded his head well thats what comes of being a junior partner theres more said the kid oh the kid pulled out lomaxs ring he said to show you this all right ive seen it said the iceman its his now whats the rest of the message that no matter what you hear on the grapevine hes not out to kill you am i going to hear that on the grapevine asked the iceman he seems to think so so he met with this anointed one under the guise of a freelance killer youre very quick well lets hope the anointed one didnt offer him so much money that he forgets where his loyalties lie he wouldnt do that said the kid youd be surprised what people would do for money said the iceman he pulled a bottle out from behind the bar picked up a couple of glasses and limped over to an empty table not too far from the doorway come on young man he said weve got some talking to do the kid followed him to the table and sat down opposite him have a drink said the iceman filling both glasses and shoving one over to the kid on the house thanks what is it a whiskey they make over in the binder system the kid took a sip it burned his tongue and throat but he forced a smile to his face good he muttered dont ever take a job as a diplomat or a politician said the iceman wryly i beg your pardon youre a lousy liar i said i liked it said the kid irritably downing the rest of the drink in a single gulp then fighting unsuccessfully to stifle a strangled cough how the hell did lomax ever hook up with you what is that supposed to mean demanded the kid it means i want to know how the hell lomax hooked up with you the iceman repeated calmly i did him a favor back on greycloud what kind i saved his life the iceman stared at him you he said with open disbelief me id ask how but youd probably tell me you think im lying asked the kid heatedly lets just say that i think youre exaggerating said the iceman youd better be he added if lomax needed you to save his life i hired the wrong man and i didnt get to be this old by misjudging the people i hire he paused where did you come across the anointed one we didnt we made contact with one of his men on olympus but i dont know where the anointed one himself is what do you know about him not much just that hes some kind of cult leader and he wants you dead youre sure its a he youre talking about and not a she asked the iceman finally taking a sip of his drink yeah at least korbekkian thats his man on olympus the guy who keeps hiring men to kill you korbekkian kept calling him he why asked the kid is there some woman with a grudge against you anythings possible said the iceman i just want to make sure shes not calling herself the anointed one these days so theres a woman out there somewhere who wants to kill you repeated the kid his face alight with interest what did you do to her its a long story said the iceman downing the remainder of his drink im all ears its also none of your business said the iceman you know youre not the friendliest guy i ever met said the kid look said the iceman ive had four men try to kill me in the past month men ive never seen before now you show up out of the blue to tell me that some religious nut ive never heard of wants me dead and that any day now im going to hear that the gravedancer is working for him now some people might feel friendly under these circumstances but i dont happen to be one of them but im here to help you said the kid you said the iceman with an amused smile what can you do youd be surprised the iceman shrugged probably i would be he paused whats your name they call me the silicon kid who does the kid swallowed hard anyone whos met me since i left greycloud he answered lamely all ten of em eh said the iceman well its an interesting name especially for a young man who seems to be all flesh and blood how did you come by it the gravedancer gave it to me in that case im properly impressed said the iceman why are you the silicon kid ive got implanted chips that let me see in the dark and into the infrared and ultraviolet spectrums and while i was on my way here from olympus i created one that will give me the fastest responses of any man in the galaxy you havent had it implanted yet no but its simple outpatient surgery said the kid if youve got a doctor on last chance i can have it done in less than an hour weve got one answered the iceman but he hasnt been sober for the better part of ten years if i were you id wait until i hit a bigger world the kid looked his disappointment i was kind of hoping to have it done here so i could protect you i thank you for the thought said the iceman but i dont need protection on my own world he paused besides im leaving this afternoon oh where are you going into the democracy why because if i stay here im a sitting duck for this anointed ones killers answered the iceman maybe lomax can handle the situation and maybe he cant but i dont plan to wait to find out but why the democracy asked the kid i never said the anointed one was there he paused hell i dont know where he is neither do i said the iceman but i damned well intend to find out and you think someone in the democracy can tell you oh yes said the iceman with certainty theres someone there who can tell me why travel all that way asked the kid why not just send him a subspace message i didnt say hed want to tell me replied the iceman just that he could he paused and he will he concluded grimly im coming along said the kid suddenly i dont recall asking you to there wont be any action here at all once you leave kid said the iceman seriously the graveyards are full of young men who came to the inner frontier looking for action believe me youll be much better off just waiting here until lomax shows up the kid shook his head theres a whole galaxy out there just waiting to be seen he smiled i plan to see it go touristclass youll live longer if you dont take me along ill just follow you in the gravedancers ship said the kid thats your prerogative answered the iceman try not to wreck it damn it iceman said the kid why cant i make you understand that im on your side kid you dont even know what the game is do you no admitted the iceman but im going to find out you might need me i doubt it once i get my chip implanted ill be the fastest gun anyone ever saw fast is good said the iceman accurate is better he paused again and knowing when not to shoot is better still if im with you you can tell me when to shoot and when not to telling you what to do isnt my responsibility said the iceman he stared into the silicon kids eyes you dont know what youre getting into if you have a brain in your head youll go back to greycloud and stay there you dont know what youre getting into either retorted the kid im already in it replied the iceman four men have come out here to kill me what makes you think theyll stop just because you leave last chance said the kid i could help you why why what asked the kid confused the iceman stared at him with open curiosity i never laid eyes on you until ten minutes ago why do you want to risk your life for me ive heard stories about you since i was a kid you probably arent going to believe it but youre one of my heroes im too old and fat and lame to be anyones hero said the iceman all the more reason why you need me you may be invulnerable on last chance but youre fair game once you leave look kid even if you get your implant all it means is that your reaction time is quicker isnt that enough the iceman looked amused again it means you can miss twice as many shots as most normal people the kid got to his feet picked up the bottle and walked over to the bar he placed it down at the far end then returned to the table can you shutter the windows and kill the lights he asked ive got a couple of dozen customers who wont appreciate it just for a few seconds why so i can prove to you that you need me the iceman stared at him then shrugged were going to darken the room for just a moment he announced to the assembled drinkers and gamblers theres nothing to worry about if youve got cards or money on the tables place your hands over them he waited a few seconds then nodded to one of his men who went into his office a moment later the doors closed the windows became opaque and the lights went off now what asked the iceman now i show you what i can do said the kid there was an instant of silence punctuated by the explosive sound of a bullet being fired from a handgun and then a crash what the hell was that demanded the iceman as a woman shrieked and a few men yelled obscenities the lights came on immediately and the iceman saw that about half his clients had drawn their own weapons its okay folks he said reassuringly nothing to get excited about take a look said the kid proudly pointing to the shattered liquor bottle on the bar the iceman limped over to the bar and stood a few feet away from the bottle staring at the glass shards that lay atop the bar you really can see in the dark the kid nodded and i can hit what im aiming at how do i know you didnt just remember where it was asked the iceman do you really think thats what i did asked the kid we can do it again and you can place it anywhere you want once the rooms dark the iceman considered the proposition then shook his head no it s not necessary i believe you well said the kid grinning confidently all right said the iceman im impressed how impressed asked the kid from this moment on youre working for me what does the job pay it depends on what i want you to do answered the iceman he pulled a wad of credits out of a pocket and handed them to the kid thisll hold you for awhile thanks said the kid taking the money when do we leave after i have lunch and pack my gear you can meet me over at the hangar thanks iceman said the kid you wont be sorry that remains to be seen said the iceman the name of the planet was sweetwater and it was a relatively new concept in interstellar real estate a retirement world for the very wealthy sweetwater boasted a golf course for every of its residents indoor and outdoor pools in every house quick home delivery from local stores a doctor for every two hundred people a guarantee of one mile of coastline along a freshwater ocean for every property owner imported birds of every shape and color daily spaceliner service to more than a dozen major worlds of the democracy literally hundreds of private hangars half a dozen brokerage houses that were tied into every major stock market in the democracy high security fences around every piece of property and a large but unobtrusive private security force for the entire planet it must cost a bundle to set up housekeeping here said the kid as he and the iceman emerged from their ship most of the people who live here can afford a bundle or two replied the iceman dryly who does live here anyone who can afford it must not be a large population remarked the kid there isnt said the iceman they walked through the spaceport which housed an elegant restaurant and two very upscale gift shops one of which dealt exclusively in rare and expensive pieces of alien art then emerged into the bright sunlight and warm dry air of sweetwater the man i have to see isnt going to talk in front of strangers said the iceman turning to the kid doctors arent exactly an endangered species on this planet why dont you get your chip implanted while i take care of my business and ill meet you back here in front of the restaurant in about five or six hours we can have a decent dinner before we take off suits me agreed the kid the iceman pointed toward an airlift that leads to a monorail platform from which you can get into what passes for a town in about ten minutes you wont have any trouble finding a doctor once you get there youre not going into town the iceman shook his head my man lives in the opposite direction ill rent a groundcar and drive out there okay said the kid see you later the young man walked off toward the airlift and the iceman made arrangements for his vehicle in a few minutes he was driving through the carefully landscaped countryside passing one oceanfront estate after another until he finally came to the one he sought he turned into a driveway proceeded for perhaps a quarter of a mile and then came to a highvoltage electronic field whos there asked a mechanical voice emanating from a holographic imaging station carlos mendoza checking files said the voice positive identification made then another voice was heard a human voice well ill be damned come on in the field dissolved and the iceman drove the remaining three hundred yards to an angular house constructed of an alien material that seemed to reflect hundreds of changing colors in a continuous pattern it was surrounded by pools decks and exotic gardens filled with tinkling crystalline flowers and one long glass wall offered a panoramic view of the bluegreen ocean he brought the vehicle to a stop then stepped onto a moving cushion of air that brought him gently to the second level of the house when he arrived at the front door he found it open and he stepped into a mirrored foyer where an old balding man with spindly arms and legs but sporting a small potbelly greeted him carlos mendoza its been a long time the iceman nodded how have you been i cant complain said the old man leading him through the foyer into a large circular room that afforded a fantastic view of the shoreline the icemans gaze swept the room and he smiled theyd lock you away if you did this is some place havent you been here before once just when you moved in ah yesmy retirement party the old man paused can i get you something to drink why not whatll it be he said walking to a bar that rose out of the floor as he approached it whatever youre having well ive been saving a bottle of cygnian cognac for a special occasion said the old man since youre my first visitor in more than a month i figure that makes it special enough sounds good to me said the iceman walking over to the window wall and looking out at the ocean nice view isnt it agreed the old man with a show of pride nice world for that matter makes me think i could learn to adjust to retirement there are a couple of properties for sale up the road said the old man no reason why you shouldnt consider it he touched a button on his wristwatch and a shining metallic robot entered the room two cygnian cognacs please sidney the robot bowed and left the room sidney repeated the iceman with a smile beats the hell out of calling it model au answered the old man have a seat carlos the iceman walked over and sat down on a chair that instantly adapted itself to his body while the old man seated himself a few feet away the robot reentered the room a moment later with two cognacs on a shining tray made of some alloy the iceman didnt recognize thank you sidney said the old man that will be all the robot bowed again how much did the little piece of machinery cost you asked the iceman plenty does it do anything besides serve you drinks it does on those rare occasions when i can think of something else for it to do answered the old man he took a sip of his cognac excellent they still make it better in the cygni system than anywhere else the iceman sipped his own drink youll get no argument from me there was a momentary silence as the old man stared at him so carlos he said at last are you really thinking of retiring i think about it all the time no reason why not agreed the old man youve certainly put in your time out there on the frontier and lord knows youve made enough money what s to stop you four different men have tried to stop me in the last month said the iceman i dont think i follow you someones put a hit out on me said the iceman i thought you might be able to help me find out why ive been retired for almost four years carlos said the old man i dont know whats happening on the inner frontier or anywhere else for that matter but you can find out how i know the name of the party that wants me dead i told you im out of touch come on said the iceman you were in the service for half a century you cant make me believe that they dont still call you to pick your mind or that you havent got a computer thats tied into the master computer on deluros viii the old man looked annoyed youre asking a lot for a man who just showed up out of the blue i gave you a lot said the iceman im not anymore said the old man they retired my code name when i quit these days im just plain robert gibbs if i hadnt agreed to go up against penelope bailey six years ago youd have been fired before you had a chance to quit said the iceman firmly it was s fat i pulled out of the fire a little over six years ago and its who owes me a favor im here to collect it you were well paid for that incident said gibbs so were you as your current surroundings go to prove the iceman paused you still owe me i dont see it that way carlos answered gibbs i was working for the government you were a freelancer who extorted an enormous fee for your services and gave you value received when no one else in the galaxy could have done so said the iceman and dont give me that holierthanthou attitude just because you stayed in the service i put in fifteen years with them before i went my own way they got their pound of flesh and then some nevertheless damn it i wouldnt ask for this favor if i didnt need it snapped the iceman i told you there have been four attempts on my life youve made a lot of enemies over the years true but the anointed one isnt one of them and hes the one whos after me gibbs looked at him startled the anointed one he repeated that s right gibbs got to his feet walked over to the window and looked out at the ocean why does he want you dead thats what i want to know i need whatever information you have on him i dont have anything but you can get it said the iceman gibbs nodded i can get it now it was the icemans turn to frown why this sudden change of mood i thought you were digging in your heels and telling me i had no business asking you for information this is different said gibbs turning to face him the democracys been after the anointed one for close to three years why because hes grown from a minor upstart into a serious problem answered gibbs the man may have as many as two hundred million followers why havent i heard of him then he began his operation on the outer frontier out by the rim and in the spiral arm he just reached the democracy about a year ago thats why im surprised that hes after you to the best of our knowledge he hasnt made any inroads on the inner frontier yet tell me about him said the iceman taking another sip of his cognac he purports to be a religious leader answered gibbs finishing his own drink and walking over to a small table where he deposited the empty glass he had some tax problems and one day the governments witnesses showed up dead thats when we started keeping an eye on him go on we dont know what his eventual goal is but we can tie him to more than fifty murders we know hes been buying arms at a phenomenal rate we know hes got a fairsized army in his employ and we know he finances them through a number of illegal businesses weve taken him to court on tax charges on more than eighty worlds and ninety percent of those cases are dragging on through endless postponements while he claims that hes a taxfree religious institution gibbs snorted contemptuously how many religions do you know of that possess a sizable army what do you think he s after gibbs shrugged i dont know hell no one knows at first we thought he actually planned to take over a number of worlds out on the rim and set up his own little empire but then he began expanding into the democracy itself surely he doesnt plan to go up against the democracy for a while we thought he did said gibbs staring out at his terrace where a trio of goldandpurple avians had landed at an automated feeding station but the navys got a billion ships said the iceman and theyre spread out over fifty or sixty thousand worlds one quick strike at deluros viii could cause so much chaos that we might actually be willing to strike a deal with him i very much doubt it well that was our original assessment anyway said gibbs in fact we pulled the rd fleet back to help defend the deluros system against an assault even though hes years away from having enough firepower to seriously consider it but in the last year or so he seems to have changed his focus oh gibbs nodded yes according to our informants he seems obsessed with another religious figure called the prophet who is probably a rival in the cult business he smiled and shook his head in wonderment i dont know where they get these names or these followings for that matter he paused anyway these days he seems to be skirting the democracy and expanding toward the galactic core which means hell reach the inner frontier anytime now why i was hoping you might tell me said gibbs after all youre the one hes trying to kill i never heard of the man until two days ago said the iceman staring through the window wall as two of sweetwaters three moons moved rapidly across the sky gibbs shrugged again well ive told you everything i know about him but not everything the democracy knows said the iceman i want to know where hes at right now if we knew wed go in after him i still want to know what the democracy knows said the iceman he stared directly at gibbs i want his confidential file gibbs ordered sidney to bring him another cognac i dont think there is one come on said the iceman contemptuously i used to work for the service remember im not kidding carlos they dont know a damned thing about him theyve got to have photographs holographs a past history a list of current associates thats classified material carlos said gibbs accepting the cognac from sidney the robot bowed picked up gibbss empty glass and retreated to another room i cant give you that sure you can just tie into deluros and tell them you want it youre still cleared for it theres bound to be some sensitive material that could embarrass the government and wouldnt help you at all said gibbs the service is not without its own elements of corruption if there are any agents or officials under investigation who have not formally been charged i wont turn their names over to you he paused and stared at the iceman thats my deal if i do get the file from deluros i insist that i go through it first and in private and give you only what i think is safe for you to have fair enough replied the iceman id like a file on the prophet too cant help you there and thats the truth said gibbs we dont have a thing on him in fact if our informants hadnt mentioned that the anointed one is obsessed with him we wouldnt even know the prophet existed obviously he considers the prophet a threat said the iceman if a man of such power is worried about the prophet how the hell can the democracy not know a thing about him beats the hell out of me carlos admitted gibbs but if anything turns up on him ill make it available to you under the same conditions i wont release any material that might embarrass the service he paused thats the best i can do all right agreed the iceman gibbs left the room walked down a long corridor entered his study activated his computer and put through his request for the anointed ones file while the iceman got out of his chair and walked around the room admiring the pieces of alien and human art that gibbs had acquired or more likely had purchased from his decorator a few moments later the old man reentered the room it should be just a couple of minutes he announced what i mainly want said the iceman is a list of the places im most likely to find him or his chief underlings a couple of holographs some material concerning his past and a list of the hit men hes used in the past i think he hires freelancers whenever he can answered gibbs and ill tell you right now there arent any photos or holos of him hes always had his associates represent him in court then how do you know hes a male demanded the iceman why do you think hes not because no one seemed to have heard of him six years ago gibbs paused trying to follow the icemans train of thought and finally smiled you think hes penelope bailey its possible said the iceman taking his seat again youre wrong carlos his name is moses mohammed christ which i think you will agree is a most unfeminine name also weve taken a number of his followers into custody and theyve testified that the anointed one is a male in his forties he paused besides penelope bailey is dead the iceman leaned forward intently say that again shes dead carlos not a chance said the iceman with absolute certainty she was confined in a cell on alpha crepello iii last time i saw her yes said the iceman the locals called it hades well hades no longer exists what are you talking about it was struck by a huge meteor about eighteen standard months ago answered gibbs theres nothing left of it except some dust and a bunch of asteroids in orbit around alpha crepello youre sure fly out there yourself if you dont believe me gibbs got to his feet the file should be here by now if youll excuse me the iceman sat silent and motionless for the entire time that gibbs was censoring the anointed ones file finally the older man reentered the room and handed the iceman a hard copy in a folder i hope this file proves useful to you said gibbs im no longer empowered to make such assignments but the democracy would be very grateful if you found a way to terminate the anointed one the democracy has got a bigger problem than some halfbaked religious fanatic with delusions of empire said the iceman grimly he stood up and walked to the door what are you talking about asked gibbs the iceman reached the doorway and turned none of you ever understood what you were dealing with he paused you still dont perhaps youd care to enlighten me said gibbs his voice reflecting his annoyance why bother you wont believe me try me the iceman stared at him penelope bailey is alive youre mistaken scoffed gibbs the hell i am said the iceman i told you alpha crepello iii was destroyed by a meteor i dont doubt it every living being on the planet was killed including her the iceman looked at gibbs for a long moment and sighed deeply youre a fool he said and walked out to his waiting vehicle the kid was waiting in front of the restaurant when the iceman returned to the spaceport everything go okay asked the iceman im a little bit sore replied the kid he used a local anesthetic and it s starting to wear off small price to pay to be the fastest gun in the galaxy said the iceman wryly now if you were only the most accurate gun as well im working on it the kid assured him itll take a lot of practice practice is for losers ill do it with chips suddenly he grinned im the silicon kid remember ill try not to forget again said the iceman sardonically how was your day asked the kid after a momentary silence not good said the iceman frowning not good at all oh theres no sense standing here talking said the iceman lets get some dinner and then well take off he summoned the maltre d who led them past a multicolored fountain in the middle of the floor and escorted them to a secluded table toward the back of the restaurant the kid immediately picked up a menu and studied it everything seems imported he noted youd think a temperate world like this could grow its own food that s not what this world was created for replied the iceman but its so expensive to do it this way if you live on sweetwater you dont wolry about prices i suppose youre right said the kid surveying his surroundings and toying with his crystalline wine and water glasses its a pretty nice place ive seen worse said the iceman see those shellfish in that tank he added pointing to a saltwater tank that was discreetly placed against a wall yeah theyre mutated said the iceman they come from the pinnipes system he paused i cant pronounce their name but theyre supposed to be the besttasting seafood in the galaxy ive never been a seafood fan well take my word for it said the iceman he looked across the room and those are real hesporite paintings on the wall not fakes he continued how can you tell watch when a waiter passes in front of them said the iceman theyll glow wherever his shadow falls how come they use the larvae of some phosphorescent insect in their paints answered the iceman they look like oils in the daylight but they glow in the dark i never knew that the iceman smiled there are probably a lot of things you never knew live long enough and youll learn some of them i get the feeling that you dont have much use for anyone younger than the gravedancer said the kid wryly not much agreed the iceman he signaled a waiter and ordered an antarrean wine while the kid requested a beer you know id never seen a live waiter until i left greycloud remarked the kid now ive seen them twice in a week theyre like most luxuries responded the iceman you pay for what you get and you pay plenty at a place like this uh until i figure out exactly what im going to do on the frontier im on a budget said the kid no problem said the iceman when you travel with me or work for me and right now youre doing both i pick up the tab are you that rich as a matter of fact i am how does someone get to be as rich as you asked the kid live a long time and dont do anything too stupid replied the iceman with a smile there it is again said the kid there what is this contempt for people my age not for all of them answered the iceman right now the most dangerous person in the galaxy is a twentyeightyearold woman named penelope bailey shes probably been the most dangerous person since the day she was born i never heard of her yes you did said the iceman you just never knew her real name who is she at various times shes been known as the soothsayer and the oracle the oracle asked the kid suddenly enthused right tell me about her in a minute said the iceman as their waiter brought them their drinks and recited the days special offthemenu selections the kid requested a plain steak and the iceman ordered a shellfish in a cream sauce would you like to select your own sir asked the waiter the iceman shook his head ill trust to your taste very good sir i do love seafood said the iceman when the waiter left you sure you dont want to have some you can get steak anywhere no thanks youre making a big mistake continued the iceman the sauce alone is worth the price of the meal get back to the oracle said the kid impatiently what is she like shes a young woman with a gift answered the iceman i first met her twenty years ago when she was just a frightened little girl but even then two hundred of the best bounty hunters on the inner frontier were no match for her youre telling me an eightyearold girl stood off two hundred armed bounty hunters said the kid skeptically the iceman smiled and shook his head you make it sound like she beat them in a shootout her gift doesnt work like that how does it work shes precognitive the kid frowned what does that mean it means she can see the future said the iceman more to the point it means she can see a number of futures and through her actions she can bring about the one thats the most favorable to her how the iceman shrugged as a string quartet walked over to the fountain and started filling the room with their music i dont know how it works i only know that it does work give me an example said the kid all right said the iceman lets say shes hiding from you in the cargo area here and youve been hired to kill her he paused and leaned forward whatever approach you take whatever entrance you use shell know it even before you do shell see an infinite number of futures maybe you kill her in all but three of them shell figure out what she has to do to bring one of those three favorable futures into being how asked the kid the iceman shrugged maybe itll be something as simple as her walking out one door while you walk in through another maybe it will be more complex like positioning you under a crate that will drop on you and kill you once in a million times and doing whatever it takes to make that milliontoone possibility come to pass maybe shell see that of all the possible futures theres one in which you die of a sudden heart attack shell analyze every facet of that future see how it differs from all the others and do what she can to bring it into being but surely there must be some futures in which she doesnt survive said the kid what if i surrounded the building with fifty gunmen probably shed still manage to find a future in which she escaped hah said the kid and one of the violinists glared at him keep your voice down said the iceman most of the diners would rather hear the music sorry said the kid but you said probably what if she couldnt then shed surrender to you and find some way to escape an hour or a day or a week from now the iceman paused not all problems are capable of immediate solution she was a prisoner of some alien bounty hunter chained to a bed in his room when a friend of mine first found her he paused to this day i still havent decided whether my friend actually found her or if she manipulated events so she would be found thats some gift that what did you call it that precognition said the kid that it is agreed the iceman thats why the democracy was so set on exploiting it the democracy who do you think hired all those bounty hunters said the iceman think of what someone who could not only see but manipulate the future could do theyd never lose a war or even a battle theyd know exactly how to handle a galactic economy they could probably just stand her on a new world and have her tell them whether it was worth the effort to set up mining operations or not he paused then smiled and of course if they found a way to control her theyd never lose an election never make a bad investment in the market never cheat on their spouses if there was a chance of being caught theyd know before they contracted cancer or some other disease and take whatever precautions were necessary to avoid it i begin to see now said the kid hell shed be worth billions thats what they thought answered the iceman thats why they were so hot to get their hands on her you make it sound likc they were wrong they didnt know what they were dealing with said the iceman lowering his voice still further as the quartets violinist began walking slowly throughout the room playing romantic solos at those tables where he thought he might cadge a tip what did they think they were dealing with asked the kid from their point of view this was a little eightyearold girl who just managed to elude their grasp from mine and i think time has proven me right this was a child who managed to remain free despite the best efforts of the largest and most powerful government in history to capture her a lot of legendary bounty hunters caught up with her at one time or another cemetery smith threefisted ollie jimmy sunday but when the dust cleared they were dead and she was still free she killed them all asked the kid his voice filled with disbelief not directly but yes she was responsible for their deaths as surely as if she had killed them herself the iceman paused again thinking back to the first time he had encountered penelope bailey the thing was she didnt look like the most dangerous human being in the galaxy she looked like a frightened little girl who was always hugging a rag doll for comfort but in the end everyone who was associated with her those who tried to capture or kill her and those who tried to protect her was dead and she was still free what about you i was lucky the iceman patted his prosthetic leg still this used to be flesh and blood but she didnt kill you she was very young and her powers werent fully developed answered the iceman she left me for dead she couldnt see far enough ahead then to know that id survive and that was your experience with the oracle the iceman shook his head she was just penelope bailey back then though some alien who had latched onto her practically worshipped her for all the good it did him in the long run called her the soothsayer and for a while the name caught on the waiter brought their salads out the kid pushed his aside while the iceman began eating his own needs a little pepper said the iceman certainly sir said the waiter supplying it and then walking off to the kitchen how did she become the oracle asked the kid well as i said she was very young and her powers werent mature answered the iceman she and her alien friend sought asylum on a planet called hades somehow the race that lived there figured out what she was and managed to imprison her in a room protected by an impenetrable force field as i said her powers werent fully developed at the time he took another bite of his salad anyway they made a deal with her they would feed her and keep her alive and she would direct them in their attempt to remain independent of the democracy over the next fourteen years pronouncements would come forth from her cell and the government of hades would act upon them thats how she became the oracle how did you get involved with her again the iceman sighed its a long story basically a man named who worked for the democracy hes the same man i saw earlier today hired me to kill her he took a last bite of his salad and pushed the bowl aside and since i knew what kind of threat she represented i took the commission but because she knew who i was i farmed it out to someone who was younger and tougher than i was you dont take any risks if you can avoid it do you said the kid not if i can help it said the iceman showing no irritation at the question i didnt get to be this old by looking for trouble the waiter arrived with their dinners and both men fell silent again until he left excellent said the iceman taking a mouthful of his shellfish im going to have to make a point of visiting more often okay said the kid as soon as the waiter was out of earshot so you hired someone else to kill her where do you come in you had to go through a lot of blue devils thats what we called the aliens to get to her said the iceman taking a taste of his meal and nodding his approval she was very valuable to them so she had layer upon layer of protection it was when i realized that my man was working his way to her too easily that i went there to try to stop him to stop him repeated the kid frowning why the fact that no one else had been able to stop him or even appreciably slow him down meant that she wanted him to succeed not in killing her but in reaching her prison and if she wanted it then i didnt so you saved her life the iceman shook his head her life was never in danger it probably hasnt been in danger since the day she was born but if your killer made it to her prison you still dont understand said the iceman stand her against that wall he gestured toward a wall of the restaurant and program a dozen laser weapons to fire randomly at her and shell know when each one will discharge and where each beam will hit and shell simply avoid them and if you fired so many beams from so many weapons that she couldnt avoid them all then shed find a future in which one of the weapons was a dud and exploded in your face before you could activate the rest of them so what happened on hades my man had certain information she needed something that could effectuate her escape he was killed before she could make use of him the iceman stared blankly out the window across the landing field he was a damned good man so she was still a prisoner on hades that s right and now she s free again the iceman nodded when did she escape the iceman shrugged i have no idea at least eighteen months ago how does someone escape from a force field i didnt know wed even developed the technology we havent the inhabitants of hades werent human they developed it so how did she escape from it i dont know where is she now the iceman shrugged again i had rather hoped she was the anointed one but ive got a feeling she isnt too many people have seen him and testified that he s a man in his forties just a minute said the kid you dont know when she escaped you dont know how she escaped and you dont know where she is is that right that s right then how do you know shes escaped at all because a meteor crashed into hades eighteen months ago and blew the whole damned world to smithereens no survivors well then thats it she died when the meteor hit the iceman shook his head not her if there was one future in a trillion in which the meteor didnt hit hades in which it missed the planet or was blown to bits by a weapon or another meteor shed have found a way to make it come to pass but that doesnt make any sense said the kid if she could make it miss the planet how come the planet was demolished because it was payback time answered the iceman with utter conviction sometime before it hit she found a way to escape from that force field and just as she could have chosen a future in which the meteor missed hades if she were still on the planet she could also choose the oneinamillion future in which it smashed into hades once she had left this was a race that had imprisoned her for close to two decades there was no way she was going to let them off the hook with merely a reprimand the kid considered what the iceman had said you really think she had the power to do that he asked dubiously i know she has said the iceman firmly the kid finally tried a piece of his steak and made a face whats the matter asked the iceman its cold the iceman who had been eating while they had been speaking took the last bite of his own meal pity he said you probably wont eat this well again for months you think shell be coming after you asked the kid chewing on a piece of nolongerwarm meat no said the iceman im no more to her than an insect no man is good said the kid leave her to the democracy and lets worry about the anointed one after twenty years the democracy still doesnt know what theyre dealing with said the iceman besides they think shes dead from the meteor yes well who knows maybe theyre right and youre wrong im not wrong said the iceman angrily okay youre not wrong said the kid what do you plan to do about it nothing said the iceman yet youre not going to go after her go where so its like i said lets concentrate on stopping the anointed one the anointed one is nothing but a minor irritant said the iceman a minor irritant whos paid five men to kill you the kid pointed out lomax will handle him said the iceman dismissing the subject or at least hell warn me if anyone else is coming after me we have more important things to worry about the kid frowned like what the iceman stared at him havent you heard a word ive said he demanded there is a monster loose in the galaxy and no one else is aware of the threat she presents he paused ive got to find out where she is what name shes using how well protected she is the kid frowned in confusion i thought you just said you werent going to go after her im not she knows who i am what i look like id be dead before i could get anywhere near her then what once i locate her the next step is to find out what shes planning to do he stared at the kid that s when i send you in me you want to be a genuine inner frontier hero dont you said the iceman with a grim smile yeah said the kid suddenly excited yeah i do there it is said the iceman as his ship braked to light speeds in the alpha crepello system the silicon kid walked over to the viewscreen you mean there it isnt the iceman looked away from the whirling dust and rocks that were the only things left in alpha crepello iiis orbit i had to make sure he said well now im sure and this penelope bailey did this just by wishing it said the kid staring at the dust and trying to imagine a planet in its place essentially replied the iceman its much more complex but thats the gist of it the kid let out a low whistle thats some lady he said she makes you and the gravedancer look like pikers have you got yourself a new hero now asked the iceman amused not me said the kid she scares the shit out of me he continued to stare at the viewscreen people just cant do things like that shes not a person said the iceman not anymore she hasnt been for a long time he paused thoughtfully maybe she never was they say she killed the forever kid when she was the soothsayer is that right not exactly the kid frowned confused i dont understand she didnt kill him explained the iceman she could have saved him but she chose not to legally its not the same thing morally it is all these legendary men and women and youre the only one who survived said the kid whats your secret the iceman shrugged i was lucky maybe once was luck not twice kid if i knew the answer to that id be willing to go up against her again maybe youve got some kind of power too suggested the kid one you dont even know about if i had it id know about it by now the iceman took one last look at where hades had been she killed one hell of a lot of blue devils he remarked a lot of men too i didnt know any men lived on hades they didnt but hades had three terraformed moons that were all populated by men port maracaibo port marrakech and port samarkand you dont see em now do you what happened to them they probably fell into the sun when the planet blew answered the iceman the kid was silent for a long moment and then spoke well to be fair about it she had some justification he said shed been a prisoner there for sixteen or seventeen years and that justifies killing every living thing on hades and all its moons they didnt have any reason to imprison her in the first place said the kid from what you told me they just spotted her talent and locked her away what would you have done asked the iceman the kid shrugged i dont know talked to her tried to find out what her plans were seen if there was any way to get her to work for me youre a fool how do you know that she doesnt plan to use her powers for good whose good responded the iceman hers or ours they might be the same theyve never been the same said the iceman youre making the same mistake and all the rest made you think because she looks human and had human parents she must be human he paused take it from me kidshe hasnt been a human being for a long long time if indeed she ever was the kid turned in his seat to face the iceman how can you be so sure of that because i know the way her mind works as much as any man can know anyway answered the iceman what frightens me and what ought to frighten the shit out of you and everyone else isnt that she has the power to blow hades to bits hell the navy can do that too he shook his head no what frightens me is that i know she did it without a single regret or second thought by the time she became the oracle she had evolved past all human reference points we mean no more to her than a grain of sand means to us she was human once said the kid doggedly you told me she was just a frightened little girl when you first met her there must be a shred of that humanity still remaining somewhere within her the iceman sighed heavily fine you search for it i plan to if i get the chance i wish you luck said the iceman closing the subject he commanded the ships computer to break orbit and take them out of the alpha crepello system ive seen everything i needed to see no sense staying here any longer what do we do now asked the kid now said the iceman selecting a world from the holographic display of the inner frontier and directing the navigational computer to lay in a course for it we head for confucius iv never heard of it its an ugly little world on the edge of the frontier why are we going there because you can usually buy information there what kind of information are we after asked the kid staring at the holographic display until it faded into nothingness were trying to get a line on the prophet the prophet said the kid surprised isnt he some bandit on the frontier possibly possibly repeated the kid you think it might be penelope bailey i dont know answered the iceman thats what i plan to find out he walked carefully to the galley pulled out an exotically shaped bottle and poured himself a drink you want some he asked sure said the kid what is it alphard brandy said the iceman handing the bottle and a glass to the kid not as good as the stuff they make in the terrazane system but it keeps better at light speeds thanks said the kid filling his glass and returning the bottle to the iceman do you mind if i ask you a question go ahead you didnt pick the prophet out of a hat said the kid taking a swallow of the brandy and deciding that he liked it theres hundreds of bandits with strange names out there what makes you think the prophet might be penelope bailey why not father christmas or undertaker mcnair or the border lord well the name fits said the iceman returning to his seat and setting his glass down on a panel in front of the navigational computer but thats secondary there have been prophets before there will be again he paused it was something told me what that the anointed one was thought to be building up his forces for some military action against the democracy but during the past year he seems to have changed his target now hes hunting for the prophet so what think it through said the iceman returning to his seat with his glass in his hand here is this fanatic with two hundred million armed followers all set to take on the democracy and suddenly he decides the prophet is a greater threat he stared at the kid the democracys got a navy of almost a billion ships and a standing army of maybe ten billion men now what do you think could possibly pose a greater threat than that you make it sound logical enough admitted the kid but its also possible that the anointed one decided that he wasnt up to defeating the democracy or maybe hes out to assimilate all the prophets followers into his fold what followers demanded the iceman according to the democracy hasnt got any hard information on the prophet dont you think theyd know if she had millions of men ready to fight on her command he paused again you say that the prophet is just a bandit on the frontier all right who has she robbed what sector is she operating out of i dont know said the kid he stared at the iceman but neither do you for all you know the prophet is just some smalltime bandit like i said its possible then why go on some wildgoose chase after her or him as the case may be im going after penelope bailey because the democracy thinks shes dead they sure as hell arent going to go looking for her he paused and the reason im going to try to find the prophet is even simpler i dont have any other leads he took a deep breath and released it slowly and theres one other thing oh what ive never met the anointed one in my life said the iceman i never even heard of him until a couple of weeks ago what has that got to do with the prophet maybe nothing admitted the iceman picking up his glass and taking another sip but if weve never met and i havent hampered him in any way then i can think of only one reason he wants me dead he paused again im the only person ever to meet penelope bailey and live to tell about it that could imply that im working for her but youre not the kid pointed out the iceman smiled you know it and i know it but the anointed one has no reason to know it the only thing he knows is that ive been in her presence a number of times and im still alive youre working with even less information than he is responded the kid finishing his brandy in a single gulp both in regards to the anointed ones motives and penelope baileys identity if shes still alive youre supposed to sip your brandy said the iceman ill remember next time said the kid please do its expensive stuff if youre just thirsty ive got water and beer all right said the kid irritably i said id remember and i will he paused so how do we go about learning if youre right or wrong about the prophet we assume that im right and that shes penelope bailey and we proceed based on that supposition said the iceman well start on confucius iv i dont know anything about the prophet you dont know anything about the prophet even the democracy doesnt know anything about the prophet but we do know that the prophet exists people have heard of her people talk about her youve heard of her and we know that the anointed one is searching the inner frontier for her the iceman paused and drummed his fingers on the computer panel so we start going from one likely world to another until we find someone who knows something more about her than her name maybe well get a location maybe the scene of a recent crime maybe the name of an associate but sooner or later well get something and then then we keep piecing together bits of information until we know if shes penelope bailey or not i dont know about this said the kid doubtfully this whole scenario youve built everything youve said its all supposition true agreed the iceman but it feels right so were going all over the inner frontier chasing some bandit because it feels right said the kid displaying a sardonic smile when you pay the bills well do it your way said the iceman in the meantime if you have any objections i can let you off on the nearest oxygen world no ill stay with you said the kid ive still got a lot of worlds to see i might as well see them on salary he paused thoughtfully and if she really is alive i want to see her suddenly he smiled who knows maybe ill go down in history as the man who killed penelope bailey i wouldnt bet my last credit on it said the iceman dryly confucius iv wasnt much of a world it consisted of three abandoned tradertowns a handful of mines which were mostly played out some enormous flat fields that didnt have rich enough soil or get enough rain and one small city the city new macao was pretty unimpressive even by the standards of the inner frontier its cobblestone streets created to be charming were in dire need of repair and caused equal havoc to feet and tires the major hotel resembled a steel and glass pagoda and the rooms were furnished with the same lack of taste displayed by the architect another hotel resembled an emperors palace as conceived by someone who had never seen either an emperor or a palace the streets were narrow and winding with an abundance of bars and drug dens and an absolute minimum of official supervision i like it said the silicon kid as he and the iceman walked down the main street past the two hotels and a trio of overpriced nightclubs its filthy and dangerous replied the iceman thats what i like about it its exotic your definition of exotic and mine differ considerably said the iceman wryly look at the men standing in the doorways of some of those buildings said the kid excitedly ill bet ive seen half of them on wanted posters probably said the iceman i suppose i should warn you that that doesnt necessarily make them desirable companions ive been rubbing shoulders with farmers all my life said the kid at least these guys figure to be more interesting when s the last time a farmer took your wallet cut your throat and left you for dead in the street id like to see someone try it now that ive got my implants said the kid confidently you would said the iceman with an amused smile well maybe i can accommodate you what are you talking about asked the kid suddenly tense when we turn off of this street just keep twenty yards behind me i guarantee youll have a chance to try out the new improved you what about you me i gave up showing off half a century ago no said the kid i mean if this place were going is dangerous why wont they go after you too because they want to live the kid laughed youre a fat old man with a limp thats right then why should they leave you alone because im the iceman came the reply in such a cold voice that the kid decided his aging companion was more formidable than he looked so where are we going a place even the police dont go answered the iceman its just a couple of more blocks has it got a name nightmare alley picturesque remarked the kid accurate replied the iceman they walked for another fifty yards then turned down a narrow side street this is nightmare alley asked the kid soon said the iceman they walked past two dilapidated buildings then came to a winding alleyway and suddenly the character of the area changed from something that the kid thought was exotic and iceman thought was merely rundown to something that both agreed was deeply weird club after club lined the alley most with their own barkers there was a drug den a betting parlor a bar another drug den a pornographic stage show a whorehouse for men a whorehouse for women a whorehouse for aliens and a whorehouse for those desiring that most taboo of vices interspecies sex taverns each darker and more disreputable than the last catered to all races shrill screams and raucous laughter came from the whorehouses and terrified screams emanated from one of the drug dens there were a pair of weapon shops one specializing in laser pistols and rifles the other in projectile firearms and the kid had the feeling that not a single weapon in either shop possessed a serial number every fifteen feet or so they came to a body lying on the pavement some appeared drunk others comatose the iceman paid them no attention i think i just saw lizard malloy in that bar across the alleyway whispered the kid excitedly well this is a good place to stay when theres a price on your head replied the iceman a few faces peered out at the iceman and the kid from the interiors of the buildings they passed but no one made any move to hinder them and even the barkers stepped aside as the iceman approached them they seem to know you said the kid impressed they know enough not to bother me anyway answered the iceman i thought you hadnt left last chance in four years that s right you must have made quite an impression the last time you were here the iceman made no reply but began slowing down were going in there he said gesturing toward a doorway once were inside keep your mouth shut and your eyes open got it right said the kid he paused uncertainly what am i looking for youll know it when you see it said the iceman he entered the doorway followed by the kid welcome to the house of usher said a tall man dressed in faded formal garb he stared at the iceman and suddenly a look of recognition crossed his face its been a long time mr mendoza we heard rumors that you had been killed i can only be killed with a silver bullet replied the iceman with a wry smile i thought everyone knew that he pulled out a hundredcredit note and handed it to the man im renting a table near the bar its my office for the next two hours the man grabbed the note and nodded theres another hundred credits for you for every person you bring to my office if they have anything useful to sell what are you buying information theres all kinds of information mr mendoza pass the word that the iceman is interested in information about the prophet the man rubbed his chin thoughtfully that may be more difficult than you imagine mr mendoza ive only heard the prophet mentioned twice in all the time ive been here this is nightmare alley said the iceman someone will know something he pulled out two more notes put the word on the street too tell them ill be here for two hours and then im leaving confucius ill pass the word as soon as i take you to your table dont bother said the iceman i know the way as the tall man walked out the door the iceman turned to the kid follow me and dont stare at what at anything you see it s in bad taste the iceman led him through a labyrinthian corridor that passed a number of dimly lit rooms in one a number of men and women all addicts of the alphanella seed lay in various states of stupor and catatonia their pupils dilated their eyes wide open their faces contorted in nightmarish smiles in another three greenskinned aliens mildly apelike in appearance sat naked on the floor surrounded by perhaps two hundred blueglowing candles each alien was dissecting a small animal the kid tried to ignore the little animals screams of pain and wondered if he was observing a religious ritual or an illegal dinner or both they passed three more cubicles each with humans or aliens doing things that they were never meant to do and finally they came to the bar there were a dozen tables evenly spaced throughout the room all but three of them occupied by a relatively equal number of humans and aliens and the iceman picked the one that was farthest from the corridor through which they had entered the two men who were sitting there took one look at him and left hurriedly as he approached welcome back mr mendoza said the bartender a grossly obese bald man with a handlebar mustache that had been dyed a bright blue its been a long time not long enough said the iceman distastefully and the bartender chuckled bring us a pair of beers the bartender nodded and waddled over with their drinks a moment later sure i cant interest you in a dust devil or a blue giant he asked panting from the effort of walking across the room just the beers said the iceman tossing a pair of maria theresa dollars on the tray maybe later said the bartender maybe said the iceman and the bartender retreated to his station this is some place said the kid unable to keep the excitement from his voice you like it here asked the iceman dont you the scum of the inner frontier if they sink low enough eventually wind up on confucius iv and the worst of them turn up in nightmare alley if i didnt have business to transact you couldnt pay me to spend two seconds in this place it s got atmosphere said the kid yeah said the iceman well if you scrub hard enough in the shower most of itll wash off youve got no sense of adventure said the kid with a smile this isnt an adventure kid its a business and a deadly one at that the kid lowered his voice see that woman at that table over there the skinny one with the red hair yes i think it s sally the blade so what shes killed thirty men maybe thirtyfive said the kid excitedly i know do you know her personally id like to meet her why dont you just walk over and ask for her autograph said the iceman caustically maybe i will dont why not you dont come to the house of usher to meet starstruck farm boys said the iceman you come here to conduct business that man shes with isnt here just to buy her a drink and talk her into bed and i dont think hed appreciate having a stranger come up and start talking the iceman paused he might even think you had some notion of blackmailing him once sally does what hes paying her to do the kid considered the iceman s statement all right he said sullenly but you dont have to make fun of me just keep your mind on business said the iceman were here to find out about a woman who destroys entire worlds as easily as sally slits throats they sat in silence for perhaps ten minutes then a very small man his face disfigured by some skin disease that had gone untreated walked up to them and sat down word is that youre looking for the prophet he said in a hoarse voice thats right said the iceman what are you paying depends what youre selling for three hundred new stalin rubles i can put you next to a guy who works for him on this planet no said the man but hes not far from here you can reach him in half a day and when i find out he doesnt exist or that hes never heard of the prophet how long will it take me to find you again asked the iceman are you calling me a liar demanded the man heatedly no just a lousy salesman said the iceman now go away i aint going anywhere till you pay me something for my time said the man kid said the iceman give him something for his time the kid drew his sonic pistol so fast that even the iceman who was expecting it couldnt follow the motion a fraction of a second later it was pointed directly at the man s head you want the down payment now or later asked the iceman the man glared at him trying to keep the fear from his face then muttered a curse under his breath and scuttled off toward the corridor i assume that was what you wanted me to do said the kid the iceman nodded but dont shoot anyone unless i tell you to he said we wont be able to do any business if word gets out that were killing the customers we dont need customers like him were passing the word to the dregs of humanity replied the iceman five out of six customers are going to be exactly like him offer them enough for a drink and a fix and theyll swear to anything sell you any information youre looking for and be long gone or dead by the time you find out they were lying so how will you know whos telling the truth there are ways said the iceman he got to his feet returned their empty glasses to the bar and ordered two more beers before he could take his first swallow a welldressed man with long flowing golden hair sat down next to him youre the iceman he asked thats right i know a little something about the prophet what about him asked the iceman first of all its a her the iceman pulled out a roll of bank notes peeled one off and laid it on the table in front of the blond man keep going he said shes on the inner frontier said the man where im not sure what world at various times ive heard she was on oceana port raven and primrose the iceman laid another note on top of the first whats her game word is that shes raising an army that she wants to take over some of the frontier worlds the iceman didnt pull out a note this time word is wrong she doesnt need an army hey im just telling you what ive heard what else do you know or think you know about her she must have access to some awfully powerful weapons said the man they say she blew up some alien world old news replied the iceman refusing to peel off another note you got anything else thats it said the man picking up the two bank notes just a minute said the iceman as the man started to get up yeah ill double what youve got if you can give me a name a name the man looked puzzled the name of the person who told you the prophet is a woman wont do you much good hes dead ill pay a hundred credits for the name anyway the man paused and stared at him curiously zanzibar brooks he said at last who was he he did a little of everything you know what i mean i know what you mean said the iceman was there paper on him yeah fifty thousand credits dead or alive he paused he died in some bar brawl on port raven a couple of months ago suddenly he smiled if id have known it was going to happen id have shot him myself and cashed the reward he actually saw the prophet he said he did the iceman gave him a final bank note thanks my pleasure said the man if you have anything else to ask me ill be in one of those rooms down the hall he got up and left the table did you believe him asked the kid he answered the first question right said the iceman as for the rest its just hearsay and if theres one thing penelope bailey doesnt need its an army he took a long swallow of his beer but if we dont find out anything more well send a message to port raven and see if we can learn where this zanzibar brooks spent the last year of his life two more men and a woman approached them in the next hour none of them with anything to sell except sob stories about how they needed the money the lceman was about to leave when a tall lean man entered the room looked around and approached his table youre mendoza he asked right my names quinn mind if i sit down be my guest the man named quinn seated himself whos he he asked gesturing toward the kid with his head a friend anything you have to say you can say in front of him quinn smiled for what youre paying me ill say it in front of everyone you dont know what im paying you if its less than five thousand credits weve got nothing to talk about the iceman stared at him appraising him carefully what do you think you know thats worth five thousand credits quinn leaned back on his chair and smiled confidently i know where you can find the prophet he paused are we in business or do i walk were in business said the iceman i havent seen any money yet the iceman pulled out his roll and counted out five thousand credits then laid it on the table in front of him start talking he said shes on mozart mozart i never heard of it theres a star in the terrazane sector called symphony said quinn they named all the planets after composers even the ones that werent habitable beethoven and sondheim are gas giants mozart is the third planet out from the star what makes you think shes on mozart asked the iceman because ive seen her said quinn what does she look like blonde medium height late twenties rather pretty actually the iceman shoved the pile of notes over to quinn what else can you tell me about her shes one very strange lady i can tell you that the iceman laid his roll of notes on the table keep talking i work on a cargo ship said quinn two weeks ago we developed engine trouble near the symphony system and went into orbit around mozart while we made repairs some of us got to spend a day on the planet and its not much of a world just an agricultural colony that supplies food to half a dozen nearby mining worlds but she rules it as if she were some kind of goddess i mean her word is law and god help anyone who disobeys her who even thinks of disobeying her he paused she must be some kind of mutant or something because she seems to know what theyre thinking even before they do theyve tried to kill her a couple of times and even though she doesnt have any bodyguards theyve never gotten close to her i mean hell i saw her myself plain as day walking through town like she didnt have a care in the world she never even asked what we were doing there it was like she already knew how long has she been there asked the iceman quinn shrugged maybe four or five months why why what why is she on mozart whats her purpose there thatll be another five thousand the iceman counted off the amount and quinn grabbed the money greedily she plans to set up her own empire in the inner frontier said quinn she told you that no but she told someone on mozart that i spoke to youre sure i got no reason to lie to you how does she plan to go about it they say shes pretty tight with a bunch of mercenaries replied quinn maybe she plans to use them and pick up one colony world after another do you know anything else about her asked the iceman thats it well youve been most helpful mr quinn let me buy you a drink before you leave youve done enough for me already said quinn smiling and holding up the wad of money its no problem i really have to be going but i insist said the iceman i told you i have to suddenly quinn was looking into the barrel of the kids sonic pistol try to be a little more gracious mr quinn said the iceman getting to his feet ill be right back with your drink he walked over to the bar whispered something to the obese bartender then returned a moment later with a drink here you are mr quinn he said pleasantly placing the drink down on the table in front of quinn if you think you can poison me right here in front of everyone you should know that i have friends said quinn how very comforting said the iceman now drink up quinn looked at the kids pistol once more and then very slowly he lifted the glass up to his lips now swallow it said the iceman sternly quinn closed his eyes took a deep breath and downed the drink in a single gulp then he leaned back half expecting to die in hideous agony when nothing happened he blinked once then leaned forward seemed about to say something and then became almost rigid its all right mr quinn said the iceman you can hear and understand every word im saying let me assure you that you have not been poisoned nor do i intend to rob you i just want to repeat a couple of my questions he paused what is the prophets purpose on mozart i dont know murmured quinn his words slurred slightly and no one on mozart told you that she planned to set up her own empire did they no but you did see her there yes thank you very much mr quinn said the iceman he leaned over and took half of his money back you earned the first five thousand credits but you really shouldnt be so greedy i didnt get to be a rich man by paying people to lie to me he got to his feet and motioned the kid to do the same were going to leave now mr quinn he continued your muscles will respond to your commands in about ten minutes and youll suffer no side effects from the drug i had placed in your drink its a powder that encourages you to tell the truth with just enough of a narcotic added so that you should enjoy the next couple of minutes immensely he gave the motionless man a friendly pat on the shoulder and suddenly his voice became low and ominous i would strongly suggest that you enjoy your five thousand credits and that you make no attempt to follow us when you are once more capable of movement then he and the kid walked back through the labyrinthian corridor and out the main entrance of the house of usher what do we do now asked the kid as they began walking down nightmare alley now repeated the iceman now we follow our lead as far as we can we try to learn a little more about mozart and we try to find some more people who have been there and seen the prophet then we try to find out what shes done that has alerted the anointed one to her presence and made him decide that she presents a greater threat to him than the democracy does if she does the kid corrected him oh she does all right said the iceman with absolute conviction im just surprised that hes figured it out and once we do all that said the kid then we go to mozart one of us does answered the iceman the iceman remained on confucius iv for another day but could learn nothing further about the prophet however the silicon kid managed to learn a little something about the iceman they were sitting in the lobby of their pagodalike hotel having breakfast prior to going to the spaceport when quinn entered the building walked across the lobby and confronted them i see youre feeling better said the iceman pleasantly you son of a bitch snarled quinn attracting considerable attention from the other diners you doped me up and took my money you sold information you didnt have answered the iceman that made it my money its mine and im here to take it back if i have to kill you for it i will the kid tensed but the iceman leaned over and laid a restraining hand on his shoulder the man means business he said wed better give him what he wants but began the kid its just money said the iceman its not worth dying for he reached into the pocket where he kept his roll of bills while quinn watched him intently then he calmly pulled out a small pistol and fired it pointblank between quinns eyes two women shrieked and a waiter dropped his tray the tall man was dead before he hit the ground i told you it wasnt worth dying for said the iceman to the corpse you killed him said the kid i sure as hell hope so you didnt even give him a chance you think this is some kind of a game said the iceman irritably we dont play by any rules out here he paused the man came here to rob me or kill me maybe you think i should have waited for him to draw his weapon the kid made no reply and the iceman got to his feet as the manager and two security guards approached him everyone in the restaurant was a witness said the iceman he threatened to kill me he threatened to kill you if you didnt give him your money said a man at the next table same thing said the iceman i didnt come here to be robbed at gunpoint his guns still in its holster noted the manager the iceman shrugged he was a lousy robber weve got the whole thing on holotape said one of the security guards if it happened the way you said you dont have any problem i never did replied the iceman and somehow the kid knew that he was right two policemen entered the hotel a moment later and walked over to the crowd that was clustered around quinns body then listened as the iceman repeated his story sounds good to me said one of them you want to come down to headquarters and make a statement ill make it right here said the iceman the man was a fool he paid for his foolishness that wasnt the kind of statement i had in mind said the officer with a smile its the only one i care to make replied the iceman can you check the holotape this morning my associate and i plan to leave confucius this afternoon the officer stared at him intently youre carlos mendoza arent you yes the officer nodded i thought so he said if you say it was selfdefense thats good enough for me youre free on your own recognizance and well view the tape before noon if it supports your story youll be free to leave on schedule fair enough said the iceman the holotape venfied the icemans account of the incident and they took off in early afternoon now i know why they call you the iceman remarked the kid as they left confucius far behind them oh youre as cold and emotionless as you say penelope bailey is said the kid im not saying thats a bad way to be he added hastily out here its probably a survival trait he paused you must have been one hell of a dangerous man when you were younger im more dangerous now the kid stared at him for a long moment then shrugged if you say so he paused by the way a lot of people on confucius seemed to know you ive done business there before they all called you mendoza rather than the iceman continued the kid why nicknames come and go but ive been carlos mendoza all my life the iceman fits you better thank you i think replied the iceman with an amused smile what other names have you had over the years theyre not important they fell silent for the next few minutes then the kid walked to the galley and made himself some dinner when he returned to his seat he found that the iceman was studying the navigational computers holographic representation of the terrazane sector looking for mozart asked the kid ive found it said the iceman indicating a star that was blinking a bright yellow this is symphony mozart is the third planet circling it how far away is it from here said the iceman at full speed we can make it there in a little over one standard day what do i do once i get there asked the kid eventually youll try to get close enough to penelope bailey to find out what her plans are as for what youll do immediately i dont know yet thats why were heading for aristotle aristotle its a university planet on the edge of the democracy well pay a fee and tie into their computer and find out what we can about mozart why dont we just tie into the master computer on deluros viii asked the kid because shes more likely to have someone monitoring the master computer than the one on aristotle replied the iceman what makes you think so persisted the kid after all if shes as bright as you say i never said she was bright i said she was precognitive whatever said the kid why wont she be monitoring the computer on aristotle the iceman leaned back and switched off the holographic display shes the most powerful and dangerous being alive but shes not without her limitations he said at last she spent her childhood on the run until she was eight years old and she spent the next sixteen or seventeen years in a twentybytwenty cell how much of the galaxy can she have seen deluros viii is the capital world of the race of man so of course she knows about it but ill bet shes never even heard of aristotle youd better be right said the kid you may be making the bet but im the one who has to pay if youre wrong im not wrong said the iceman she has powers beyond anyones comprehension but shes not allknowing he paused anyway once we learn a little more about mozart well have a better idea what identity you should assume there why dont i just show up as a gun for hire suggested the kid the iceman chuckled whats so funny demanded the kid nobody ever needed a hired gun less than penelope bailey said the iceman besides even if she did shed want references and since im the only reference youve got you wouldnt make it to noon i could say i worked for the gravedancer lomax is a hired gun he doesnt hire them himself the kid shrugged it was just a suggestion if you believe even half of what ive told you about her it was a stupid suggestion answered the iceman if you want to live through this youd better start using your brain all right said the kid irritably you dont have to bite my head off your head is all youve got said the iceman my advice to you is that you remember that and forget about your siliconenhanced physical abilities some of those abilities may prove damned useful on mozart like what like being able to see in the dark she doesnt have to see shell know where you are and where youre going to be thirty seconds and thirty minutes from now if im so stupid and so useless why are you sending me in at all demanded the kid id go myself if i could but i cant hide this limp and besides shed know who i was anyway he paused youre going in because youre the only piece ive got to play thanks for building my confidence said the kid sardonically just see that you dont get overconfident responded the iceman no matter how ive prepared you if you live long enough to meet her what youre going to see is a very normallooking young woman and youre going to think ive exaggerated the threat she poses he paused for a moment just remember better men than you have tried to stop her and every last one of them is dead then why am i going in at all youre not going there to hurt her or even threaten her answered the iceman youre just trying to get some information if she cant see far enough ahead if she doesnt know what you plan to do with it you just might come out of this in one piece the iceman stood up stretched his arms and turned to the kid im going to grab some sleep before we reach aristotle he announced you might consider doing the same the kid nodded and went to his own bunk he was sure that he would have a difficult time falling asleep but after what seemed only a moment to him the iceman was shaking him by the shoulder whats the matter he said groggily sitting up abruptly and inadvertently banging his head against a bulkhead am i in the wrong bunk the iceman smiled there are only two then whats wrong nothing youve been asleep for eleven hours he paused were in orbit around aristotle youre kidding said the kid getting stiffly to his feet check the ships chronometer if you dont believe me said the iceman i already made us some breakfast you never miss a meal do you not if i can help it the kid joined the iceman in the galley which was almost as claustrophobic as the cockpit did you ever consider getting a bigger ship he asked as he picked up his coffee mug and took a swallow i suppose if i had thought about it i would have admitted the iceman i had never planned to leave last chance again not much of a world if you ask me i didnt a man like you with the money youve made you ought to be living next to your friend on sweetwater its a matter of taste answered the iceman i like the inner frontier sweetwater is on the frontier but its not really a frontier world said the iceman its a haven for retired billionaires last chance suits me just fine i kind of liked confucius myself said the kid especially nightmare alley youre young yet the ships computer beeped twice yes said the iceman i have established a link to the geopolitical computer on aristotle announced the computer good said the iceman extract whatever information it has on a planet called mozart star system asked the computer symphony in the terrazane sector working extracted all right said the iceman now see if its got any data on a human known as the prophet working negative all right said the iceman break the connection and have the connect fee billed to my account on binder x working done connection broken said the computer now give me a hard copy of what you extracted a moment later the computer produced a single sheet of paper thats everything asked the iceman frowning yes deactivate he picked up the sheet and read it then looked at the kid theres not much information here to go on he announced so i gather replied the kid what do we have the iceman looked down at the sheet again mozart is an oxygen world ninetysix percent standard gravity population as of the last census he paused the population breaks down this way sixtythree percent agricultural twentytwo percent in the export business and of course what theyre exporting are agricultural products the rest in miscellaneous businesses no standing army no navy the planet is divided into six states with a central governing body thats elected every three years only one spaceport no tourist industry so i show up as a farm worker looking for a job asked the kid the iceman shook his head you get stuck on a farm you might never get off it i could go to one of their towns and hire on at some store i suppose too obvious answered the iceman after some consideration i mean who the hell goes to an agricultural world to work as a clerk or even a store manager then what the iceman stared at him for a long moment youre the silicon kid he said go there as a specialist selling your skills he paused waiting for the full scenario to come to him and then spoke again you travel the inner frontier creating whatever chips are needed a farmer with a predator problem needs to see in the dark to protect his stock an exporter needs to store a dozen alien languages in his head a bartender wants to be able to mix drinks faster you can produce the chips they need i think it should work im good said the kid but im no miracle man and no surgeon even if i make the chips i cant implant most of them thats not your job said the iceman shrugging it off your job is just to create the chips its up to the buyers to get em implanted on a planet with a population of only twentyseven thousand men there might not be a doctor who can do it all the better said the iceman itll give you a reason to hang around until one can be sent for theyre not going to let you leave until they know your product works what kind of chip can i sell penelope bailey asked the kid she doesnt need one too bad said the kid it would have been a great way to make her notice me youre just going there to get information said the iceman if youre very lucky she wont notice you at all you dont make her sound like the type who confides in her lieutenants said the kid if i dont make personal contact with her how am i going to find anything out id be surprised if she has any lieutenants replied the iceman as for gathering information keep your eyes and ears open you mean like see if theyre importing arms and ammunition the iceman shook his head she doesnt need that then what i wish i could tell you said the iceman itll probably be something very ordinary until you remember that a very extraordinary woman is behind it give me an example see if shes ordered half a dozen books about deluros viii it could mean she plans to go there next find out if shes ordered a lodin language tape she could be planning an alliance with the lodinites dont bother with what shes doing now shes seen the present so many times in so many of its manifestations its almost as if shes walking through a play whatever shes saying and doing now is old news to her shes looking days or weeks ahead thats not a hell of a lot to go on said the kid the iceman smiled grimly were you under the delusion that this was going to be easy no but just remember that youre only there for information and if it s too difficult to get if you have to rob or kill someone to obtain it forget it because shell see what youre going to do before you even think of it do you understand what im saying to you yes good because your life depends on it the iceman paused for a moment your life and maybe forty trillion others he amended part the silicon kids book mozarts spaceport was just beyond the city limits of minuet a town that supplied the surrounding agricultural community with the basics a grocery store a very small medical clinic a trio of seed stores a pair of restaurants some small hotels and a theater that housed live entertainment four or five days a year just past the spaceport were huge silos where mutated corn and wheat were dried out and stored until they could be shipped and enormous pens that held genetically altered cattle that topped four thousand pounds at maturity the kid landed made arrangements to store the iceman s ship in a hangar and then entered the small spaceport where a slidewalk took him directly to a customs booth he entered it sat down and faced a computer with a glowing red sensor name said a mechanical voice neil cayman he replied then added also known as the silicon kid display your passport to the sensor please he held his passport up are you bringing any foodstuffs or animals from offplanet no please state the nature of your business on mozart i am a salesman specializing in customtailoring computer chips for surgical implantation do you possess cash or a line of credit totaling at least two thousand credits or its equivalent the kid held up the money the iceman had given him and the sensor scanned the denominations no visa is required for your trip to mozart please enjoy your stay neil cayman there was a pause i can find no reference to your alias continued the computer would you like it appended to your passport yes please please hold up your passport again he did so and a very thin laser beam shot out and burned a tiny notation onto the titanium card just beneath his holograph and legal name i have some questions said the kid putting the passport back into his pocket i am programmed to answer most questions dealing with mozart replied the computer should the nature of your question require a subjective answer i will direct you to the proper planetary authority who can answer you thats very accommodating of you said the kid wryly i exist to serve ill need a place to stay while im here can you recommend a hotel in minuet the computer s screen suddenly came to life these five establishments currently have rooms or suites available it said flashing a listing can you make a reservation for me yes fine said the kid studying the list id like a room at the manor house for how many nights will you require your room i dont know answered the kid can you make it open yes ground floor or second floor second floor room has been reserved in your name ill also need a vehicle the screen changed here is a list of those vehicles available for rental at the spaceport plus their daily charges the kid selected one one more thing said the kid id like to know if any business on the planet specializes in implanted biochips no good can i place an advertisement in every planetary newspaper or newstape to the effect that i have just arrived and that that is my specialty and that i can be contacted at the manor working said the computer buzzing quietly there are three planetary newstapes mr cayman two weekly and one daily each has requested that you supply an exact wording for your advertisement i see said the kid he paused for a moment i assume theres a personal computer with a planetary tiein in my room at the manor house that is correct if you can have the electronic addresses of the three newstape advertising departments waiting for me on my computer ill create the ads when i get there there was a brief humming it has been done oh one more thing said the kid id like a listing of churches on the planet there was an immediate listing of fourteen churches all were sects that were known to him none seemed likely to be connected to the anointed one or penelope bailey thank you the kid got up and left the booth walked to the vehicle rental area signed for the groundcar he had selected brought up a map that included the spaceport and minuet on the instrument panels viewscreen and began driving toward the town passing what seemed like two or three miles of cattle feedlots along the way minuet was a small town and as he reached the commercial district he realized that the computer had been somewhat optimistic in its use of the word hotel the manor house like its fellow hostelries was a refurbished structure that had been built some two centuries earlier and had been a very impressive mansion before it had been remodeled and turned into a rooming house now it catered to visiting salesmen most of whom dealt in mutated seeds and fertilizers that had been created to work on worlds similar to this one he left the groundcar in a lot behind the house checked in at the desk registered his voiceprint waited until the lock on the door to room was coded to it and allowed the airlift to gently transport him to the second level of the boardinghouse the room itself was a little more spartan than the one he had stayed in on olympus it consisted of a bed two chairs a computer station in the corner and a bathroom with a dryshower and a chemical toilet he pulled the addresses of the newstape offices from the computer wrote a brief ad and sent it off to each of them he then ordered electronic editions of the three newstapes scanned them as they appeared on his computer and was not surprised to find no mention of the prophet in any of them he left the room after about an hour descended to the ground level and walked across the street to a small restaurant where he ordered lunch when he returned to his room there was already one response to his advertisement from a silo manager who had breathed in one preservative too many and wanted a chip to warn him when the chemical content in the air reached a certain level he asked the man to send him the formulas for those preservatives that were being used and promised to get back to him within three days then with nothing further to do and not wishing to spend the afternoon actually creating the chip he decided to lie down and take a nap until dinnertime when he awoke he ate a dinner of mutated soya products in the same restaurant where he had had lunch then walked out onto the street just as the sun was going down it was cool and dry with a very mild breeze coming from the west and he found it very refreshing he looked up and down the street unwilling to go back to his room right away most of the town was already closed down for the night and he found that if he wished to remain away from his hotel his choice was limited to a holo theater a tavern and a casino he didnt like holos and he knew just enough about gambling to know he wasnt much good at it so he wandered over to the tavem it was rather small especially for the only tavern in the town as soon as he entered it he encountered a purpleandgold avian that was chained to its perch atop a metal stand it stared at him screeched once and then concentrated on preening itself paying him no further attention the kid gave it a wide berth it was relatively small no more than three pounds but it had a wickedlooking beak and walked up to the bar where he ordered a beer the bartender nodded filled a glass and slid it over to him the kid picked it up and carried it over to an empty table near the back of the room a few moments later a tall man dark of skin and sporting two gold teeth that gleamed whenever he spoke or smiled walked over to him a beer in his hand mind if i join you he asked all the other tables seem to be full be my guest said the kid thanks said the man he extended his hand my names james mboya neil cayman said the kid taking his hand youre new here arent you the kid nodded just got in today what are you selling what makes you think im selling anything mboya laughed because nobody comes to a farming world for pleasure doesnt anyone ever come here to buy instead of sell mboya shook his head all our beef and produce are contracted for the next decade we supply a hell of a lot of worlds he paused i could sell you some gold if you want he grinned displaying his two gold teeth theyre removable i hock em whenever i need some money then buy em back when im flush the kid sipped his beer chips he said at last i beg your pardon computer chips thats what i sell what kind whatever kind you want me to create for you something that would make me feel ten years younger when i wake up in the morning might be nice said mboya with a smile it could be done said the kid really you wouldnt be any younger but i could create a chip that would mask any aches and pains you had mboya snapped his fingers just like that he asked still smiling no said the kid id have to speak to your doctor find out whats ailing you which muscles are degenerating learn your whole medical history then i could make it the kid paused hed have to implant it though im just a technician not a surgeon how long do you plan to be on mozart asked mboya if i can put the money together you just might have yourself a client the kid shrugged it depends on how much business i can do here he said taking another sip of his beer ive placed some ads now its just a matter of waiting maybe i can show you around while youre here offered mboya not that theres all that much to see well theres one thing id like to see answered the kid after some thought oh what is that while i was on a nearby world i heard that youve got someone here called the prophet someone who can see the future he paused id like to meet her why the kid smiled id sure like some investment advice maybe i could trade a couple of custommade chips for it well i see her from time to time answered mboya i can pass the word and see if shes interested he paused no reason why she shouldnt be he added thoughtfully i mean just knowing youre going to wake up with a hangover doesnt make the hangover go away id appreciate that said the kid he noticed that mboya had finished his beer let me buy the next round thanks said mboya much appreciated the kid signaled the bartender to bring two beers over to the table other than frequenting the casino down the block what do people do for fun around here this is an agricultural world replied mboya with a laugh they talk about planting fertilizer and the weather mostly the weather once in a long while they might have a cattle show thats about it not exactly thrilling said the kid wryly if you want thrills you should go to a world like calliope or maybe confucius not a farm world have you ever been to them once or twice said mboya what the hell kind of business can a farmer possibly have on confucius asked the kid as the bartender arrived with their beers mboya paused and studied the kid i didnt say i was a farmer no i suppose you didnt said the kid what do you do mboya shrugged expansively oh a little of this a little of that a few deals here a few there how long have you been on mozart a few months its a pleasant enough world a little on the dull side as youve already noticed but the climates nice the people are friendly and your money goes a long way here he paused it s no worse than most worlds and probably better than a lot of them where are you from originally asked the kid picking up his new beer and taking a swallow back in the democracy said mboya with an expression of contempt a little world named far london he paused i decided that a man with my talents could go a lot further on the inner frontier what are your talents youll laugh no i wont said the kid mboya shrugged right at the moment im in pest control pest control repeated the kid surprised you have a pest problem you send for me and i cure it well at least i understand why youre on an agricultural world said the kid they must have a lot of work for you here i keep busy answered mboya finishing off his beer and putting the empty glass back on the table sounds like dull work if you dont mind my saying so said the kid i rather enjoy it replied mboya to each his own true agreed mboya as for myself id go crazy spending all my time creating computer chips so would i answered the kid thats why i was looking for a little action if you dont like gambling youre out of luck in minuet said mboya it occurs to me that the prophet could break the bank if shes all shes supposed to be said the kid i doubt theyd allow her to play responded mboya shes that good if you owned the casino would you take the chance that she might be asked mboya i wonder what the hell someone like her is doing out here on a world like this in the first place said the kid you seem very interested in her observed mboya she sounds like a very interesting person answered the kid and i really could use some investment advice what exactly have you heard about her just that shes supposed to be able to foresee the future answered the kid nothing more well i heard some rumors that she used to be the oracle but i dont believe it the kid watched mboya to see if there was any reaction there wasnt hell everyone knows that the iceman killed the oracle a few years back the iceman said mboya now theres a name to conjure with youve heard of him who hasnt replied mboya hes a legend out here he paused id like to meet him someday if hes still alive that is the kid looked at the empty glasses care for another round he asked no said mboya i think im going to go try my luck at the roulette table down the street i never much liked roulette said the kid too big a percentage for the house i dont like it all that much myself said mboya suddenly he grinned but as the old saying goes its the only game in town in this case literally good luck said the kid perhaps youd care to come along suggested mboya getting to his feet theyve also got blackjack poker and jabob ill probably be along later said the kid i think ill have another beer first i had a long nap this afternoon im good for hours yet well thank you for the beer mr cayman said mboya i hope youll let me return the favor if you show up at the casino before i leave its a deal said the kid mboya grinned thats always assuming i havent gone broke in the interim one of those gold teeth ought to buy the best bottle in the house said the kid mboya laughed and walked out into the night and the kid picked up his glass and walked over to the bar ill have another he said coming right up said the bartender bringing him a fresh glass interesting guy that mboya said the kid does he come here often oh he comes by every now and then when his boss sends him answered the bartender but ive never heard him called mboya before thats not his real name asked the kid the bartender shrugged for all i know it is but out here on the frontier they call him the black death the black death repeated the kid the way you two were getting on i thought you knew him the kid shook his head he just walked up and introduced himself told me he was in pest control the bartender chuckled well in a way i suppose he is in what way he s the prophet s bodyguard the kid nursed his next beer for half an hour then wandered over to the casino it was a large room far larger than the icemans on last chance there were half a dozen blackjack tables four poker tables a pair of roulette wheels a craps table a billiard table two jabob games and another alien game that he had never seen before the casino was relatively empty when the kid arrived there were perhaps fifteen men and women playing the various games and not a single alien to be seen the kid immediately spotted mboya the solitary player at one of the roulette wheels and walked over to him hello neil said mboya with a friendly smile glad you decided to come on over there was nothing else to do said the kid with a shrug by the way do i call you mr mboya or mr death mboya laughed james will do but you are the black death persisted the kid some people call me that mboya studied the table then placed a pair of chips on odd and another on red i see you like to play it safe noted the kid the odds are thirtyfive to one that youll lose if you bet on a number answered mboya i dont really expect to win when i come here but id like my money to last long enough for me to enjoy myself for a couple of hours why are you here at all asked the kid i like to gamble where should i be talking to me that was your assignment wasnt it i am talking to you said mboya easily no reason why i shouldnt enjoy myself while im doing it does she send you out to talk to every newcomer to mozart asked the kid no said mboya as the wheel started spinning just the ones shes curious about why is she curious about me mboya shrugged who knows what makes her curious or why she does anything she does he cursed beneath his breath as the number came up even and black damn you wouldnt think anyone could lose this consistently i bet black four times in a row and it comes up red all four times so i finally bet red and it comes up black if i didnt know better id say the wheel was rigged what makes you think it isnt asked the kid because if it was no man having anything to do with this casino would be alive tomorrow morning answered mboya seriously and they know it he stared at the table again trying to decide which number to bet then finally shrugged and straightened up ive had enough of this game its time to find a slower way to lose my money he spotted the empty pool table you ever shoot any pool neil once in a while good said mboya walking to the table and studying its green felt surface care to play for a small stake just to make it interesting it wouldnt be fair said the kid im not a hustler mboya assured him i know it wouldnt be fair because you cant win mboya grinned well now i wouldnt necessarily say that either its the truth said the kid i thought you only played once in a while thats right then why should i believe you believe whatever you want suddenly the kid shrugged and smiled one hundred credits a game sounds good to me said mboya selecting a cue and starting to chalk the tip of it just remember i warned you said the kid picking his cue and walking back to the table i admire your confidence said mboya rack em the kids confidence turned out to be well placed as he had known it would be the chips that were tied into his eyes showed him every tiny irregularity in the tables surface the chips in his shoulders allowed him to make every shot with the same sure stroke the chip hed had implanted on sweetwater allowed him to lean far over the table without any discomfort or loss of balance he easily beat mboya three games in a row and was about to rack the balls for a fourth game when the black death called it quits and pulled three hundredcredit notes out of his wallet you ought to quit the chip business and turn pool shark he said ruefully as he laid the money on the table maybe someday i will answered the kid picking it up and stuffing it into his wallet mboya signaled to a lone waiter who was wandering around the casino taking orders a pair of beers please he said when the waiter approached them he wiped his brow and turned to the kid lets have a seat losing at roulette and pool is thirsty work you never had a chance said the kid following him to an unoccupied card table i knew that after about the fifth shot mboya agreed with a wry smile as he sat down opposite the kid i dont know where you learned to play and your style is unorthodox as all hell but somebody sure as hell taught you well it was the kids turn to smile i doubt that ive played half a dozen times in my life i dont believe it said mboya adamantly i have no reason to lie to you said the kid i didnt lie about your chances either i told you on the front end that i was going to win so sue me said mboya i didnt know youd be that good theres a lot about me you dont know replied the kid he paused that neither you nor your boss knows i dont suppose youd care to confide in me suggested mboya with a smile the kid shook his head anything she wants to know she can ask me directly thats not her style neil then shell have to change it said the kid firmly mboya seemed amused she doesnt change for other people they change for her why because shes the prophet he paused why are you so interested in meeting her i told you i know what you told me said mboya i just thought you might prefer to tell me the truth are you calling me a liar said the kid not at all answered mboya calmly if i called you a liar youd probably take offense and then id have to kill you and you seem like a nice enough young man i might be a lot harder to kill than you think said the kid thats possible admitted mboya a lot of men ive killed were harder to kill than i had thought they would be but theyre all dead just the same he paused maybe we ought to change the subject before i start getting curious about just how hard youd be to kill suits me said the kid ive got no quarrel with you youre just the hired help he paused of course you did lie to me over at the tavern why would i lie to you you said you were in pest control i am answered mboya easily thats why im here to see just how much of a pest you intend to be and how much controlling youll need i told you said the kid i sell computer chips i know what you told me said mboya i didnt believe you then and i dont believe you now order a chip from me and youll see you were wrong the kid smiled if nothing else itll improve your pool game the waiter finally arrived with their beers and mboya tossed a couple of coins on his tray they make a lot of good things on mozart said mboya grimacing as he emptied the container into his glass but beer alas isnt one of them so order an import as long as im here i feel i ought to support the local industries the kid stared at him curiously youre a strange kind of killer well if it comes to that youre a strange kind of traveling salesman replied mboya the kid stared at him i was minding my own business he said defensively you sought me out that s my job so you said replied the kid id just like to know why shes curious about me mboya grinned mine is not to reason why yours is just to protect her with your life right wrong the bartender at the tavern said you were her bodyguard said the kid mboya shook his head she doesnt need a bodyguard im just her eyes and ears when shes occupied with other matters which is most of the time what s she like different in what way im supposed to be asking the questions said mboya i dont have to answer them no agreed mboya but youd make my job much easier if you would the kid finally took a long swallow of his beer then stared at mboya why do i care if your jobs easy or hard because when i get frustrated in my work i get illtempered said mboya believe me you wouldnt like me when im illtempered i dont think i like you all that much right now answered the kid mboya studied him carefully do you know something else youre not telling me neil like what i dont know but most people dont talk to me like that unless they think theyve got some kind of an edge what i know is my business answered the kid and you can stop calling me neil i thought it was your name it used to be nowadays im the silicon kid never heard of you said mboya you will said the kid thats a promise so you think you can make your reputation by taking out the prophet is that it asked mboya obviously amused by the thought take my advice kid and forget about her go after the gravedancer or maybe lizard malloy who knows if you get lucky or you catch them on a bad day you just might live through it i didnt come to mozart to kill anyone replied the kid im just here to sell computer chips ah i understand now said mboya with an amused grin were all going to hear about you because youre going to become the galaxy s most famous traveling salesman youre going to hear of me because theres always going to be someone like you who doesnt take me seriously said the kid and thats a mistake well ill certainly take that under advisement said mboya he paused and stared at the kid by the way wheres all the silicon that makes you the silicon kid its in place said the kid thats right said mboya you specialize in implants dont you yes well youll have to pardon me if i dont faint dead away with terror said mboya i pardon you said the kid seriously mboya placed his glass on the table youre an interesting young man he continued i bear you no ill will and i wish you a long and happy life thanks i plan to enjoy it then take my advice and dont go looking for suddenly mboya froze his eyes on the doorway is something wrong asked the kid turning to see what mboya was staring at three men all dressed in nondescript outfits their pockets bulging with weapons had entered the casino but instead of walking to the tables they fanned out across the front of the room staring at mboya time for me to go to work said mboya wryly he got up and walked halfway across the room stopping about twenty feet from the newcomers i thought i told you you werent welcome here he said facing the man in the center i know what you told me replied the man nothings changed since last week youre still not welcome on mozart oh somethings changed all right said the man he grinned this time im not alone nothing s changed repeated mboya i think the three of you had better turn around and go right back to the spaceport not a chance said the man well i cant make you behave sensibly said mboya with a shrug i can only suggest it you know what were here for continued the man where is she where is who no games now said the man weve come for the prophet the prophet repeated mboya never heard of her if we have to kill you to get to her we will whats all this talk of killing asked mboya pleasantly this is a peaceful little world the man laughed if its such a peaceful world what are you doing here keeping the peace said mboya im going to ask you just once more said the man where is she none of your business said mboya now ive got a question for you yeah can you count to five because thats how many seconds youve got to get out of here the man glared at him for the briefest of instants then he and his two cohorts all reached for their weapons mboyas own sonic pistol appeared in his hand as if by magic and two of the men were dead before they could draw their weapons mboya crouched as he pivoted toward the third man only to find that he was already wounded his left arm smoldering from the blast of a laser beam the man got off a quick inaccurate shot at mboya who killed him a second later somebody go for the police ordered mboya as the patrons most of whom had hit the floor began getting to their feet two men immediately left the building i suppose i should thank you continued mboya as he turned to the kid whose laser pistol was still in his hand but it was stupid to get involved why the hell did you do it i wanted to see if i was faster than you said the kid i am you shot a man you never saw before just to see if you were faster than me repeated mboya incredulously thats right some people might call that attempted murder if they arrest me theyll certainly have to arrest you too said the kid do you think theyre going to mboya stared at him for a long moment youre a dangerous young man you know that i know that how many men have you killed none yet admitted the kid but i have a feeling im going to enjoy it when i finally get around to it ill just bet you are said mboya he paused youd better get your ass back to the hotel ill take care of the authorities the kid nodded and walked around the bodies when he got to the doorway he turned back to mboya i was faster than you he said but you didnt kill him mboya pointed out you missed im still adjusting to the chips ill aim better next time if it had been me instead of him you wouldnt have lived to have a next time said mboya you took him by surprise he was looking at me when you shot him he paused now that i know what you can do youll never take me by surprise i dont want to if i ever take you itll be in a fair fight well thats comforting to know said mboya wryly the kid remained in the doorway do you think shell meet with me now he asked at last i dont know remind her that they were out to kill her i dont have to remind her answered mboya thats why i left the restaurant and came here she knew they were going to show up remind her anyway said the kid i still want some investment advice sure you do said mboya the kid heard a commotion about a block away the police were accompanying the two gamblers and he decided that he might as well follow mboyas ininstructions and return to his hotel remaining here wouldnt get him any closer to the prophet and the resultant publicity might cost him enough customers so that he would no longer have an excuse for spending two or three weeks on the planet im staying at the manor house he said to mboya i know ill be waiting to hear from you dont hold your breath said mboya the kid stepped outside waited until the policemen and gamblers had passed him and entered the casino and then walked back to his hotel it had been an interesting night he had made contact with a man who worked for the prophet and he had seen a shootout in fact he had participated in it and the adrenaline his body had produced wasnt totally dissipated yet it was a hell of a feeling that sense of excitement and he knew that he had found his future vocation once this business with penelope bailey was over as he took the airlift to his room and sprawled fully dressed on his bed he promised himself that those minstrels who wandered from world to world singing songs of santiago and billybuck dancer and the iceman would someday sing songs about the silicon kid as well the kid was having breakfast across the street when mboya entered the restaurant and walked over to his table shell see you he said when asked the kid now just wait until i finish my breakfast and ill be right with you youre finished said mboya you dont keep the prophet waiting i do said the kid taking another mouthful and chewing it thoughtfully if youre doing this to impress her youre wasting your time said mboya youre less than an insect to her you may be less than an insect said the kid im not what makes you think so asked mboya contemptuously because you dont invite insects for interviews said the kid he spent a few more minutes finishing his meal while mboya watched him then drank his coffee left a pair of new stalin rubles on the table and finally got to his feet all right let s go he followed mboya to a groundcar and a moment later they were speeding south out of the city they passed a number of farms then came to still another farm no different in any respect from the last dozen and pulled up to a geodesic dome that overlooked a small pond no guards noted the kid she doesnt need any not even you not even me said mboya well let s go on in she wants to see you alone said mboya ill be waiting for you out here what room is she in asked the kid getting out of the landcar how should i know the kid shrugged let the slidewalk take him from the car to the front entrance and waited for the door to open there were no cameras no retina identification scanners no signs of any security system the door slid into the wall after a moment and he walked into a circular foyer i am here said a feminine voice and he followed it into a large room that possessed a window wall overlooking the pond seated on an exotic chair carved from some alien hardwood was penelope bailey she was blonde slender dressed in a loose white gown the kid decided that she should have been rather pretty but somehow she seemed to possess no sexuality and precious little humanity there was something about her eyes something he couldnt quite put his finger on even when she looked at him she seemed to be focusing on something beyond him something that only she could see welcome mr cayman she said and even her voice seemed remote as if her mind were elsewhere and the rest of her was going through some preordained performance good morning prophet replied the kid please be seated where wherever you choose thank you said the kid sitting down on a couch covered in a metallic fabric that continually changed colors as the sun shone in on it suddenly penelope shifted her position and raised her right arm above her head for just an instant is something wrong asked the kid no you seem uncomfortable he noted you are very transparent mr cayman she said with an almost alien smile i dont think i understand what youre saying you know why i changed my position so why pretend that you do not i have no idea why you moved the way you did answered the kid she shook her head still smiling her eyes still focused on some unimaginably distant point you come to ask for my advice mr cayman and yet you refuse to be honest with me i am being truthful with you no mr cayman she arose and walked over to the window you were sent to mozart to find me and i know that you were not sent by that bizarre criminal who calls himself the anointed one she paused that means whoever sent you knew me many years ago before i became the prophet only two such men are still living and one of them is retired she turned to him her eyes staring into his but focusing beyond them you were sent by carlos mendoza who is known as the iceman and since he would not send you here without telling you who and what i am you know that when i make sudden movements or commit acts that seem incomprehensible to you as many of them must i am controlling or manipulating various futures the kid stared at her without answering for a long moment youre as good as he said you were he replied at last i take that as high praise she said he is the one man who has ever stood against me the one man in the whole of creation whom i have ever feared are you still afraid of him asked the kid she shook her head no i am not you havent got much reason to be said the kid hes a fat old man with a limp a limp i gave him twenty years ago she said staring off into the distance why didnt you kill him then i was very young replied penelope i thought he would die of his wounds and i wanted him to suffer the kid was about to make a comment when she held up a hand what is it he said watch she said indicating the far side of the pond what am i supposed to be looking at he asked staring out through the window there is a small animal atop its burrow is there not she asked still looking into his eyes yes he said kind of a muddy red in color watch closely she said a few seconds later an avian swooped down grabbed the animal in its claws and flew off with it you knew that was going to happen i know everything that is going to happen she said i am the prophet could you have saved the rodent certainly she said there are an infinite number of futures in some of them the rodent spotted the avian in time to retreat to its burrow in others the avian was distracted and did not see the rodent how could you have changed what happened asked the kid she smiled again but did not answer him would you care for something cool to drink mr cayman she asked after a moment it promises to be a warm day why dont you make it cooler suggested the kid the house is climatecontrolled she replied and i have more important things to do in that case said the kid ill have some water follow me please she said walking down a gleaming white corridor to the kitchen dont you have any servants asked the kid as he looked around the gadgetfilled room millions of them she replied holding a glass under a tap cold she whispered and the water poured out when the glass was filled she said stop the flow of water ceased and she handed the glass to the kid thank you he said draining the glass with a single swallow you are welcome mr cayman she said come sit outside with me beneath the shade trees are you sure you want to go out he asked as you pointed out the house is climatecontrolled i had an unpleasant experience which i am certain you were told about she replied leading him out to a shaded patio i dont like feeling confined the kid recalled the dust and asteroids circling alpha crepello no i guess you dont he sat down on a wooden bench and she seated herself on an indentical bench about ten feet away from him then stood up instantly what s the matter asked the kid nothing is wrong mr cayman then why she smiled there is an event its nature need not concern you that must come to pass on a world called cherokee the past is fixed and immutable mr cayman but there are literally an infinite number of futures in every future in which i remained seated it did not come to pass in a handful of those in which i stood up it may yet happen but how can standing up on mozart effect something lightyears away asked the kid i neither know nor question the why of it i only know the truth of it she paused now shall we get down to business mr cayman thats what im here for she stared at him and for just a moment her eyes focused he decided uneasily that he preferred her to stare off into what he imagined was the future you must excuse me mr cayman but im not at all sure what youre here for i thought you knew everything said the kid i know the plethora of futures that will be she replied i do not know everything that was that doesnt make any sense it makes sense to me she said now perhaps you will be kind enough to tell me why you have come to mozart if you know the future you already know what i am going to say you might say any of a hundred things replied penelope you are quite a liar you know and a bit of an egomaniac as well i wish to hear whatever it is that you will say how will you know if im lying asked the kid because i already know most of the answer to any question i ask then why ask at all to determine how trustworthy you are mr cayman why do you care all in good time mr cayman said penelope staring off into time and space again please answer my question now ive come to mozart to sell computer chips said the kid that is the fact of it she said serenely but not the truth of it all right he said with a shrug i was sent here by the iceman i know that s it then why did he send you he doesnt think anything can kill you so when he heard about hades blowing up he figured you had escaped before it happened and does the democracy agree with him no the kid paused he thinks theyre fools he is correct anyway he wants to know what you plan to do of course not your immediate plans continued the kid but your longterm plans i plan to survive in a universe that has proven itself hostile to me at every opportunity answered penelope without emotion well from what ive seen survival seems to be the least of your problems assuming you have any problems at all i am just flesh and blood mr cayman she replied someday i will die just as any other human being dies suddenly she smiled in amusement it will not be at your hands mr cayman if you pull out your laser weapon and attempt to fire it as you are considering doing it will misfire and explode in your hand i wasnt considering any such thing lied the kid you have been warned mr cayman she said your fate is in your hands the kid withdrew his pistol and studied it it was working just fine last night he said in a million futures it will function correctly this morning said penelope i will not allow any of those futures to come to pass the kid stared at his pistol for a moment then shrugged and replaced it in its holster now ive got a question for you he said about investments she asked in a mocking tone no ask your question mr cayman why havent you made yourself ruler of the whole damned galaxy it doesnt seem to me that anyones got the power to stop you perhaps someday i shall she replied i have other more pressing things to do first such as you wouldnt understand try me she stared at him and a contemptuous smile crossed her face if you could see what i see if you tried to make sense of it and bring order to it it would drive you quite mad even as we speak a starship on its way to antarres must malfunction a miner on nelson must dig a mile to the west of his camp a politician on new rhodesia must accept a bribe a chrystalline alien on atria must receive a subspace message from far orion there are a thousand events that must transpire each in its exact order a million futures must vanish every nanosecond and you ask me to explain all this to you poor little human who seeks only a full belly and a fat wallet who dreams of heroic deeds and grateful maidens and who is doomed only to become a speck of dust in a galaxy already overflowing with dust she paused no mr cayman i do not think you could comprehend my goals or my explanations the kid stared at her for a moment whatever your goals are you need a better lieutenant than james mboya he said you have a candidate in mind to replace the black death she asked and he got the distinct impression that she was laughing at him youre looking at him he said i thought you worked for the iceman i work for winners said the kid youre a winner i am very happy with the black deaths services replied penelope im better than he is in what way im quicker stronger faster said the kid and i can make you just as quick and strong with your chips she suggested thats right said the kid you fire mboya and take me on and as much as you are i can make you more you can make me even less human than i am she asked mockingly that s an interesting proposition mr cayman you dont even have to fire him said the kid i can kill him as soon as i leave the house hes waiting outside for me but i dont want you to kill him mr cayman she said nor do i want your chips she stared at him and once again her eyes seemed to focus on the here and now i never wanted to be the prophet mr cayman what seems a gift to you has often seemed a curse to me i wanted to be like every other human being and i have been harassed and chased and imprisoned for most of my life because i was different and now you offer to make me even more different youll have to do better than that if you want to be like everyone else why not just take a new identity and move out to the spiral arm or the outer frontier asked the kid because i am different replied penelope i didnt wish to be but i cannot deny the fact of it wherever i go they will seek me out wherever i hide they will find me fate has been very cruel to me mr cayman now that my powers are mature i plan to defend myself as best i can you can defend yourself by hiding i can defend myself by making sure that no one alive or yet to be born can ever harm me again she said i will do whatever must be done to protect myself including blowing up planets asked the kid an eye for an eye mr cayman and there were a lot of eyes on hades what happened there was justice on a grand scale she paused you might consider that before opposing me im not trying to oppose you said the kid im trying to join you if i allow you to serve me i must have your complete obedience she said youll have it you will be well paid but you will also be asked to do many things that you may find unpalatable you just pay me the money and let me worry about the rest of it said the kid one of the first things i will have you do is betray carlos mendoza i kind of thought you might said the kid with a grin that doesnt bother you no even though he is your friend hes on the wrong side of the fence said the kid theres no way he can win if i dont deliver him to you someone else will so i might as well get paid for it penelope stared thoughtfully at him you seem like a very practical young man neil cayman she said i think you may prove useful to me in ways you do not even comprehend then im hired you are hired we havent talked about money yet he noted you will find that i am more than generous answered penelope and if you are loyal you will wield such power as you have heretofore only dreamed about sounds good to me said the kid and by the way im not neil cayman any longer oh everyone out here on the frontier seems to choose a new name for themselves im the silicon kid she smiled that is a very impressive and descriptive name it will suffice for the time being youve got another one planned for me he asked perhaps i dont suppose youd care to tell me what it is when the time comes said penelope she got to her feet and now our interview is over the black death will take you back to your hotel i know that you wish to pit your skills against his she paused from this day forth you are not to fight with anyone except on my express orders is that clear its clear he said reluctantly good you will hear from me when i need you you can see the future said the kid as she ushered him through the house so why not tell me now when youll need me because i do not exist to serve you mr cayman he walked out the front door and climbed into mboyas groundcar penelope watched them pull away then walked to her bedroom and emerged a moment later with a small rag doll she clutched it lovingly to her bosom and continued to stare blindly into time and space occasionally making a gesture or striking a pose that would help bring the particular future she envisioned into being mboya was waiting for the silicon kid in the groundcar as the slidewalk took him away from the prophets domicile he climbed in still assimilating what he had heard and a moment later mboya was driving him back toward minuet so how did it go im working for her answered the kid a humorless smile crossed mboyas face remind me never to turn my back on you what is that supposed to mean demanded the kid i know why you came here and who sent you said mboya you sold him out judas i plan to get a hell of a lot more than thirty pieces of silver said the kid besides he hasnt got a chance you know that that doesnt make any difference replied mboya when you make a commitment youre supposed to keep it why dont you let me worry about that said the kid angrily what if you decide the anointed one is more powerful than the prophet said mboya you going to change sides again hed have to be something awfully special to be more powerful than her maybe he is hes supposed to have more than a hundred million followers who all but worship him hes just a man said the kid shes something well more mboya drove in silence for a few moments passing the same farms they had driven by on the way out as they reached minuet he spoke again i hope you have to go up against him the anointed one asked the kid mboya shook his head the iceman hes a fat old man said the kid i can take him a lot of people have thought they could take him said mboya but hes still here even the prophet couldnt kill him he wont pose any problem at all said the kid hell he still thinks im on his side mboya smiled kid he never thought you were on his side how the hell do you know what he thinks demanded the kid youve never even met him hes lived seventyodd years on the inner frontier answered mboya easily you dont get that old out here by being stupid are you saying im stupid asked the kid heatedly if you think you can fool the iceman or take him out you are responded mboya even if he didnt know you he knows her he knows what she can do how she can influence people and events so whos going to kill him you when the time comes answered mboya what makes you better able to than me i respect him said mboya i wont make any careless or foolish mistakes and you think i will its a possibility mboya paused you know that hes gone up against the prophet twice and lived to tell about it and yet you keep describing him as a fat old man who poses no threat to you thats right you still dont see it do you see what asked the kid irritably you dont think he survived his meetings with the prophet because he was faster than you do you what difference do physical attributes make when she knows what youre going to do before you yourself do mboya paused again he survived because of his brain not because of his gun and hell beat you the same way ive heard enough of this crap said the kid i can take him and you together without drawing a deep breath and dont you forget it can you take the gravedancer too asked mboya what do you know about him ive researched you thoroughly kid i know every place youve been since you left greycloud and who youve been with bully for you said the kid sullenly by the way that wasnt a rhetorical question can you take the gravedancer why because hes working for the anointed one now answered mboya that means sooner or later one of us is going to have to go up against him i can take anybody said the kid confidently once you learn to shoot straight said mboya sardonically anybody repeated the kid even men who know your secret what the hell is that supposed to mean just that the iceman and the gravedancer both know that whatever you are you owe it to those implanted chips if they know theyre going to go up against you dont you think theyll find some way to negate them theres no way it can be done answered the kid these are biochips im their energy source theres no field you can create that can make them stop functioning i dont know about that said mboya maybe but just about the time you tell a man he cant do something whether its climb down from the trees or cross an ocean or fly a starship or negate a biochip he usually finds a way to do just that were a very successful race of lawbreakers weve broken all the laws of gravity and einstein and spare me the lecture said the kid these chips will keep functioning until im dead well i wish them a long and happy life said mboya pulling up to the kids hotel you know said the kid as he got out of the groundcar and turned to face mboya before you worry about the iceman or the gravedancer youve got a bigger problem oh youre going to have to face me why asked mboya she cant have two enforcers said the kid im going to have to prove to her that im the best theres only one way to do that we can do it right here and now if youre dead set on it said mboya with no show of fear or surprise the kid shook his head ill choose the place and time what makes you think ill let you the kid grinned because youre an honorable man he turned on his heel and walked into the lobby of the manor house he picked up a newstape took it to his room watched with disinterest as its headlines flashed by and then walked over to a mirror where he studied himself moodily his clothes were flashy and stylish but he decided they needed to make more of a statement become an identifiable trademark it was true that the iceman dressed for comfort but lomax always wore black and the holos he had seen of father christmas always showed him in a modified red and white santa claus outfit with a pair of sonic pistols suspended from a shining black patentleather belt but what kind of outfit would instantly label him as the silicon kid a shirt with chips sewn into it he shook his head too garish something with his sk initials monogrammed onto it he quickly rejected the notion as amateurish then what he could simply dress as he had been dressing but what was the use of being the silicon kid if people didnt know it that was the problem with the iceman and mboya they had the credentials but they lacked a certain style and if he was going to be the prophets righthand man at least until he figured out how to get rid of her he wanted people to know him the instant he landed on a planet the moment he entered a town or a room perhaps some weapon that was uniquely his own after all with his implants he could handle any weapon with such speed and dexterity that no one alive could match him so why be limited to laser sonic or projectile weapons the more he thought about it the more he liked the idea he would create a weapon of a type that no one else possessed one that would forever be his trademark and if it was one that could kill the prophet when the proper time came so much the better excited he walked over to the computer on his desk activated it and had it and had it tie into tiny minuet library accessing information on the various types of weapons currently in use he found nothing very useful there and was considering accessing a larger library on a nearby world when the computers screen went blank whats wrong he demanded i have an incoming message answered the computer in a mechanical voice all right lets see it it was from a young woman who had lost the use of her left arm in an accident and wondered if he could create a chip that would restore the arm to its former state tell her that if the nerves have been damaged shed be better off with a prosthetic arm if its something else have her doctor forward her records to me working said the computer wait a minute he said suddenly operation suspended hed already made contact with the prophet so why bother with the facade just tell her that im sorry but i cant help her working done deactivate the computer went dead and an instant later the vidphone came to life yeah said the kid activating it the holographic image of penelope bailey hovered above the machine i see my two guard dogs have been growling at one another she said in amused tones i thought he was enough of a man not to go running to you for help said the kid contemptuously he is in my employ as are you she said serenely my employees have no secrets from me send him on his way said the kid why you dont need him youve got me now poor futile little man thrashing about in the darkness dreaming of triumph and glory said penelope how can you have any idea what i need you didnt hire him for his personality answered the kid you hired him because hes the slack death he paused well youve got someone better working for you now better at what she asked with a smile do you really think i need you to do my killing for me you didnt seem to have any objection to letting him do it last night noted the kid he merely saved me the bother of dispatching three unpleasant individuals i was never in any physical danger from them come on lady he said if you dont need killers what are men like mboya and me doing on your payroll great forces have been set in motion she answered forces far beyond your ability to fathom each of you has a role to play and each of you will play it what role you will learn your destiny in the fullness of time have i got a destiny most assuredly she replied that is why i let you live what were you going to do have mboya gun me down on the way out if you decided you didnt want to hire me you still dont understand what you are dealing with do you she said in a million times a million futures you will live out the day neil cayman but you are a very highstrung young man and in a tiny handful of the futures i can foresee you will die of a sudden cerebral hemorrhage and in one future you will have an intimation of your death that future will occur when i do this and with that she walked to her window wall and placed both hands against it fingers splayed wide as she looked out on her pond the kid felt a sudden pain flash through his head he yelled incoherently then dropped to one knee the pain became worse more intense than any he had ever known and he curled into a fetal ball his fists pressed against his temples and then suddenly the pain was gone it took him a full minute to regain his feet and focus his eyes and he saw penelopes image smiling at him from a few inches over the vidphone do you begin to comprehend she asked serenely how the hell did you do that from thirty miles away he muttered you have seen what i did to hades and yet you wonder at my abilities perhaps the black death was correct perhaps you are not bright enough to be useful to me he told you that demanded the kid certainly she replied he has no secrets from me well if im too dumb to work for you maybe ill just go back to the iceman he snapped for just the merest fraction of a second he thought he finally detected an emotion on her face terror perhaps or hatred or possibly simply contempt but then it vanished and she focused her gaze on him again that would not be very wise neil cayman she said you would be dead before you left the planet she paused you have given your allegiance to me only i can return it to you you may not take it back she smiled an emotionless smile or perhaps you would like another demonstration of my power no he said you win for the moment he added mentally you are highspirited just like a young animal she said i do not hold that against you in fact i find it admirable but like any other young animal you must be trained your spirit must be directed then you will begin to earn your keep im no animal said the kid you are all animals she said and broke the connection the kid spent the next five days lounging around the manor house eating sleeping watching holos doing a little drinking and a little gambling trying unsuccessfully to keep from being bored he accepted a couple of assignments to create biochips just to alleviate the boredom he impatiently awaited a summons from penelope bailey and couldnt figure out why she had hired him only to let him rot in a tiny hotel on a nondescript planet then on the fifth evening after his meeting with her he happened to catch a newscast on the holo set and realized that she had been far from inactive according to the report more than eighty temples on some thirty different worlds each belonging to the followers of moses mohammed christ known as the anointed one had burned due to unknown causes killing almost men and women and injuring twice that many foul play was suspected of course but to date not a single instance of arson had been uncovered at any of the sites and why should they have found any evidence of arson thought the kid with a grim smile you want this temple burned to the ground hold your hand thus and so and the wind will blow the flame from a candle up against the window coverings you want that temple consumed by fire move eight feet to the right and a man with a lit cigar in his hand will have a heart attack and the rug will catch fire an instant later stand on one leg and lightning will strike another temple it was power beyond imagining and yet she needed him needed mboya needed still others whose names he didnt know and whose functions he could only guess at she was power incarnate but she was not allpowerful the inhabitants of hades had kept her imprisoned for almost seventeen years she needed help his help although he couldnt yet imagine why and she could be defeated or at least fought to a draw the iceman had proven that and he was certainly more than equal to anything that the iceman might have done he checked the news the next morning twelve more temples had been added to the total and went out for breakfast he waited for a pair of trucks to pass by then crossed the street and entered the small restaurant where he had been having most of his meals to his surprise mboya who usually slept quite late after a night at the casinos gaming tables was sitting alone at the back of the nearly empty establishment drinking a cup of coffee good morning he said when he saw the kid morning replied the kid come join me said mboya the kid looked around the restaurant for a moment then shrugged and walked past half a dozen empty tables he sat down opposite mboya and ordered coffee and a roll i havent seen you for a couple of days said mboya ive been around answered the kid working on chips mostly why bother youre working for her now no need to keep up pretenses ill stop if she ever gets around to giving me something to do said the kid he gazed out the window i grew up on a planet just like this one theres nothing to do here have you practiced your marksmanship lately asked mboya with a grin i dont need to its just a matter of adjusting to the implants im used to em now then i assume youll never miss again thats right said the kid seriously good said mboya im glad to hear it and i dont need someone taunting me this early in the morning added the kid making no attempt to hide his irritation i wasnt taunting you answered mboya i was being sincere sure you were i was repeated mboya im calling it quits that means sooner or later she s going to send you up against the kind of men ive been pacifying for her being a lousy shot isnt conducive to your health youre quitting repeated the kid surprised thats right arent you a little young for retirement im not retiring said mboya im just not going to work for her any longer why not asked the kid as his coffee finally arrived dont you listen to the holo or scan the newstapes asked mboya shes just launched an undeclared war on the anointed one the kid frowned do you know something about him that i dont know probably not then what has that got to do with you quitting look said mboya im a gunman i kill people for a living im not especially proud of it but im not ashamed of it i live by a code ive never gone up against a man who didnt have a chance and most of those ive killed have deserved it so dont you understand she can kill half a million men without even leaving her house he grimaced thats not killing anymore not the way i do it its genocide and i dont want any part of it what s the difference between killing three men or three thousand asked the kid they all follow the anointed one and they all want her dead mboya sighed its difficult to explain try all right to me killing is a profession and its got rules to it you stand close enough to look your opponent in the eye you always give him a chance to back off you talk to him you try to see into his soul and seek out his weaknesses you risk your life to take his life its a very personal thing he paused to her its just expediency ten men ten million men its all the same and none of them had a chance none of them even knew what killed them the kid considered what mboya had said then shook his head i dont see it he said you kill her enemies she kills her enemies the only difference is the number its a competition or at least it should be said mboya im competing against my opponent sure but im also competing against a standard of excellence i set for myself i dont really care if the person im working for is on the right or the wrong side of the dispute that doesnt affect me at all its the principle and the competition that count he paused but her shes gone beyond all reference points im competing with myself but shes competing with god or maybe nature no one else can kill that profligately she doesnt need me and i dont want any part of what shes doing but she does need you or she wouldnt be paying you said the kid mboya shook his head shes got you now and good luck to her me im going out to the quinellus cluster where no one has ever heard of the anointed one or the prophet soon everyone shall hear of me said a voice from the doorway and they both turned to see penelope bailey standing there staring at them i thought you might show up said mboya what did you expect replied penelope you made a commitment to me and now you intend to break it you must have known i would or you wouldnt have hired him said mboya jerking his head in the kids direction why i hired him is not your concern she said true enough agreed mboya with a shrug my only concern is getting out of this situation he stared at penelope you can keep whatever money ive got coming she shook her head i have no need of money she said i hired you you have yet to serve your purpose if you can see the future you know that im leaving and that nothing can change my mind said mboya if you force me to stay right now ill just catch the next ship out of here once youre gone no you wont replied penelope you will not leave until i say that you may but why youve got the kid now he says hes faster than i am and for all i know hes right you dont need me i alone know what i need answered penelope you made a commitment to serve me i will not release you from that commitment you can kill whole planets without even leaving your house persisted mboya why do you need me to kill your enemies off one at a time i owe you no explanation said penelope coldly you came to me for employment i gave it to you now you will fulfill the terms of our agreement you probably manipulated me into coming just as you manipulate everything else said mboya free will isnt a valid concept when youre involved what are you doing here asked the kid who had been listening to them intently i am here to stop the black death from betraying me answered penelope if you can see the future you know i have no intention of betraying you said mboya trying to keep his voice level and reasonable i just want to get out of here penelope stared unblinking into his eyes i will not permit it she answered but why he insisted i told you you have not yet served your purpose just what the hell is my purpose to serve me faithfully and obediently for how long until i no longer need you answered penelope how long will that take penelope shrugged eloquently a day a week a month a year a lifetime or perhaps only a moment how will i know because i will tell you she said mboya stared at her long and hard and finally he nodded all right he said but it had better be closer to a day than a lifetime are you giving me orders now she asked making no attempt to mask her amusement no he said that was a damned quick change of heart said the kid sardonically shes the prophet answered mboya if i cant convince her to let me go what else is there to do im glad you have seen the error of your way said penelope now i want both of you to come with me we have business elsewhere mboya and the kid got to their feet left a handful of coins on the table and followed her out into the street the sun was higher in the sky now the morning dew had evaporated and the air was warming up there were a handful of vehicles parked in front of the various feed and general stores but it was totally devoid of pedestrians penelope turned to her left and started walking south and the kid and mboya turned to follow her after they had gone half a block she stopped what is it asked the kid penelope turned to him though once again her eyes were focused far into the future the restaurant was the wrong place she said here in the street is where we shall resolve our conflicts i dont understand she pointed to mboya that man tried to desert me he still harbors the hope of leaving the planet once i have returned to my house such disobedience cannot be tolerated the kid suddenly felt the muzzle of a sonic pistol jammed against his rib cage sorry kid said mboya but i want your pistol the kid remained motionless for a moment give it to him said penelope i dont give my weapon to anyone said the kid he will kill you if you disobey him said penelope and then what use will you be to me give it to him the kid paused for another moment then very carefully withdrew his laser pistol and handed it to mboya thanks for not being stupid said mboya tucking the pistol into his belt he looked at penelope i thought we had an agreement you had no intention of keeping it she said what happens now asked mboya do i die of a stroke or a heart attack or do you cause a meteor to fall on my head i know i cant touch you but whatever happens i plan to take him with me i will do nothing to hinder you said penelope she smiled at him a smile that terrified him far more than the thought of the various fates awaiting him youre just going to let me go to the spaceport and take my ship out of here mboya said dubiously you will not live to reach the spaceport i thought you just said that you werent going to kill me i am not said penelope she looked at the kid he is what the hell are you talking about rasped the kid hes got a gun in my ribs and you made me give my own weapon away i am the prophet she said serenely did you not promise to follow me blindly yes but then kill him the kid stared into her expressionless face for a moment then he pivoted on his heel and tried to slap the pistol out of mboyas hand mboya was ready for him and stepped back the kid missed and went sprawling on the street get up said penelope the kid got carefully to his feet staring at the barrel of the sonic pistol that was aimed at him dont make me do this kid said mboya alternating his attention between the kid and penelope now attack said penelope youre crazy snapped the kid i take one step toward him and im a dead man would you rather face him or me said penelope the kid considered her question then sprang toward mboya with a howl of animal rage fully expecting to be dead before he reached him mboya pulled the trigger and his sonic pistol sputtered once and then went dead the kid reached him an instant later and the two men rolled on the street scratching gouging kneeing pummeling the kid tried to pull a knife from his boot but mboya knocked it loose from his hand and it flew some twenty feet away then suddenly they were on their feet again and the kid realized that he was up against a superior fighter a man who knew every martial discipline whose feet were as deadly as his hands perhaps moreso the kid swung a roundhouse right at mboya who ducked stepped inside it gave him two quick blows to the ribs and a spinning kick to the jaw that sent him sprawling he was up again instantly and this time he remembered the implants no longer did he try to overpower his heavier antagonist but concentrated on blocking blows and kicks while striking with lightninglike swiftness he broke through mboyas guard three times but realized that he wasnt doing sufficient damage that speed alone wouldnt carry the day against mboyas expertise he began backing away in the direction of the knife and a moment later allowed mboya to land a solid kick to his chest hurling him backward onto the street this time when he got up it was with the knife in his hand mboya saw it and went into a defensive posture but for all his many skills he was no match for the sheer speed with which the kid wielded his weapon and within seconds the kid had slashed him twice on the ribs and once on the side of the neck mboya instinctively placed a hand to the neck wound exposing his torso and the kid plunged the knife deep into his belly he fell to the ground holding both hands to his newest wound and groaning finish the job said penelope as the kid stepped back why bother replied the kid hes not going to cause you any trouble for a long long time i said finish the job said penelope the kid stared at mboya then looked up at penelope why because i told you to and no other reason is necessary i thought you were keeping him for a purpose he has served it said penelope staring off into the distance finish the job the kid looked at her for another moment then knelt down next to mboya grabbed his hair with his free hand and slashed his throat mboya gurgled once and then died satisfied said the kid straightening up yes said penelope i am satisfied what was that all about asked the kid looking up and down the street for signs of the police but finding none why didnt you kill him yourself because this was a necessary part of your education answered penelope i didnt learn all that much said the kid wryly you learned the most important lesson of all said penelope you learned that when i tell you to do something it must be done even in the face of certain death she paused you also learned that when i tell you to finish a job you may not disobey me she smiled at him her gaze back from the future and trained intently on his face soon you will obey me without hesitation without thinking soon you will be worthy of the tasks i shall give you and the rewards you shall receive you are progressing very rapidly neil cayman i told you before thats not my name anymore i know she replied and i shall not use it again you have proven yourself to me and you have earned a new name good he said im glad we agree on that yes we do said penelope stepping around mboyas corpse and walking off toward her groundcar follow me fido the kid was about to protest then he remembered the pain she had visited upon him at the beginning of the week and he sighed and fell into step behind her penelope commanded her front door to slide open then ushered the kid inside and led him through the foyer to the large room that overlooked the pond the kid looked around and saw a rag doll lying on the couch whose is that he asked pointing toward it mine said penelope with no show of embarrassment she picked it up and cuddled it to her breast arent you a little old for dolls i had a kitten once she replied tightening her grip on the doll as if afraid that someone would come into the room and take it away from her it wouldnt come near me and whenever i reached out to it it hissed and spat at me maybe it was just a spooky kitten he suggested she shook her head i bought a puppy three months ago it ran up to every stranger wagging its tailbut it would never remain in the same room with me a rag dolls a poor substitute said the kid perhaps she agreed but it has never run from me and it has never attempted to betray me and that is more than i can say about any human ive ever known any human she paused a wistful expression on her face there was one a very long time ago a woman who fed me and protected me and whom i loved very much but even she turned against me in the end she turned to face the kid it is more difficult than you think to be the prophet to know that every member of the race that gave you birth hates and fears you not without cause noted the kid you really did a job on them last night only because the anointed one has decreed that i must die she smiled bitterly the anointed one whom i have never met never challenged never opposed he was well on his way to attacking the democracy but then he somehow heard of my powers and has decided to make war on me instead of upon the navy the iceman who knows he cannot possibly hinder me nonetheless pays you to spy on me the black death who knew what happens to those who are disloyal to me died rather than stay and continue working for me she paused and sighed i always knew he would if you knew he was going to be disloyal why didnt you get rid of him sooner as i told you he had a function to perform to die in minuet to provide you with the opportunity to prove your fidelity to me she said it was imperative that you be presented with a situation where you would surely die if you did not trust in my powers and yield to my authority why asked the kid you had mboya already she shook her head he was destined to desert me how do you know i wont because you are selfish enough and greedy enough and immoral enough to realize that your best interest lies in total fealty to me she replied i dont know that i especially like that assessment of me said the kid the question is not whether you like it replied penelope but whether it is true she paused you have made only two friends on the inner frontier felix lomax and carlos mendoza and yet here you are working for me and prepared to betray both of them what do you know about the gravedancer demanded the kid surprised do you think i am without my spies and my informants or that you can keep any secrets from me she asked with an amused smile do not try to change the subject fido have you deserted them or not my names the silicon kid your name is whatever i choose it to be answered penelope just as your destiny is speaking of destinies there are a lot of people who would pay a hell of a lot of money to know what yours is she looked out at the pond i know what it should be but there are still too many variables too many intangibles in the equation she turned to stare at him that is why you are here what do you expect me to do asked the kid i have many tasks for you said penelope if you succeed at them you will be handsomely rewarded if you fail you will surely die the kid looked unimpressed this is silly he said why dont you just read the future and tell me what i have to do in order to succeed she shook her head and looked back at the pond that presupposes that there is only one future she answered and as i have explained to you before there are more futures than there are grains of sand on a beach i cannot yet see them all with equal clarity the kid sat down on a couch and stretched his arms along the top of it all right he said just what is it that you want me to do next she turned to him but again he got the distinct impression that she was looking past or through him into the future you will kill moses mohammed christ who calls himself the anointed one just like that asked the kid with a smile hes probably better protected than the secretary of the democracy and hes certain to be awfully well hidden i know where he is how many bodyguards has he got she shrugged it makes no difference she said his bodyguards with one exception will cause you no problems whos the one who will cause me a problem felix lomax the gravedancer said the kid what trouble can he cause hell he still thinks im working for him and the iceman he will know not unless you tell him he wont said the kid confidently or are you saying that hes a telepath too neither he nor i is a telepath answered penelope but on the other hand neither of us is a fool he will see you there and he will deduce the reason for your presence the kid considered her statement then shrugged then ill kill him he will not be as easy to kill as you seem to think she said i killed mboya didnt i i was there to help you you didnt lift a finger he said i killed him on my own i did not lift a finger she repeated with a smile why do you suppose his pistol failed to function well after that said the kid uneasily you really believe that dont you she said with a sigh you are a fool fido i told you not to call me that he snapped she looked amused do you think to frighten me or do you think that i will be as easy to kill as the black death was he glared sullenly at her but said nothing i admire a show of spirit in any young animal even a young man she continued but if you direct it at me again i will have to discipline you there are men out there many men who need killing you must learn to focus your rage she paused you must also learn that being young and strong and fast and even unafraid is not enough when you face an opponent such as felix lomax come on he said unimpressed if i get in any trouble youll just do whatever you did with mboya and thatll be that why are you trying to make this seem more dangerous or difficult than it is you will be hundreds perhaps thousands of lightyears away from me she answered i cannot control events that precisely from so great a distance if i could i wouldnt need you i can do it without you he said confidently if it was an impossible task i wouldnt send you she said i detest waste well then i know that you can kill the anointed one i do not know if you will kill him thanks for your confidence he said sardonically there are many futures in which you kill him and in some you kill felix lomax as well but there are an almost equal number of futures in which you lie dead at lomaxs feet none of those are going to come to pass i hope not but i do not know i know said the kid he paused once i take care of the gravedancer and the anointed one maybe ill go after the iceman she shook her head he is the only man that i have ever feared you cannot kill him hes an old man who lets other people do his fighting for him you will not oppose him now or ever she said but i can take him he was responsible for the death of the only person i ever cared for she said so softly that the kid had difficulty making out the words he is the man who convinced the democracy to try to kill me she paused as the memories came flooding back he is the reason i remained imprisoned on hades after i had manipulated events to arrange my escape whenever i have been made to suffer and i have suffered much believe me he has been the cause of it all the more reason for me to kill him and for the first time since he had known her the emotionless mask dropped from penelopes face she turned away from the window to face him and her eyes shone with a terrifying hatred he is mine she whispered the kid left mozart six hours later as his ship broke out of orbit he was still contemplating the almost tangible fury in penelopes voice and feeling very relieved that all he had to do was face the best killer and the most powerful fanatic in the galaxy he did not envy the iceman and far behind him penelope bailey hugged her doll to her bosom and wondered what her life might have been like had she been an ordinary woman then she realized that for the first time in many years she was crying she wiped the tears off her cheeks put out of her mind all thought of the way things might have been and went back to sorting out the various futures that confronted her part the anointed ones book felix lomax awoke with a start when the ship signaled him that he had an incoming message he sat erect blinked his eyes very rapidly for a moment then instructed the screen to activate a holograph of milo korbekkian with mount olympus clearly visible through the window behind his desk instantly appeared good morning gravedancer he said it took me a while to track you down lomax shrugged the iceman keeps moving i missed him on sweetwater and again on confucius iv he paused hes not doing much to cover his trail ill catch up with him sooner or later sooner said korbekkian i just got word that hes finally returned to last chance youre sure my source claims to have seen him i notice your source didnt feel compelled to go up against him noted lomax caustically the anointed one has given you the commission no one else in our organization will try to kill him unless you fail i wont fail said lomax just have the second half of the money ready to deposit in my account next time you hear from me we have an agreement we shall not renege on it see to it that you dont lomax broke the connection and directed his navigational computer to lay in a course for last chance far into the inner frontier then he unstrapped himself from his seat made his way through the cramped quarters to the lavatory shaved and took a quick dryshower and emerged feeling somewhat refreshed he selected a few mutated fruits from the galley ordered the computer to brew a pot of coffee and sat down to eat the skinless oranges and sweetlemons it had been a dull two weeks since he had met the anointed one he had no intention of finding the iceman where anyone loyal to his new employer might chance to see them and so he had purposely gone off on false trails and had made sure he hit sweetwater and confucius long after his prey had gone he didnt dare raise the iceman on subspace radio to relay his findings since he couldnt know whether the men operating the various sending stations were in league with the anointed one so he had simply bided his time waiting for the iceman to return to his home world in the process he had learned even more about the extent of the anointed ones empire enough to conclude that moses mohammed christ did in fact pose a serious threat to all those worlds on the outskirts of the democracy and possibly to the entire inner frontier as well he may have held his legions together through the religion he had invented but he was anything but a simple fanatic his organization was structured along military lines and functioned with clocklike precision every man knew his position knew who he must report to knew what was expected of him their financing was quite sophisticated the anointed one floated the bulk of his principal on a fourworld circuit during the course of a galactic standard day drawing interest at each bank during that banks operating hours before transferring it to the next they were ready for the unexpected as well take that firebombing or whatever it was of the churches by the next morning the anointed one had a list of every damaged building every lost member of his organization every police report concerning what might have happened and who might have been responsible monies were dispersed auxiliary plans were brought to bear and the organization barely missed a beat as for the anointed one himself lomax had the feeling that if he were just one whit more cynical or untrusting hed have had the perfect temperament for a gunfighter he had met with him twice now and he still didnt know if he was dealing with a religious fanatic a masterful politician a superior tactician or a combination of all three lomax finished his meal got his coffee and walked back to the cockpit it was perhaps the most uncomfortable section of the ship but for some reason he preferred sitting up there it wasnt as if he couldnt control the ship and even its weaponry by voice from his bunk or couldnt direct the computer to display a hologram of the viewscreen anywhere within the body of the ship but for some reason he tended to read nap and drink in the pilots chair it made him feel closer to the action even though he knew that was a false premise and that indeed there was no action to be had so he loafed and read and slept and thought and two days later the computer announced that he had reached his destination and was entering orbit around last chance he requested permission to land received the necessary coordinates and touched down some twenty minutes later he walked the dusty mile from the spaceport to the end of the line then entered it and looked around for the iceman who was sitting alone at a table near the doorway a tall drink in his hand lomax approached him holding his hands in plain view just in case the iceman either hadnt received his message or more likely hadnt believed it good afternoon gravedancer said the iceman with a smile good afternoon replied lomax may i sit down of course care for something cold to drink a beer would be nice the iceman signaled to one of the bartenders who immediately brought over a tall glass of beer thanks said lomax taking a long swallow you know someday you really ought to consider paving your streets and stop all my customers from arriving with a killing thirst chuckled the iceman dont be silly the smile vanished and dont drop your hands below the top of the table until were through talking didnt the kid reach you asked lomax yes then you got my message i did said the iceman the question is do i believe it well do you probably but lets talk anyway suits me said lomax wheres the kid did you send him packing not quite replied the iceman hes on a little errand for me he paused tell me about the anointed one who is he and why does he want me dead hes a religious fanatic answered lomax his organization is established on more than three thousand worlds and hes got a couple of hundred million wildeyed zealots believing hes got a direct line to god theyre willing to go up against the democracy itself if he tells them to whats that got to do with me somewhere along the way he found or manufactured an enemy that he thinks is even more powerful than the democracy or at least poses more of a threat she goes by the name of the prophet lomax paused shes some kind of bandit or killer out here on the frontier and evidently youve gone up against her before more to the point you survived your encounter which leads him to believe that youre now in league with her a logical conclusion said the iceman wrong but logical he paused all right you can drop your hands now logical repeated lomax frowning are you saying that this woman is so powerful that if you lived there has to be a reason for it other than your own abilities i can see where he might think so answered the iceman why has she kept her identity such a secret asked lomax i mean hell ive heard the prophet mentioned maybe three times in the past four or five years youve heard of her before said the iceman with the trace of a smile shes had other names in the past such as the soothsayer and the oracle youre telling me the oracle and the prophet are the same person thats right how much danger are you in from her asked lomax probably no more than you are responded the iceman which is not to say im not in danger we all are i dont think i understand what i mean is i doubt that she has singled me out for termination said the iceman that would be imbuing her with human emotions and human responses that i dont think she possesses any longer if indeed she ever did he paused but that doesnt mean the entire race isnt in danger this is a woman capable of destroying entire planets i dont know what her eventual goals are but i cant imagine that humanity as a whole is going to be well served by them she really can destroy whole worlds asked lomax dubiously absolutely ive seen the results then old moses is probably right about her being behind the fires whos moses and what fires are you talking about moses is moses mohammed christ which is what he calls himself when hes not busy being the anointed one and the fires a couple of hundred of his temples on worlds all the hell over the galaxy erupted in flames almost simultaneously the police on the various worlds havent turned up any clues but theyre sure its not arson and the military agrees as for moses hes dead certain it was the prophets doing lomax looked across the table at the iceman i thought he was crazy until now she did it all right said the iceman shes the only person who could have done it lomax finished his beer and signaled for a refill which arrived almost instantly am i correct in assuming that the kids assignment has something to do with the prophet the iceman nodded i sent him to the world shes living on then hes probably dead already i doubt it said the iceman first i told him just to gather information and if she cant see a future in which he kills her she wont feel it necessary to terminate him also added the iceman with a smile that young mans as transparent as glass fivell get you ten hes already sold out and joined up with her what use would she have for him asked lomax hes a connection to you and me and she probably would like to see us both dead me on general principles you because youre working for her enemy i thought you were too insignificant for her to bother with noted lomax wryly im too insignificant for her to waste her time hunting the galaxy for me answered the iceman but if the kid can deliver me to her well thats a different matter has it occurred to you suggested lomax that the smartest thing you and i can do is take a vacation to deluros viii or some other world at the center of the democracy and just wait there in comfort until the anointed one and the prophet kill each other off hes no match for her no match repeated lomax i told you hes got close to three hundred million followers three hundred three hundred million three billion it makes no difference said the iceman if he goes up against her hes going to lose just what kind of power does she possess shes precognitive then shell know how to hide where he cant find her said lomax id hardly call that winning you dont understand continued the iceman she can see every possible permutation every conceivable future and when she sees the one she wants she figures out how to manipulate events so that it comes to pass he paused and finally remembering his drink took a sip from it take those fires the other night you dont think she had agents on two hundred worlds set them do you there was no sign of arson admitted lomax of course there wasnt then how did she do it she sat down and stared into the future into hundreds maybe millions of futures and saw that in one of them someone dropped a lit cigarette and in another a meteor made a dead hit on a temple and in a third someone left some oilsoaked rags in one of the storerooms and so on okay she saw all that how did she make it happen i dont know said the iceman i wasnt there but ive seen her do it before shell flinch or strike a pose or move to a different spot or how does that effect events thousands of lightyears away interrupted lomax i dont know repeated the iceman hell i doubt if she understands how it works but she knows that it works and what if she cant manipulate her way out of a jam then shell wait until she can answered the iceman shes been captured before but shes never stayed captured and he added grimly things have not gone very well for those who did the capturing okay so no one wants to get near her said lomax whats to stop the anointed one from encircling her planet with warships and obliterating it i dont know said the iceman maybe a meteor swarm would wipe them out maybe every member of the crew would contract some virus maybe the weapons would malfunction or maybe the bombs would explode and every living thing on the planet would die except her so how do you defeat someone like that ive spent a lot of time thinking about it this past week answered the iceman and there might be a way im not sure i think with someone like her youd want to be sure the iceman shook his head grimly with someone like her you can never be sure all you can do is hope suddenly there was a shrill yell from the casino where a miner had just hit his number at the roulette wheel the man did a little jig cashed in his chips and offered to buy drinks for everyone in the house a relatively inexpensive proposition as there were only six people in the casino and another four in the bar where was i asked the iceman turning back to lomax you were saying you thought you knew how to beat her replied lomax well its a possibility anyway said the iceman care to tell me about it im going to do more than that said the iceman im going to enlist your aid oh how you came here to do a job right i came here to tell you what i had learned lomax corrected him you came here to kill me for the anointed one said the iceman well thats what he thinks anyway i need his help to accomplish my plan continued the iceman hes not going to give it to me of course but theres every likelihood that hell give it to you why the hell should he replied lomax im going to have to report that you were gone by the time i got to last chance he paused then smiled wryly even if he buys it hes not going to have much use for me he considered the prospects maybe ill just keep clear of him and live on the down payment i got for killing you no said the iceman youre not going to tell him an obvious lie about not finding me and youre not going to go into hiding i told you i need his help so what am i going to do asked lomax youre going to earn his trust and maybe even move up a couple of notches in his organization to where you can do me even more good and how do you think im going to do that demanded lomax the iceman smiled youre going to kill me of course they were in the icemans office and lomax sitting in a corner beneath a number of plaques and awards that had been given to carlos mendoza for his fifteenyear period of government service was examining various hand weapons finally he looked up i think it would be easiest with a projectile pistol he said we could just fill it with blanks they make a hell of a bang and you could stick some phony blood beneath your tunic in a plastic bag just grab your chest when you hear the shots and cut the bag open true said the iceman but you dont use a projectile weapon your trademark is a laser pistol hard to fake a laser burn though answered lomax i can set it for a precise distance but if youre a foot farther away everyone will see that it didnt reach you and if youre three inches too close youre going to have a roasted heart how about a sonic gun asked the iceman lomax shook his head if im going to use a gun thats not my own the projectile pistol makes more sense the iceman considered that for a moment then sighed okay he said i suppose well just have to go with it lomax got up walked to a bar opposite the iceman s desk and poured himself a drink from the icemans private stock you really think this will fool her he asked after he had downed the drink and poured himself another it was never intended to fool her replied the iceman swiveling on his chair to look at lomax if she looks at enough futures shell find me in some of them then why to fool him answered the iceman why bother two reasons first i dont want the anointed one wasting his time or his resources hunting me down said the iceman and second i want a nice spectacular killing to help you win his trust he paused two killings actually two asked lomax unless i miss my guess our friend neil cayman has taken a look at penelope bailey and a look at us and decided that hell live a lot longer if he joins forces with her its possible admitted lomax and since the one thing she doesnt need is a personal bodyguard the likelihood is that shell send him out to kill either me or the anointed one the kid isnt exactly a genius but hes not suicidal either if she sends him after me hell desert he knows i cant be touched on last chance but if she sends him after the anointed one you can score even more points with your boss by killing him can i kill him asked lomax you mentioned that hes got another implant you do this for a living said the iceman hes just a kid with quick reflexes and delusions of grandeur i trust you to find a way lomax grimaced i have a feeling it wont be quite as easy as you make it sound im about to face penelope bailey herself said the iceman with a wry smile youll forgive me if my heart doesnt bleed for a professional killer who has to face a hotheaded kid whos feeling his hormones point taken said lomax returning his smile suddenly the smile vanished do you know yet how youre going to take her out the iceman put his feet up on his desk im working on it he replied well youve gone up against her twice before probably you learned something from it not much came the answer the first time i just tried to stop her from killing someone i cared for the second time i tried to prevent her from escaping from a prison cell on hades ive never actually tried to harm her before can it be done i dont know said the iceman honestiy i think i might have been able to do it when she was eight years old but now he shrugged i just know that i have to try do you mind if i ask you a question go ahead why do you have to try asked lomax i mean with the anointed one weve got a legitimate fanatic whos sworn to overthrow the democracy and has a couple of hundred million followers who will shoot at anything he tells them to shoot at but the prophet shes never actually caused any harm and shes hardly got an army at her beck and call so why not leave her alone she doesnt need an army answered the iceman lighting a small thin antarrean cigar all by herself shes more than a match for the anointed one the iceman puffed on his cigar i still dont think you realize just what she is her motivations arent human her thought processes arent human her powers certainly arent human and her goals arent human what are her goals whatever they are theyre contrary to ours how can you be sure of that someday if you live through this fly out to the alpha crepello system said the iceman and then what then try to find the third planet youre telling me she destroyed an entire planet said lomax finally finishing his second drink and walking back to his chair thats right why she was kept prisoner there for sixteen years then she had some cause didnt she to kill everyone on an entire planet demanded the iceman what happens if she doesnt like her tax bill next year there are eleven billion men on deluros viii believe me when i tell you she can destroy it just as easily as she destroyed hades hades alpha crepello iii to your knowledge has she ever killed any human who wasnt trying to kill her persisted lomax the icemans mind flashed back over the years to an everyouthful gunfighter lying dead in the street and to a small wiry woman with a pained puzzled expression on her face as a red blolch spread across her shirt you might say no answered the iceman i say yes whats the difference because when you have the power to save people and you let them die i call it murder thats debatable thats why i said you might not agree with me the iceman paused its academic anyway either youre with me or youre not and if youre not then youre with her whether you know it or not youre paying the bills said lomax laconically besides who knows i might get to take out the anointed one as an added bonus the iceman shook his head vigorously absolutely not we need him we do for what all in good time said the iceman you can trust me said lomax i know i can said the iceman in fact i cant do what i have to do without you im just not quite sure of all the details yet once i leave here how will you be able to let me know what you want me to do give me a scramble code for your ship said the iceman putting his cigar out withdrawing another from a pocket of his tunic changing his mind and replacing it when im ready to move ill contact you and give you your instructions that may not be enough said lomax the anointed one moves around we could be on any of fifty planets when you finally decide to get in touch with me theres every chance ill be out of sending range he paused maybe i should contact you the iceman shrugged as you wish youll be at the end of the line ill be on last chance at any rate answered the iceman he scribbled a number on a piece of paper heres my code load it into your ships computer when you leave thanks said lomax one more queshon go ahead what if hes so impressed that i was able to kill you that he sends me after the prophet he wont how do you know youve never met him no man reaches his position without having a brain and using it answered the iceman if youre good enough to kill me youre too good to waste against penelope bailey youll be far more valuable to him as a bodyguard maybe he doesnt know she can read the future persisted lomax maybe he thinks she can be killed just like anyone else then stall hes not the kind of man you can stall the iceman stared at him for a moment all right then well just have to see to it that youre in no condition to go out after penelope bailey for a few weeks i dont like the sound of this said lomax you wont like the feel of it either said the iceman but its the only way to make sure he doesnt send you after her lomax returned the icemans stare lets have it i think im going to have to bust you up a little bit in the bar tonight itll lend authenticity to your reason for shooting me down how much asked lomax suspiciously not too much maybe an arm or a leg just enough to keep you from being able to go after penelope and what if the silicon kid shows up three days later shit muttered the iceman i forgot about him he sighed you can take him if youre one hundred percent but not if youre crippled up i suppose well have to fake it that sounds like a lot of faking for two men who arent exactly professional actors said lomax itll work said the iceman by the time anyone pays much attention itll all be over youll walk out immediately ill instruct my men to let you go and there will be a couple of them outside waiting to rush you to your ship just in case someone wants to avenge me or more likely add to his reputation by killing the man who killed me and ill be carried into my office before anyone can examine me the word will get out by tomorrow morning and last chance will issue formal denials for a few days and then admit that i was killed by the gravedancer he grinned once im sure youre safe inside the anointed ones sphere of influence we might even put a price on your head just to make it look legitimate youre sure this is all necessary asked lomax i mean you could just go into hiding for awhile and i could pass the word that ive killed you the iceman shook his head no weve got to go through with it somebody told your boss that i was on last chance that means somebody saw me here for all we know hes still on the planet and if he is hell certainly be at the bar or the casino tonight i mean hell theres nowhere else to go here whoever he is hes got to see you kill me and confirm your story or theres every chance the anointed one wont believe it all right said lomax settling back in his chair and smiling i suppose i can live with being known as the man who killed the iceman he paused i wonder how many men died trying to get that title more than i hope you can imagine said the iceman grimly the end of the line was crowded lomax arrived after taking a dryshower and dining in his room and found himself in the midst of the usual miners traders explorers adventurers bounty hunters whores and misfits some dressed in brilliantly colored silks and satins some in outfits that would look more at home in the midst of a war there was a fairsized alien contingent there too a few canphorites some lodinites and robelians an enormous torqual and even a pair of diminutive faerielike andricans the first of that species lomax had ever seen the iceman wasnt in evidence so lomax strolled over to the gaming tables he passed up the roulette wheel and the blackjack games and spent a few minutes losing a quick seventy credits at a jabob game the andrican who beat him looked so childishly pleased with itself strutting and waving its money around with a laugh that sounded like the delicate tinkling of wind chimes that even lomax was amused and finally he wandered back to the tavern most of the tables were full there were a pair available near the casino but the last thing he needed to do was make his escape past half a dozen bounty hunters some of whom might start wondering if a reward would be posted for the icemans murderer and so he waited until one opened up by the outside door he sat down ordered a bottle of cygnian cognac poured himself a glass and once again surveyed the room his path to the door was clear he was in plain sight of the huge oneway mirror behind the bar where the iceman would have a couple of men stationed to protect him he was partially in shadow so if he didnt jerk his supposedly wounded arm just right no one would see it the best of the bounty hunters by reputation anyway were some sixty feet away at the gaming tables and they wouldnt risk hitting any customers as he walked out the door he gingerly felt his left arm with the fingers of his right hand the artificial blood was there right over his biceps where the iceman could slit it open with a knife then he checked his weaponry again the projectile weapon filled with blanks sat on his right hip where he could reach it with his good arm and on his left hip was a laser pistol just in case the icemans protection wasnt quite as promised lomax forced his body to relax content that he had done everything he could do to help carry off the ruse now it was just a matter of waiting for the iceman who in turn was undoubtedly waiting long enough to be sure that the anointed ones informant was on the premises one of the whores sidled up to him and he spoke to her for a few minutes when she realized that he had no interest in transacting any business with her she moved off to a likelier target and something about her body language conveyed to the other whores the fact that the man in black wasnt in a buying mood finally after another hour had passed the iceman emerged from his office he walked past lomaxs table with no sign of recognition spent a few minutes gladhanding the customers checked with his gamesmen and dealers to see how the casino was doing then stopped by the bar for a beer he downed it asked for a refill and carried his glass over to lomaxs table you all set he asked softly lomax nodded as ready as ill ever be good lets wait a few more minutes just in case our man is a late sleeper even if he is youll have a hundred eyewitnesses noted lomax true admitted the iceman but im sure the anointed one would rather have a firsthand report i would youre the boss said lomax picking up his glass and taking yet another sip of his cognac they passed a few minutes in silence and finally the iceman spoke again id say its about time he paused i almost hate to see you leave last chance he added wryly thats expensive stuff youre drinking thats okay said lomax with a smile its on my tab which i have no intention of paying the hell youre not paying it yelled the iceman in a voice that rang out throughout the tavern when you come into my establishment youre no different than anyone else youd be surprised how different i am old man replied lomax not quite yelling but making sure that he too could be heard you bleed like anybody else snapped the iceman drawing a knife and slashing at lomaxs left arm just below the elbow and lomax felt a bolt of pain surge through him and blood real blood began discoloring his shirt sleeve that was supposed to be my upper arm you asshole he grated as the iceman hurled his aging body at lomax i decided we couldnt take the chance whispered the iceman now shoot me before someone pulls us apart lomax managed to withdraw his projectile weapon and an instant later four loud explosions echoed through the tavern the iceman clutched at his chest managed to slit open the blood bag with his knife spun around once so that everyone could see that his chest and stomach were drenched in blood and collapsed to the floor while the attention had been focused on the iceman lomax had holstered the projectile weapon painfully withdrawn his laser pistol and transferred it to his good hand now he began backing out of the tavern very carefully watchful for any indication that one of the customers might try to stop him nothing happened and a moment later he found himself in the street lets go whispered a voice and he was instantly surrounded by three men in just a second he said his speech starting to slur i just have to get my bearings what bearings whispered the voice youre standing right in front of the end of the line it must be raining mumbled lomax im all wet whats the matter demanded another voice just how much did you drink tonight not much answered lomax whats the matter with me im dizzy come on whispered the first voice before someone comes after you right said lomax suddenly he dropped to his knees i cant stand up he murmured jesus hissed a third voice look at his arm i think the iceman hit an artery hes lost a lot of blood then fix a tourniquet but lets get out of here hold him still hes soaked with the stuff very good cognac muttered lomax and passed out he remembered nothing about the next four hours evidently they patched him up put him in his ship and set the navigational computer to take him a few hundred lightyears away and then brake to a stop in the void between star systems they could have doped him up a bit he thought bitterly as he tried to ignore the shooting pain whenever he moved his left arm however slightly they had cut his shirt off and bandaged his arm with the few strips of the cloth that werent already bloodsoaked but the blood had congealed and he was in utter agony as he cut the material off he had disinfectants galore in his medical kit but nothing with which to sew up or cauterize the wound and he instructed his ship to land at the first human outpost it was the icemans fault he decided trying to restrain his rage nobody could ever tell that fat old man anything he had planned this from the start and all that stuff during the afternoon about how he would fake a wound was just a smoke screen he knew exactly what he was doing old mendoza it was a deep and painful wound and lomax was weak enough from loss of blood that the anointed one was sure to give him a few days to recuperate rather than send him out after the prophet and yet with the experience of a lifetime the iceman had managed to miss most of the major nerves and tendons while opening the artery it was an ugly wound and a painful one but it wouldnt incapacitate him if he had to go up against the kid in a few days time a quick transfusion of blood and some painkillers and hed be almost as good as new by the time the kid showed up hed fake weakness as the iceman knew he would rather than go after the prophet who seemed totally invincible to him anyway and probably the rumors of his brush with death and his weakened condition would be just the edge he needed against the kid the goddamned iceman thought of everything and although he was undoubtedly right lomax couldnt stop feeling furious with him he faded in and out of consciousness for the next day and finally awoke with a start when his computer signaled him that it had received permission to land on pollux iv he radioed ahead for medical service was transferred to an ambulance and raced to a nearby medical center and two days later his arm bound in sterile packing and his blood count back to normal he took off again he had no idea where the anointed one was but he contacted korbekkian on olympus via a scrambled channel and was told that his leader was currently ensconced in a fortress on the desert world of beta stromberg known locally as new gobi he loaded the coordinates into his computer ate a light meal and slept most of the way there once in orbit he used the secret frequency korbekkian had given him to announce his presence and a few moments later was directed to land at a small field on the equator he emerged from his ship into the incredibly hot sunlight and felt a momentary dizziness as he carried his duffel bag to the tiny customs station where he was immediately given a tall container of water and some salt tablets it takes getting used to confided one of the guards no more than hell does ill wager muttered lomax downing the water and a pair of tablets the guard laughed at that no bet he said lomax looked around shading his eyes from the sun with his good hand what now he asked come with me said the guard leading him off to a groundcar hes waiting for you youre a hero gravedancer said the guard he sent a lot of men out after the iceman youre the one who succeeded you people know about that already not much happens that the anointed one doesnt know about answered the guard as they climbed into the machine he ordered the ignition to activate and suddenly lomax felt a lifegiving cold breeze hit him from all directions better asked the guard much answered lomax i may never get out the guard laughed again and sped off along a narrow tract of ground that differed from the rest of the surrounding area only in that it possessed tire marks they drove for about ten miles circled an immense sand dune and suddenly were confronted by an enormous fortress capable of housing at least three thousand men you guys didnt build this on the spur of the moment remarked lomax studying the building a huge angular structure with tight molecular bonding that made the relatively thin walls almost impervious to attack no answered the guard it was standing here deserted when we first arrived a few years ago evidently there was a native race that resented mans presence a few centuries ago there are maybe two dozen fortresses like this all over the planet and the native race gone whats so important about new gobi that we had to kill off an entire race to possess it asked lomax curiously beats me said the guard probably just because it was here lomax nodded sounds about right well said the guard we might as well go in itd damned well better be climatecontrolled said lomax as he reluctantly got out of the groundcars cool compartment it probably wouldnt bother the anointed one if it wasnt confided the guard he s totally beyond such mundane concerns as physical comfort but he understands that the rest of us have human weaknesses and limitations and he takes care of his followers that means its cool inside asked lomax as the sun bore down upon his head and neck right then lets hurry said lomax increasing his pace they reached the heavily guarded entrance and were passed through without question the guard turned lomax over to a pair of men in military uniforms then left and began driving back to the spaceport the two men accompanied lomax down a long highceilinged corridor until they came to a pair of ornate double doors hes inside said one of the men youre to go in alone thanks you know the procedure asked the other well enough to get by answered lomax the man stared at him but offered no comment and a moment later the two doors swung open just enough for lomax to pass through them then silently closed behind him moses mohammed christ was on his selfstyled throne wearing the white robe and gold chain that seemed to be his trademark his alien feline carnivore lay at his feet as always welcome back mr lomax he said a smile of greeting crossing his ascetic face you have done well thank you my lord said lomax approaching to within fifteen feet of him then stopping as the carnivore s muscles began tensing i understand that you did not emerge unscathed continued the anointed one not quite said lomax he gestured to his left arm which was hanging limp at his side the medics say that ill be as good as new in three or four weeks thats excellent news said the anointed one i would hate to lose the services of the man who killed carlos mendoza he paused the remainder of your fee has been deposited in your account as we agreed i never doubted that it would be said lomax everyone knows you are a man of your word my lord the anointed one leaned forward tell me about your adventure mr lomax theres nothing much to tell my lord i insulted him he lost his temper and i killed him it was just another days work youre too modest mr lomax said the anointed one i sent four men to last chance ahead of you why did you succeed when they failed its like i told you when we first met my lord said lomax im the best there is and how did you escape surely the iceman had bodyguards men posted around his establishment youre a sharp son of a bitch arent you thought lomax wryly youve heard the story from at least one confederate and you still smell a rat aloud he said partly it was the element of surprise my lord the iceman and i were old acquaintances and his men probably werent expecting anything also i was positioned right by the front door so i could make a quick exit surely they could recover their composure and shoot more rapidly than you could move out the doort suggested the anointed one i knew that his men were stationed in the casino and behind a oneway mirror that hung over the bar answered lomax i waited until enough patrons were blocking their view before i precipitated his attack on me he paused it takes a long time to tell but it was over in just a couple of seconds and how did you make it to your ship as badly wounded as you were i had a vehicle waiting outside lied lomax that was a most remarkable escape commented the anointed one look said lomax heatedly if you think im lying you can check with last chance theyll confirm that the icemans dead and you can check with the hospital on pollux iv theyre the ones who patched me up i already have said the anointed one lomax stared at him well then i have a fondness for tales of derringdo said the anointed one with a smile as long as you keep paying for them ill keep giving you new ones said lomax am i doing it righf did i get too mad too soon should i have been so defensive damn it iceman i wish you were here you re a hell of a lot better at lying and doubledealing than i am and this is one smart bastard this anointed one almost as smart as you you shall have ample opportunity to said the anointed one i have already selected your next target ill just bet you have but until you are fully healed you will remain here on new gobi with me he paused i have long needed a man of your capabilities mr lomax i think we shall have a long and fruitful relationship i hope so my lord if you are loyal to me and fulfill your assignments you can become one of the most powerful men in the galaxy i can live with that my lord said lomax forcing a smile to his face i am sure that you can the anointed one paused and stared at him intently but if you betray my trust i can promise you a death such as few men have ever experienced lomax returned his stare he doesnt want to impress me with that if he could scare me im not the man hes seeking save your threats my lord he said in level tones im a businessman and ive made a considered judgment that my best interests lie in serving you if i should ever become convinced that i made a wrong decision youll be in no position to order my death the anointed one smiled i like you mr lomax he said you are forthright and uncomplicated you wish to kill and become rich i seek an executioner whose motivation is reasonable and predictable i foresee that we shall work in harmony for many years to come i see no reason why we shouldnt my lord good said the anointed one now go to your quarters unpack your gear and relax you will join me for supper tonight where ill send some men to accompany you until you become better acquainted with your surroundings answered the anointed one its a very large fortress thank you my lord said lomax bowing and backing toward the doors which opened just before he reached them he was escorted to his quarters a large airy room with a window overlooking a flowered courtyard and immediately took another pain pill then he sent for his belongings which the guard from the spaceport had left at the entrance of the fortress took a dryshower being careful to keep his left arm free from the light chemical spray and shaved he considered taking more salt tablets but the interior of the fortress was pleasantly cool and he had no intention of going outside again so he settled for drinking from the huge container of ice water he found at his bedside then after too many days of napping in the cockpit of his ship he lay down on the airbed floating on the gentle currents and was soon sound asleep he was awakened by a rasping sound and realized that someone was ringing the small bell outside his door he got up off the bed groggily wincing as he used his left arm to support some of his weight and ordered the door to open its dinnertime sir said a uniformed guard five minutes he muttered the anointed one doesnt like to be kept waiting said the guard well if the anointed one doesnt want me passing out at the table he can wait until ive taken my medication said lomax irritably he went into the bathroom washed his face with cold water ran a brush through his hair and took another pain pill he noticed some seepage coming through the dressing on his ann but decided that it would lend verisimilitude to his story and elected not to change the dressing until he returned to the room then he approached the guard who was fidgeting uncomfortably and nodded the man walked off rapidly and lomax followed him through a maze of cool tiled corridors until they came to a large chamber where the anointed one sat alone at one end of a long polished table made of some alien hardwood his pet was nowhere to be seen and lomax concluded that probably even the anointed one couldnt control it when there was food present you are late mr lomax he said emotionlessly im sorry my lord responded lomax as the guard silently left the chamber but im still on medication for my arm i see said the anointed one he paused for a moment then inclined his head almost imperceptibly you are forgiven thank you my lord while you are on medication i will send for you a few minutes early thats the most reasonable approach my lord a man and a woman both clad in conservatively tailored beige robes entered the chamber bearing bowls of salad we do not imbibe stimulants mr lomax said the anointed one as the two servers placed the bowls before them i hope this will not present a hardship for you not at all said lomax as another woman brought in a container of water and two large glasses she filled them to the top and set one in front of each man good for our main course we will have roasted blacksheep blacksheep my lord a mutated sheep from balok xiv answered the anointed one balok xiv my lord asked lomax frowning from the number id have guessed it was a gas giant the anointed one smiled balok has thirtyone planets the only habitable one is balok xiv an agricultural colony where theyve done genetic experimentation with sheep and goats he paused blacksheep go about eight hundred pounds apiece and are said to be the most succulent meat on the inner frontier really im surprised youve never had any i eat very little meat my lord answered lomax good i like a man who watches his diet and his blood pressure and his cholesterol level added lomax with a wry grin ah said the anointed one with a smile then you are not superhuman after all im afraid not my lord lomax paused wondering if he should bring up the subject of penelope bailey or wait for the anointed one to do so finally he decided to take advantage of the opening the only superhuman im aware of is the prophet good said the anointed one i had hoped that we might discuss her this evening he paused did mendoza talk to you about her not much answered lomax he said nothing about her powers lomax shook his head no my lord i was hoping you might tell me about her the anointed one stared at him intently if you know nothing of her powers why do you claim that she is superhuman he asked thats right lomax put your foot into it again why dont you the iceman seemed to think she was he said carefully and as for me i cant believe hed work for anyone who wasnt something out of the ordinary he shrugged he said something about her predicting the future but i dont put much stock in it oh why not maybe she can read the backs of cards or do party tricks but if she could really see the future why didnt she warn him that i had come to last chance to kill him maybe she no longer had any use for him maybe said lomax striving to look unconvinced but predicting the future thats a little hard to swallow then what do you think makes her superhuman mr lomax persisted the anointed one youd better put an end to this before you say something else that he can pounce on lomax i have a reason my lord but i have a feeling it may offend you come said the anointed one you have my permission to speak frankly all right said lomax feigning reluctance i think you fear her my lord and if a man who has no fear of the democracy fears a single woman out of the frontier then she must be in some way superhuman i fear no one snapped the anointed one then i apologize my lord no one do you hear i hear my lord said lomax and since i was mistaken about that then i am certain i was mistaken about the prophet as well he stared unblinking into the coalblack eyes of the anointed one once my arm is totally healed i hope you will commission me to kill her and because i have offended you and i wish to convince you of my loyalty and my desire to remain in your service i will accept such a commission for no fee at all evidently it was the right answer for the tension left the anointed ones thin body and he leaned back on his chair that will not be necessary mr lomax he said his voice once more under control i will pay for value received if you insist my lord said lomax but my offer stands the anointed one continued staring at him you are a most unusual man mr lomax i take that as a high compliment my lord perhaps said the anointed one at the moment though it is merely an observation they ate in silence and then the servers took away their empty salad dishes and brought in the blacksheep get here soon kid thought lomax as he cut himself a small piece of meat and chewed it thoughtfully this man is too goddamned sharp maybe the iceman could handle him but i sure as hell cant not for any length of time if you dont show up quick im going to make one mistake too many two days passed days in which lomax did his best to keep to himselfor at least keep away from the anointed one he complained that his medication made him groggy then spent hours each afternoon feigning sleep on his bed just in case his room was under surveillance he insisted that the anointed ones security was paramount and spent more hours each day walking the perimeter of the castle and even the sunbaked grounds checking every means of ingress trying to imagine how he might gain access to the fortress if he was an assassin he spent an hour a day cleaning and polishing his weapons and another half hour taking target practice and still he found himself in the anointed ones presence too often for his liking he took lunches and dinners with him and his presence was requested for the evening entertainments strangely the anointed one made no attempt to convert him to the one true faith probably because he made it clear early on that he had no interest in any religion and this onea combination of the harsher features of christianity judaism and islam made less sense to him than most he arose on the morning of the third day allowed himself the luxury of a shower with actual water shaved dressed and ordered his door to open he no longer needed assistance finding his way around the fortress though it was nonetheless frequently given but on this particular morning there were no guards to be seen and he walked to the enormous kitchen where he usually had a glass of juice and a cup of coffee before the anointed one could find him and invite him to breakfast this morning though there was no one working in the kitchen and the coffee had not yet been made shrugging he walked to the enormous refrigerator pulled out a container of fruit juice held it to his lips and took a long swallow before replacing it as he was leaving the kitchen he looked out the window which overlooked the same garden as his bedroom but from a different angle and something caught his eye not a movement for nothing was moving in the morning sun but a patch of color that didnt seem to belong he stared at it for a moment then blinked his eyes and stared again and suddenly the whole picture seemed to take shape and he realized that he was staring at the leg of a dead man who had recently been the anointed ones personal chef he drew his laser pistol and walked carefully to the kitchen door it opened out to the dining room where the anointed one took his meals but the room was totally deserted and lomax quickly walked through it into the highceilinged corridor beyond here he came to two more bodies both dead both displaying the effects of sonic distortion he couldnt remember if the silicon kid used a sonic pistolin fact he couldnt recall the kid carrying a weapon at all but there was no doubt in his mind that this was the kids doing the iceman had predicted it and he had come to the conclusion that the cagey old man was damned near as good at predicting the future as was penelope bailey he stepped over the two bodies then looked out into a nearby courtyard there were no bodies there but there also werent any guards and two men were usually positioned there even in the heat of the day the kid was good he had to give him that hed killed at least three men possibly more and done it swiftly and silently without alerting anyone to his presence but he couldnt keep it up there were close to a thousand armed men in and around the fortress and any moment now he would have to hear the explosions of projectile weapons the crackling of lasers the eerie humming of sonic guns but he heard nothing as he proceeded along the corridor he came to a turn very near the front entrance to the fortress and looked out a circular window there were some thirty men in the courtyard some standing at attention a few in conversation with each other four of them picking up tiny pieces of litter he considered alerting them to the kids presence but thought better of it if he was to win the anointed ones total confidence he would have to go up against the kid alone as the iceman had said calling in the army might save the day but it wouldnt win the war gun still in hand walking in a semicrouch his left arm still hanging limply by his side lomax increased his pace to the throne room for it was there that the anointed one conducted his morning business he turned two more corners then found himself facing the massive double doors four men lay dead in front of them he walked past them silently then gave one of the doors a slight push it didnt give open he murmured the door swung open just enough for him to pass through then closed behind him the kid his back to the door was facing the anointed one and three of his closest advisors a sonic pistol in each hand the three advisors had their hands above their heads and the anointed ones feline carnivore lay dead on the floor but moses mohammed christ sat passively upon his throne staring at the kid as if he somehow held the advantage that wasnt so difficult at all the kid was saying she told me getting to you would be easy i should have believed her did she tell you how you were going to get back out asked lomax the kid whirled to face him she warned me about you too gravedancer he said youre the one to watch out for he grinned i cant imagine why probably because im going to kill you said lomax in level tones im the only one whos doing any killing today said the kid because we were friends once ill give you five seconds to get out of here im not going anywhere said lomax now drop your guns and you just might live long enough to leave the room in one piece the kid laughed youve got a gun aimed at me ive got a pair aimed at you its a standoff no its not said lomax im prepared to die for the anointed one youve got your whole life ahead of you kid are you ready to throw it away for a woman who hasnt got the guts to do her own dirty work just in case i come out of this alive youd damned well better have been listening to every word i could just as easily have backshot him but the iceman says ive got to be a hero for you neither of us has to die said the kid and suddenly lomax saw what he was looking for the first tiny flickering of uncertainty oh you can throw in with me why should i want to so you can be on the winning side said the kid what does she pay the sky s the limit said the kid enthusiastically you wouldnt believe it he relaxed slightly what do you say gravedancer this is what i say answered lomax firing his laser weapon and hurling himself to the ground rolling rapidly to his left the kid uttered a strangled gurgle and swept lomaxs vicinity with his sonic pistols but they were aimed too high and before he could lower them he had collapsed to the floor this cant be happening rasped the kid coughing up mouthfuls of blood i cant lose lomax walked over to him and kicked his weapons across the floor i told you you should have stayed on greycloud kid he said the kid tried to answer but couldnt you could have been a farmer or a chip manufacturer or half a hundred other things lomax paused and stared down at him now youre just one more fool who came out to the frontier and wound up in an unmarked grave the kid glared at him for just an instant then a look of terror crossed his face he tried to say something else coughed again and died are you all right my lord asked lomax turning to the anointed one i am thanks to you answered the anointed one im glad i arrived in time you knew this man yes my lord replied lomax he called himself the silicon kid his real name was neil cayman he paused a little distortion of the truth probably wont hurt i took him in fed him gave him money he used it to implant some biochips in his body chips that made him a killer with phenomenal reflexes he looked at the anointed one then he deserted me and went to work for the prophet he offered you your life said the anointed one yes he did knowing that these chips made him a formidable opponent and still recovering from your wounds as you are why did you not accept his offer lomaxs first instinct was to look him in the eye and say because you are my leader my lord and i am loyal only to you he caught himself just in time once you finish laughing at that you just might decide to lop off my head he paused for a moment and then spoke it was a value judgment my lord a value judgment lomax nodded if i agreed to join him it would be an admission to both him and to myself that i couldnt defeat him and no matter how high i rose in the prophets organization i would always take my orders from him he paused and smiled a properly selfsatisfied smile at the anointed one but by taking him on and killing him ive proved both my worth and my loyalty to you i ask for no specific reward for my actions i shall trust to your wisdom and generosity the anointed one nodded you are a simple man mr lomax but an honest one and a brave one he smiled you shall have your reward thank you my lord the anointed one sighed deeply i wish i could read the prophet as easily as i can read you perhaps when you meet her youll discover that you can answered lomax perhaps said the anointed one he turned to his three advisors who had remained where they stood silent and motionless summon my military leaders the three men practically ran from the room and returned a few minutes later with six uniformed soldiers my lord began the largest of them i had no idea i silence commanded the anointed one the man snapped to attention while you and your subordinates were doing god only knows what this man he indicated lomax stood side by side with me and helped me dispatch the notorious assassin known as the silicon kid the very same assassin who entered this fortress as if there were no guards at all well thanks for admitting that i helped you thought lomax wryly this man he repeated again pointing to lomax and this man alone was prepared to defend me with his life that is not so my lord we all shut up snapped the anointed one in all matters of security this man this gravedancer now speaks for me and must be obeyed as i would be obeyed is that clear the six men stared sullenly at lomax and muttered their acquiescence wonderful six more men waiting to stick knives in my back just what i needed i want you to conduct an immediate investigation and find out how this assassin was able to penetrate our defenses how he came to sneak into the fortress past hundreds of armed men who were supposed to be protecting me from just such an occurrence the anointed one smiled a humorless smile when the report is in my hands and i expect it no later than this evening we shall mete out justice to those deserving of it the mens expression betrayed a certain uneasiness at his notion of justice your arm is bleeding again mr lomax said the anointed one turning to lomax tend to it and then join me in the dining room we have many things to discuss we do my lord the anointed one nodded she couldnt protect him perhaps she is not superhuman after all his eyes blazed with passion you may soon have your wish mr lomax my wish you wish to kill her do you not yes my lord said lomax wondering just what he was getting himself into i think as soon as your arm is healed i shall give you the opportunity thank you my lord said lomax bowing and backing out of the room and just how do i get out of this one iceman lomax returned to his room and noticed that his left arm was indeed bleeding he went into the bathroom to change the dressing then reached for his container of pain pills and stopped he closed the door behind him and performed a thorough inchbyinch survey of the bathroom finally satisfied that there were no security cameras embedded in the walls or ceiling he took a pill and placed the container in his holster just beneath his laser pistol then he emerged from the bathroom walked to the door of the bedroom and ordered it to open there were four guards this time more he assumed for his security than because the anointed one distrusted his motives ive got to go to my ship he announced is something wrong sir asked one of the guards i left the rest of my pills there answered lomax antiinflammatories and painkillers i can send someone to get them for you sir offered the guard lomax shook his head my ships got a very complex security system your man would blow it up the second he tried to open the hatch he paused can you get me a ride there i doubt that i could find it myself which should assuage most of your doubts certainly sir answered the guard let me just report to the anointed one and tell him why youll be late for your meeting of course said lomax the guard walked a few feet away raised the anointed one on his communicator whispered something listened for a moment and returned to lomax it s all arranged sir he announced there will be a groundcar waiting for you at the main entrance the anointed one requests that you join him for lunch when you return thank you said lomax heading off down the corridor a moment later he was racing across the hardened surface of the sunbaked desert wondering what kind of native race had lived in such a place the spaceport came into view the instant they rounded the huge dune that protected the fortress but the light and the perspective played tricks with his estimate of the distance involved and it took the groundcar five minutes longer than he anticipated to reach his ship ill wait right here for you sir said his driver that wont be necessary replied lomax i may be a few minutes just to get some pills sir i want to recharge my laser pistol we have chargers at the fortress sir i trust my own answered lomax the driver shrugged whatever you say sir it could take half an hour or so and i dont want either you or the vehicle overheating said lomax why dont you go over to the observation tower and have a cold drink keep an eye on the ship when you see me come out of the hatch drive by and pick me up whatever you say sir replied the driver already uncomfortable as the hot air poured in through lomaxs open door he sped over to the tower as lomax opened the hatch of his ship stepped through and locked it behind him the interior of the ship was excruciatingly hot he immediately activated the climatecontrol system and in a short time the temperature dropped down to a comfortable level he began charging his pistols power pack it wouldnt do to be caught charging it at the fortress that evening then seated himself at the pilots chair activated the radio masked his signal as best he could and put through a subspace transmission on the icemans private scrambled code a moment later a voice crackling with static could be heard this is the iceman lomax here whats happening the kid is dead the anointed one loves me and im going to cut your arm open the next time i see you the iceman chuckled i had to make it believable i hope i didnt do any permanent damage ill live answered lomax at least it wont be the arm that kills me he amended but the anointed one might if i give him too many wrong answers are you in trouble there asked the iceman not yet but it could blow at any minute im operating in the dark here i dont know what you want and i know just enough about the prophet so that he thinks i know more i see said the iceman there was a brief pause in the transmission all right i suppose its time to move move where asked lomax figure of speech answered the iceman i have to move youre staying right where you are what do you want me to do somehow youve got to convince the anointed one to attack a planet called mozart and to attack in force mozart repeated lomax frowning never heard of it its the third planet in the symphony system alpha montana iii on your charts whats so special about mozart thats where penelope bailey is really or is that just what we want him to think shes really there said the iceman and you want him to attack in full force thats right does that include nukes and chemicals everything hes got said the iceman even antimatter if he has any i doubt it replied lomax even so there wont be much left of mozart after he hits it dont kid yourself said the iceman he wont be able to harm a hair of her head lomax frowned again then whats this all about i need to get onto the planet you plan to use an army of two hundred million men as a distraction exclaimed lomax in disbelief in a manner of speaking theyve got to keep her so busy that i can land just a minute iceman said lomax if shes what you say she is shell know youre going to land i mean she can see past the battle cant she of course she can but shell be so preoccupied with the immediate threat that shell have to put me on hold so to speak and deal with me later and what happens when she does deal with you thats my concern said the iceman you just see to it that the anointed one attacks you killed the kid and he thinks you killed me give him a good reason to attack and he ought to trust you enough to do what you tell him hes not the most trusting soul youd ever want to meet said lomax dubiously then think of some reason why he has to trust you and make it stick said the iceman ill do my best your bests been good enough so far said the iceman he paused again oh i need to know one other thing what is it do his ships have any special military insignia i dont want them blowing me to bits before i reach the planet not to my knowledge replied lomax he considered the question no im sure they dont when the democracy thinks youre planning to attack it you dont advertise your presence by plastering an insignia all over your ships youd better be right said the iceman if i find out otherwise ill try to get word to you lomax promised him does your ships radio respond to the same scramble code yes good enough ill signal you if im wrong about the insignia how soon do you think you can get him to attack said the iceman youre a lot closer to mozart than i am i want to make sure that i dont get there too late hes got his forces spread out all over the democracy and the inner frontier said lomax if he gave the word right now it would probably take them a couple of months to assemble and get into some kind of coherent formation and he wont think hes got that kind of time he paused thoughtfully then continued my guess is hell pull in whatever he can get from nearby systems five thousand ships or so maybe three to five million men and attack within a week then id better take off in a couple of days and just stay a few systems away until my sensors pick up your fleet dont be in such a hurry said lomax i still have to convince him to attack its not as easy as you might think he paused im not as quick as you iceman every time i start stretching the truth he starts getting suspicious then dont tell him a thing said the iceman promptly what are you talking about let him discover the truth on his own answered the iceman the truth we want him to believe that is lomax stared at the blank viewscreen above the computer panel lost in thought hello said the iceman hello are you still there yeah im here said lomax you didnt transmit for almost two minutes said the iceman i thought id lost you i came up with an idea said lomax oh i think i can make the anointed one buy it but im going to need your help ill help in any way i can answered the iceman but dont forgetthe anointed one thinks im dead i know said lomax are you recording this transmission yes all right he rattled off a ninedigit code did you get that yeah what is it its a code that will reach a man named milo korbekkian on olympus okay what do i do with it asked the iceman create a phony name and send him a message that cant be traced back to last chance or to your ship no problem said the iceman what kind of message tell him said lomax barely able to suppress a smile that the prophets military machine wont be ready for war for another month or two that shes relatively defenseless on mozart and that korbekkians assignment is to commission some assassinations including mine that will take the anointed ones attention away from her vulnerability you think thatll do it asked the iceman i think so replied lomax he sees conspiracies everywhere so why not give him one korbekkians just a contact man theres no reason to assume he wont play both ends against the middle supplying killers to both sides for a fee lomax paused yeah the more i think about it the more i think its just the kind of double cross the anointed one will buy and he if buys that hell buy the prophets being defenseless it shouldnt take much to convince him to hit her before she builds up her forces how much does he know about her not much enough to know that she hasnt got any forces or that she doesnt need any it would be inconceivable to him answered lomax hell i know all about her and i have a hard time believing it all right said the iceman youve had a busy day already and we dont want to hit the anointed one with too many things all at once ill send the message exactly two standard days from now right one word of advice gravedancer said the iceman what is it somebody always lives to tell the story if you want it to be you see to it that youre not in the attack fleet the iceman broke the connection the anointed one was waiting for him when he returned from the spaceport he entered the dining room found a fruit plate already laid out for him and promptly sat down he took a long swallow from his water glass then went to work on some citrus slices killing people seems to increase your appetite remarked the anointed one dryly lomax smiled and shook his head no my lord but being out in that heat makes me want to replenish some fluids did you remember your salt tablets no said lomax surprised i totally forgot about them as long as you remain on new gobi you must always keep them with you said the anointed one you have become one of my most valued men i should hate to lose you to a case of heat prostration id hate it every bit as much my lord replied lomax ill make sure im not without the tablets again did you find your medication aboard your ship continued the anointed one lomax nodded and i recharged my power pack i wouldnt have thought your weapon expended that much energy in this mornings altercation it didnt my lord answered lomax but when you depend on your weapons for a living you care for them the way a mother cares for her baby he forced a smile to his lips i can survive forgetting my salt tablets but if my weapons ever fail me im not likely to get a second chance very sensible said the anointed one i approve lomax didnt know what to say next so he fell silent and concentrated on his food tell me mr lomax said the anointed one breaking the silence after a moment how do you think the silicon kid gained entrance to the fortress he had to have a confederate on the inside lied lomax promptly that is my conclusion too have you any suggestions concerning who it might have been lomax shook his head i havent been here long enough my lord he paused but theres no question in my mind that an organization this size is riddled with traitors and double agents a few perhaps admitted the anointed one but riddled i think not mr lomax i hate to disagree my lord said lomax but whenever one man holds as much power and wealth as you do its an open invitation to shall we say disloyalty i am the anointed one my people follow me as a matter of faith and belief temporal rewards are secondary to them theyre no more secondary to your followers than they are to me my lord said lomax the only difference is that i make no bones about it he stared across the table at the ascetic whiterobed man take your man on olympus for example milo korbekkian has served me loyally for seven years responded the anointed one milo korbekkian has served you for seven years responded lomax you are impugning his loyalty demanded the anointed one lets say im trying to define it answered lomax im sure hes loyal to milo korbekkian and to mrs korbekkian if there is one and to the capitalistic principle but i know for a fact that korbekkian has taken commissions from people other than yourself and has arranged various killings that you know nothing about he shrugged that doesnt make him disloyal my lord in all likelihood his other dealings have no effect on you or your plans how do you know that he has accepted other commissions demanded the anointed one its my business to know said lomax im the kind of man he hires i dont believe you mr lomax thats your prerogative my lord said lomax with an air of unconcern the anointed one stared at him long and hard across the table prove it he said at last how asked lomax it would just be my word against his he paused i suppose you could monitor his incoming and outgoing messages if you wanted to go to the trouble i do not said the anointed one the subject is closed but lomax saw the shadow of doubt cross his face and he knew the subject was far from closed satisfied he devoured the rest of his fruit plate and spent the remainder of the meal offering wild speculations as to which guards had been paid to turn a blind eye to the kids presence that morning then word of still another body turned up some hapless attendant that the kid had killed and hidden earlier in the day and the anointed one suddenly in a rage went off to see the corpse and question his guards while lomax returned to his room and spent most of the afternoon feigning sleep for the benefit of any unseen observers things proceeded uneventfully for the next two days lomax remained in his quarters as much as possible spoke as little as possible during meals concerned himself with examining the fortresss security secretly tested his ever stronger left arm and publicly favored it and even began developing a taste for blacksheep then in late afternoon two days after he had spoken to the iceman lomax was summoned once again to the throne room where moses mohammed christ sat alone on his chair a look of triumph on his long lean face you were right mr lomax said the anointed one as you have been right all along my lord said lomax trying his best to look confused milo korbekkian said the anointed one what about him he was also in the employ of the prophet as you yourself suggested i knew he was working for someone else besides you my lord replied lomax i never said it was the prophet he paused i assume youll want me to eliminate him that has already been taken care of said the anointed one thats too bad said lomax i might have been able to pry some information about the prophet out of him i am in possession of all the information i need oh the anointed one leaned forward excitedly on his throne his coalblack eyes shining with triumph she is hiding on a planet named mozart in the alpha montana system and she is practically defenseless youre sure of this asked lomax there is no doubt whatsoever exclaimed the anointed one the silicon kid was sent here to divert my attention from her until she can build up her defenses and from such information as i now possess it is absolutely certain that korbekkian also hired many others to wreak terror and confusion among us to get us to look inward for traitors and conspirators rather than turning our eyes toward mozart if your information is correct said lomax carefully and if she is truly defenseless then our next logical move is attack cried the anointed one finishing his sentence for him i have summoned my forces here and given orders to my commanders we attack mozart in three days time can you mobilize that quickly my lord asked lomax amazed once again at the accuracy of the icemans assessment not all of my followers are warriors and not all who are warriors are available to me answered the anointed one but we will attack in force with almost four million men and women in close to eight thousand vessels that have been equipped for war may i make a suggestion my lord certainly i dont think any of us know the full extent of the prophets powers if indeed she has any powers at all said lomax but if we are to expose this many of our people to potential danger then i think we should hit mozart with everything we have we should settle for nothing less than blowing it out of existence my own thinking precisely said the anointed one nodding his head in agreement we will spare no expense withhold no weapon and show no mercy good said lomax firmly i think youve made a wise decision my lord he smiled today the prophet tomorrow the democracy so it shall be intoned the anointed one and you mr lomax will be beside me to share in the spoils i wouldnt think thered be anything left of mozart to share in replied lomax there will be the glory of victory over my enemy a victory in which you will have played a fundamental part im just doing what you pay me to do my lord said lomax nothing more dont be modest mr lomax said the anointed one without you the silicon kid might well have killed me and had you not expressed your doubts about korbekkian i might never have learned of the prophet s whereabouts before she was ready to meet me in battle you are truly one of the architects of our forthcoming victory im flattered that you should think so my lord answered lomax in fact continued the anointed one magnanimously it would be unfair to you not to allow you to participate in this holy war i have decided to give you your own ship to command my own ship repeated lomax startled the anointed one smiled i had my doubts about you initially i confess it but by your actions you have overcome every one of them this is my way of rewarding you youre quite sure my lord asked lomax i mean ive killed many men but ive never commanded a ship or led men into battle you will do both for the first of many times said the anointed one but i will have no more of your false modesty mr lomax said the anointed one still smiling it really does not become you he got to his feet our interview is over lomax returned unhappily to his room wondering exactly what the anointed ones smile actually meant part the prophets book penelope bailey stood beside a wooden bench next to the pond behind her house her eyes trained blindly on the sky seeing what no one else on mozart could see what no more than a handful of sophisticated instruments on the planet could detect you are a fool moses mohammed christ she murmured have you learned nothing from our prior encounters do you think my power is limited to destroying your churches she paused there is still time to turn back but you will not retreat will you what lunacy has possessed you what demons have goaded you into attacking me when the only possible result is your destruction she sighed deeply then went inside to make herself a cup of tea the fleet was not yet in the formation she desired and she knew that she had an hour or more to prepare herself she sat down at a small table in the kitchen added some lemon to the tea stirred it absently and continued looking out the window there were still factors to be sorted out alternatives to be found actions to be considered six of the anointed ones ships had developed engine trouble should she destroy them or let them live to tell the story of his defeat to spread tales of her power throughout the galaxy there was another ship too one that she foresaw would not join the formation that seemed somehow special though she could not yet determine why then she turned her attention to the democracy the plan took constant modification incessant monitoring this man must die that woman must not this worlds economy must collapse that lone miner must discover his planets only diamond pipe she twitched she posed she postured she did all that was necessary to bring about the desired events and then she began reading the permutations of those events for each of them altered a million possible futures and she was presented with a new set of choices a new spate of alternatives all of which must be read and analyzed and extrapolated she concentrated on the plan for perhaps forty minutes then satisfied that it was on track for another day she made another cup of tea and walked out to the pond once more again she looked blindly up to the skies soon moses mohammed christ she murmured soon she finished her tea and set the cup and saucer down on the wooden bench i would have given you another six years she said softly staring at the sky eventually i would have defeated you in the spica sector but you would have enjoyed six more years of power and authority now i will have to rebuild your organization will have to assert myself sooner i will adjust and i will triumph but i cannot fathom why you have chosen to throw your life away when we met at spica i would have given you no alternative but to fight or run and because you could not lose face before your followers you would have fought she paused frowning but there is no reason for this confrontation today no reason for you to die on the inner frontier i must learn what brought you to this unhappy end for it became likely only a week ago and certain only this morning and because she did not have the gift of reading the past she turned her attention once more to the future to the infinite number of futures confronting her searching through them for a key to unlock the recent past to determine the reason for her enemys suicidal decision and within a very few minutes she found it of course she said with no feeling of surprise it had to be you she closed her eyes to better see the future you learn well carlos mendoza she said a halfsmile on her lips you will not approach until the attack has begun and at that time i shall be too busy neutralizing the doomsday weapons to bother with you their threat is immediate while yours though greater is further removed in time and i will have to let you land she concentrated harder sifting through the futures you chose your position with foresight and intelligence she continued no meteor no asteroid no debris can reach you before you join the battle and yet she said perhaps i can show you that i have more weapons in my arsenal than even you anticipate suddenly she smiled a pacemaker blood thinners you are prepared are you not very well you shall not die of a heart attack or a stroke before you can face me she paused some things even i cannot change evidently it has been ordained in the book of fate that i must confront you one last time and now her face contorted with rage i have never sought to make you my enemy twice i could have killed you and twice i allowed you to live i could have destroyed last chance in the twinkling of an eye and yet i did not and still you seek me out you remain dedicated to my destruction it is because of you that i have become a fugitive among my own people that i have spent the past twenty years in hiding or in confinement you are the architect of my unhappiness and today when i have done what i must do to the fleet that approaches i shall face you one last time she paused trying to control her emotions i will show you no more mercy than you would show me she whispered i have things to do in the galaxy great things things that are beyond your feeble comprehension you will never hinder them again she looked up at the sky once more not to where the fleet was gathered but to where a lone ship still lightyears away was speeding toward mozart you shall learn what it means to oppose me now that my powers are mature she promised you shall learn why men fear the darkness and why death itself can be a mercy prepare yourself carlos mendoza for this is your last day of life lomax summoned his second in command to the bridge of the ship sir said the man we have a serious problem here he announced problem sir lomax nodded one of the goddamned bombs has armed itself he stood aside so that the man could study his control panel and especially the blinking red light on the left side of it could it be a malfunction on the board sir i already thought of that answered lomax the board is working perfectly let me check the bomb itself sir said the man perhaps its emitting a false signal do so said lomax and be discreet no sense upsetting the rest of the crew until we know what were dealing with the man nodded and headed off toward the weapons bay he returned some four minutes later its armed sir he reported how much time do you think we have before it blows i dont know sir maybe ten minutes maybe ten hours weve never carried this type of weapon before its new to me too complained lomax hell the whole ship is new to me im just a gunman that the anointed one took a liking to you saved his life sir protested the man with the passion of a fanatic we are prepared to carry out any orders that you give the problem is that i dont know what orders are required in this situation said lomax grimly i suppose we should jettison the bomb but according to my computer its in a position where wed have to jettison the entire payload he paused i hate to do that were attacking with a smaller force than i would have recommended had time not been a vital consideration the prophet is the most formidable antagonist in the galaxy we may need every weapon we possess there is an alternative sir i was wondering when it would occur to you what is that asked lomax aloud we can load the crew onto our landing craft and leave them to make their way to the planet behind the bulk of the fleet while you and i stay aboard and try to deactivate the bomb excellent suggestion replied lomax pass the word i want them all off the ship within fifteen minutes he paused yourself included i request permission to remain on board sir permission denied i insist sir one of us is going to have to go down into the weapons bay and try to deactivate the bomb and one of us is going to have to navigate the ship ill put it on automatic that might work in deep space sir but were in a war zone you may come under attack i doubt it said lomax you yourself have stated that she is the most formidable foe we will ever face sir lomax realized that further argument could arouse the mans suspicions furthermore it was essential that he get the crew off the ship as quickly as possible before someone discovered what was really happening all right he said you can stay now see to the evacuation and report to me when its complete ill continue trying to deactivate the bomb from here the man saluted and left and lomax lit a small cigar and pretended to work the control panel until the bridge was totally deserted he watched the viewscreen as the shuttlecraft left the mother ship one by one until the last of the crew had gone and only lomax and his second in command remained the man approached him and saluted the evacuation is completed sir good said lomax now ill go down and see if i can deactivate the bomb sir be careful said lomax yes sir the man departed and lomax lit another cigar and hoped the prophet could see far enough into the future to know that his ship was no threat to her the man returned some ten minutes later a puzzled frown on his face sir he said yes as nearly as i can tell the bomb is not malfunctioning you mean its not armed its armed all right but it seems to have been armed purposely from here you dont say yes sir from your panel lomax pulled his pistol out you should have abandoned ship with the others i dont understand sir youre a good man said lomax and i am truly sorry for what i must do he fired his gun the man uttered a single surprised grunt and fell to the deck dead then having done everything within his power to convince the prophet that his ship wanted no part of the doomed battle lomax sat back to await the outcome in the first thirty seconds of the would be battle the life support systems of seventyfour of the anointed ones ships lost all power eighteen more were destroyed when their ordnance unlike lomaxs actually did activate and explode a meteor wiped out twentyseven more ships a comet crazily careening off its eternal course accounted for another nineteen one ship s weapons computer malfunctioned and destroyed thirtyseven of its allies before it in turn was demolished what is happening here demanded the anointed one his face contorted with rage and terror no one has fired upon us and yet we are being decimated he glowered at the planet mozart spinning blue and green and serene in his viewscreen she is just one woman what is happening and a million miles beneath him penelope bailey staring blindly at the sky smiled and whispered not yet my foolish one not yet first you must see the folly of attacking me when all of your men have been killed when all your ships float dead in the void then i shall tend to you after receiving permission to land from a bored spaceport employee who had no idea that a war had erupted a million miles above his head the icemans ship broke out of orbit and plunged down toward mozarts surface he wasnt worried about being fired upon because he knew that whatever defenses penelope possessed they werent military in nature as for the local authorities they caused him no concern whatsoever he was willing to bet that no one else even knew that the anointed one s fleet was out there or that it was being torn to pieces when he got to within five miles of the surface he pressed a button and released a trio of parachutes designed to save him just in case penelope was able to stop concentrating on the heavily armed ships in orbit and devote a few seconds to him but the landing was accomplished without mishap and the iceman climbed into the hold of his ship to prepare the cargo he had brought along it took him almost twenty minutes to assemble the components then he attached them to the loose vest he had brought slipped the vest on covered it with a bulky coat and finally emerged from his ship a spaceport official was waiting for him welcome to mozart he said thank you said the iceman you certainly took your time getting out of your ship continued the official is everything all right do you need any mechanical assistance no answered the iceman i was just rearranging some cargo will you require either fuel or a hangar neither said the iceman my business here should be done before nightfall if it isnt there will be a twohundredcredit fee for leaving your ship where it is the iceman reached into a pocket and pulled out a wad of bills then peeled off a pair of hundredcredit notes here he said handing them to the official you can return them to me when i leave this evening ill make out a receipt while youre clearing customs said the man putting the bills between the pages of a small notebook where is customs at the base of the tower replied the man leading the iceman into the lobby of the observation tower and over to the customs desk where a handsome uniformed woman looked up at him name please the iceman pulled out his titanium passport card and laid it on her desk carlos mendoza she ran the card through a computer waited a few seconds for it to scan his retina and verify his identity and returned it to him may i ask the purpose of your visit mr mendoza im here to conclude some very old business he replied and the name of the party you have come to see penelope bailey she looked up from her computer and stared at him for a moment does miss bailey know you are coming to see her id be very surprised if she didnt answered the iceman all right mr mendoza you are cleared to stay on mozart for fourteen days should you decide to extend your visit beyond that limit please inform this office thank you the democracy credit is the official currency of mozart but we also accept new stalin rubles maria theresa dollars new zimbabwe dollars and far london pounds if you possess any other form of currency please declare it on this form she handed him an officiallooking document and record all your currency conversion transactions the iceman took the form folded it neatly and placed it in a pocket of his overcoat welcome to mozart mr mendoza she said todays temperature is degrees celsius which translates into degrees rankine degrees reaumur and degrees fahrenheit she paused you may find your overcoat rather warm i wont be wearing it that long he replied how do i get to town from here there is free public transportation every two hours she checked her timepiece im afraid you just missed it if you dont wish to wait there are usually a few groundcars for hire in front of the spaceport thank you said the iceman he turned and walked through the small lobby at the base of the observation tower and out the main entrance a single groundcar was parked there and he quickly climbed into it where to asked the driver im looking for a private residence answered the iceman have you got a directory here the driver pressed a button activating a holoscreen that hovered in the air about two feet from the iceman just state the name of your party said the driver his address will appear at the top of the screen and the oneway and roundtrip fares will be computed and appear in the lower righthand corner penelope bailey instantly an address appeared this was followed by a map that traced seven or eight routes selected the quickest one left it on display and posted a rate of fortyeight credits one way or eightyeight credits for a round trip shes out in the sticks isnt she remarked the driver as an identical screen appeared above his dash panel i suppose so answered the iceman i havent been there before how long will it take the driver stared at the map maybe twenty minutes twentyfive if we run into some traffic traffic on this planet harvesters or combines on the road moving from one farm to another explained the driver they can slow you down plenty he paused well are we going yes the groundcar pulled away from the spaceport one way or round trip one way will do answered the iceman if i need a ride back ill call for one remember my tag number and ask for it said the driver i can use the business ill do that replied the iceman they drove in silence for almost twenty minutes passing through town and going out along the back roads and finally the iceman leaned forward how much longer he asked maybe another two miles stop when youre a mile away youre sure just trying to save you some engine trouble i dont have any engine trouble you never can tell said the iceman handing a hundredcredit note to the driver youre the boss said the driver with a shrug a moment later the groundcar slowed down and pulled over to the side of the road and the iceman got out if the maps right it should be just around the next curve said the driver you sure you dont want me to wait im sure all right he paused from what i hear around town this is a very strange lady youre going to visit i dont know what kind of business youve got with her but good luck thanks said the iceman ill probably need it the groundcar turned and headed back toward the spaceport and the iceman began walking along the edge of a mutatedcorn field toward penelope baileys house when he finally was able to see the top of the geodesic dome he removed his overcoat and left it lying in a ditch at roadside he stopped lit a cigar paused to enjoy the taste of the first puff and then reached down to his vest and activated two tiny switches then he continued walking and five minutes later he reached his destination he approached the front door and found that it was locked and since he was no longer in any condition to pound it or pull at it he gingerly walked around to the back where he saw a young blonde woman her back to him standing beside a small pond her eyes trained on the heavens striking a new position every few seconds welcome iceman she said without turning to face him i have been waiting for this moment for a long time i dont doubt it replied the iceman coming to a stop i have only forty more ships to destroy she announced and then i shall be able to give you my full attention she paused now twentythree now seventeen you are very clever to have gotten this far iceman i was fortunate you would have been more fortunate had you elected to remain on your own world she replied still motionless eleven now seven now four she paused again and now there is only the anointed one finally she turned to the iceman shall we let him live a little longer so that he may grasp the full extent of his defeat it makes no difference to me replied the iceman no of course it does not she said you care no more about moses mohammed christ than i do she paused and stared into the icemans eyes so it comes down to you and me as i always knew it would l the iceman stared at the young woman confronting him you were an appealing little girl penelope he said thinking back to the first time he had ever seen her small frightened vulnerable he paused i should have killed you then she smiled you would have failed probably he admitted you were more than capable of protecting yourself even then i still am she replied i have grown stronger over the years weve both grown penelope said the iceman meeting her gaze youve grown stronger and ive grown wiser wise enough to kill me she asked amused i think so he replied seriously she laughed i dont even need my powers to destroy you you havent grown wiser merely older you are a fat lame old man already you pant and sweat from the mere exertion of walking the last mile to my home your heart beats faster your blood races through your body you have trouble catching your breath i could kill you with my bare hands iceman look ahead and see what will happen if you do suggested the iceman you will die but not alone you refer to the vest you wear of course if you hit me or shoot me ill fall down and if i fall down every map of mozart is going to be obsolete half a second later im carrying enough explosives to make this the center of a twentymile crater she stared at him so five million men died this morning merely to let you approach me with your plans and your explosives and you call me a monster i dont call you anything penelope he said im your executioner not your judge and did you really think it would be this easy she asked did you think there wasnt a single future in which your switches failed to activate your explosives the iceman felt a sudden tension at the pit of his stomach youre bluffing he said with more confidence than he felt she shook her head serenely i never had any need to bluff i could have disabled your explosives whenever i wanted to but you didnt he said frowning no iceman i didnt she stared at him for a long moment you are prepared to die today are you not i am so am i she replied our deaths like our lives are intertwined she paused but first i would like to talk to you he looked surprised what do you want to talk about oh about many things she replied it is strange i am bound to you by hatred but i am also closer to you than to anyone now alive and you alone have never lied to me she paused the threat of invasion is over we have all the time in the world to talk she smiled ironically the rest of our lives and i have some questions for you what kind of questions he said suspiciously simple ones all right he said start asking why do all living things shun me she asked not only people but even animals she paused even puppies the iceman was taken aback for a moment it was not the type of question he had anticipated finally he spoke because youre different he said because you are no longer human men do not shun the crippled or the senile the retarded or the deformed said penelope they take them into the bosom of their families and shower them with love and compassion why of all the sons and daughters of your race have i alone been cast out because none of the unfortunates to whom you liken yourself have the power to destroy entire worlds at their whim you not only have that power but you have exercised it only to protect myself she paused do you know that no human being has touched me since the day the mouse died some twenty years ago not a single one no said the iceman i didnt know that kittens hiss and puppies hide she continued birds fly away even the reptiles in my garden slither off into the shadows when i appear i have no better answer he replied uncomfortably the sound of a tractor working in a nearby field came to his ears have you any more questions you have hated me from the first day we met she said why what had i ever done to you i dont hate you penelope he replied you dont hate an ion storm that threatens your ship or a meteor swarm that bombards your planet if youre alone in a jungle you dont hate the carnivores that stalk you in the night none of them are good or evil theyre just hazards of nature that have to be overcome in order to survive he paused i feel no hatred toward you at all i bear you no malice i blame you for only one thing the death of the mouse she betrayed my trust you were a child he replied you had no grasp of subtleties you couldnt fully comprehend what was happening he paused again she loved you as if you were her own daughter the only reason shes dead is because she never truly understood what you were she thought she was saving you as if you could be shot down like any ordinary human penelope paused i have not thought of the mouse in a long time she said at last i think of her every day said the iceman her death caused you that much pain it did then i have repaid you for some of the pain you have caused me he stared at her and made no reply did she really love me asked penelope after a brief silence yes she did will anyone ever love me again i wonder she mused thoughtfully the iceman shook his head no they wont i know she replied do you know what it is like to face a future in which not a single person will ever love you a future in which every member of your race shuns you as if you were some beast to be avoided no answered the iceman and i dont envy anyone who does i never asked for this gift iceman she said all i ever wanted was to be a normal little girl to play with other girls to live with my family she paused for a moment lost in her memories my own mother was terrified of me they took me away when i was six and they killed my father when he tried to prevent it do you know how many times i played with children my own age after that iceman no he said one afternoon when the mouse and i were hiding from you she said bitterly one afternoon in my entire life suddenly she sighed and within twenty minutes they had all run away from me she looked at him they will always run away from me wont they little girls he asked confused everyone yes i suppose they will she looked up at him and for just a moment the emotionless alien mask disappeared i thought i was escaping from westerly and calliope and killhaven and hades she said but there is never really any escape is there mozart is just a bigger cell than the one i had on hades and the galaxy is just a bigger cell than mozart you cant escape who you are he replied she paused do you know something interesting iceman what of all the men i have known since i left hades as a grown woman only you have looked at me without repugnance with fear yes as well you should and with trepidation but without disgust i dont feel any disgust toward you replied the iceman other things yes but not disgust every other man and woman has felt it i even saw it on the black deaths face and in the eyes of your young spy she sighed i have seen it every day of my life even in the eyes of my own mother im sorry said the iceman sincerely you think me a monster she continued but you are on the outside looking in believe me iceman it is infinitely worse to be penelope bailey than to fear her i inspire fear and hatred by virtue of my very existence i am as much a prisoner as i ever was trapped within this body as this body was trapped within a tiny cell on hades she paused my only consolation has been the plan the plan he repeated i have been working on it for years she replied it began to form in my mind while i was in my cell on hades and i have been implementing it ever since i gained my freedom what does it involve asked the iceman control of the democracy its overthrow even now on this last day of our lives in the middle of this conversation you do not begin to understand me said penelope i have no desire to rule anyone i have no army i control no politicians i have not garnered untold wealth then what is this plan he persisted she stared at him with a level gaze simply this she answered that no child shall ever bear the curse of precognition again there are some three hundred men and women with the genetic potential to produce another soothsayer another oracle another me i have manipulated events built and destroyed planetary economies changed entire political systems to make sure that none of those three hundred people ever meet she paused that is my gift to your galaxy iceman more important that is my gift to the unborn no child shall ever be cut off from his people as i was he returned her stare you are ready to die arent you soon she replied i have a few things yet to do she closed her eyes for a moment then opened them i have allowed moses mohammed christ to live and fight another day with his defeat this morning he can no longer affect the outcome of the plan she shrugged let your vaunted democracy find out if it is fit to rule or so corrupt that its time has passed you dont know the answer i no longer care about the answer she said suddenly she walked past him circled the pond and entered her house she emerged a moment later with something small and furry cradled under one arm i seem to remember that doll said the iceman she shook her head this is a new one the one you remember fell apart while i was in prison on hades and of course i did not request another because grown women do not lavish their attentions on dolls she sighed somewhere along the way i found out what others have always known that i am not a woman she stared at him again it is time i think he carefully pulled his weapon out of its holster and aimed it at her say a prayer to your god said penelope calmly the surge of energy when you pull the trigger will activate your explosives just a minute said the iceman there is a better way i thought you were prepared to die she said i hope you were not lying for neither of us will survive this day he carefully pulled one tiny explosive off his vest and attached it to his weapons power pack let me take the vest off and deactivate it he said why should i this bomb is more than enough to kill both of us if the vest goes off well wipe out ten thousand people what are they to me asked penelope let me do it for what they might have been to you under other circumstances she considered his entreaty for a long moment then nodded he deactivated the switches removed the vest and walked to the house with it laying it carefully on a couch then he returned to the pond where penelope was waiting for him aim straight and true carlos mendoza she said that s what i came here to do he replied raising the weapon and training it on her heart suddenly he froze i have a question he said youre probably the only person that ever lived who might be able to answer it what is it can you see another life beyond this one god i hope not she said with a shudder of revulsion the iceman pulled the trigger lomax waited until the anointed ones flagship retreated to new gobi leaving its disabled companions behind before he jettisoned the body of the dead crewman then because he was a cautious man who had every intention of surviving he waited a few hours more finally when he was all through waiting he requested permission to land and touched down at the tiny spaceport about two hundred yards from the icemans ship he spent a few minutes clearing customs then made arrangements to refuel the ship and house it in a hangar there were a pair of groundcars waiting outside the observation tower and he got into the nearer of them where to asked the driver he summoned up penelope baileys address from the computers directory i took someone out there yesterday remarked the driver as they began racing past the endless pastures and fields that lined the road old fellow with a bad leg asked lomax thats the one do you know if he came back if he did he didnt rent a vehicle to do it replied the driver lomax checked his laser weapon and made sure that the charge was full did he say anything to you he asked just that he had some personal business to take care of said the driver funny thing though he had me let him off about a mile short of where he was going guess he felt like taking a walk probably said lomax noncommittally they drove the rest of the way in silence until at last the geodesic dome came into view well there it is said the driver are you the walking type too no i like my comfort the groundcar pulled up to the house a moment later should i wait for you itd probably be better if you didnt answered lomax ill call you if i need you he got out of the groundcar and walked up to the front door it was locked and the security system which didnt recognize him refused to let him in so he cautiously walked around to the back of the house he found what was left of them by the pond not much but enough to identify them the back door of the house was unlocked and inside it he found the icemans vest loaded with explosives try as he would he couldnt reconstruct what had happened although the climax of it was there for anyone to read he found a toolshed hidden behind some bushes broke the lock on it killed the ensuing alarm siren with his laser pistol and searched through the tiny building until he found a shovel he picked a shady spot under a huge tree by the pond dug a shallow grave and buried what he could find of them he filled in the grave then tried to decide how to mark it he doubted that either of them wanted a religious symbol and he had no intention of remaining on mozart until a headstone could be created and delivered then his gaze fell on something small and fluffy lying on the ground he walked over and picked it up it was the shredded remains of a small doll he tried to imagine what the doll might have to do with either of them and finally gave it up with a shrug besides it didnt really matter except for the vest which was too dangerous to leave behind it was the only object around with which to mark the grave and so he skewered it on a short branch and stuck it into the ground it wasn t much of a marker he knew but it was the best he could do under the circumstances he went into the house and summoned the groundcar via the vidphone and twenty minutes later he was speeding back to the spaceport epilogue five months had passed and lomax found himself much to his surprise on the world of sweetwater being served a mixed drink by a robot that will be all sidney said robert gibbs and the robot bowed and left the room all right mr gibbs said lomax you got me here now suppose you tell me what this is all about its about a crazed fanatic called the anointed one said gibbs a man with whom i believe you have been associated in the past what about him we want him we repeated lomax the democracy answered gibbs ive been reactivated and put in charge of my old department although theyve allowed me to operate out of my own home for the time being then let the democracy go out and get him answered lomax he thinks im dead and as far as im concerned thats a healthy relationship i dont think you understand the gravity of the situation mr lomax persisted gibbs this man is a threat to survival of our government hes just a man replied lomax calmly youve already survived the most serious threat youre ever going to face i beg your pardon penelope bailey gibbs shook his head shes been dead for four years she died when alpha crepello iii was destroyed she died five months ago when an old man with one leg hunted her down and killed her you mean mendozar asked gibbs startled hes dead lomax nodded and took a sip of his drink hes dead and so is she but life goes on mr lomax and right now more lives than you can imagine are being threatened by the man known as moses mohammed christ you survived her said lomax youll survive him i am prepared to offer you five million credits for your services said gibbs onethird now the remainder upon completion of your mission not interested then why did you come here asked gibbs you must have known the kind of offer i was going to make i just wanted to see the man who started all this all what you kidnapped penelope bailey when she was six years old said lomax you werent robert gibbs back then but it was you he paused you know if you had left her alone or had made some effort to win her confidence you wouldnt have had to depend on men like the iceman and me to do your dirty work for you she could have told you the outcome of every election predicted the results of every battle and if you didnt like the course events were taking shed have found a way to change them you could have had all that and because you never learned the secret of the stick and the carrot you let it slip away if she was so infallible scoffed gibbs how did the iceman manage to kill her i dont think he did answered lomax thoughtfully i think she just got tired of fighting like me youre not quitting said gibbs men like you and carlos never quit no im not quitting said lomax but im not fighting your battles mr gibbs if youve ever got a personal grudge against someone you know where to find me but dont expect me to fight every enemy the democracy has created through its arrogance or its stupidity we didnt create the anointed one or the bailey girl damn it snapped gibbs lomax sighed mr gibbs youve created every enemy youve ever had youve been with the anointed one spoken to him seen him in action continued gibbs surely you realize that he must be eliminated hes a religious fanatic and hes probably every bit as power hungry as you think said lomax he paused and smiled do you know who he reminds me of penelope bailey suggested gibbs surprised by the question no mr gibbs answered lomax he reminds me of you and i say a pox on both your houses he set his drink down and now if youll excuse me i have something important to do you cant walk out of here certainly i can said lomax somewhere out there on a world youve never heard of theres a grave thats marked only with a rag doll it doesnt mean a damned thing to you not anymore but im going to deliver a headstone to it seven million said gibbs lomax smiled and walked to the door youll be back said gibbs confidentiy carlos always came back and so will you you have enemies mr gibbs said lomax i think youd better hope i dont come back and then he was gone the end
