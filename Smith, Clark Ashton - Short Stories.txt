a rendezvous in averoigne clark ashton smith gerard de lautomne was meditating the rimes of a new ballade in honor of fleurette as he followed the leafarrased pathway toward vyones through the woodland of averoigne since he was on his way to meet fleurette who had promised to keep a rendezvous among the oaks and beeches like any peasant girl gerard himself made better progress than the ballade his love was at that stage which even for a professional troubadour is more productive of distraction than inspiration and he was recurrently absorbed in a meditation upon other than merely verbal felicities the grass and trees had assumed the fresh enamel of a mediaeval may the turf was figured with little blossoms of azure and white and yellow like an ornate broidery and there was a pebbly stream that murmured beside the way as if the voices of undines were parleying deliciously beneath its waters the sunlulled air was laden with a wafture of youth and romance and the longing that welled from the heart of gerard seemed to mingle mystically with the balsams of the wood gerard was a trouvиre whose scant years and many wanderings had brought him a certain renown after the fashion of his kind he had roamed from court to court from chateau to chateau and he was now the guest of the comte de la frкnaie whose high castle held dominion over half the surrounding forest visiting one day that quaint cathedral town vyones which lies so near to the ancient wood of averoigne gerard had seen fleurette the daughter of a welltodo mercer named guillaume cochin and had become more sincerely enamored of her blonde piquancy than was to be expected from one who had been so frequently susceptible in such matters he had managed to make his feelings known to her and after a month of billetsdoux ballades and stolen interviews contrived by the help of a complaisant waitingwoman she had made this woodland tryst with him in the absence of her father from vyones accompanied by her maid and a manservant she was to leave the town early that afternoon and meet gerard under a certain beechtree of enormous age and size the servants would then withdraw discreetly and the lovers to all intents and purposes would be alone it was not likely that they would be seen or interrupted for the gnarled and immemorial wood possessed an ill repute among the peasantry somewhere in this wood there was the ruinous and haunted chateau des faussesflammes and also there was a double tomb within which the sieur hugh du malinbois and his chatelaine who were notorious for sorcery in their time had lain unconsecrated for more than two hundred years of these and their phantoms there were grisly tales and there were stories of loupgarous and goblins of fays and devils and vampires that infested averoigne but to these tales gerard had given little heed considering it improbable that such creatures would fare abroad in open daylight the madcap fleurette had professed herself unafraid also but it had been necessary to promise the servants a substantial pourboire since they shared fully the local superstitions gerard had wholly forgotten the legendry of averoigne as he hastened along the sunflecked path he was nearing the appointed beechtree which a turn of the path would soon reveal and his pulses quickened and became tremulous as he wondered if fleurette had already reached the trystingplace he abandoned all effort to continue his ballade which in the three miles he had walked from la frenaie had not progressed beyond the middle of a tentative first stanza his thoughts were such as would befit an ardent and impatient lover they were now interrupted by a shrill scream that rose to an unendurable pitch of fear and horror issuing from the green stillness of the pines beside the way startled he peered at the thick branches and as the scream fell back to silence he heard the sound of dull and hurrying footfalls and a scuffling as of several bodies again the scream arose it was plainly the voice of a woman in some distressful peril loosening his dagger in its sheath and clutching more firmly a long hornbeam staff which he had brought with him as a protection against the vipers which were said to lurk in averoigne he plunged without hesitation or premeditation among the lowhanging boughs from which the voice had seemed to emerge in a small open space beyond the trees he saw a woman who was struggling with three ruffians of exceptionally brutal and evil aspect even in the haste and vehemence of the moment gerard realized that he had never before seen such men or such a woman the woman was clad in a gown of emerald green that matched her eyes in her face was the pallor of dead things together with a faery beauty and her lips were dyed as with the scarlet of newly flowing blood the men were dark as moors and their eyes were red slits of flame beneath oblique brows with animallike bristles there was something very peculiar in the shape of their feet but gerard did not realize the exact nature of the peculiarity till long afterwards then he remembered that all of them were seemingly clubfooted though they were able to move with surpassing agility somehow he could never recall what sort of clothing they had worn the woman turned a beseeching gaze upon gerard as he sprang forth from amid the boughs the men however did not seem to heed his coming though one of them caught in a hairy clutch the hands which the woman sought to reach toward her rescuer lifting his staff gerard rushed upon the ruffians he struck a tremendous blow at the head of the nearest one a blow that should have levelled the fellow to earth but the staff came down on unresisting air and gerard staggered and almost fell headlong in trying to recover his equilibrium dazed and uncomprehending he saw that the knot of struggling figures had vanished utterly at least the three men had vanished but from the middle branches of a tall pine beyond the open space the deathwhite features of the woman smiled upon him for a moment with faint inscrutable guile ere they melted among the needles gerard understood now and he shivered as he crossed himself he had been deluded by phantoms or demons doubtless for no good purpose he had been the gull of a questionable enchantment plainly there was something after all in the legends he had heard in the illrenown of the forest of averoigne he retraced his way toward the path he had been following but when he thought to reach again the spot from which he had heard that shrill unearthly scream he saw that there was no longer a path nor indeed any feature of the forest which he could remember or recognize the foliage about him no longer displayed a brilliant verdure it was sad and funereal and the trees themselves were either cypresslike or were already sere with autumn or decay in lieu of the purling brook there lay before him a tarn of waters that were dark and dull as clotting blood and which gave back no reflection of the brown autumnal sedges that trailed therein like the hair of suicides and the skeletons of rotting osiers that writhed above them now beyond all question gerard knew that he was the victim of an evil enchantment in answering that beguileful cry for succor he had exposed himself to the spell had been lured within the circle of its power he could not know what forces of wizardry or demonry had willed to draw him thus but he knew that his situation was fraught with supernatural menace he gripped the hornbeam staff more tightly in his hand and prayed to all the saints he could remember as he peered about for some tangible bodily presence of ill the scene was utterly desolate and lifeless like a place where cadavers might keep their tryst with demons nothing stirred not even a dead leaf and there was no whisper of dry grass or foliage no song of birds nor murmuring of bees no sigh nor chuckle of water the corpsegrey heavens above seemed never to have held a sun and the chill unchanging light was without source or destination without beams or shadows gerard surveyed his environment with a cautious eye and the more he looked the less he liked it for some new and disagreeable detail was manifest at every glance there were moving lights in the wood that vanished if he eyed them intently there were drowned faces in the tarn that came and went like livid bubbles before he could discern their features and peering across the lake he wondered why he had not seen the manyturreted castle of hoary stone whose nearer walls were based in the dead waters it was so grey and still and vasty that it seemed to have stood for incomputable ages between the stagnant tarn and the equally stagnant heavens it was ancienter than the world it was older than the light it was coeval with fear and darkness and a horror dwelt upon it and crept unseen but palpable along its bastions there was no sign of life about the castle and no banners flew above its turrets or its donjon but gerard knew as surely as if a voice had spoken aloud to warn him that here was the fountainhead of the sorcery by which he had been beguiled a growing panic whispered in his brain he seemed to hear the rustle of malignant plumes the mutter of demonian threats and plottings he turned and fled among the funereal trees amid his dismay and wilderment even as he fled he thought of fleurette and wondered if she were awaiting him at their place of rendezvous or if she and her companions had also been enticed and led astray in a realm of damnable unrealities he renewed his prayers and implored the saints for her safety as well as his own the forest through which he ran was a maze of bafflement and eeriness there were no landmarks there were no tracks of animals or men and the swart cypresses and sere autumnal trees grew thicker and thicker as if some malevolent will were marshalling them against his progress the boughs were like implacable arms that strove to retard him he could have sworn that he felt them twine about him with the strength and suppleness of living things he fought them insanely desperately and seemed to hear a crackling of infernal laughter in their twigs as he fought at last with a sob of relief he broke through into a sort of trail along this trail in the mad hope of eventual escape he ran like one whom a fiend pursues and after a short interval he came again to the shores of the tarn above whose motionless waters the high and hoary turrets of that timeforgotten castle were still dominant again he turned and fled and once more after similar wanderings and like struggles he came back to the inevitable tarn with a leaden sinking of his heart as into some ultimate slough of despair and terror he resigned himself and made no further effort to escape his very will was benumbed was crushed down as by the incumbence of a superior volition that would no longer permit his puny recalcitrance he was unable to resist when a strong and hateful compulsion drew his footsteps along the margent of the tarn toward the looming castle when he came nearer he saw that the edifice was surrounded by a moat whose waters were stagnant as those of the lake and were mantled with the iridescent scum of corruption the drawbridge was down and the gates were open as if to receive an expected guest but still there was no sign of human occupancy and the walls of the great grey building were silent as those of a sepulcher and more tomblike even than the rest was the square and overtowering bulk of the mighty donjon impelled by the same power that had drawn him along the lakeshore gerard crossed the drawbridge and passed beneath the frowning barbican into a vacant courtyard barred windows looked blankly down and at the opposite end of the court a door stood mysteriously open revealing a dark hall as he approached the doorway he saw that a man was standing on the threshold though a moment previous he could have sworn that it was untenanted by any visible form gerard had retained his hornbeam staff and though his reason told him that such a weapon was futile against any supernatural foe some obscure instinct prompted him to clasp it valiantly as he neared the waiting figure on the sill the man was inordinately tall and cadaverous and was dressed in black garments of a superannuate mode his lips were strangely red amid his bluish beard and the mortuary whiteness of his face they were like the lips of the woman who with her assailants had disappeared in a manner so dubious when gerard had approached them his eyes were pale and luminous as marshlights and gerard shuddered at his gaze and at the cold ironic smile of his scarlet lips that seemed to reserve a world of secrets all too dreadful and hideous to be disclosed i am the sieur du malinbois the man announced his tones were both unctuous and hollow and served to increase the repugnance felt by the young troubadour and when his lips parted gerard had a glimpse of teeth that were unnaturally small and were pointed like the fangs of some fierce animal fortune has willed that you should become my guest the man went on the hospitality which i can proffer you is rough and inadequate and it may be that you will find my abode a trifle dismal but at least i can assure you of a welcome no less ready than sincere i thank you for your kind offer said gerard but i have an appointment with a friend and i seem in some unaccountable manner to have lost my way i should be profoundly grateful if you would direct me toward vyones there should be a path not far from here and i have been so stupid as to stray from it the words rang empty and hopeless in his own ears even as he uttered them and the name that his strange host had given the sieur du malinbois was haunting his mind like the funereal accents of a knell though he could not recall at that moment the macabre and spectral ideas which the name tended to evoke unfortunately there are no paths from my chateau to vyones the stranger replied as for your rendezvous it will be kept in another manner at another place than the one appointed i must therefore insist that you accept my hospitality enter i pray but leave your hornbeam staff at the door you will have no need of it any longer gerard thought that he made a moue of distaste and aversion with his overred lips as he spoke the last sentences and that his eyes lingered on the staff with an obscure apprehensiveness and the strange emphasis of his words and demeanor served to awaken other phantasmal and macabre thoughts in gerards brain though he could not formulate them fully till afterwards and somehow he was prompted to retain the weapon no matter how useless it might be against an enemy of spectral or diabolic nature so he said i must crave your indulgence if i retain the staff i have made a vow to carry it with me in my right hand or never beyond arms reach till i have slain two vipers that is a queer vow rejoined his host however bring it with you if you like it is of no matter to me if you choose to encumber yourself with a wooden stick he turned abruptly motioning gerard to follow him the troubadour obeyed unwillingly with one rearward glance at the vacant heavens and the empty courtyard he saw with no great surprise that a sudden and furtive darkness had closed in upon the chateau without moon or star as if it had been merely waiting for him to enter before it descended it was thick as the folds of a serecloth it was airless and stifling like the gloom of a sepulcher that has been sealed for ages and gerard was aware of a veritable oppression a corporeal and psychic difficulty in breathing as he crossed the threshold he saw that cressets were now burning in the dim hall to which his host had admitted him though he had not perceived the time and agency of their lighting the illumination they afforded was singularly vague and indistinct and the thronging shadows of the hall were unexplainably numerous and moved with a mysterious disquiet though the flames themselves were still as tapers that burn for the dead in a windless vault at the end of the passage the sieur du malinbois flung open a heavy door of dark and somber wood beyond in what was plainly the eatingroom of the chateau several people were seated about a long table by the light of cressets no less dreary and dismal than those in the hall in the strange uncertain glow their faces were touched with a gloomy dubiety with a lurid distortion and it seemed to gerard that shadows hardly distinguishable from the figures were gathered around the board but nevertheless he recognized the woman in emerald green who had vanished in so doubtful a fashion amid the pines when gerard answered her call for succor at one side looking very pale and forlorn and frightened was fleurette cochin at the lower end reserved for retainers and inferiors there sat the maid and the manservant who had accompanied fleurette to her rendezvous with gerard the sieur du malinbois turned to the troubadour with a smile of sardonic amusement i believe you have already met everyone assembled he observed but you have not yet been formally presented to my wife agathe who is presiding over the board agathe i bring to you gerard de lautomne a young troubadour of much note and merit the woman nodded slightly without speaking and pointed to a chair opposite fleurette gerard seated himself and the sieur du malinbois assumed according to feudal custom a place at the head of the table beside his wife now for the first time gerard noticed that there were servitors who came and went in the room setting upon the table various wines and viands the servitors were preternaturally swift and noiseless and somehow it was very difficult to be sure of their precise features or their costumes they seemed to walk in an adumbration of sinister insoluble twilight but the troubadour was disturbed by a feeling that they resembled the swart demoniac ruffians who had disappeared together with the woman in green when he approached them the meal that ensued was a weird and funereal affair a sense of insuperable constraint of smothering horror and hideous oppression was upon gerard and though he wanted to ask fleurette a hundred questions and also demand an explanation of sundry matters from his host and hostess he was totally unable to frame the words or to utter them he could only look at fleurette and read in her eyes a duplication of his own helpless bewilderment and nightmare thralldom nothing was said by the sieur du malinbois and his lady who were exchanging glances of a secret and baleful intelligence all through the meal and fleurettes maid and manservant were obviously paralyzed by terror like birds beneath the hypnotic gaze of deadly serpents the foods were rich and of strange savor and the wines were fabulously old and seemed to retain in their topaz or violet depths the unextinguished fire of buried centuries but gerard and fleurette could barely touch them and they saw that the sieur du malinbois and his lady did not eat or drink at all the gloom of the chamber deepened the servitors became more furtive and spectral in their movements the stifling air was laden with unformulable menace was constrained by the spell of a black and lethal necromancy above the aromas of the rare foods the bouquets of the antique wines there crept forth the choking mustiness of hidden vaults and embalmed centurial corruption together with the ghostly spice of a strange perfume that seemed to emanate from the person of the chatelaine and now gerard was remembering many tales from the legendry of averoigne which he had heard and disregarded was recalling the story of a sieur du malinbois and his lady the last of the name and the most evil who had been buried somewhere in this forest hundreds of years ago and whose tomb was shunned by the peasantry since they were said to continue their sorceries even in death he wondered what influence had bedrugged his memory that he had not recalled it wholly when he had first heard the name and he was remembering other things and other stories all of which confirmed his instinctive belief regarding the nature of the people into whose hands he had fallen also he recalled a folklore superstition concerning the use to which a wooden stake can be put and realized why the sieur du malinbois had shown a peculiar interest in the hornbeam staff gerard had laid the staff beside his chair when he sat down and he was reassured to find that it had not vanished very quietly and unobtrusively he placed his foot upon it the uncanny meal came to an end and the host and his chatelaine arose i shall now conduct you to your rooms said the sieur du malinbois including all of his guests in a dark inscrutable glance each of you can have a separate chamber if you so desire or fleurette cochin and her maid angelique can remain together and the manservant raoul can sleep in the same room with messire gerard a preference for the latter procedure was voiced by fleurette and the troubadour the thought of uncompanioned solitude in that castle of timeless midnight and nameless mystery was abhorrent to an insupportable degree the four were now led to their respective chambers on opposite sides of a hall whose length was but indeterminately revealed by the dismal lights fleurette and gerard bade each other a dismayed and reluctant goodnight beneath the constraining eye of their host their rendezvous was hardly the one which they had thought to keep and both were overwhelmed by the supernatural situation amid whose dubious horrors and ineluctable sorceries they had somehow become involved and no sooner had gerard left fleurette than he began to curse himself for a poltroon because he had not refused to part from her side and he marvelled at the spell of druglike involition that had bedrowsed all his faculties it seemed that his will was not his own but had been thrust down and throttled by an alien power the room assigned to gerard and raoul was furnished with a couch and a great bed whose curtains were of antique fashion and fabric it was lighted with tapers that had a funereal suggestion in their form and which burned dully in an air that was stagnant with the mustiness of dead years may you sleep soundly said the sieur du malinbois the smile that accompanied and followed the words was no less unpleasant than the oily and sepulchral tone in which they were uttered the troubadour and the servant were conscious of profound relief when he went out and closed the leadenclanging door and their relief was hardly diminished even when they heard the click of a key in the lock gerard was now inspecting the room and he went to the one window through whose small and deepset panes he could see only the pressing darkness of a night that was veritably solid as if the whole place were buried beneath the earth and were closed in by clinging mould then with an access of unsmothered rage at his separation from fleurette he ran to the door and hurled himself against it he beat upon it with his clenched fists but in vain realizing his folly and desisting at last he turned to raoul well raoul he said what do you think of all this raoul crossed himself before he answered and his face had assumed the vizard of a mortal fear i think messire he finally replied that we have all been decoyed by a malefic sorcery and that you myself the demoiselle fleurette and the maid angelique are all in deadly peril of both soul and body that also is my thought said gerard and i believe it would be well that you and i should sleep only by turns and that he who keeps vigil should retain in his hands my hornbeam staff whose end i shall now sharpen with my dagger i am sure that you know the manner in which it should be employed if there are any intruders for if such should come there would be no doubt as to their character and their intentions we are in a castle which has no legitimate existence as the guests of people who have been dead or supposedly dead for more than two hundred years and such people when they stir abroad are prone to habits which i need not specify yes messire raoul shuddered but he watched the sharpening of the staff with considerable interest gerard whittled the hard wood to a lancelike point and hid the shavings carefully he even carved the outline of a little cross near the middle of the staff thinking that this might increase its efficacy or save it from molestation then with the staff in his hand he sat down upon the bed where he could survey the litten room from between the curtains you can sleep first raoul he indicated the couch which was near the door the two conversed in a fitful manner for some minutes after hearing raouls tale of how fleurette angelique and himself had been led astray by the sobbing of a woman amid the pines and had been unable to retrace their way the troubadour changed the theme and henceforth he spoke idly and of matters remote from his real preoccupations to fight down his torturing concern for the safety o f fleurette suddenly he became aware that raoul had ceased to reply and saw that the servant had fallen asleep on the couch at the same time an irresistible drowsiness surged upon gerard himself in spite of all his volition in spite of the eldritch terrors and forebodings that still murmured in his brain he heard through his growing hebetude a whisper as of shadowy wings in the castle halls he caught the sibilation of ominous voices like those of familiars that respond to the summoning of wizards and he seemed to hear even in the vaults and towers and remote chambers the tread of feet that were hurrying on malign and secret errands but oblivion was around him like the meshes of a sable net and it closed in relentlessly upon his troubled mind and drowned the alarms of his agitated senses when gerard awoke at length the tapers had burned to their sockets and a sad and sunless daylight was filtering through the window the staff was still in his hand and though his senses were still dull with the strange slumber that had drugged them he felt that he was unharmed but peering between the curtains he saw that raoul was lying mortally pale and lifeless on the couch with the air and look of an exhausted moribund he crossed the room and stooped above the servant there was a small red wound on raouls neck and his pulses were slow and feeble like those of one who has lost a great amount of blood his very appearance was withered and veindrawn and a phantom spice arose from the couch a lingering wraith of the perfume worn by the chatelaine agathe gerard succeeded at last in arousing the man but raoul was very weak and drowsy he could remember nothing of what had happened during the night and his horror was pitiful to behold when he realized the truth it will be your turn next messire he cried these vampires mean to hold us here amid their unhallowed necromancies till they have drained us of our last drop of blood their spells are like mandragora or the sleepy sirups of cathay and no man can keep awake in their despite gerard was trying the door and somewhat to his surprise he found it unlocked the departing vampire had been careless in the lethargy of her repletion the castle was very still and it seemed to gerard that the animating spirit of evil was now quiescent that the shadowy wings of horror and malignity the feet that had sped on baleful errands the summoning sorcerers the responding familiars were all lulled in a temporary slumber he opened the door he tiptoed along the deserted hall and knocked at the portal of the chamber allotted to fleurette and her maid fleurette fully dressed answered his knock immediately and he caught her in his arms without a word searching her wan face with a tender anxiety over her shoulder he could see the maid angelique who was sitting listlessly on the bed with a mark on her white neck similar to the wound that had been suffered by raoul he knew even before fleurette began to speak that the nocturnal experiences of the demoiselle and her maid had been identical with those of himself and the manservant while he tried to comfort fleurette and reassure her his thoughts were now busy with a rather curious problem no one was abroad in the castle and it was more than probable that the sieur du malinbois and his lady were both asleep after the nocturnal feast which they had undoubtedly enjoyed gerard pictured to himself the place and the fashion of their slumber and he grew even more reflective as certain possibilities occurred to him be of good cheer sweetheart he said to fleurette it is in my mind that we may soon escape from this abominable mesh of enchantments but i must leave you for a little and speak again with raoul whose help i shall require in a certain matter he went back to his own chamber the manservant was sitting on the couch and was crossing himself feebly and muttering prayers with a faint hollow voice raoul said the troubadour a little sternly you must gather all your strength and come with me amid the gloomy walls that surround us the somber ancient halls the high towers and the heavy bastions there is but one thing that veritably exists and all the rest is a fabric of illusion we must find the reality whereof i speak and deal with it like true and valiant christians come we will now search the castle ere the lord and chatelaine shall awaken from their vampire lethargy he led the way along the devious corridors with a swiftness that betokened much forethought he had reconstructed in his mind the hoary pile of battlements and turrets as he had seen them on the previous day and he felt that the great donjon being the center and stronghold of the edifice might well be the place which he sought with the sharpened staff in his hand with raoul lagging bloodlessly at his heels he passed the doors of many secret rooms the many windows that gave on the blindness of an inner court and came at last to the lower story of the donjonkeep it was a large bare room entirely built of stone and illumined only by narrow slits high up in the wall that had been designed for the use of archers the place was very dim but gerard could see the glimmering outlines of an object not ordinarily to be looked for in such a situation that arose from the middle of the floor it was a tomb of marble and stepping nearer he saw that it was strangely weatherworn and was blotched by lichens of grey and yellow such as flourish only within access of the sun the slab that covered it was doubly broad and massive and would require the full strength of two men to lift raoul was staring stupidly at the tomb what now messire he queried you and i raoul are about to intrude upon the bedchamber of our host and hostess at his direction raoul seized one end of the slab and he himself took the other with a mighty effort that strained their bones and sinews to the crackingpoint they sought to remove it but the slab hardly stirred at length by grasping the same end in unison they were able to tilt the slab and it slid away and dropped to the floor with a thunderous crash within there were two open coffins one of which contained the sieur hugh du malinbois and the other his lady agathe both of them appeared to be slumbering peacefully as infants a look of tranquil evil of pacified malignity was imprinted upon their features and their lips were dyed with a fresher scarlet than before without hesitation or delay gerard plunged the lancelike end of his staff into the bosom of the sieur du malinbois the body crumbled as if it were wrought of ashes kneaded and painted to human semblance and a slight odor as of ageold corruption arose to the nostrils of gerard then the troubadour pierced in like manner the bosom of the chatelaine and simultaneously with her dissolution the walls and floor of the donjon seemed to dissolve like a sullen vapor they rolled away on every side with a shock as of unheard thunder with a sense of weird vertigo and confusion gerard and raoul saw that the whole chateau had vanished like the towers and battlements of a bygone storm that the dead lake and its rotting shores no longer offered their malefical illusions to the eye they were standing in a forest glade in the full unshadowed light of the afternoon sun and all that remained of the dismal castle was the lichenmantled tomb that stood open beside them fleurette and her maid were a little distance away and gerard ran to the mercers daughter and took her in his arms she was dazed with wonderment like one who emerges from the nightlong labyrinth of an evil dream and finds that all is well i think sweetheart said gerard that our next rendezvous will not be interrupted by the sieur du malinbois and his chatelaine a vintage from atlantis clark ashton smith i thank you friend but i am no drinker of wine not even if it be the rarest canary or the oldest amontillado wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and more than others i have reason to know the truth that was writ by solomon the jewish king give ear if ye will and i shall tell you a story such as would halt the halfdrained cup on the lips of the hardiest bibber we were sevenandthirty buccaneers who raked the spanish main under barnaby dwale he that was called red barnaby for the spilling of blood that attended him everywhere our ship the black falcon could outfly and outstrike all other craft that flew the jolly roger full often captain dwale was wont to seek a remote isle on the eastward verge of the west indies and lighten the vessel of its weight of ingots and doubloons the isle was far from the common course of maritime traffic and was not known to maps or other mariners so it suited our purpose well it was a place of palms and sand and cuffs with a small harbor sheltered by the curving outstretched arms of rugged reefs on which the dark ocean climbed and gnashed its fangs of white foam without troubling the tranquil waters beyond i know not how many times we had visited the isle but the soil beneath many a cocotree was heavy with our hidden trove there we had stored the loot of bullionladen ships the massy plate and jewels of cathedral towns even as to all mortal things an ending came at last to our visits we had gathered a goodly cargo but might have stayed longer on the open main where the spaniards passed if a tempest had not impended we were near the secret isle as it chanced when the skies began to blacken and wallowing heavily in the rising seas we fled to our placid harbor reaching it by nightfall before dawn the hurricane had blown by and the sun came up in cloudless amber and blue we proceeded with the landing and burying of our chests of coin and gems and ingots which was a task of some length and afterward we refilled our watercasks at a cool sweet spring that ran from beneath the palmy hill not far inland it was now midafternoon captain dwale was planning to weigh anchor shortly and follow the westering sun toward the caribbees there were nine of us loading the last barrels into the boats with red barnaby looking on and cursing us for being slower than mudturtles and we were bending kneedeep in the tepid lazy water when suddenly the captain ceased to swear and we saw that he was no longer watching us he had turned his back and was stooping over a strange object that must have drifted in with the tide after the storm a huge and barnacleladen thing that lay on the sand half in and half out of the shoaling water somehow none of us had perceived it heretofore red barnaby was not silent long come here ye chancreeaten coistrels he called to us we obeyed willingly enough and gathered around the beached object which our captain was examining with much perplexity we too were greatly bewondered when we saw the thing more closely and none of us could name it offhand or with certainty the object had the form of a great jar with a tapering neck and a deep round abdomens body it was wholly encrusted with shells and corals that had gathered upon it as if through many ages in the ocean deeps and was festooned with weeds and seaflowers such as we had never before beheld so that we could not determine the substance of which it was made at the order of captain dwale we rolled it out of the water and beyond reach of the tide into the shade of nearby palms though it required the efforts of four men to move the unwieldy thing which was strangely ponderous we found that it would stand easily on end with its top reaching almost to the shoulders of a tall man while we were handling the great jar we heard a swishing noise from within as if it were filled with some sort of liquor our captain as it chanced was a learned man by the communion cup of satan he swore if this thing is not an antique winejar then i am a bedlamite such vesselsthough mayhap they were not so hugewere employed by the romans to store the goodly vintages of falernus and cecuba indeed there is today a spanish winethat of valdepenas which is kept in earthen jars but this if i mistake not is neither from spain nor olden rome it is ancient enough by its look to have come from that longsunken isle the atlantis whereof plato speaks truly there should be a rare vintage within a wine that was mellowed in the youth of the world before the founding of rome and athens and which perchance has gathered fire and strength with the centuries ho my rascal seabullies we sail not from this harbor till the jar is broached and if the liquor within be sound and potable we shall make holiday this evening on the sands belike tis a funeral urn full of plaguey cinders and ashes said the mate roger aglone who had a gloomy turn of thought red barnaby had drawn his cutlas and was busily prying away the crust of barnacles and quaint fantastic coralgrowths from the top of the jar layer on layer of them he removed and swore mightily at this increment of forgotten years at last a great stopper of earthenware sealed with a clear wax that bad grown harder than amber was revealed by his prying the stopper was graven with queer letters of an unknown language plainly to be seen but the wax refused the cutlas point so losing all patience the captain seized a mighty fragment of stone which a lesser man could scarce have lifted and broke therewith the neck of the jar now even in those days i stephen magbane the one puritan amid that christless crew was no bibber of wine or spirituous liquors but a staunch rechabite on all occasions therefore i held back feeling little concern other than that of reprobation while the others pressed about the jar and sniffed greedily at the contents but almost immediately with its opening my nostrils were assailed by an odor of heathen spices heavy and strange and the very inhalation thereof caused me to feel a sort of giddiness so that i thought it well to retreat still further but the others were eager as midges around a fermentingvat in autumn sblood tis a royal vintage roared the captain after he had dipped a forefinger in the jar and sucked the purple drops that dripped from it avast ye slumgullions stow the watercasks on board and summon all hands ashore leaving only a watch there to ward the vessel well have a gala night before we sack any more spaniards we obeyed his order and there was much rejoicing amid the crew of the black falcon at the news of our find and the postponement of the voyage three men grumbling sorely at their absence from the revels were left on board though in that tranquil harbor such vigilance was virtually needless we others returned to the shore bringing a supply of pannikins in which to serve the wine and provisions for a feast then we gathered pieces of drift with which to build a great fire and caught several huge tortoises along the sands and unearthed their hidden eggs so that we might have an abundance and variety of victuals in these preparations i took part with no special ardor knowing my habit of abstention and being of a somewhat malicious and tormenting humor captain dwale had expressly commanded my presence at the feast however i anticipated nothing more than a little ribaldry at my expense as was customary at such times and being partial to fresh tortoisemeat i was not wholly unresigned to my lot as a witness of the babylonian inebrieties of the others at nightfall the feasting and drinking began and the fire of driftwood with eery witchcolors of blue and green and white amid the flame leapt high in the dusk while the sunset died to a handful of red embers far on purpling seas it was a strange wine that the crew and captain swilled from their pannikins i saw that the stuff was thick and dark as if it had been mingled with blood and the air was filled with the reek of those pagan spices hot and rich and unholy that might have poured from a broken tomb of antique emperors and stranger still was the intoxication of that wine for those who drank it became still and thoughtful and sullen and there was no singing of lewd songs no playing of apish antics red barnaby had been drinking longer than the others having begun to sample the vintage while the crew were making ready for their revel to our wonderment he ceased to swear at us after the first cupful and no longer ordered us about or paid us any heed but sat peering into the sunset with eyes that held the dazzlement of unknown dreams and one by one as they began to drink the others were likewise affected so that i marvelled much at the unwonted power of the wine i had never before beheld an intoxication of such nature for they spoke not nor ate and moved only to refill their cups from the mighty jar the night had grown dark as indigo beyond the flickering fire and there was no moon and the firelight blinded the stars but one by one after an interval the drinkers rose from their places and stood staring into the darkness toward the sea unquietly they stood and strained forward peering intently as men who behold some marvelous thing and queerly they muttered to one another with unintelligible words i knew not why they stared and muttered thus unless it were because of some madness that had come upon them from the wine for naught was visible in the dark and i heard nothing save the low murmur of wavelets lapping on the sand louder grew the muttering and some raised their bands and pointed seaward babbling wildly as if in delirium noting their demeanor and doubtful as to what further turn their madness might take i bethought me to withdraw along the shore but when i began to move away those who were nearest me appeared to waken from their dream and restrained me with rough hands then with drunken gibbering words of which i could make no sense they held me helpless while one of their number forced me to drink from a pannikin filled with the purple wine i fought against them doubly unwilling to quaff that nameless vintage and much of it was spilled the stuff was sweet as liquid honey to the taste but burned like hellfire in my throat i turned giddy and a sort of dark confusion possessed my senses by degrees and i seemed to hear and see and feel as in the mounting fever of calenture the air about me seemed to brighten with a redness of ghostly blood that was everywhere a light that came not from the fire nor from the nocturnal heavens i beheld the faces and forms of the drinkers standing without shadow as if mantled with a rosy phosphorescence and beyond them where they stared in troubled and restless wonder the darkness was illumed with the strange light mad and unholy was the vision that i saw for the harbor waves no longer lapped on the sand and the sea had wholly vanished the black falcon was gone and where the reefs had been great marble walls ascended flushed as if with the ruby of lost sunsets above them were haughty domes of heathen temples and spires of pagan palaces and beneath were mighty streets and causeys where people passed in a neverending throng i thought that i gazed upon some immemorial city such as had flourished in earths prime and i saw the trees of its terraced gardens fairer than the palms of eden listening i heard the sound of dulcimers that were sweet as the moaning of women and the cry of horns that told forgotten glorious things and the wild sweet singing of people who passed to some hidden sacred festival within the walls i saw that the light poured upward from the city and was born of its streets and buildings it blinded the heavens above and the horizon beyond was lost in a shining mist one building there was a high fane above the rest from which the light streamed in a muddier flood and from its open portals music came sorcerous and beguiling as the far voices of bygone years and the revellers passed gayly into its portals but none came forth the weird music seemed to call me and entice me and i longed to tread the streets of the alien city and a deep desire was upon me to mingle with its people and pass into the glowing fane verily i knew why the drinkers had stared at the darkness and had muttered among themselves in wonder i knew that they also longed to descend into the city and i saw that a great causey built of marble and gleaming with the red luster ran downward from their very feet over meadows of unknown blossoms to the foremost buildings then as i watched and listened the singing grew sweeter the music stranger and the rosy luster brightened then with no backward glance no word or gesture of injunction to his men captain dwale went slowly forward treading the marble causey like a dreamer who walks in his dream and after him one by one roger aglone and the crew followed in the same manner going toward the city haply i too should have followed drawn by the witching music for truly it seemed that i had trod the ways of that city in former time and had known the things whereof the music told and the voices sang well did i remember why the people passed eternally into the fane and why they came not forth and there it seemed i should meet familiar and beloved faces and take part in mysteries recalled from the foundered years all this which the wine had remembered through its sleep in the ocean depths was mine to behold and conceive for a moment and well it was that i had drunk less of that evil and pagan vintage than the others and was less besotted than they with its luring vision for even as captain dwale and his crew went toward the city it appeared to me that the rosy glow began to fade a little the walls took on a wavering thinness and the domes grew insubstantial the rose departed the light was pale as a phosphor of the tomb and the people went to and fro like phantoms with a thin crying of ghostly horns and a ghostly singing dimly above the sunken causey the harbor waves returned and red barnaby and his men walked down beneath them slowly the waters darkened above the fading spires and walls and the midnight blackened upon the sea and the city was lost like the vanished bubbles of wine a terror came upon me knowing the fate of those others i fled swiftly stumbling in darkness toward the palmy hill that crowned the isle no vestige remained of the rosy fight and the sky was filled with returning stars and looking oceanward as i climbed the bill i saw a lantern that burned on the black falcon in the harbor and discerned the embers of our fire that smoldered on the sands then praying with a fearful fervor i waited for dawn a voyage to sfanomoл clark ashton smith there are many marvellous tales untold unwritten never to be recorded or remembered lost beyond all divining and all imagining that sleep in the double silence of farrecessive time and space the chronicles of saturn the archives of the moon in its prime the legends of antillia and moaria these are full of an unsurmised or forgotten wonder and strange are the multitudinous tales withheld by the lightyears of polaris and the galaxy but none is stranger none more marvellous than the tale of hotar and evidon and their voyage to the planet sfanomoл from the last isle of foundering atlantis harken for i alone shall tell the story who came in a dream to the changeless center where the past and future are always contemporary with the present and saw the veritable happening thereof and waking gave it words hotar and evidon were brothers in science as well as by consanguinity they were the last representatives of a long line of illustrious inventors and investigators all of whom had contributed more or less to the knowledge wisdom and scientific resources of a lofty civilization matured through cycles one by one they and their fellowsavants had learned the arcanic secrets of geology of chemistry of biology of astronomy they had subverted the elements had constrained the sea the sun the air and the force of gravitation compelling them to serve the uses of man and lastly they had found a way to release the typhonic power of the atom to destroy transmute and reconstruct the molecules of matter at will however by that irony which attends all the triumphs and achievements of man the progress of this mastering of natural law was coincidental with the profound geologic changes and upheavals which caused the gradual sinking of atlantis age by age aeon by aeon the process had gone on huge peninsulas whole seaboards high mountainranges citied plains and plateaus all went down in turn beneath the diluvial waves with the advance of science the time and location of future cataclysms was more accurately predictable but nothing could be done to avert them in the days of hotar and evidon all that remained of the former continent was a large isle called poseidonis it was well known that this isle with its opulent seaports its aeonsurviving monuments of art and architecture its fertile inland valleys and mountains lifting their spires of snow above semitropic jungles was destined to go down ere the sons and daughters of the present generation had grown to maturity like many others of their family hotar and evidon had devoted long years of research to the obscure telluric laws governing the imminent catastrophe and had sought to devise a means of prevention or at least of retardation but the seismic forces involved were too deeply seated and too widespread in their operation to be controllable in any manner or degree no magnetic mechanism no zone of repressive force was powerful enough to affect them when the two brothers were nearing middleage they realized the ultimate futility of their endeavors and though the peoples of poseidonis continued to regard them as possible saviors whose knowledge and resource were wellnigh superhuman they had secretly abandoned all effort to salvage the doomed isle and had retired from seagazing lephara the immemorial home of their family to a private observatory and laboratory far up in the mountains of the interior here with the hereditary wealth at their command the brothers surrounded themselves not only with all the known instruments and materials of scientific endeavor but also with a certain degree of personal luxury they were secluded from the world by a hundred scarps and precipices and by many leagues of littletrodden jungle and they deemed this seclusion advisable for the labors which they now proposed to themselves and whose real nature they had not divulged to anyone hotar and evidon had gone beyond all others of their time in the study of astronomy the true character and relationship of the world the sun the moon the planetary system and the stellar universe had long been known in atlantis but the brothers had speculated more boldly had calculated more profoundly and more closely than anyone else in the powerful magnifying mirrors of their observatory they had given special attention to the neighboring planets had formed an accurate idea of their distance from the earth had estimated their relative size and had conceived the notion that several or perhaps all might well be inhabited by creatures similar to man or if not inhabited were potentially capable of supporting human life venus which the atlanteans knew by the name of sfanomoл was the planet which drew their curiosity and their conjecture more than any other because of its position they surmised that it might readily resemble the earth in climatic conditions and in all the prerequisites of biological development and the hidden labor to which they were now devoting their energies was nothing less than the invention of a vehicle by which it would be possible to leave the oceanthreatened isle and voyage to sfanomoл day by day the brothers toiled to perfect their invention and night by night through the ranging seasons they peered at the lustrous orb of their speculations as it hung in the emerald evening of poseidonis or above the violetshrouded heights that would soon take the saffron footprints of the dawn and ever they gave themselves to bolder imaginings to stranger and more perilous projects the vehicle they were building was designed with complete foreknowledge of all the problems to be faced of all the difficulties to be overcome various types of airvessels had been used in atlantis for epochs but they knew that none of these would be suitable for their purpose even in a modified form the vehicle they finally devised after much planning and long discussion was a perfect sphere like a miniature moon since as they argued all bodies travelling through etheric space were of this shape it was made with double walls of a metallic alloy whose secret they themselves had discovered an alloy that was both light and tough beyond any substance classified by chemistry or mineralogy there were a dozen small round windows lined with an unbreakable glass and a door of the same alloy as the walls that could be shut with hermetic tightness the explosion of atoms in sealed cylinders was to furnish the propulsive and levitative power and would also serve to heat the spheres interior against the absolute cold of space solidified air was to be carried in electrum containers and vaporized at the rate which would maintain a respirable atmosphere and foreseeing that the gravitational influence of the earth would lessen and cease as they went further and further away from it they had established in the floor of the sphere a magnetic zone that would simulate the effect of gravity and thus obviate any bodily danger or discomfort to which they might otherwise be liable these labors were carried on with no other assistance than that of a few slaves members of an aboriginal race of atlantis who had no conception of the purpose for which the vessel was being built and who to ensure their complete discretion were deafmutes there were no interruptions from visitors for it was tacitly assumed throughout the isle that hotar and evidon were engaged in seismologic researches that required a concentration both profound and prolonged at length after years of toil of vacillation doubt anxiety the sphere was completed shining like an immense bubble of silver it stood on a westwardfacing terrace of the laboratory from which the planet sfanomoл was now visible at eventide beyond the purpling sea of the jungle all was in readiness the vessel was amply provisioned for a journey of many lustrums and decades and was furnished with an abundant supply of books with implements of art and science with all things necessary for the comfort and convenience of the voyagers hotar and evidon were now men of middle years in the hale maturity of all their powers and faculties they were the highest type of the atlantean race with fair complexions and lofty stature with the features of a lineage both aristocratic and intellectual knowing the nearness of the final cataclysm they had never married they had not even formed any close ties but had given themselves to science with a monastic devotion they mourned the inevitable passing of their civilization with all its epochgarnered lore its material and artistic wealth its consummate refinement but they had learned the universality of the laws whose operation was plunging atlantis beneath the wave the laws of change of increase and decay and they had schooled themselves to a philosophic resignation a resignation which mayhap was not untempered by a foresight of the singular glory and novel unique experiences that would be entailed by their flight upon hithertountravelled space their emotions therefore were a mingling of altruistic regret and personal expectancy when on the evening chosen for their departure they dismissed their wondering slaves with a writ of manumission and entered the orbshaped vessel and sfanomoл brightened before them with a pulsing luster and poseidonis darkened below as they began their voyage into the seagreen heavens of the west the great vessel rose with a buoyant ease beneath their guidance till soon they saw the lights of susran the capital and its galleycrowded port lephara where nightly revels were held and the very fountains ran with wine that people might forget awhile the predicted doom but so high in the air had the vessel climbed that hotar and evidon could hear no faintest murmur of the loud lyres and strident merrymaking in the cities beneath and they went onward and upward till the world was a dark blur and the skies were aflame with stars that their optic mirrors had never revealed and anon the black planet below was rimmed with a growing crescent of fire and they soared from its shadow to unsettling daylight but the heavens were no longer a familiar blue but had taken on the lucid ebon of ether and no star nor world not even the littlest was dimmed by the rivalship of the sun and brighter than all was sfanomoл where it hung with unvacillating lambence in the void mile by stellar mile the earth was left behind and hotar and evidon peering ahead to the goal of their dreams had almost forgotten it then gazing back they saw it was no longer below but above them like a vaster moon and studying its oceans and isles and continents they named them over one by one from their maps as the globe revolved but vainly they sought for poseidonis amid an unbroken glittering waste of sea and the brothers were conscious of that regret and sorrow which is the just due of all evanished beauty of all sunken splendor and they mused awhile on the glory that had been atlantis and recalled to memory her obelisks and domes and mountains her palms with high and haughty crests and the firetall plumes of her warriors that would lift no longer to the sun their life in the orblike vessel was one of ease and tranquillity and differed little from that to which they were accustomed they pursued their wonted studies they went on with experiments they had planned or begun in past days they read to each other the classic literature of atlantis they argued and discussed a million problems of philosophy or science and time itself was scarcely heeded by hotar and evidon and the weeks and months of their journey became years and the years were added into lustrums and the lustrums into decades nor were they sensible of the change in themselves and in each other as the years began to weave a web of wrinkles in their faces to tint their brows with the yellow ivory of age and to thread their sable beards with ermine there were too many things to be solved or debated too many speculations and surmises to be ventured for such trivial details as these to usurp their attention sfanomoл grew larger and larger as the halfoblivious years went by till anon it rolled beneath them with strange markings of untravelled continents and seas unsailed by man and now the discourse of hotar and evidon was wholly concerning the world in which they would so soon arrive and the peoples animals and plants which they might expect to find they felt in their ageless hearts the thrill of an anticipation without parallel as they steered their vessel toward the everwidening orb that swam below them soon they hung above its surface in a cloudladen atmosphere of tropic warmth but though they were childishly eager to set foot on the new planet they sagely decided to continue their journey on a horizontal level till they could study its topography with some measure of care and precision to their surprise they found nothing in the bright expanse below that in any manner suggested the work of men or living beings they had looked for towering cities of exotic aerial architecture for broad thoroughfares and canals and geometrically measured areas of agricultural fields instead there was only a primordial landscape of mountains marshes forests oceans rivers and lakes at length they made up their minds to descend though they were old old men with fivefoot ermine beards they brought the moonshaped vessel down with all the skill of which they had been capable in their prime and opening the door that had been sealed for decades they emerged in turn hotar preceding evidon since he was a little the elder their first impressions were of a torrid heat of dazzling color and overwhelming perfume there seemed to be a million odors in the heavy strange unstirring air odors that were almost visible in the form of wreathing vapors perfumes that were like elixirs and opiates that conferred at the same time a blissful drowsiness and a divine exhilaration then they saw that there were flowers everywhere that they had descended in a wilderness of blossoms they were all of unearthly form of supermundane size and beauty and variety with scrolls and volutes of petals manyhued that seemed to curl and twist with a more than vegetable animation or sentiency they grew from a ground that their overlapping stems and calyxes had utterly concealed they hung from the boles and fronds of palmlike trees they had mantled beyond recognition they thronged the water of still pools they poised on the jungletops like living creatures winged for flight to the perfumedrunken heavens and even as the brothers watched the flowers grew and faded with a thaumaturgic swiftness they fell and replaced each other as if by some legerdemain of natural law hotar and evidon were delighted they called out to each other like children they pointed at each new floral marvel that was more exquisite and curious than the rest and they wondered at the speed of their miraculous growth and decay and they laughed at the unexampled bizarrerie of the sight when they perceived certain animals new to zoology who were trotting about on more than the usual number of legs with orchidaceous blossoms springing from their rumps they forgot their long voyage through space they forgot there had ever been a planet called the earth and an isle named poseidonis they forgot their lore and their wisdom as they roamed through the bowers of sfanomoл the exotic air and its odors mounted to their heads like a mighty wine and the clouds of golden and snowy pollen which fell upon them from the arching arbors were potent as some fantastic drugs it pleased them that their white beards and violet tunics should be powdered with this pollen and with the floating spores of plants that were alien to all terrene botany suddenly hotar cried out with a new wonder and laughed with a more boisterous mirth than before he had seen that an oddly folded leaf was starting from the back of his shrunken right hand the leaf unfurled as it grew it disclosed a flowerbud and lo the bud opened and became a triplechaliced blossom of unearthly hues adding a rich perfume to the swooning air then on his left hand another blossom appeared in like manner and then leaves and petals were burgeoning from his wrinkled face and brow were growing in successive tiers from his limbs and body were mingling their hairlike tendrils and tongueshaped pistils with his beard he felt no pain only an infantile surprise and bewilderment as he watched them now from the hands and limbs of evidon the blossoms also began to spring and soon the two old me had ceased to wear a human semblance and were hardly to be distinguished from the garlandladen trees about them and they died with no agony as if they were already part of the teeming floral life of sfanomoл with such perceptions and sensations as were appropriate to their new mode of existence and before long their metamorphosis was complete and every fiber of their bodies had undergone a dissolution into flowers and the vessel in which they had made their voyage was embowered from sight in an everclimbing mass of plants and blossoms such was the fate of hotar and evidon the last of the atlanteans and the first of human visitors to sfanomoл an adventure in futurity clark ashton smith a survivor from the lost continents of mu or atlantis appearing on our modern streets would have seemed no stranger no more different from others than the man who called himself conrad elkins and yet i have always found it difficult to define even in my own thoughts the many elements which served to constitute this strangeness it would seem that the adjectives which would fitly describe elkins were as yet nonexistent in our vocabulary that they could be found only in some unimaginably subtle complex and refined language such as might be developed through long cycles of elaborating culture and civilization on an older and riper planet than ours even at first sight i was greatly struck not to say startled by the mans personality perhaps the thing which arrested me more than all else was the impossibility of assigning him to any known ethnic stock it is my theory that no human being is so individual that he does not possess obvious earmarks which place him immediately among the tribes of mankind and i am prone to pride myself on a sedulously cultivated gift for analyzing offhand the nationality and racial affiliations of any given person but elkins baffled me his extreme pallor his fine hair and clearcut lineaments were in a general sense indicative of caucasian origin yet i could not find the distinguishing features of any american european or asiatic branch of the white race also i could not have told his age he seemed young when one considered the smoothness of his face and yet there was a hint of something incalculably old in his expression his garb was modish and welltailored with nothing in the least unusual or eccentric in this as in all other things he gave always the subtle impression of desiring to avoid notice he was a little under medium height and of strangely delicate build and his features considered by themselves were almost effeminate apart from the great brow of uncorrugated ivory which resembled the one that we see in the portraits of edgar allan poe the small intricately convoluted ears the short deeply curved lips and the queer exotic molding of the sensitive nostrils all seemed to bespeak the possession of more highly developed senses than are normal to mankind his eyes were very large and luminous of an indescribable purplish color and did not flinch as i had occasion to observe before the most intense light his hands too were quite remarkable in their extreme fineness flexibility and vigor they were the hands of a supersurgeon or a superartist the mans habitual expression was wholly enigmatic no one could have read his mind and this not from any lack of mobility or expressiveness in the lineaments themselves but rather i felt sure from the unknown character of his ideas and motivations about him there was an aura of remote recondite knowledge of profound wisdom and aesthetic refinement assuredly he was a mystery from all angles and any one who has gone into chemistry as i have is almost inevitably a lover of mysteries i made up my mind to learn all that i could concerning him i had seen elkins a number of times on the streets and in libraries and museums before the beginning of our actual acquaintance indeed the frequency of our meetings in the multitudinous babel of new york was so phenomenal that i soon decided that he must have lodgings near mine and was perhaps engaged in similar studies i made inquiries regarding him from librarians and curators but learned nothing more than his name and the fact that he had been reading the works of havelock ellis and other modern authorities on sex as well as many books in biology chemistry and physics the motives which prompted his visits to the natural history and other museums were seemingly of a general nature but evidently he was seeking to familiarize himself with certain branches of modern science as well as archaeology being myself a student of chemistry who had given nearly a decade of collegiate and postgraduate effort to the subject and also several years of independent work and experimentation in my laboratory on washington square my curiosity was touched with fraternal interest when i learned of elkins studies others than myself i found had been struck by the mans appearance but no one really knew anything about him he was extremely taciturn volunteering no information whatever regarding himself though impeccably polite in all his dealings with others apparently he desired to avoid making friends or acquaintances a farfromdifficult procedure in any large city yet oddly enough i did not find it hard to know him which as i later learned was due to the fact that elkins had somehow conceived an interest in me and also was well aware of my interest i came upon him one may afternoon as he was standing in the natural history museum before a case of artifacts from the mounds of the mississippi valley to all appearance he was deeply absorbed i had made up my mind to address him on some pretext or another when suddenly he forestalled me has it ever occurred to you he said in a grave finely modulated voice how many civilizations have been irretrievably lost how many have been buried by deluge glacial action and geological cataclysm and also by profound social upheavals with their subsequent reversions to savagery and do you ever think that presentday new york will some time be as fragmentary and fabulous as troy or zimbabwe that archaeologists may delve in its ruins beneath the sevenfold increment of later cities and find a few rusting mechanisms of disputed use and potteries of doubtful date and inscriptions which no one can decipher i assure you this is not only probable but certain the very history of america in some future epoch will become more or less legendary and it would surprise you to know the theories and beliefs regarding the current civilization which will some day be prevalent you speak as if you had some inside information on the subject i replied halfjestingly elkins gave me a quick inscrutable glance i am interested in all such things he said and by the same token mr pastor i believe you are something of a speculative thinker yourself along different lines i have read your little thesis on the cosmic rays your idea that these rays might become a source of illimitable power through concentration appeals to me i can safely say that the idea is quite ultramodern i was surprised that he knew my name but obviously he had made inquiries similar to mine also of course i was pleased by his familiarity with a treatise that was generally looked upon as being rather advanced not to say fantastic in its theories the ice being thus broken the growth of our acquaintance was rapid elkins came to my rooms and laboratory many times and i in turn was admitted to his own modest lodgings which as i had surmised were only a few blocks away from mine on the same street a score of meetings and the development of a quasifriendship left me as fundamentally ignorant concerning elkins as i had been at first i do not know why he liked me perhaps it was the universal human need of a friend inescapable at all times and in all places but somehow the halfaffectionate air which he soon adopted toward me did not make it any easier to ask the personal questions that seethed within me the more i came to know him the more i was overcome by a sense of impossible seniority on his part by the feeling that he must be older and intellectually more evolved than myself in a fashion that could not be measured by tabulated or classified knowledge strangely since such a feeling has been unique in my experience i was almost like a child before him and grew to regard him with something of the awe which a child conceives toward an elder who is seemingly omniscient nor was the awe conditioned at first by anything which he actually said or did the furnishings of his rooms were as noncommittal as the man himself there was nothing to seize upon as indicating his nationality and antecedents however i saw at once that he was a linguist for there were books in at least four modern languages one which he told me he had just been reading was a recent and voluminous german work on the physiology of sex are you really much interested in that stuff i ventured to ask there is it seems to me overmuch discussion and all too little knowledge regarding such matters i agree with you he rejoined one hears of special knowledge but it fails to materialize on investigation i thought that i had an object in studying this branch of twentieth century science but now i doubt greatly if there is anything of value to be learned i was struck by the tone of intellectual impersonality which he maintained in all our discussions no matter what the subject his range of information was obviously vast and he gave the impression of boundless reserves though there were certain avenues of science generally looked upon as important in our day to which he seemed to have given only a somewhat cursory and negligent attention i gathered that he did not think much of current medicine and surgery and he startled me more than once by pronouncements on electricity and astronomy that were widely at variance with accepted ideas somehow at most times he made me feel that he was discreetly curbing the full expression of his thoughts he spoke of einstein with respect and seemed to regard him as the one real thinker of the age mentioning more than once with great approval his theories concerning time and space elkins showed a tactful interest in my own chemical researches but somehow i felt that he looked upon them as being rather elementary once in an unguarded manner he spoke of the transmutation of metals as if it were already an accomplished everyday fact explaining the reference when i questioned him as a rhetorical flight of imagination in which he had lost himself for the moment the late spring and early summer passed and the mystery which had drawn me to elkins was still unsolved i did indeed learn from a casual remark that he was a native of north america which failed to render his ethnic distinction any the less baffling i decided that he must represent a reversion to some type whose lineaments have not been preserved in history or must be one of those rare individuals who anticipate in themselves a whole era of the future evolution of the race i will not deny that the truth occurred to me more than once but how was i to know that the truth was a thing so utterly improbable much as i had grown to admire and even revere him elkins was to me the most incomprehensible and alien being on earth and i sensed in him a thousand differences of thought and emotion and a world of unfamiliar knowledge which for some reason he was trying to withhold from my apprehension one day toward the end of the summer he said to me i must leave new york before long hugh i was startled since hitherto he had made no reference to leaving or to the duration of his stay you are returning home perhaps i hope it will at least be possible for us to keep in touch with each other he gave me a long unreadable glance yes i am going home but odd as it may seem to you there will be no possibility of future communication between us we part for all time unless you should care to accompany me my curiosity seethed anew at his cryptic words yet somehow i was still unable to ask the questions that arose to my lips if you mean that as an invitation i said i shall be glad to accept and pay you a visit sometime yes it is an invitation he rejoined gravely but before accepting would you not prefer to know where you are going perhaps when you hear the truth you will not care to accept and perhaps you will not even believe me for once my inquisitiveness was stronger than my respect do you live on mars or saturn then he smiled no i am a denizen of the earth though it may surprise you in the present infantile condition of astronautics to learn that i have made more than one voyage to mars i realize your natural curiosity concerning me and an explanation is now necessary if when you have learned the truth you still care to accompany me as my guest i shall be overjoyed to take you with me and to offer you my hospitality for as long as you wish to remain he paused a moment the mystery that has troubled you will be fully explained when i tell you that i am not a man of your own era but have come from a period far in the future or what is known to you as the future according to your notation my proper time is about a d my real name is kronous alkon i have assumed the vaguely analogous one of conrad elkins as well as the speech and garb of your time for reasons which will be fairly obvious at present i shall give you only a brief summary of the causes which prompted my visit to the twentieth century it would require a long discourse to even offer you an adequate sketch of our social anatomy and problems and i speak merely of one aspect humanity in our age is menaced with gradual extinction through an increasing overpreponderance of male children and a method of sexcontrol which would restore in some degree the balance of nature is urgently desired your age the first great mechanistic era is a wellnigh mythical period to us and less known even than certain earlier periods because of the allengulfing savagery to which man reverted at its end there ensued long dark ages through which only the most fragmentary records survived along with a legendry of vast uncouth machines which the superstition of peoples identified with avenging demons perhaps they were not without reason since the abuse of machinery was one of the main causes of your dйbвcle also there remained a widespread popular belief accepted even now by many of our scientists that the people of the twentieth century could determine at will the sex of their offspring and that the secret of this determination was lost in the ensuing barbarism along with certain minor secrets of chemistry and metallurgy which no later civilization has ever rediscovered the former belief has no doubt arisen because the sexes are well known to have been numerically equal in your time and because they have not been equal since for many thousands of years after the rebuilding of an enlightened civilization on the ruins of yours girlchildren predominated and the whole world became a matriarchy the period known as the amazonian wars which were the most sanguinary and merciless wars in history put an end to the matriarchy by wiping out all but a few hundred thousand of the human race these reverted to the most primitive conditions there were more dark ages and then slowly the evolution of our present cycle of renewed culture in which the male predominates both numerically and intellectually but our difficulties were not over it was to recover the fabled secret of sexdetermination that i came back through the ages and have lived among you for a full year of twentieth century time it has been a fascinating experience and i have learned many things regarding the antique world which are altogether unknown and unverifiable to my fellows your crude cumbrous machines and buildings are not unimpressive in their way and your science is not without a few inklings of our later discoveries but obviously you know even less regarding the mysterious laws of biology and sex than we do your supposed method of determination is truly fabulous and i have no reason for tarrying any longer in an alien epoch now to become personal hugh you are the only friend i have cared to make in the epoch your mind is in some respects beyond the age and though everything will seem different to you in our time and much will be incomprehensible i am sure you will find a surpassing interest in the world of a d i shall of course provide you with a safe means of return to your own era whenever you wish will you go with me hugh i could not reply for a moment i was awed astonished bewildered even to stupefaction by the remarkable things that my friend had just told me his statements were no less than miraculous yet somehow they were not incredible i did not doubt his veracity for an instant after all it was the only logical explanation of everything that puzzled me in conrad elkins of course ill go with you i cried overcome and dazzled by the strange opportunity which he offered me there were a hundred obvious questions that i wanted to ask elkins anticipating certain of these he said the machine in which i traveled through time is a vessel commonly used among us for spacetravel i will explain to you later the modification of the original mechanism which rendered possible a journey in that fourthdimensional space known as time i have reason to believe that the invention is wholly unique and has never been duplicated i had nurtured for many years my project for visiting your period and in preparation for this i made a prolonged study of all available historic data bearing thereon as well as the archaeological and literary remains of antique america as i have said the remains are fragmentary but the language being the rootstock of our own tongue is fairly wellknown to our scholars i took pains to master it as far as possible though i have since found that some of our pronunciations and definitions are erroneous also that the vocabulary is much ampler than we had supposed i studied likewise the costumes of your period of which a few plates are still extant and made for myself habiliments which would enable me to pass unnoticed upon my arrival elkins paused and went to his clothescloset he opened it and brought out a suit of some soft brown fabric it was not badly tailored though the cut was unfamiliar later i found that the actual plate from which it had been designed belonged to the year ten years in advance of our own date elkins went on my departure was carefully planned and i am supposed to have gone on a voyage to the asteroids several of which notably pallas vesta and ceres have been colonized by human beings for hundreds of years past i made the actual timejourney in a state of unconsciousness this as you will soon learn was inevitable because of the temporary abstraction from everything that creates or contributes to what we know as consciousness i was prepared for it and had made all the necessary calculations and adjustments beforehand and had carefully synchronized the movement of the vessel in the timedimension with the movement of the earth and the solar system in space geographically speaking i would not move an inch during the entire trip rising to an elevation of thirty thousand feet above the earth i started the timemechanism there was a period of absolute oblivion and then with the ceasing of the timeflight i recovered my senses knowing that i was now in the twentieth century if my calculations were correct and not choosing to advertise my strangeness i sought for a place where i could land quietly and without detection the place which i selected after much circumnavigation and study was an inaccessible cliff in the catskill mountains far from any settlement there i descended at night and left my machine whose presence was indetectible either from below or above i finished my descent of the cliff by the use of an antigravitational device and made my way from the wilderness the next day i was in new york where for the most part i have remained ever since and have carried on unobtrusively my studies of your civilization for monetary needs i had brought with me some disinterred coins of your period and also a few small ingots of chemically wrought gold he showed me one of the coins a silver dollar that was stained almost beyond recognition like an ancient obolus by the oxidation of untold centuries then he brought out another garment from the clothescloset a short flaring tunic of dull red with a long graceful mantle that could be detached at will since it was fastened to the shoulders by two clasps of carven silver the fabric as well as the garment itself was strange to me kronous also brought out a pair of sandals vaguely resembling those of the ancients though they were not made of leather but of some stiff indestructible cloth this he said is the raiment in which i left akameria the america of a d i will have a similar tunic made for you by some costumetailor here in new york and also sandals though i suppose the sandals will have to be made of leather since the material used in these is a chemical product of my own time i am planning to leave the day after tomorrow and i hope that will not be too soon for you indeed it wont i replied i havent many preparations to make theres nothing to do but lock up the laboratory and phone a few friends that i am leaving for a worldtour of indefinite length i dont imagine therell be any searchparties two days later with an hour of daylight still before us elkins and i had reached the base of the unsurmountable cliff on which the timemachine was hidden the last four hours of our journey had been on foot we were in the wildest section of the catskills and staring up at the terrible mountainwall i felt an increased awe of my strange companion who seemed to have no doubt whatever of his ability to scale it he opened a small satchel whose contents he had not hitherto revealed to me and took out the antigravitational device of which he had spoken the thing was a hollow disk of some dull unidentifiable metal with chains of an equally ambiguous material which secured it to the body elkins showed me the simple operation of the mechanism which he said was electronic in its nature then he strapped it to his chest set the apparatus running and rose slowly in air till he reached the top of the precipice there he disappeared from view but a few moments later the metal disk was lowered at the end of a long cord for my use in surmounting the cliff following directions i proceeded to adjust the mechanism and start it going the feeling of utter weightlessness as i floated upward was a most unique experience it was as if i were a feather wafted on an imperceptible aircurrent being unused to the apparatus i did not understand the finer technique of movement beneath its influence and when i came to the cliffedge i would have continued to drift skyward if my companion had not reached out and stopped me i found myself standing beside him on a broad ledge overhung by another cliff which rose immediately above it certainly elkins could not have chosen a safer hidingplace for this timemachine the vessel itself whose door he now proceeded to unlock was a long spindleshaped affair evidently designed for swift movement in air or ether it could not have carried more than three people inside it was lined with lockers and machinery and three great slings or cradles in which the driver and passengers were immovably suspended this of course was requisite during the loss of gravity and normal weight in etherflight elkins said that he had found it equally convenient to strap himself into one of the slings during his voyage in time both of us were still dressed in twentieth century attire elkins now donned the tunic and sandals of his own age which he had brought along in the satchel together with the duplicates that had been made for me by a somewhat mystified costumer these elkins directed me to put on i obeyed feeling like a masquerader in the odd garb that is the last of conrad elkins said my companion pointing to his discarded suit henceforth you must call me kronous alkon your name will seem pretty outlandish among us so i think i will introduce you as huno paskon a young colonial born on pallas kronous alkon now busied himself with the machinery of the vessel this to my untrained eye was awesomely intricate he adjusted a series of movable rods that were set in a notched board and seemed to be winding up a clocklike apparatus with a numbered dial and three hands there were hundreds perhaps thousands of figures on the dial that he said is to control within precise limits the extent of our forward movement in the timedimension we are all set for the proper year month and day he now fastened me and then himself in the complicated slings and turned to a small keyboard with many knobs and levers which seemed to be distinct from the rest of the machinery these he said are the controls for atmosphere and etherflight before turning on the timepower i shall rise to a higher altitude and fly south for about fifty miles he turned one of the knobs there was a low drumming sound but i would not have been conscious of any movement if a sudden sunset glow through the vessels ports had not shown that we were rising above the level of the cliffs after a few minutes kronous alkon moved one of the levers and the drumming ceased the power of spaceflight he said is provided by atomic disintegration now for the timeflight i shall make use of a very different kind of power a strange complex energy derived from the repercussion of cosmic rays which will transport us into what for lack of a better name is called the fourth dimension properly speaking we will be outside of space and from a mundane viewpoint will be nonexistent i assure you however that there is no danger when the timepower shuts off automatically in ad you and i will awaken as if from a deep sleep the sensation of dropping off may prove rather terrific but no more so than the taking of certain anaesthetics simply let yourself go and realize that there is nothing to fear he seized a large rod and gave it a powerful jerk i felt as if i had received an electric shock that was tearing all my tissues apart and disintegrating me into my ultimate cells and molecules in spite of the reassurance of kronous alkon i was overwhelmed by an unspeakably confusing terror i had the sensation of being divided into a million selves all of which were whirling madly downward in the maelstrom of a darkening gulf they seemed to go out one by one like sparks as they reached a certain level till soon all were gone and there was nothing anywhere but darkness and unconsciousness i came to myself in a manner which was like the direct reversal of my descent into oblivion first there was that sense of remote and sparklike entities which increased to a multitude all of them drifting upward in cosmic gloom from an ultimate nadir and then the gradual merging of these entities into one as the interior of the timemachine resumed coherent outline around me then i saw before me the figure of kronous alkon who had twisted about in his sling and was smiling as he met my gaze it seemed to me that i had slept for a long long time my companion pressed a knob and i had the feeling of one who descends in an elevator it was not necessary for kronous alkon to tell me that we were sinking earthward in less than a minute trees and buildings were visible through the ports and there was a slight jar as we landed now said kronous we are on my country estate near djarma the present capital of akameria djarma is built on the ruins of the city of new york but is hundreds of miles inland since there have been extensive geologic changes during the past years you will find that the climate is different too for it is now subtropical weather conditions are pretty much under human control and we have even reduced by artificial means the permanent areas of ice and snow at the poles he had unstrapped himself and was performing the same service for me then he opened the door of the vessel and motioned me to precede him i was met by wafts of warm perfumeladen air as i stepped out on a stone platform adjoining a sort of aerodrome a great shining edifice in which were housed various aircraft of unfamiliar types not far away was another building marked by a light graceful architecture with many tiers of open galleries and high fantastic eiffellike towers there were extensive gardens around this building and broad fields of vegetables that i did not recognize ran away on each side of the distance somewhat apart there stood a group of long onestoried houses my home said kronous i trust that everything is well i left the estate in charge of my two cousins altus and oron also there is trogh the martian overseer and a barracoon of venusian slaves who do all the agricultural labor all our necessary menial and industrial tasks are performed by such slaves who have been imported to earth for many generations and are now becoming a problem in themselves i hope there has not been any trouble during my absence i noticed that kronous had taken from an inner pocket of his tunic a small rod vaguely resembling a flashlight and having a ball of red glass or crystal at one end this he was carrying in his hand an electronic projector he explained the current paralyzes but does not kill at any distance up to fifty yards sometimes we have to use such weapons when the slaves are recalcitrant the venusians are a low vicious type and require careful handling we started toward the house whose lower stories were halfconcealed by tall trees and massed shrubbery no sign of life was manifest as we followed a winding path among fountains of colored marble and palms and rhododendrons and baroque unearthlylooking plants and flowers that would have baffled a presentday botanist kronous told me that some of these latter were importations from venus the hot humid air was saturated with odors which i found oppressive but which kronous appeared to inhale with delight rounding a sharp turn in the path we came to an open lawn immediately in front of the house here an unexpected and terrific scene revealed itself two men attired like kronous and a huge barrelchested spindlelegged being with an ugly head like that of a hydrocephalous frog were fronting a horde of bestial creatures who would have made the neanderthal man look like an example of classic beauty in comparison there must have been a score of these beings many of whom were armed with clubs and stones which they were hurling at the three who opposed them their brownblack bodies were clothed only with patches and tufts of coarse purple hair and perhaps half of their number were adorned with thick bifurcated tails these i learned later were the females the males for some obscure evolutionary reason being undistinguished in this respect the slaves cried kronous as he ran forward with his projector leveled following him i saw the fall of one of the two men beneath the impact of a large stone a dozen of the slaves were lying senseless on the lawn and i could see that the persons they were attacking were armed with projectors our approach had not been noticed and kronous made deadly use of his weapon at close range stretching slave after slave on the ground turning and apparently recognizing their master the remainder began to disperse sullenly their rout was completed by the heavychested giant who hurled after them with his catapultlike arms much of the ammunition which they had dropped on beholding kronous i fear that altus is badly hurt said kronous as we joined the little group on the lawn the other man whom kronous now introduced to me as his cousin oron was stooping over the fallen figure and examining a hidden wound from which blood was streaming heavily amid the fine black hair oron who acknowledged the introduction with a courteous nod had himself been cut and bruised by several missiles the introduction had been made in english kronous and oron now began to talk in a language that i could not understand apparently some explanation was being made regarding myself for oron gave me a quick curious glance the giant had ceased hurling stones and clubs after the departing venusians and now came to join us that is trogh the martian overseer said kronous to me like all of his race he is extremely intelligent they are an old people with an immemorial civilization that has followed a different trend from ours but is not therefore necessarily inferior and we of earth have learned much from them though they are highly reserved and secretive the reddishyellow body of the martian was attired only in a black loincloth his squat toadlike features under the high bulging knobby head were impossible to read and i was chilled by the sense of an unbridgeable evolutionary gulf as i looked into his icy green eyes culture wisdom power were manifest behind his gaze but in forms that no human being was properly fitted to understand he spoke in a harsh guttural voice evidently using human language though the words were difficult to recognize as being in any way related to those employed by kronous and oron because of an odd prolongation of the vowels and consonants carrying among us the still unconscious form of altus oron kronous trogh and myself entered the portico of the nearby house both the architecture and the material of this building were the most beautiful i had ever seen much use was made of arabesque arches and light decorative pillars the material which resembled a very translucent onyx was as kronous told me in reality a synthetic substance prepared by atomic transmutation within there were many couches covered with unknown opulent fabrics of superb design the rooms were large with lofty vaulted ceilings and in many cases were divided only by rows of pillars or by tapestries the furniture was of much beauty with light curving lines that conformed to the architecture and some of it was made from gemlike materials and gorgeous metals that i could not name there were scores of paintings and statues mainly of the most bizarre and fantastic nature and testifying to supreme technical skill i learned that some of the paintings were firsthand depictions of scenes on alien planets we laid altus on a couch the man was indeed severely injured and his breathing was slow and faint in all likelihood he had suffered some degree of brainconcussion kronous brought out a bulbshaped mechanism ending in a hollow cone which he explained to me was the generator of a force known as osc a superelectric energy used in the treatment of wounds as well as of illness in general it was of sovereign power in restoring the normal processes of health no matter what the cause of derangement might be when the generator was set in action by kronous i saw the emission of a green light from the hollow end falling on the head of the wounded man the pulse of altus became stronger and he stirred a little but did not awaken as yet when kronous turned off the green ray after a few minutes he asked me to examine the wound and i found that it was already beginning to heal altus will be perfectly well in two or three days said kronous the real problem he went on is the venusians and not only for me but for everyone else it was a dreadful mistake to bring them to earth in the beginning they are not only ferocious and intractable but they breed with the most appalling fecundity in opposition to the dwindling numbers of the human race already they outnumber us five to one and in spite of our superior knowledge and weapons i believe that they constitute our worst menace all that they require is a little organization evening had now fallen trogh had retired to his own quarters presided over by his martian wife at some distance from the house a meal consisting mainly of delicious fruit and vegetables most of which were new to me was served by oron i learned that one of the vegetables was a species of truffle imported from venus after we had eaten a strong delicately flavored liqueur made from a fruit that vaguely resembled both the peach and the pineapple was brought out in deep slender glasses of crystal kronous now spoke at some length he told me that he had already confided the truth concerning his timevoyage and myself to oron the reason i did not want my trip to be known he said is because of the mechanical principle involved which might be stolen or duplicated by some other inventor and i am dubious of its value to mankind in general we of the present era have learned not to abuse mechanical devices in the gross manner of earlier generations but even so it is not well that man should know too much we have conquered space and the conquest has entailed new perils on the whole i think it would be better if the conquest of time should remain an isolated exploit i can trust oron and also altus to keep the secret he went on to speak of various things which he felt that it was necessary for me to know you will find he soliloquized that our world is motivated by desires and ambitions very different from those which are most prevalent in your own the mere struggle for existence for wealth and power is almost alien to our comprehension crime is extremely rare among us and we have few problems of administration or government when such occur they are submitted to the arbitration of a board of scientists we have infinite leisure and our aspirations are toward the conquest of remote knowledge the creation of rare artforms and the enjoyment of varied intellectual and aesthetic sensations aided by the long lifespan averaging three or four hundred years which our mastery of disease has made possible i am not sure however that this mode of life has been wholly to our advantage perhaps through the very lack of struggle of hardship of difficulty we are becoming effete and effeminate but i think we will be put to a severe test before long coming as you have from a commercial age he went on it will no doubt interest you to be told that half of our own commerce is interplanetary there are whole fleets of ethercraft that ply between the earth mars venus the moon and the asteroids however we are on the whole not a commercial people apart from those of us who have chosen to live in cities the remainder are mostly the owners of large plantations where everything necessary is produced or manufactured by slavelabor it is of course only our dwindling numbers that have made this system possible we possess the power if we so desire of manufacturing everything through a mode of chemical synthesis however we find that natural foodstuffs are preferable to the synthetic kind and we make less use of our knowledge in this regard than you might suppose perhaps the chief use of our mastery of atomic conversion is in the making of fabrics and buildingmaterials there is much more that i might tell you but you will see and learn for yourself tomorrow morning oron and myself will begin to instruct you in our language thus began several quiet weeks of life on kronous estate i made rapid progress in the language which bore about the same relation to english that english bears to latin i was given access to a fine and extensive library filled with the latest scientific works with fiction and poetry of the latterday world and also a few rare items dating from periods which though long subsequent to our own time were nevertheless buried in the dust of antiquity on several occasions kronous took me through his laboratory in which he could perform the most incredible marvels of atomic transformation and feats of microscopic analysis that revealed a whole world in the electron i realized that the science of our time was childsplay compared with that of the era into which i had been transported one day kronous showed me a cabinet full of objects that had been recovered from the ruins of new york and other antique cities among them were porcelain dinnerplates masonic emblems pearl necklaces china doorknobs twenty dollar goldpieces and sparkplugs the sight of them and the realization of their extreme age combined with their homely familiarity aroused in me the most violent nostalgia an intolerably desperate homesickness for my own period this feeling lasted for days and kronous did not show me any more ancient relics altus had recovered fully from his wound and i heard of no more insubordination from the slaves of kronous however i could not forget the terrible scene which had formed my initiation into life on the estate i saw many times the savagelooking venusians who went about their agricultural labors with a sullen air of mindless brooding and i was told much concerning them their ancestors were inhabitants of the deep and noisomely luxuriant jungles of venus where they lived under the most primitive conditions in perpetual conflict with terrible animals and insects and also with each other they were cannibalistic by nature and their habits in this respect had proven hard to curb every now and then on the plantation one of their number would disappear surreptitiously the slavetrade had flourished for several centuries but had languished of late years since those brought to earth had now multiplied in excess of the required quota the original venusian slaves were mostly though not all the captives of tribal raids and wars and they had been purchased very cheaply by terrestrial traders in exchange for alcoholic liquors and edged weapons however the venusians had been willing to sell even members of their own tribes apparently there was little attachment or loyalty among them and their instincts were those of wolves and tigers the martians had come to earth mainly as traders though their services were sometimes procurable for such positions as the one held by trogh they were taciturn and aloof but they had permitted certain of their chemical and astronomical discoveries to be utilized by human beings they were a philosophical race much given to dreaming and were universally addicted to the use of a strange drug known as gnultan the juice of a martian weed this drug was more powerful than opium or hashish and gave rise to even wilder visions but its effects were physically harmless its use had spread among human beings till a law was passed forbidding its importation it was still smuggled both by martians and terrestrials in spite of all the efforts made to stop it and addiction to the drug was still fairly common among humanity by means of radio and television both of which were now employed in vastly simplified and improved forms kronous and his cousins were in hourly touch with the whole world of their time and even with the earthstations on mars venus the moon and the larger asteroids i was privileged to see in their televisors many scenes that would have appeared like the maddest visions of delirium back in we were posted on all the news of the world and with my growing mastery of the language i soon came to the point where i no longer required the interpretation of kronous to understand the announcements much of this news was not reassuring but served to confirm the prophetic fears that had been voiced by my host there were daily outbreaks on the part of venusian slaves all over the planet and in many cases much damage was inflicted before they could be subdued also these outbreaks were beginning to display a mysterious concertion and a degree of mentality of which the venusians had not hitherto been believed capable acts of sabotage as well as personal assaults were increasingly common and the sabotage in particular often showed a rational intelligence even at this early date there were those who suspected that the venusians were being aided and incited by the martians but there was no tangible proof of such abetting at the time one day from djarma there came the news of that bizarre minerals plague known as the black rot one by one the buildings in the suburbs of djarma were being attacked by this novel disease which caused their synthetic stone and metal to dissolve inch by inch in a fine black powder the rot was the work of a microorganism which must some how have been introduced from venus where its ravages had been noted in certain mountainranges its appearance on earth was a mystery but had all the air of another act of sabotage it was capable of devouring half the elements known to chemistry and offhand nothing could be discovered to arrest its progress though all the akameriaian chemists were at work on the problem kronous and i watched in the televisor the working of the black rot somehow it was inexpressibly terrifying to see the slowly spreading area of silent and utter devastation the crumbled or halfeaten buildings from which the occupants had fled the thing had started on the outskirts of djarma and was steadily devouring the city in an everbroadening arc all the bestknown scientists of akameria were summoned in conclave at djarma to study the rot and devise if possible a means of retardation kronous who was a renowned chemist and microscopist was among those called upon he offered to take me with him and of course i accepted with the utmost eagerness the trip was a matter of no more than forty miles and we made it in a light airvessel belonging to kronous a sort of monoplane run by atomic power though i had already familiarized myself with many of the scenes of djarma by television the city was a source of absorbing fascination to me it was far smaller than new york and was widely spaced with many gardens and exuberant semitropical parks meandering through its whole extent the architecture was nearly all of the same open aerial type that i had seen in kronous home the streets were broad and spacious and there were comparatively few large buildings the whole effect was one of supreme grace and beauty the streets were not overcrowded with people and no one ever seemed to be in a hurry it was strange to see the grotesque martians and bestial venusians mingling everywhere with humans of the same type as kronous the stature and build of kronous were above the average and it was rare to see a man who was taller than five feet six inches i of course with my five feet eleven was very conspicuous and attracted much attention the conclave of savants was being held in a large edifice built expressly for such meetings at the heart of djarma entering we found that about two hundred men some of whom were extremely old and venerable had already gathered in the council chamber much general discussion was going on and those who had ideas to suggest were listened to in respectful silence kronous and i took seats amid the gathering so intent were all these men on the problem to be solved that few of them even vouchsafed me a curious glance peering at the faces about me i was awed by an impression of supreme intellectuality and wisdom the garnered lore of incalculable ages also on many of these countenances i perceived the marks of a worldold ennui and the stamp of a vague sterility an incipient decadence for some time kronous and i listened to the discussion that was in progress pondering the various data brought forward i was struck by the fact that all the elements assailed by the black rot belonged at the opposite end of the scale from radium in regard to their atomic activity and explosiveness sotto voce i commented on this to kronous is it not possible i suggested that radium might be of some use in combatting the plague i believe you have told me that radium like any other element is easily manufacturable nowadays that is a striking inspiration said kronous thoughtfully and it might be worth trying with our chemical mastery we can make all the radium we need at will in our laboratories with your permission i am going to broach the idea he arose and spoke briefly amid the attentive silence of the assembly credit for the idea he announced as he ended must be given to huno paskon a young colonial from pallas whom i have brought to earth as my guest i felt myself abashed by the grave unanimous gaze of these erudite and revered savants who all eyed me in a manner that i could not fathom somehow it seemed unthinkably presumptuous to have made any suggestion in their presence however there appeared to me much serious debate going on a widespread discussion in which the proposed use of radium was manifestly meeting with great favor at last a venerable savant named argo kan who was spokesman of the assembly rose and said i vote for an immediate trial of the method suggested by kronous alkon and huno paskon others one by one stood up and cast similar verbal votes till the motion had been approved by nearly everyone present the meeting then dispersed and i learned from kronous that work was being immediately begun in local laboratories for the preparation of radium on a large scale and its utilization in the most effective form in less than an hour several chemists were ready to visit the area of destruction with portable machines in which radium was disintegrated and used as a fine spray it was magical in arresting the black rot which had been eating its way continuously into the city creeping from house to house along the crumbling pavements the whole affected area which now covered several square miles was soon surrounded by a cordon of men equipped with the radiummachines and to the vast relief of the people of djarma and akameria the plague was pronounced under control during our stay in djarma kronous and i were guests in a fine building set apart for the use of visiting scientists i was amazed at the sybaritic luxury developed by this people a luxury which though illimitably and unimaginably resourceful was at no time in excess of the bounds of good taste there were baths that would have been the envy of a roman emperor and beds that would have reduced cleopatra to beggary we were lulled by rich aerial music from no visible source and were served with food and with all other necessities as if by intangible hands at the mere verbal expression of a wish of course there was a mechanical secret to such wonders but the secret was cleverly hidden and the means never obtruded itself humbly i realized how far ahead of ourselves were these men of ad with their quiet and consummate mastery of natural laws a mastery which none of them seemed to regard as being of any great value or importance i was somewhat embarrassed by the honor paid to myself as the originator of a means of retarding the black rot and could only feel that my inspiration had been merely a fortunate accident compliments both written and verbal were showered upon me by scientific dignitaries and it was only through the intercession of kronous who explained my aversion to publicity that i was able to avoid numerous invitations finding that he had certain business to transact kronous was not ready to return to his estate for several days since he could not devote all of his time to me i formed the habit of going for long walks on the streets of djarma and through its environs walking slowly amid the changing scenes of a metropolis has always been a source of unending fascination for me and of course in this unfamiliar city of the future where all was new and different the lure of such wanderings was more than doubled and the sensations of knowing that i trod above the ruins of new york separated from my own period by years with their inconceivable historic and telluric vicissitudes was about the weirdest feeling that i had ever experienced it was a strange spectacle through which i sauntered vehicles were used of a light noiseless gliding type without visible means of propulsion and there were many airvessels which flew deftly and silently overhead and discharged their passengers on the roofs or balconies of the high buildings and the landing or departure of great shinning etherships was an hourly occurrence however it was the throng of footpassengers which engaged my attention most both sexes and all ages were attired in gaily colored costumes i was impressed by the practical absence of noise tumult and hurry all was orderly tranquil unconfused from the scarcity of women in the crowd i realized how true were the racial fears expressed by kronous the women whom i saw were seldom beautiful or attractive according to th century standards in fact there was something almost lifeless and mechanical about them almost sexless it was as if the sex had long reached the limit of its evolutionary development and was now in a state of stagnation or virtual retrogression such i learned from kronous was indeed the case but these women because of their rarity and their value to the race were shielded and protected with great care polyandry was prevalent and romantic love or even strong passion were unknown things in this latterday world a horrible homesickness came over me at times as i roamed amid this alien throng and peered into shopwindows where outlandish foodstuffs and curiously wrought fabrics from foreign planets were often displayed and the feeling would increase whenever i approached the martian quarter where dwelt a considerable colony of these mysterious outsiders some of them had transported their own manyangled and asymmetrical architecture to earth their houses defied the rules of geometry one might almost say those of gravity and the streets about them were full of exotic odors among which the stupefying reek of the drug gnultan was predominant the place allured me even though it disturbed me and i strolled often through the tortuous alleys beyond which i would reach the open country and wander among luxuriant fields and palmy woods that were no less baffling and unfamiliar than the scenes of the city one afternoon i started out later than usual as i passed through the city i noticed that there were few venusians in the throng and overheard rumours of fresh revolts however i paid little attention to these at the time twilight had overtaken me when i turned back from the open country toward the martian quarter the sylvan wilderness in which i had never met many people was quieter than usual i was following a narrow path bordered with thick shrubbery and palmettoes and i began to hurry with a vague apprehensiveness remembering the rumors i had heard heretofore i had been unafraid but now in the thickening twilight i was aware of some indefinible menace and i remembered that i had foolishly forgotten to arm myself with the electronic projector which kronous had given me to carry in my wanderings i had not seen anyone in the neighborhood but now as i went along i scrutinized the deepening shadows of the shrubbery on each side of the path suddenly i heard a sound behind me that was like the scuffling of heavy naked feet and turning saw that seven or eight venusians several of them armed with clubs were closing in upon me they must have been crouching amid the leafage as i passed their eyes gleamed like those of ravenous wolves in the twilight and they uttered low snarling animal noises as they hurled themselves upon me i avoided the viciously swinging weapons of the foremost and laid him out with a neat uppercut but the others were at me in a moment using indiscriminately their clubs and dirty talons i was aware of claws that tore my clothing and slashed my flesh and then something descended upon my head with a dull crash and i went down through reeling flame and whirling darkness to utter insensibility when i came to myself i was conscious at first only of my painracked head and limbs the crown of my head was throbbing violently from the blow i had received then i heard a mutter of thick unhuman voices and opening my eyes beheld the flamelit faces and bodies of a score of venusians who were dancing around a great fire i was lying on my back and it required only a tentative effort at movement to tell me that my hands and feet were bound another man similarly bound and perhaps dead or dying was stretched on the ground beside me i lay still deeming it inadvisable to let the venusians know that i had recovered consciousness and watched the lurid scene it was something out of dantes inferno with the red reflection that ran bloodily on the uncouth hairy limbs and hideous demoniacal features of the interplanetary slaves their movements though they had a semblance of some rude horrible rhythm were nearer to the capering of animals than they were to the dancing of even the lowest terrestrial savages and i could not help but wonder that such beings had mastered the art of lighting a fire the use of fire i was told had been unknown to them in their own world till the advent of men i remembered hearing also that they sometimes employed it nowadays in their cannibalistic revels having acquired a taste for cooked meat likewise it was rumored of late that they were not averse to human flesh and that more than one unfortunate had fallen a victim to their practices such reflections were not conducive to my peace of mind also i was oddly disturbed by a large sheet of metal grating lying near the fire and having a grotesque resemblance to a giant gridiron which was visible at intervals between the whirling figures at second glance i recognized it as a sort of perforated tray which was used in the dehydration of various fruits it was about eight feet in length by four in width suddenly i heard a whisper from the man beside me whom i had supposed unconscious they are waiting for the fire to die down he said almost inaudibly then they will broil us alive over the coals on that sheet of metal i shuddered though the information was far from novel or unexpected how did they get you i enquired in a tone as low as that of my interlocutor i am or was the owner of these slaves he answered they caught me unaware this time but i believe or hope that my family has escaped i made the mistake of thinking the slaves were thoroughly cowed from punishments that i inflicted not long ago i gather that there has been a concerted revolt this afternoon from what the savages themselves have let drop they are not so unintelligent as most people believe them to be and i have a theory that the terrestrial climate has served to stimulate their mentality they possess secret means of communication among themselves over the most unbelievable distances that are no less efficient than radio i have long suspected too that they have a tacit understanding with the martians who are covertly abetting them the microorganism that caused the black rot was no doubt smuggled from venus by the martians in their ethervessels and there is no telling what sort of plague they will loose next there are some queer and frightful things on those alien planets things that are deadly to terrestrials though harmless enough to the natives i fear that the end of human supremacy is near at hand we conversed in this fashion for some time and i learned that the name of my fellowcaptive was jos talar in spite of our dire and seemingly hopeless predicament he showed no evidence of fear and the abstract philosophical manner in which he viewed and discussed the situation was truly remarkable but this as i had occasion to observe was characteristic of the temper of mankind in that era a full half hour must have passed as we lay there bound and helpless then we saw that the huge fire was beginning to die down revealing a vast bed of glowing coals the light grew dimmer on the antic figures around it and the beastlike faces of the venusians were more loathsome than ever in the lowering gloom the dancing ceased as if at an unspoken signal and several of the dancers left the circle and came to where jos talar and myself were lying we could see the gloating of their obscene eyes and the slavering of their greedy mouths as they dug their filthy talons into our flesh and dragged us roughly toward the fire in the meanwhile others had stretched the huge metal tray upon the bed of coals all of them were eyeing us with a hyenalike avidity that made me shiver with sickness and repulsion i will not pretend that i was able to regard with any degree of complacency the prospect of becoming in the near future a venusian piиce de rйsistance but i nerved myself to the inevitable reflecting that the agony would soon be over even if they did not knock us on the head beforehand there would be a swift though terrible death on the bed of coals our captors had now seized us by our feet and shoulders as if they were about to fling us upon the improvised gridiron there was an awful moment of suspense and i wondered why the venusians did not complete the expected action then i heard from their lips a low snarling with an unmistakable note of alarm and saw that all of them were watching the starlit heavens they must have possessed keener senses than those of humanity for at first i could neither see nor hear anything to justify their attention then faroff among the stars i perceived a moving light such as was carried by the akamerian airvessels at first i did not connect the light with any idea of possible rescue and i wondered at the perturbation of the slaves then i realized that the light was flying very low and was descending straight toward the fire it drew near with meteoric rapidity till jos talar and myself and the cowering savages were illuminated by the full beams of the bluish searchlight the vessel itself like all of its kind was almost noiseless and it slid to earth and landed with preternatural speed and dexterity within twenty paces of the fire several men emerged from its dim bulk and ran toward us the slaves had loosened their hold on jos talar and myself and growling ferociously they crouched as if ready to leap upon the advancing figures the men were all armed with tubular objects which i supposed were the usual electronic projectors they levelled them at the venusians and thin rays of flame like those from acetylene torches issued from them and stabbed across the gloom several of the savages screamed with agony and fell writhing to the ground one of them dropped among the coals and howled for a few instants like a demon who has been taken in some pitfall prepared for the damned the others began to run but were followed by long slender beams that searched them out in their flight dropping several more soon the survivors had disappeared from view in the darkness and the fallen had ceased to writhe as our rescuers approached and the glow of the dying fire illumed their faces i saw that the foremost was kronous alkon some of the others i recognized as scientists whom i had met in djarma kronous alkon knelt beside me and severed my bonds with a sharp knife while someone else performed a like service for jos talar are you hurt asked kronous not severely i replied but you certainly came just in the proverbial nick of time a moment more and they would have thrown us upon the fire your coming is a miracle i cannot imagine how it happened that is easily explained said kronous as he helped me to my feet when you did not return this evening i became alarmed and knowing the usual directions of your wanderings i studied this part of the environs of djarma very closely with a nocturnal televiser which renders plainly visible the details of the darkest landscape i soon located the venusians and their fire and recognized one of the bound figures as being yourself after that it required only a few minutes for me to collect several companions arm them charter an airvessel and seek the spot indicated by the televisor i am more than thankful that we arrived in time there has been he went on a worldwide revolt of the slave during the past few hours two of the continents asia and australia are already in their hands and a desperate struggle is going on throughout akameria we are no longer using the electronic projectors which merely stun the weapons we used tonight are heatray generators which kill but come we must return to djarma i will tell you more afterwards our flight to djarma was uneventful and kronous and i were landed by our companions on the roof of the building in which we had been housed here we said goodby to jos talar who went on with the rescuing scientists to find certain relatives and to learn if possible the fate of his family kronous and i descended to our rooms where we found altuswho had just arrived from the estate he told us that oron had been killed in a terrific combat with the slaves that afternoon trogh had mysteriously disappeared and altus himself had been compelled to flee in one of the airvessels belonging to kronous a truly horrible state of affairs my bruised head and lacerated body required attention and kronous gave an application of the green ray which marvelously relieved all my pain and soreness altus miraculously had escaped injury this time in his handtohand fighting with the slaves we sat for hours while kronous told us the events of the day and while fresh reports continued to arrive the worldsituation had indeed become serious and apart from the universal revolt of the slaves many new and unlookedfor perils had disclosed themselves in the actual conflict the venusians had suffered more heavily than the terrestrials and thousands of them had been slain and others compelled to flee before the superior weapons of mankind but to counterbalance this a number of new and baffling plagues had been loosed by the savages who it was now universally felt were being assisted in this regard by the martians in the western part of akameria great clouds of a vicious and deadly martian insect had appeared an insect which multiplied with the most damnable rapidity in other sections gases had been freed in the air that were harmless to both venusians and martians but deleterious to human beings vegetable moulds from venus which fed like malignant parasites on all terrene plantforms had also been introduced in a hundred places and no one knew what else the morrow would reveal in the way of extraplanetary pests and dangers i thought of the prophecy of jos talar at this rate said kronous the world will soon be rendered unhabitable for man with our heatrays and other weapons we might wipe out the revolutionists in time but the plagues they have brought in are a different problem there was little sleep for any of us that night we rose at early dawn to learn the appalling news that the whole of europe was now subject to the interplanetary slaves the bacteria of a score of awful martian and venusian diseases to which the outsiders had developed more or less immunity were decimating the human population and those who survived were unable to cope with their conquerors similar diseases were appearing in akameria and all the other plagues were spreading with malign celerity we must go to my estate immediately and retrieve the time machine which i left in the aerodrome said kronous to me you can then return to your own age it is not fair to ask you to stay longer in a world that is nearing ultimate ruin and chaos we the last remnants of mankind will fight it out as best we can but the war is not yours i protested that i had no desire to leave him that i would remain to the end and also that i had implicit faith in the power of humanity to overcome its extraterrestrial foes kronous smiled a little sadly nevertheless he persisted we must recover the timemachine thus your means of escape will be assured no matter what happens will you go with me i intend to make the trip this very forenoon of course i could not object to this and i was eager to accompany him apart from any use which i myself might make of it the timemachine was too rare and valuable a thing to be left at the mercy of venusian vandals who might well destroy it in their campaign of nationwide sabotage kronous altus and myself made the brief trip in the same light airvessel that had been used for the journey to djarma the fertile luxuriant countryside with fronded woods and tall airy spires of embowered mansions above which we had flown less than a week before was now patched and blotched with devastation many of the houses had been gutted by fire and the ravages of the vegetable mould from venus had blighted many fields and forests whose grass and foliage rotted beneath it to a nauseous grey slime approaching the estate of kronous we saw that we should arrive none too soon the venusians had fired the house and even their own quarters and columns of smoke were arising from the doomed edifices a dozen slaves were nearing the aerodrome with the obvious intention of trying to set it on fire or of destroying or damaging the vessels which it contained the features of kronous were deadly pale with anger he said nothing as he steered the atomic monoplane directly toward the slaves who had now seen us and were running headlong in a futile effort to escape several of them had been carrying lighted torches which they now dropped we swooped upon them flying only a few feet above the ground in the open space that surrounded the aerodrome two of the slaves were caught and mangled by the sharp prow of the flier and altus and myself using heatray projectors accounted for five more as we passed them only three remained and wheeling the vessels around in a sharp curve and steering with one hand kronous himself dispatched them with his heatray we landed near the entrance of the aerodrome kronous went in and a minute later the timevessel flew gently forth and settled on the platform kronous opened the door and called to me you and i hugh will return to djarma in the timeship and altus will take charge of the monoplane no more of the venusians were in sight though we saw enough of their handiwork as we circled above the plantation before starting for djarma kronous sighed at the ruin that had been wrought but otherwise gave no evidence of emotion and maintained a stoical silence half an hour later we were back in our apartments at djarma and the timemachine was securely housed in an aerodrome nearby since it had all the appearance of a small interplanetary flier no one but ourselves ever dreamt of its real nature and use every hour brought fresh news of the national damage inflicted by the planetary aliens and their plagues the martians had now declared open hostility their first movement had been to destroy all the human embassies and tradingstations on mars and to seize a vast amount of ethershipping but before these overt actions were generally known they had also assumed the offensive everywhere on earth they possessed a frightful weapon the zeroray which could penetrate animal tissue in an instant with fatal frostbite this weapon had been kept a secret its invention and mode of operation were obscure to human scientists and it was no less lethal and effective than the heatray a battle was now going on in the martian quarter of djarma and the martians were holding their own airvessels had tried dropping explosives on the quarter but this was found to be more dangerous to humanity than to the martians for the latter were using some sort of unknown ray which detonated the explosives in midair or even while they were still on board the airvessels i was forced to marvel at the equanimity shown by the people of akameria in the face of all these dire problems and dangers everywhere scientists were coolly endeavoring to combat the new pests and were seeking to devise more efficacious weapons for use against the outsiders no fear or alarm was exhibited by anyone probably the secret of this calm impertubable attitude lay in the lofty mental evolution and philosophic detachment that had been universally attained by the human race through the past ages knowing how insecure and impermanent was their tenure of existence among the inimical forces of the cosmos men were prepared to meet their doom with resignation and dignity also the race had grown old and many perhaps were tired of the quotidian sameness of life and were ready to welcome anything no matter how hazardous in the nature of change djarma was now full of refugees from the outlying plantations and more were arriving hourly but gazing on the calm unhurried throng no one could have guessed the parlousness of the general situation there was no evidence of strife or peril or apprehension and even the war in the martian quarter was conducted silently since the weapons employed were all noiseless some of the martian buildings however had been fired by heatrays and a pall of black smoke was rising and mushrooming above the ruddy flames djarma had suffered less so far than most of the other akameriaian centers the whole country was in disorder and all communication was becoming seriously deranged however a few hours after the return of kronous altus and myself there came from southern akameria the warning of a new and more lethal plague than any which hitherto appeared a tiny venusian microorganism a sort of aerial algae which spread and increased with phenomenal celerity had been turned loose and was rendering the air unbreathable for human beings over a vast and ever growing area it was harmless to the venusians themselves for the thick vaporous air of their native jungles was full of it and though it was deleterious to the martians the latter had prepared themselves beforehand and were all equipped with respiratory masks and atmospheric alters but men were dying of slow asphyxiation marked by the most painful pneumonic symptoms wherever overtaken by the strange pest it was visible in the air which displayed a saffron color when invaded by the organism for this reason it soon became known as the yellow death beyond the manufacture and distribution of airmasks on a large scale nothing could be done by savants to combat the new plague the saffron cloud was rolling northward hour by hour a noiseless and irresistible doom and the situation was indeed desperate a conclave of scientists was called and it was soon decided that humanity must evacuate the regions menaced by the deadly aerial scourge the only resource was for men to retreat toward the arctic circle and entrench themselves in dominions where the organism could not penetrate since it thrived only in warm tropical air this said kronous to me sorrowfully is a preparatory step toward our final abandonment of the earth the planetary aliens have conquered as i knew they would the cycle of human domination has completed itself and the future belongs to the venusians and martians i venture to predict however that the martians will soon enslave the venusians and rule them with a far stricter hand than we humans he went on hugh the hour of our parting will soon arrive you could leave us at any rate as you know but perhaps you will wish to see the drama to its end i pressed his hand but could say nothing there was a tragic pathos in the swift doom which threatened the final remnant of the race remote and alien as these people were in many of their customs and ideas and feelings they were still human i admired their stoical courage in the face of irretrievable disaster and for kronous himself after our long association and mutual vicissitudes i had conceived a real affection all of djarma was now astir with preparations for the northward flight every airvessel or spacecraft available was mustered for use and more were being built with miraculous expedition there were great airliners and freighters in which personal belongings foodsupplies and laboratory equipment were transported and the skies were thronged with their departure and their return for new cargoes perfect order and organization prevailed and there was no trace of hurry or confusion anywhere kronous altus and myself were among the last to leave an immense bank of smoke was looming above the martian quarter and the weird hydrocephalous inhabitants were being driven forth by the flames and were invading the deserted streets of the human section when we rose above the city in the timevessel and steered northward far to the south we could see a saffron cloud that had covered the horizon the microorganic plague that was smothering the whole of akameria beneath the guidance of kronous our vessel rose to a lofty elevation where more than the ordinary atmospheric speed was possible flying at seven hundred miles per hour we soon neared the realms of perpetual winter and saw the sheeted ice of the polar regions glittering far below us here humanity had already entrenched itself and whole cities were being reared as if by magic amid the eternal wastes of snow laboratories and foundries were erected where synthetic foods and fabrics and metals were prepared in immense quantities the polar domains however were too inhospitable and the climate too rigorous for a warmthloving race to form more than a waystation in the flight of humanity it was decided that the larger asteroids which had long been successfully colonized by man would form the most suitable cosmic refuge a great fleet of spacevessels was soon assembled in readiness for departure more were built amid the ice and snow and each day was marked by the arrival of ships from midether plying among the planets which had been warned by radio of existing terrestrial conditions and had come to assist in the universal hegira in those days before the ultimate farewell i came to know kronous better than at any previous time his altruism and imperturbable fortitude aroused my deepest admiration of course he had cast in his lot with the people of his own era and official posts on one of the etherliners had already been assigned to altus and himself those who displayed any interest in the matter were informed by kronous that i huno paskon intended to return alone in a small ethervessel to pallas my supposedly natal asteroid even between ourselves we seldom mentioned the real nature of my journey kronous gave me careful instruction regarding the mechanism both spatial and chronological of the timemachine but to avoid any error he himself arranged all the controls in preparation for my flight through backward time all that i would have to do was to turn on the power of the cosmic rays and the machine would land me in then after it landed an automatic device would shoot it back to his own day the day of departure came when vessels were ready for the intercosmic transportation of the worlds remaining people it was an awful and solemn moment ship by ship and fleet by fleet from the icefounded platforms on which they had been resting the long bulks of glittering metal upon the aurora borealis and disappeared in the chill dreadful gulfs of outer space the ship to which kronous had been assigned was one of the last to leave and he and i stood for a long while beside the timevessel and watched the soaring of those skyward flocks altus had already said a farewell to me and had gone aboard the great etherliner for me the hour was full of infinite sorrow and a strange excitement in the realization that man was abandoning his immemorial home and would henceforward be an exile among the worlds but the face of kronous was a marble mask and i could not surmise his thoughts and feelings at last he turned to me and smiled with an odd wistfulness it is time for me to go and time for you also he said good by hugh we shall not meet again remember me sometimes and remember the final fate of the human race when you are back in your own epoch he pressed my hand briefly and then climbed aboard the spaceliner and he and altus waved to me through the thick crystal of a sealed port as the huge vessel rose in air for its flight upon the interplanetary void sadly regretting almost that i had not insisted upon accompanying them i locked myself in the timevessel and pulled the lever which would begin my own flight across the ages an offering to the moon clark ashton smith i believe announced morley that the roofless temples of mu were not all devoted to solar worship but that many of them were consecrated to the moon and iam sure that the one we have now discovered proves my point these hieroglyphics are lunar symbols beyond a doubt thorway his fellowarchaelogist looked at morley with a surprise not altogether due to the boldly authoritative pronouncement he was struck anew by the singularity of morleys tones and expression the dreamy beardless olive featutes that seemed to repeat some aboriginal aryan type were transfigured by a look of ecstatic absorption thorway himself was not incapable of enthusiasm when the occasion seemed to warrant it but this wellnigh religious ardor was beyond his comprehension he wondered if his companions mentality were not a trifle eccentric however he mumbled a rejoinder that was deferential even though noncommittal morley had not only financed the expedition but had been paying a liberal stipend to thorway for more than two years so thorway could afford to be respectful even though he was a little tired of his employers odd and unauthorized notions and the interminable series of sojourns they had made on melagesian isles from the monstrous and primordial stone images of easter island to the truncated pyramidal columns of the ladrones they had visited all the farstrewn remains which are held to prove the former existence of a great continent in the midpacific now on one of the lesser marquesas hitherto unexplored they had located the massive walls of a large templelike edifice as usual it had been difficult to find for such places were universally feared and shunned by the natives who believed them haunted by the immemorial dead and could not be hired to visit them or even to reveal their whereabouts it was morley who had stumbled upon the place almost as if he were led by a subconscious instinct truly they had made a significant discovery as even thorway was compelled to admit except for a few of the colossal topmost stones which had fallen or splintered away the walls were in wellnigh perfect preservation the place was surrounded by a tangle of palms and jackfruit and various tropical shrubs but somehow none of them had taken root within the walls portions of a paved floor were still extant amid centurial heaps of rubble in the center was a huge square block rising four feet above the groundlevel which might well have served as an altar it was carved with rude symbols which appeared to represent the moon in all its digits and was curiously grooved across the top from the middle to one side with a trough that became deeper toward the edge like all other buildings of the sort it was plain that the temple had never supported a roof yes the symbols are undoubtedly lunar admitted thorway also morley went on i believe that rites of human sacrifice were performed in these temples oblations of blood were poured not only to the sun but to the moon the idea is maintainable of course rejoined thorway human sacrifice was pretty widespread at a certain stage of evolution it may well have been practiced by the people who built this edifice morley did not perceive the dryness and formality of his confreres assent he was preoccupied with feelings and ideas some of which could hardly have been the natural result of his investigations even as in visiting many others of the ancient remains he had been troubled by a nervous agitation which was a compound of irresoluble awe and terror of nameless eager fascination and expectancy here among these mighty walls the feeling became stronger than it had been anywhere else and it mounted to a pitch that was veritably distracting and akin to the disturbed awareness that ushers in the illusions of delirium his idea that the temple was a place of lunar worship had seized him almost with the authority of an actual recollection rather than a closely reasoned inference also he was troubled by sensory impressions that bordered upon the hallucinative though the day was tropically warm he was conscious of a strange chill that emanated from the walls a chill as of bygone cycles and it seemed to him that the narrow shadows wrought by a meridian sum were peopled with unseen faces more than once he was prompted to rub his eyes for ghostly films of color like flashes of yellow and purple garments came and went in the most infinitesimal fraction of time though the air was utterly still he had the sense of perpetual movement all around him of the passing to and fro of intangible throngs it was many thousand years in all likelihood since human feet had trodden these pavements but morley could have cried aloud with the imminence of the longdead ages it appeared to him in a brief glimpse that his whole life as well as his journeyings and explorations in the south seas had been but a devious return to some earlier state of being and that the resumption of this state was now at hand all this however continued to perplex him mightily it was as if he had suffered the intrusion of an alien entity he heard himself speaking to thorway and the words were unfamiliar and remote as if they had issued from the lips of another they were a joyous and a childlike race those people of mu he was saying but not altogether joyous not wholly childlike there was a dark side and a dark worship the cult of death and night personified by the moon whose white implacable frozen lips were appeased only by the warm blood that flowed upon her altars they caught the blood in goblets as it ran from the stone grooves they raised it aloft and the goblets were swiftly drained in midair by the remote goddess as if the sacrifice had proven acceptable but how do you know all this thorway was quite amazed no less by his companions air than by the actual words morley he thought was less like a modern everyday american than ever he remembered inconsequently how all the natives of the various island groups had taken to morley with an odd friendliness without the reserve and suspicion often accorded to other white men they had even warned morley against the guardian spirits of the ruins and they did not always trouble to warn others it was almost as if they regarded him as being in some manner akin to themselves thorway wondered though he was essentially unimaginative i tell you i know morley said as he walked up and down beside the altar i have seen his voice trailed off in a frozen whisper and he seemed to stiffen in every limb and stood still as with some momentary catelepsy his face grew deadly pale his eyes were set and staring then from between rigid lips he uttered the strange words rhalu muvasa than in a monotonous hieratic tone like a sort of invocation morley could not have told what it was that he felt and saw in that moment he was no longer his known and wonted self and the man beside him was an unheeded stranger but he could remember nothing afterwards not even the odd vocals he had uttered whatever his mental experience may have been it was like a dream that fades instantly when one awakens the moment passed the extreme rigidity left his limbs and features and he resumed his interrupted pacing his confrere was staring at him in astonishment not unmingled with solicitude are you ill the sun is pretty hot today and one should be careful perhaps we had best return to the schooner morley gave a mechanical assent and followed thorway from the ruins towards the seashore where the schooner they had used in their voyaging was anchored in a little harbor less than a mile distant his mind was full of confusion and darkness he no longer felt the queer emotions that had seized him beside the altar nor could he recall them otherwise than dimly all the while he was trying to recollect something which lay just below the rim of memory something very momentous which he had forgotten long long ago lying in a cane couch beneath an awning on the schooners deck morley drifted back to his normal plane of consciousness he was not unwilling to accept thorways suggestion that he had suffered a touch of sun among the ruins his ghostly sensations the deliriumlike approach to a state of awareness which had no relation to his daily life were now unlikely and unreal in an effort to dismiss them altogether he went over in his mind the whole of the investigative tour be had undertaken and the events of the years preceding it he remembered his youthful luctations against poverty his desire for that wealth and leisure which alone makes possible the pursuit of every chimera and his slow but accelerative progress when once he had acquired a modicum of capital and had gone into business for himself as an importer of oriental rugs then he recalled the chance inception of his archaeological enthusiasm the reading of an illustrated article which described the ancient remains on easter island the insoluble strangeness of these littleknown relics had thrilled him profoundly though he knew not why and he had resolved to visit them some day the theory of a lost continent in the pacific appealed to him with an almost intimate lure and imaginative charm it became his own particular chimera though he could not have traced to their psychal origin the feelings behind his interest he read everything procurable on the subject and as soon as his leisure permitted he made a trip to easter island a year later he was able to leave his business indefinitely in the hands of an efficient manager he hired thorway a professional archaeologist with much experience in italy and asia minor to accompany him and purchasing an old schooner manned by a swedish crew and captain he had set out on his long devious voyage among the islands going over all this in his thoughts morley decided that it was now time to return home he had learned all that was verifiable regarding the mysterious ruins the study had fascinated him as nothing else in his life had ever done but for some reason his health was beginning to suffer perhaps he had thrown himself too assiduously into his labors the ruins had absorbed him too deeply he must get away from them must not risk a renewal of the queer delusory sensations he had experienced he recalled the superstitions of the natives and wondered if there were something in them after all if unwholesome influences were attached to those primeval stones did ghosts return or linger from a world that had been buried beneath the waves for unknown ages damn it he had almost felt at times as if he were some sort of revenant himself he called to thorway who was standing beside the rail in conversation with one of the norse sailors i think we have done enough for one voyage thorway he said we will lift anchor in the morning and return to san francisco thorway made little effort to conceal his relief he did not consider the polynesian isles a very fruitful field for research the ruins were too old and fragmentary the period to which they belonged was too conjectural and did not deeply engage his interest i agree he rejoined also if you will pardon me for saying it i dont think the south sea climate is one of ideal salubriousness ive noticed occasionally indispositions on your part for some time past morley nodded in a weary acquiescence it would have been impossible to tell thorway his actual thoughts and emotions the man was abysmally unimaginative he only hoped that thorway did not think him a little mad though after all it was quite immaterial the day wore on and the swift purpureal darkness of eventide was curtailed by the rising of a full moon which inundated sea and land with warm ethereous quicksilver at dinner morley was lost in a taciturn abstraction and thorway was discreetly voluble but made no reference to the late archaeological find svensen the captain who ate with them maintained a monosyllabic reticence even when he was told of the proposed return to san francisco after eating morley excused himself and went back to the cane couch somewhat to his relief he was not joined by thorway moonlight had always aroused in morley a vague but profound emotion even as the ruins had done it stirred among the shadows of his mind a million ghostly intimations and the thrill he felt was at times not unalloyed with a cryptic awe and trepidation akin perhaps to the primal fear of darkness itself now as he gazed at the tropic plenilune he conceived the sudden and obsessing idea that the orb was somehow larger and its light more brilliant than usual even as they might have been in ages when the moon and earth were much younger then he was possessed by a troublous doubt by an inenarrable sense of dislocation and a dreamlike vagueness which attached itself to the world about him a wave of terror surged upon him and he felt that he was slipping irretrievably away from all familiar things then the terror ebbed far that which he had lost was far off and incredible and a world of circumstances longforgot was assuming or resuming the tinge of familiarity what he wondered was he doing on this queer ship it was the night of the sacrifice to rhalu the selenic goddess and he matla was to play an essential part in the ceremony he must reach the temple ere the moon had mounted to her zenith above the starstone and it now lacked only an hour of the appointed time he rose and peered about with questioning eyes the deck was deserted for it was unnecessary to keep watch in that tranquil harbor svensen and the mate were doubtless drinking themselves to sleep as usual the sailors were playing their eternal whist and pedro and thorway was in his cabin probably writing a nolesseternal monograph on etruscan tombs it was only in the most remote and exiguous manner that morley recollected their existence somehow he managed to recall that there was a boat which he and thorway had used in their visits to the isle and that this boat was moored to the schooners side with a tread as lithe and supple as that of a native he was over the rail and was rowing silently shoreward a hundred yards or little more and then he stood on the moonwashed sand now he was climbing the palmclustered hill above the shore and was heading toward the temple the air was suffused with a primal brooding warmth with the scent of colossal flowers and ferns not known to modern botanists he could see them towering beside his way with their thick archaic fronds and petals though such things have not lifted to the moon for aeons and mounting the crest of the hill which had dominated the little isle and had looked down to the sea on two sides he saw in the mellow light the far unbounded reaches of a softly rolling plain and sealess horizons everywhere that glowed with the golden fires of cities and he knew the names of these cities and recalled the opulent life of mu whose prosperity had of late years been menaced by atlantean earthquakes and volcanic upheavals these it was believed were owing to the wrath of rhalu the goddess who controlled the planetary forces and human blood was being poured in all her fanes to placate the mysterious deity morley could have remembered a million things he could have called to mind the simple but strange events of his entire preexistence in mu and the lore and history of the farflung continent but there was little room in his consciousness for anything but the destined drama of the night long ago how long he was not sure he had been chosen among his people for an awful honor but his heart had failed him ere the time ordained and he had fled tonight however he would not flee a solemn religious rapture not untinged with fear guided his steps toward the temple of the goddess as he went on he noticed his raiment and was puzzled why was he wearing these ugly and unseemly garments he began to remove them and to cast them aside one by one nakedness was ordained by sacerdotal law for the role he was to play he heard the softvowelled murmur of voices about him and saw the multicolored robes or gleaming amber flesh of forms that flitted among the archaic plants the priests and worshippers were also on their way to the temple his excitement rose it became more mystical and more rhapsodic as he neared his destination his being was flooded by the superstitious awe of ancient man by the dreadful reverence due to the unknown powers of nature he peered with a solemn trepidation at the moon as it rose higher in the heavens and saw in its rounded orb the features of a divinity both benign and malevolent now he beheld the temple looming whitely above the tops of titan fronds the walls were no longer ruinous their fallen blocks were wholly restored his visit to the place with thorway was dim as a fever fantasy but other visits during his life as matla and ceremonials of the priests of rhalu which he had once beheld were clear and immediate in his memory he knew the faces he would see and the ritual wherein he would participate he thought mostly in pictures but the words of a strange vocabulary were ready for his recollection and phrases drifted through his mind with unconscious ease phrases that would have seemed untelligible gibberish an hour before matla was aware of the concentrated gaze of several hundred eyes as he entered the great roofless fane the place was thronged with people whose round features were of a prearyan type and many of the faces were familiar to him but at that moment all of them were parcel of a mystic horror and were awesome and obscure as the night nothing was clear before him save an opening in the throng which led to the altarstone around which the priests of rhalu were gathered and wherein rhalu herself looked down in relentless icy splendor from an almost vertical elevation he went forward with firm steps the priests who were clad in lunar purple and yellow received him in an impassive silence counting them he found that there were only six instead of the usual seven one there was among them who carried a large shallow goblet of silver but the seventh whose hand would lift the long and curving knife of some copperish metal had not yet arrived thorway had found it curiously hard to apply himself to the halfwritten monograph on etruscan tombs an obscure and exasperating restlessness finally impelled him to abandon his wooing of the reluctant muse of archaeology in a state of steadily mounting irritation wishing that the bothersome and unprofitable voyage were over he went on deck the moonlight dazzled him with its preternatural brilliance and he did not perceive for a few moments that the cane couch was empty when he saw that morley was gone he experienced a peculiar mixture of alarm and irritation he felt sure that morley had not returned to his cabin stepping to the schooners shoreward side he noted with little surprise the absence of the moored boat morley must have gone ashore for a moonlight visit to the ruined temple and thorway frowned heavily at this new presumptive evidence of his employers eccentricity and aberration an unwonted of responsibility deep and solemn stirred him he seemed to hear an inward injunction a halffamiliar voice bidding him to take care of morley this unhealthy and exorbitant interest in a more than problematic past should be discouraged or at least supervised very quickly he made up his mind as to what he should do going below he called two of the swedish sailors from their game of pedro and had them row him ashore in the ships dinghy as they neared the beach the boat used by morley was plainly visible in the plumy shadow of a clump of seawardleaning palms thorway without offering any explanation of his purpose in going ashore told the sailors to return to the ship then following the wellworn trail toward the temple he mounted the islandslope step by step as he went on he became aware of a strange difference in the vegetation what were these monstrous ferns and prinordiallooking flowers about him surely it was some weird trick of the moonlight distorting the familiar palms and shrubs he had seen nothing of the sort in his daytime visits and such forms were impossible anyway then by degrees he was beset with terrible doubt and bewilderment there came to him the ineffably horrifying sensation of passing beyond his proper self beyond all that he knew as legitimate and verifiable fantastic unspeakable thoughts alien abnormal imphlses thronged upon him from the sorcerous glare of the effulgent moon he shuddered at repellent but insistent memories that were not his own at the ghastly compulsion of an unbelievable command what on earth was possessing him was he going mad like morley the moonbright isle was like some bottomless abyss of nightmare fantasy into which he sank with nightmare terror he sought to recover his hard materialistic sanity his belief in the safe literality of things then suddenly and without surprise he was no longer thorway he knew the real purpose for which he had come ashore the solemn rite in which he was to play an awful but necessary part the ordained hour was near the worshippers the sacrifice and the six fellowpriests awaited his coming in the immemorial fane of rhalu unassisted by any of the priests matla had stretched himself on the cold altar how long he lay there waiting he could not tell but at last by the rustling stir and murmur of the throng he knew that the seventh priest had arrived all fear had left him as if he were already beyond the pain and suffering of earth but he knew with a precision wellnigh real as physical sight and sensation the use which would be made of the copperish knife and the silver goblet he lay gazing at the wan heavens and saw dimly with farfocused eyes the leaning face of the seventh priest the face was doubly familiar but he had forgotten something he did not try to remember already it seemed to him that the white moon was drawing nearer was stooping from her celestial station to quaff the awaited sacrifice her light blinded him with unearthly fulgor but he saw dimly the flash of the falling knife ere it entered his heart there was an instant of tearing pain that plunged on and on through his body as if its tissues were a deep abyss then a sudden darkness took the heavens and blotted out the face of rhalu and all things even pain were erased for matla by the black mist of an eternal nothing in the morning svensen and his sailors waited very patiently for the return of morley and thorway from the island when afternoon came and the two were still absent svensen decided that it was time to investigate he had received orders to lift anchor for san francisco that day but he could not very well depart without thorway and morley with one of the crew he rowed ashore and climbed the hill to the ruins the roofless temple was empty save for the plants that had taken root in the crevices of its pavement svensen and the sailor looking about for the archaeologists were horrified from their stolidity by the stains of newly dried blood that lined the great groove in the altarblock to its edge they summoned the remainder of the crew a daylong search of the little island however was without result the natives knew nothing of the whereabouts of morley and thorway and were queerly reticent even in avowing their ignorance there was no place where the two men could have hidden themselves granting that they had any reason for a procedure so peculiar svensen and his men gave it up if they had been imaginative it might have seemed to them that the archaeologists had vanished bodily into the past demon of the flower clark ashton smith not as the plants and flowers of earth growing peacefully beneath a simple sun were the blossoms of the planet lophai coiling and uncoiling in double dawns tossing tumultuously under vast suns of jade green and balasruby orange swaying and weltering in rich twilights in auroracurtained nights they resembled fields of rooted servants that dance eternally to an otherworldly music many were small and furtive and crept viperwise on the ground others were tall as pythons rearing superbly in hieratic postures to the jeweled light some grew with single or dual stems that burgeoned forth into hydra heads and some were frilled and festooned with leaves that suggested the wings of flying lizards the pennants of faery lances the phylacteries of a strange sacerdotalism some appeared to bear the scarlet wattles of dragons others were tongued as if with black flames or the colored vapors that issue with weird writhings from out barbaric censers and others still were armed with fleshy nets or tendrils or with huge blossoms like bucklers perforated in battle and all were equipped with venomous darts and fangs all were alive restless and sentient they were the lords of lophai and all other life existed by their sufferance the people of the world had been their inferiors from unrecorded cycles and even in the most primitive myths there was no suggestion that any other order of things had ever prevailed and the plants themselves together with the fauna and mankind of lophai gave immemorial obeisance to that supreme and terrible flower known as the voorqual in which a tutelary demon more ancient than the twin suns was believed to have made its immortal avatar the voorqual was served by a human priesthood chosen from amid the royalty and aristocracy of lophai in the heart of the chief city lospar in an equatorial realm it had grown from antiquity on the summit of a high pyramid of sable terraces that loomed over the town like the hanging gardens of some greater babylon crowded with the lesser but deadly floral forms at the center of the broad apex the voorqual stood alone in a basin level with the surrounding platform of black mineral the basin was filled with a compost in which the dust of royal mummies formed an essential ingredient the demon flower sprang from a bulb so encrusted with the growth of ages that it resembled a stone urn above this there rose the gnarled and mighty stalk that had displayed in earlier times the bifurcation of a mandrake but whose halves had now grown together into a scaly furrowed thing like the tail of some mythic seamonster the stalk was variegated with hues of greening bronze of antique copper with the livid blues and purples of fleshly corruption it ended in a crown of stiff blackish leaves banded and spotted with poisonous metallic white and edged with sharp serrations as of savage weapons from below the crown issued a long sinuous arm scaled like the main stem and serpentining downward and outward to terminate in the huge upright bowl of a bizarre blossom as if the arm in sardonic fashion should hold out a hellish beggars cup abhorrent and monstrous was the bowl which like the leaves was legended to renew itself at intervals of a thousand years it smouldered with sullen ruby at the base it lightened into zones of dragons blood into belts of the rose of infernal sunset on the full swelling sides and it flamed at the rim to a hot yellowish nacarat red like the ichor of salamanders to one who dared peer within the cup was lined with sepulchral violet blackening toward the bottom pitted with myriad pores and streaked with turgescent veins of sulphurous green swaying in a slow lethal hypnotic rhythm with a deep and solemn sibilation the voorqual dominated the city of lospar and the world lophai below on the tiers of the pyramid the thronged ophidian plants kept time to this rhythm in their tossing and hissing and far beyond lospar to the poles of the planet and in all its longitudes the living blossoms obeyed the sovereign tempo of the voorqual boundless was the power exercised by this being over the people who for want of a better name i have called the humankind of lophai myriad and frightful were the legends that had gathered through aeons about the voorqual and dire was the sacrifice demanded each year at the summer solstice by the demon the filling of its proffered cup with the lifeblood of a priest or priestess chosen from amid the assembled hierophants who passed before the voorqual till the poised cup inverted and empty descended like a devils miter on the head of one of their number lunithi king of the realms about lospar and highpriest of the voorqual was the last if not the first of his race to rebel against this singular tyranny there were dim myths of some primordial ruler who had dared to refuse the required sacrifice and whose people in consequence had been decimated by a mortal war with the serpentine plants which obeying the angry demon had uprooted themselves everywhere from the soil and had marched on the cities of lophai slaying or vampirizing all who fell in their way lunithi from childhood had obeyed implicitly and without question the will of the floral overlord had offered the stated worship had performed the necessary rites to withhold them would have beem blasphemy he had not dreamt of rebellion till at the time of the annual choosing of the victim and thirty suns before the date of his nuptials with nala priestess of the voorqual he saw the hesitant inverted grail come down in deathly crimson on the fair head of his betrothed a sorrowful consternation a dark sullen dismay which he sought to smother in his heart was experienced by lunithi nala dazed and resigned in a mystic inertia of despair accepted her doom without question but a blasphemous doubt formed itself surreptitiously in the mind of the king trembling at his own impiety he asked himself if there was not some way in which he could save nala could cheat the demon of its ghastly tribute to do this and escape with impunity to himself and his subjects he knew that he must strike at the very life of the monster which was believed to be deathless and invulnerable it seemed impious even to wonder concerning the truth of this belief which had long assumed the force of a religious tenet and was held unanimously amid such reflections lunithi remembered an old myth about the existence of a neutral and independent being known as the occlith a demon coeval with the voorqual and allied neither to man nor the flower creatures this being was said to dwell beyond the desert of aphom in the otherwise unpeopled mountains of white stone above the habitat of the ophidian blossoms in latter days no man had seen the occlith for the journey through ayhom was not lightly to be undertaken but this entity was supposed to be immortal and it kept apart and alone meditating upon all things but interfering never with their processes however it was said to have given in earlier times valuable advice to a certain king who had gone forth from lospar to its lair among the white crags in his grief and desperation lunithi resolved to seek the occlith and question it anent the possibility of slaying the voorqual if by any mortal means the demon could be destroyed he would remove from lophai the longestablished tyranny whose shadow fell upon all things from the sable pyramid it was necessary for him to proceed with utmost caution to confide in no one to veil his very thoughts at all times from the occult scrutiny of the voorqual in the interim of five days between the choosing of the victim and the consummation of the sacrifice he must carry out his mad plan unattended and disguised as a simple hunter of beasts he left his palace during the short threehour night of universal slumber and stole forth toward the desert of aphom in the dawn of the balasruby sun he had reached the pathless waste and was toiling painfully over its knifesharp ridges of dark stone like the waves of a mounting ocean petrified in storm soon the rays of the green sun were added to those of the other and aphom became a painted inferno through which lunithi dragged his way crawling from scarp to glassy scarp or resting at whiles in the colored shadows there was no water anywhere but swift mirages gleamed and faded and the sifting sand appeared to run like rills in the bottom of deep valleys at setting of the first sun he came within sight of the pale mountains beyond aphom towering like cliffs of frozen foam above the deserts dark sea they were tinged with transient lights of azure of jade and orange in the going of the yellowred orb and the westward slanting of its binary then the lights melted into beryl and tourmaline and the green sun was regnant over all till it too went down leaving a twilight whose colors were those of seawater in the gloom lunithi reached the foot of the pale crags and there exhausted he slept till the second dawn rising he began his escalade of the white mountains they rose bleak and terrible before him against the hidden suns with cliffs that were like the sheer terraces of gods like the king who had preceded him in the ancient myth he found a precarious way that led upward through narrow broken chasms at last he came to the vaster fissure riving the heart of the white range by which it was alone possible to reach the legendary lair of the occlith the chasms beetling walls rose higher and higher above him shutting out the suns but creating with their whiteness a wan and deathly glimmer to illumine his way the fissure was such as might have been cloven by the sword of a macrocosmic giant it led downward steepening ever like a wound that pierced to the heart of lophai lunithi like all of his race was able to exist for prolonged periods without other nutriment than sunlight and water he had brought with him a metal flask filled with the aqueous elenent of lophai from which he drank sparingly as he descended the chasm for the white mountains were waterless and he feared to touch the pools and streams of unknown fluids upon which he came at intervals in the dusk there were sanguinecolored springs that fumed and bubbled before him to vanish in fathomless rifts and brooklets of mercurial metal green blue or amber that wound beside him like liquescent serpents and then slipped away into dark caverns acrid vapors rose from clefts in the chasm and lunithi felt himself among strange chemistries of nature in this fantastic world of stone which the plants of lophai could never invade he seemed to have gone beyond the voorquals grim diabolic tyranny at last he came to a clear watery pool occupying almost the entire width of the chasm in passing it he was forced to scramble along a narrow insecure ledge at one side a fragment of the marble stone breaking away beneath his footfall dropped into the pool as he gained the opposite edge and the hueless liquid foamed and hissed like a thousand vipers wondering as to its properties and fearful of the venomous hissing which did not subside for some time lunithi hurried on and came after an interval to the fissures end here he emerged in the huge craterlike pit that was the home of the occlith fluted and columned walls went up to a stupendous height on all sides and the sun of orange ruby now at zenith was pouring down a vertical cataract of gorgeous fires and shadows addorsed against the further wall of the pit in an upright posture he beheld that being known as the occlith which had the likeness of a high cruciform pillar of blue mineral shining with its own esoteric luster going forward he prostrated himself before the pillar and then in accents that quavered with a deep awe he ventured to ask the desired oracle for awhile the occlith maintained its aeonold silence peering timidly the king perceived the twin lights of mystic silver that brightened and faded with a slow rhythmic pulsation in the arms of the blue cross then from the lofty shining thing there issued a voice that was like the tinkling of mineral fragments tightly clashed together but which somehow shaped itself into articulate words it is possible said the occlith to slay the plant known as the voorqual in which an elder demon has its habitation though the flower has attained millennial age it is not necessarily immortal for all things have their proper term of existence and decay and nothing has been created without its corresponding agency of death i do not advise you to slay the plant but i can furnish you with the information which you desire in the mountain chasm through which you came to seek me there flows a hueless spring of mineral poison deadly to all the ophidian plantlife of this world the occlith went on and told lunithi the method by which the poison should be prepared and administered the chill toneless tinkling voice concluded i have answered your question if there is anything more that you wish to learn it would be well to ask me now prostrating himself again lunithi gave thanks to the occlith and considering that he had learned all that was requisite he did not avail himself of the opportunity to question further the strange entity of living stone and the occlith cryptic and aloof in its termless impenetrable meditation apparently saw fit to vouchsafe nothing more except in answer to a direct query withdrawing from the marblewalled abyss lunithi returned in haste along the chasm till reaching the pool of which the occlith had spoken he paused to empty his waterflask and fill it with the angry hissing liquid then he resumed his homeward journey at the end of two days after incredible fatigues and torments in the blazing hell of aphom he reached lospar in the time of darkness and slumber as when he had departed since his absence had been unannounced it was supposed that he had retired to the underground adyta below the pyramid of the voorqual for purposes of prolonged meditation as was sometimes his wont in alternate hope and trepidation dreading the miscarriage of his plan and shrinking still from its audacious impiety lunithi awaited the night preceding that double dawn of summer solstice when in a secret room of the black pyramid the monstrous offering was to be made ready nala would be slain by a fellowpriest or priestess chosen by lot and her lifeblood would drip from the channeled altar into a great cup and the cup would then be borne with solemn rites to the voorqual and its contents poured into the evilly supplicative bowl of the sanguinated blossom he saw little of nala during that interim she was more withdrawn than ever and seemed to have consecrated herself wholly to the coming doom to no one and least of all to his beloved did lunithi dare to hint a posssible prevention of the sacrifice there came the dreaded eve with a swiftly changing twilight of jeweled hues that turned to a darkness hung with auroral flame lunithi stole across the sleeping city and entered the pyramid whose blackness towered massively amid the frail architecture of buildings that were little more than canopies and lattices of stone with infinite care and caution he made the preparations prescribed by the occlith into the huge sacrificial cup of black metal in a room lit with stored sunlight he emptied the seething sibilant poison he had brought with him from the white mountains then opening adroitly a vein in one of his arms he added a certain amount of his own lifefluid to the lethal potion above whose foaming crystal it floated like a magic oil without mingling so that the entire cup to all appearance was filled with the liquid most acceptable to the satanic blossom bearing in his hands the black grail lunithi ascended a hewn stairway that led to the voorquals presence his heart quailing his senses swooning in chill gulfs of terror he emerged on the lofty summit above the shadowy town in a luminous azure gloom against the weird and iridescent streamers of light that foreran the double dawn he saw the dreamy swaying of the monstrous plant and heard its somnolent hissing that was answered drowsily by myriad blossoms on the tiers below a nightmare oppression black and tangible seemed to flow from the pyramid and to lie in stagnant shadow on all the lands of lophai aghast at his own temerity and deeming that his shrouded thoughts would surely be understood as he drew nearer or that the voorqual would be suspicious of an offering brought before the accustomed hour lunithi made obeisance to his floral suzerain the voorqual vouchsafed no sign that it had deigned to perceive his presence but the great flowercup with its flaring crimsons dulled to garnet and purple in the twilight was held forward as if in readiness to receive the hideous gift breathless and fainting with religious fear in a moment of suspense that seemed eternal lunithi poured the bloodmantled poison into the cup the venom boiled and hissed like a wizards brew as the thirsty flower drank it up and lunithi saw the scaled arm draw back tilting its demon grail quickly as if to repudiate the doubtful draught it was too late for the poison had been absorbed by the blossoms porous lining the tilting motion changed in midair to an agonized writhing of the reptilian arm and then the voorquals huge scaly stalk and pointed leafcrown began to toss in a deathly dance waving darkly against the auroral curtains of morn its deep hissing sharpened to an insupportable note fraught with the pain of a dying devil and looking down from the platform edge on which he crouched to avoid the swaying growth lunithi saw that the lesser plants on the terraces were now tossing in a mad unison with their master like noises in an ill dream he heard the chorus of their tortured sibilations he dared not look again at the voorqual till he became aware of a strange silence and saw that the blossoms below had ceased to writhe and were drooping limply on their stems then incredulous he knew that the voorqual was dead turning in triumph mingled with horror he beheld the flaccid stalk that had fallen prone on its bed of unholy compost he saw the sudden withering of the stiff sworded leaves of the gross and hellish cup even the stony bulb appeared to collapse and crumble before his eyes the entire stem its evil colors fading swiftly shrank and fell in upon itself like a sere empty serpentskin at the same time in some obscure manner lunithi was still aware of a presence that brooded above the pyramid even in the death of the voorqual it seemed to him that he was not alone then as he stood and waited fearing he knew not what he felt the passing of a cold and unseen thing in the gloom a thing that flowed across his body like the thick coils of some enormous python without sound in dark clammy undulations a moment more and it was gone and lunithi no longer felt the brooding presence he turned to go but it seemed that the dying night was full of an unconceived terror that gathered before him as he went down the long somber stairs slowly he descended a weird despair was upon him he had slain the voorqual had seen it wither in death yet he could not believe the thing he had done the lifting of the ancient doom was still no more than an idle myth the twilight brightened as he passed through the slumbering city according to custom no one would be abroad for another hour then the priests of the voorqual would gather for the annual bloodoffering midway between the pyramid and his own palace lunithi was more than startled to meet the maiden nala pale and ghostly she glided by him with a swift and swaying movement almost serpentine which differed oddly from her habitual languor lunithi dared not accost her when he saw her shut unheeding eyes like those of a somnambulist and he was awed and troubled by the strange ease the unnatural surety of her motion which reminded him of something which he feared to remember in a turmoil of fantastic doubt and apprehension he followed her threading the exotic maze of lospar with the fleet and sinuous glide of a homing serpent nala entered the sacred pyramid lunithi less swift than she had fallen behind and he knew not where she had gone in the myriad vaults and chambers but a dark and fearsome intuition drew his steps without delay to the platform of the summit he knew not what he should find but his heart was drugged with an esoteric hopelessness and he was aware of no surprise when he came forth in the varicolored dawn and beheld the thing which awaited him the maiden nala or that which he knew to be nala was standing in the basin of evil compost above the withered remains of the voorqual she had undergone was still undergoing a monstrous and diabolic metamorphosis her frail slight body had assumed a long and dragonlike shape and the tender skin was marked off in incipient scales that darkened momentarily with a mottling of baleful hues her head was no longer recognizable as such and the human lineaments were flaring into a weird semicircle of pointed leafbuds her lower limbs had joined together had rooted themselves in the ground one of her arms was becomimg a part of the reptilian bole and the other was lengthening into a scaly stem that bore the darkred bud of a sinister blossom more and more the monstrosity took on the similitude of the voorqual and lunithi crushed by the ancient awe and dark terrible faith of his ancestors could feel no longer any doubt of its true identity soon there was no trace of nala in the thing before him which began to sway with a sinuous pythonlike rhythm and to utter a deep and measured sibilation to which the plants on the lower tiers responded he knew then that the voorqual had returned to claim its sacrifice and preside forever above the city lospar and the world lophai from the crypts of memory clark ashton smith aeons of aeons ago in an epoch whose marvelous worlds have crumbled and whose mighty suns are less than shadow i dwelt in a star whose course decadent from the high irremeable heavens of the past was even then verging upon the abyss in which said astronomers its immemorial cycle should find a dark and disastrous close ah strange was that gulfforgotten star how stranger than any dream of dreamers in the spheres of today or than any vision that hath soared upon visionaries in their retrospection of the sidereal past there through cycles of a history whose piled and bronzewrit records were hopeless of tabulation the dead had come to outnumber infinitely the living and built of a stone that was indestructible save in the furace of suns their cities rose beside those of the living like the prodigious metropoli of titans with walls that overgloom the vicinal villages and over all was the black funereal vault of the cryptic heavens a dome of infinite shadows where the dismal sun suspended like a sole enormous lamp failed to illumine and drawing back its fires from the face of the irresolvable ether threw a baffled and despairing beam on the vague remote horizons and shrouded vistas illimitable of the visionary land we were a somber secret manysorrowed people we who dwelt beneath that sky of eternal twilight pierced by the towering tombs and obelisks of the past in our blood was the chill of the ancient night of time and our pulses flagged with a creeping prescience of the lentor of lethe over our courts and fields like invisible sluggish vampires born of mausoleums rose and hovered the black hours with wings that distilled a malefic languor made from the shadowy woe and despair of perished cycles the very skies were fraught with oppression and we breathed beneath them as in a sepulcher forever sealed with all its stagnancies of corruption and slow decay and darkness impenetrable save to the fretting worm vaguely we lived and loved as in dreams the dim and mystic dreams that hover upon the verge of fathomless sleep we felt for our women with their pale and spectral beauty the same desire that the dead may feel for the phantom lilies of hadean meads our days were spent in roaming through the ruins of lone and immemorial cities whose palaces of fretted copper and streets that ran between lines of carven golden obelisks lay dim and ghastly with the dead light or were drowned forever in seas of stagnant shadow cities whose vast and ironbuilded fanes preserved their gloom of primordial mystery and awe from which the simulacra of centuryforgotten gods looked forth with unalterable eyes to the hopeless heavens and saw the ulterior night the ultimate oblivion languidly we kept our gardens whose gray lilies concealed a necromantic perfume that had power to evoke for us the dead and spectral dreams of the past or wandering through ashen fields of perennial autumn we sought the rare and mystic immortelles with somber leaves and pallid petals that bloomed beneath willows of wan and veillike foliage or wept with a sweet and nepentheladen dew by the flowing silence of acherontic waters and one by one we died and were lost in the dust of accumulated time we knew the years as a passing of shadows and death itself as the yielding of twilight unto night
