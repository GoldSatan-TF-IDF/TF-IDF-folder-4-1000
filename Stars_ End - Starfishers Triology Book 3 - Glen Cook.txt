one ad the main sequence the death cry of an exploding sun illuminated a starfleet the likes of which few men had ever seen there were six great starships in the convoy the smallest was forty kilometers long no drive glow enveloped those ships no ion wake marked their passing they were drifting but they met the flash front of the nova with an inherent velocity approaching three tenths the velocity of light each of those starships looked like a mobile created by a sculptor looked like someone had visited a planetary junkyard had welded scraps together and then had flung the results at the farthest star those ships were all angles tubes and planes globes cubes and what appeared to be silver sails whole forests of antennae bristled on the humped mountains of their backs random chunks of debris accompanied the ships thrown out from jagged wounds in their flanks wisps of atmosphere leaked from those great rents twinkling in the nova light smaller ships like blowflies fluttered around the rawest injuries there had been a battle a battle at stars end its fury and magnitude would have beggared the imagination of men who hadnt ever been out among the stars these limping crippled starships were the survivors the great lens of the milky way sprawled before the starships cold and silver and bright their noses were aimed toward its heart like a dying man crossing a desert the starfleet was dragging itself toward healthier climes a patch on the smallest ship began to glow throwing color back into the ocean of night it was not a happy color it was the dull dark red of venous blood the red of senescent suns it brightened became more intense the other ships drifted away fate had overtaken their little sister she was about to lose control of her fusion plant they did not want to be too close to the explosion the smaller blowflyvessels flitted away carrying evacuees for a moment the smaller starship yielded a light which rivalled that of the nearby nova fragments as big as pyramids hurtled outward adding to the clutter traveling with the fleet the remainder of the ship began tumbling slowly now little more than a disemboweled corpse the little ships darted in again swarmed around the remains signals leapt across the ether any survivors anyone at all there was no answer from the wreck but the little ships went in anyway moyshe benrabi slapped the withdrawal switch beneath his left hand agony smashed into his head a demon slapped a pair of icehooks into his temples and yanked he screamed clara shot he did not feel the needle bite his arm its prick was too tiny a pain he knew it had happened only because blessed relief hit him seconds later hans pulled his helmet the youngsters face was drawn clara patted sweat from his face with a towel bad moyshe she asked the worst i cant reach him anymore hes out there without protection and we just lost jariel they couldnt contain the antimatter leak the service ships went back i dont think theyll find anybody to evacuate hans asked drink moyshe the youths voice was tremulous he had had a sister on jariel something please i must have sweated a couple of liters they get through to gruber yet clara shrugged i havent heard she was a plump grandmotherly graying woman with rosy cheeks her appearance reflected her personality she was a book which could be read by its cover benrabi was in love with her in a filial way weve got to have help we cant hide in this nova storm forever the particle wave is on its way itll shred our screens payne says were going out soon as jariel is evacuated the sharks will have to take their chances oh damn what do the starfish say hans asked returning with a fruit drink he was putting on a brave face he had been in the fleet long enough to learn how to wait for good news or bad they would let him know about his sister benrabi swung his feet to the deck like i said i couldnt get through too far maybe somebody else did somebody with more experience i dont think so hans was just nineteen hardly out of creche he had not yet hardened to all the realities of the harvestfleet well just have to do it paynes way fight our way through benrabi began shuddering as his body reacted to the massive dosage of antipain drug clara swept a blanket around his shoulders it did not lessen the chills they still did not know for certain that they had won the battle of stars end they knew only that paynes fleet had held the battle space had survived and had begun making its way home they had not been attacked again yet but it was only a matter of time till the struggle resumed look at me benrabi whispered i cant stop shaking go home clara told him get some sleep we might break through they might need me to go on minddrive just let me stretch my legs he picked at his arm where the needle had broken his skin the strain of the emergency had begun to show on his flesh he was getting tracks he collapsed when he tried to stand take him home hans clara told the youth lester help hans load moyshe onto a scooter will you whats going on benrabi demanded as hans halted the flatbed electric truck outside his quarters for a moment he did not know where he was why did you what happened a woman demanded worry strangled her voice he passed out hans replied just needs rest i told him a thin pale nervous face outlined by the short blonde hair entered moyshes vision peered down into his eyes whats the matter with you moyshe you think youre a superman give me a hand with him hans ill tie him in bed if i have to somebodys got to benrabi protested you arent the only somebody on danion theres nobody like a new convert i love him but sometimes he drives me up the wall take care of him amy dont worry ive got too much invested in this idiot they dropped benrabi into his bed it surrounded him with a womblike comfort he felt vaguely guilty he shouldnt be sleeping while other mindtechs were still trying to make contact amy sat on the edge of the bed he was asleep long before she finished cussing him out for not taking better care of himself she was still hovering around when six hours later the cabin comm buzzed she answered amy coleridge security a greyframed face appeared in the little screen good morning lieutenant is benrabi there commander sir yes sir her voice dropped an octave and seemed to snap to attention hes sleeping sir but i can wake him if you really need him no dont i wanted to speak to you lieutenant im on my way down to see you two minutes later there was a knock on the cabin door the commander must have been on the way when hed called her ive just read your report on benrabi you did why it was just a routine report the commander brushed her question aside we may need him for something more than contact coleridge i want to ask you a question i want a considered answer sir is your report honest did you let your feelings affect it no sir yes sir i mean its honest sir youre sure hes become a seiner without reservation he has a few he grew up different but hes committed sir almost too much thats the way he is will he stay committed under pressure hes changed allegiances before before when sir when he left old earth thats not the same thing earth is part of confederation he just joined the navy danions commander reflected true but considering the way old earthers look at these things it indicates a flighty nature all right enough about benrabi what about his cohort amys colorless eyebrows crinkled over her pale blue eyes thats more difficult sir mouse is more complicated are you sure youre not projecting a lack of understanding his psych profiles make him look pretty simple almost black and white he seems to have hung his whole existence on his hatred for the sangaree then why did he stay here he couldve gone back to confederation with the others he cant fight sangaree out here ive been wondering thats why i asked i cant tell you sir hes all facade to me all charm and silliness i cant tell when hes serious and when hes joking the only feeling i get is that the man im seeing isnt the real masato storm are you involved with him too lieutenant sir answer me no sir i am not involved with mr storm makes you part of a vanishing breed then seems hes bedded half the single women on danion he attracts a certain kind of woman oh the caller smiled but not you she was a long time answering the temptation is there he has an animal magnetism theres curiosity about what everyone else sees in him but nothing is going to happen i dont like him very much her answer seemed to satisfy the commander were entering a new era lieutenant a time of changes our isolationism is under attack the sharks are wearing us down the stars end idea was a debacle were going to have to adjust either that or bend over and kiss our tails goodbye those two might be useful they have unusual backgrounds we dont have a secret service to speak of they could build one but that would mean trusting them and they werent born starfishers a lot of us werent somewhere along the line my father i know were all refugees thank you lieutenant consider this discussion exclusive dont mention it to anybody and if you learn anything that might have a bearing on the matter call my office ill have your name redtagged to my personal recorder ill call you back yes sir the commander left as quickly as hed arrived amy sat and stared into the shadows of the room after a while she lifted her thin frame and drifted into the room where benrabi was sleeping she stared down at him with an expression approaching awe she had never seen or met the ships commander before except in public address announcements her moyshe her last chance man he might amount to something after all she would not have become involved with the foreigner at all had her selfimage not been pitdeep she could not make herself believe that she deserved a good man a real starfisher she had expected to watch her life drift away from the foot of a social and career ladder the commanders call changed everything she would have to get moyshe moving and make sure his friend mouse did not lead him astray the differences between the confederated life that benrabi had chosen to leave and the lives of the starfishers were deep the starfishers the high seiners spent their adult lives aboard these vast harvestships drifting the deepspace hydrogen streams gleaning the droppings of an almost intangible spacebeast they called a starfish a whole ecology existed in the interstellar rivers it was vast and slow in keeping with the low random collision of the molecules from which their type of life had gradually evolved that life was invisible to the eye or radar the atoms constituting the bodies of the interstellar creatures could be scattered over cubic kilometers starfish were more vast than harvestships yet the matter in them could be compressed into a volume smaller than that occupied by the body of a tenyearold the atoms were as much foci for forces as part of the life process itself and most of the creatures of the ecology existed in part in hyperspace and another congruent universe at the starfishs heart a tiny fusion flame burned starfish swept up hydrogen and random molecules and occasionally passed a node of hard waste the nodes were incalculably precious the starfishers called them ambergris ambergris was the foundation of their economy the nodes were used in instel communicators there was no substitute the seiners controlled the only supply and consequently the market and price countless were the organizations which would pay almost any price for nearinstantaneous communication across interstellar distance moyshe benrabi and masato storm had been sent among the seiners to try to find a way for their employers confederation navy to seize the harvestships and ambergris industry they had succeeded and failed they had found the information and had elected to become starfishers themselves the hydrogen streams boasted a complex ecology it included the predatory shark which subsisted principally upon starfish evolution had equipped starfish with only one truly credible defensive weapon intellect deepspace evolution had begun eons before the condensation of old earths sun the modern starfish species had a remembered history spanning billions of years they had seen countless planetborn races come and go they knew the value of their waste over the past thousand terran years an eyes blink in the life of a starfish shark numbers had exploded insanely a new species was coming into being it reasoned feebly bred obsessively and hunted in cooperative packs which now sometimes numbered as many as a thousand predators the survival of the starfish species had come into sudden doubt their old ones had deliberated with almost immoderate haste a decision had been reached they turned their intelligence to finding a means of contacting the tiny hard warm creatures who lived in the metal shells questing around their wakes they had struck a bargain with the original starfishers ambergris in return for the protection of human weapons it had been a good bargain the sharks had been kept at bay for two hundred years another mere blink of times eye then the ever more numerous sharks had developed the tactic of assailing the protectors before the protected danion had enlisted landsmen as emergency replacements for heavy casualties suffered during one such attack her leaders had hoped to draw high quality technicians who might be seduced away from their lives in confederation instead they had attracted scores of spies sent in hopes of capturing control of a harvestfleet confederations bureau of naval intelligence had sent senior field agents moyshe benrabi and masato igarashi storm the two had found what promised to be a home sirens wailed throughout danion amy jerked out of her seat moyshe battle stations we must be coming out of the flash wave benrabi surged out of the bedroom climbing into his jumpsuit as he came lets go honey he dragged her into the passageway outside where a pair of electric scooters nursed charger sockets he seized one she the other see you love he said as he sailed away he pulled to the center of the passage and opened the scooter up the walls blurred past people were running in the pedestrian lanes scooters hurtled at him from the opposite direction there were near collisions at every cross corridor a voice like that of a god kept booming battle stations battle station damn damn damn moyshe thought i shouldnt be going back under so soon five vast and tangled ships began nosing out of the intense nova light the blowfly vessels still swarmed around their wounds and between them and the derelict tumbling along in their midst guarded by their shell of fire one by one the five great ships rolled to present their heaviest weapons outward from a common center two ad the contemporary scene a ship came into being slightly below the surface of a dust lake rilling a crater on a nameless moon circling a world far in toward the center of the galaxy the most centerward world of ulant lay a thousand light years rimward no human being had traveled this part of space before astronomers on the primary had they been watching would have been astonished by the geyser which exploded from the craters flat dust face no astronomers were watching they like soldiers wives derelicts and children like everyone who lived on that world were engaged in a death struggle so demanding they had ceased caring whether their satellite existed the ship that bobbed to the dusts surface looked like a giant doughnut with a beer can shoved through the hole and held in place by thin straws one tall vane like a sharks fin rose from the torus leaning away from the cylinder a globe surmounted it the whole vessel was dead black not even a hull number broke its lack of color it was a tiny ship the beer can was just sixty meters tall the outer diameter of the doughnut barely spanned sixtyfive meters the curves of the vessel were broken only by a handful of antennae two missile launch bays and the snouts of laser and graser batteries she was a deadly little beast designed solely to kill she was a museum piece literally and the nastiest little shark of a warship ever conceived by the mind of man she was a climber left over from the ulantonid war she had been dragged from the war museum at luna command and reactivated especially for this mission she was the first climber to space since the wars most desperate days because climbers were almost as deadly to their crews as to the enemies they stalked only the absolute imperative of racial survival would see them used in combat again luna command had that much heart the climber fleets had been too destructive of the minds and bodies of their crews the little ambushers had changed the course of the ulantonid war and had filled the sanitariums of confederation with walking wounded the few survivors of service within their sanitydevouring fields of concealment the climber generated a field in her torus which drove her into a dimension beyond hyperspace called null where she remained virtually undetectable till she returned to hyper or norm to attack climbers in schools had destroyed whole ulantonid fleets this climber had the most remarkable crew of any navy had ever spaced her ships commander was manfred fleet admiral graf von staufenberg first deputy chief of staff of confederation navy he had seen climber duty toward the end of the war the ships first watch officer was melene telleeych cath defender prime of ulant or minister of defense her operations officer was ulants principal peacemaker or chief of the general staff turone wahlchyst forse her gunnery officer and his leading mates were star lords of the toke one was the star lord who commanded confederations marine toke legion the others ranked him in the caste of warriors there was no man or woman aboard of any of five races who ranked below the equivalent of admiral or general and none of them were not decisionmakers a wellplaced missile could have crippled the defenses of humanity and all its neighbors admiral wildblood the lady who directed navys bureau of naval intelligence and admiral beckhart who ran her department of dirty tricks had two of the more menial assignments in operations one watched the hyper detection gear the other the passive radar scans star lords and all they slept in hammocks slung from the climbers central structural member or keel they shared the one toilet and did without the shower that had never existed in climb they used portable chamberpots and smelled one anothers stinks as had the climbermen of an age gone by one and all they had come to see for themselves the growing disaster ulantonid explorers had been bemoaning for years they had seen film they had questioned witnesses in some cases they had begun to act but they had had to see with their own eyes before they could finally believe they had to watch the war going on below on the primary of the moon a race from farther in toward the galactic core was systematically exterminating every sentient creature it encountered the natives of this world were their latest victims the people aboard the climber came of races which had fought bitterly in the past there was little love among some of them now but never in the most desperate heated days of their contention had any considered eradicating their enemies their wars had been tests of racial wills with territorial causes this world was the fourth assailed by the centerward race since its discovery by ulantonid explorers the first three worlds were lifeless now the aggressors even shunned their use as bases even the warriors of toke could not comprehend the destruction of intelligent life simply because it was intelligent the warriors believed battle to be a crucible for purification of the soul a road to honor and glory grimly majestic and godlike for them combat was almost an end in itself they fought one another when there were no outsiders they were perfectly aware of the distinction between victory and obliteration they were as appalled by the excesses of the centerward race as were any of their shipmates they had come to see for themselves and the grim truth burned in the climbers display tank the worlds atmosphere was alive with spiderwebs of coherent light energy and particle beams hacked air and space like the flailing swords of a thousand ancient armies the planet people had the technological edge the exterminators had the numbers and determination their ships clouded the stars they had overwhelmed the worlds offplanet protection months ago now they were pounding the onworld defenses and were making their initial landings starbright shortlived pinpoints speckled the worlds surface theyre using nuclears ulants defender growled even during their wars bitterest hour neither human nor ulantonid had violated each others worlds with nuclear weapons by tacit agreement those had been confined to vacuum they know were here beckhart called out seven destroyer displacement ships are headed this way very well graf von staufenberg replied melene most of that looks like its happening in the troposphere theyre probably not pushing one in a thousand warheads through to the surface the star lord who commanded all star lords boomed every one through destroys the defense net weakness soon it will be two of a thousand then four not to mention what the radioactivity will do in the long run makes you wonder why theyre forcing it with landings here this south tropic archipelago theyve punched an open corridor down there hell of a defense someone muttered damn near as tough as stars end i wouldnt want to try breaking it how long till those destroyers are pushing us von staufenberg asked theyre humping it in norm four or five minutes for the closest looks like some other stuff starting to move too cant we do anything the dni demanded von staufenberg replied we could bloody a few noses it wouldnt change anything we couldnt do that with a hundred climbers therere just too damned many of them okay lets give the people in the other compartments a look i want everybody to see it well have some decision to make on our way home the warriors have decided said the star lord of the marine toke legion he speaks for toke his nonservice superior added for toke there can be but one decision we will come to them here alone if we have to its not that easy for me manfred melene said were an adventurous species but im handicapped by democratic traditions and faith in peace we dont organize quickly or well von staufenberg chuckled you did before the defender was older than he she had been a soldier throughout the ulantonid war i expect we will again we can do anything when we decide to pull together its the decision process thats so abominably slow your decisions were made years ago melene beckhart growled from his radar boards dont try to snow us i can give you the names and hull numbers of a hundred new construction ships youve got tucked away in places you never thought wed look admiral beckhart von staufenberg queried i have my sources sir theyre rearming as fast as their shipbuilding industry can space hulls they come off the line looking like commercial ships only theyve got drive potential up the yangyang and they never get delivered to any of the transport outfits they disappear for a while then turn up somewhere else with guns dripping off them why wasnt high command informed of this beckhart because my sources are in the defenders office and i knew why they were rearming you wouldnt have bought it half of high command is still trying to refight the ulantonid war i let it go on playing that game because people were seeing enough of those new ships to get nervous and start us a secret building program of our own so were on our way too beckhart your logic baffles me totally baffles me i have the distinct feeling that youll have to explain it to a board of inquiry what else have you hidden from us you want an honest answer or one that will please you beckhart did not make many friends he retained his position principally because no one else could do his job as well beckhart several things sir ongoing operations if they work out well be in good shape for meeting these monsters monsters melene demanded theres no evidence melene the admiral is a xenophobe in fact he doesnt like people very much tell me what youre doing beckhart theres a chance im on the threshold to the solution of the sangaree problem some new data was on its way in before we left ill probably want to borrow von drachau again what else still too tentative for discussion a possible breakthrough in communications and weapons technologies i wont discuss it now not here beckhart security privilege sir log it if you like von staufenberg wheeled on the director of naval intelligence she shrugged you wont get anything from me either manfred damn all right lets get moving times running out and everybodys got to have a look at this cumbers were the most cramped vessels since gemini circulating the fortyodd beings aboard was a slow uncomfortable process shes about to start shooting beckhart said of the nearest destroyer she has missile swarm we have four minutes to hide how do you like that didnt even try to find out who we were or what we wanted this is the ships commander von staufenberg said into the public address system were under fire engineering stand by to go null thirty seconds before the swarm arrived he ordered take her up to ten bev first watch officer a gesture is in order program me an attack approach on the vessel shooting at us the ulantonids feathery antennae stirred quivered the action was comparable to a humans pleased chuckle the star lords were in weapons department already hoping they would be allowed to play with their deadly toys one missile said von staufenberg right up her wake it was the classic climber attack strategy drives were a warships soft spot they simply could not be designed so that thrust apertures could be shielded as well as the remainder of the vessel the dust in the crater flowed together suddenly smashing in like the red sea on pharaohs chariots the doughnut ship had vanished take her all the way to forty bev von staufenberg ordered i doubt they know enough to look for our hawking point but lets get that crosssection down anyway one of the curiosities about the climber was that no other race known to humanity had ever developed it and for humans it had been an accidental byproduct of other research twentythree minutes passed before the first watch officer reported attack position commander weapons ships commander one missile stand by detection when we go down i want you to get the ranges and vectors on everything you can see well do what we can and i want the tape rolling ships services vent heat while were norm all right everybody ready take her down engineering heat accumulation was the biggest weakness of the climber there was no way to shed heat in null and a climber often had to stay up for days while enemy warships hunted her the climber was no warship in the slugitout sense she was a hitandrun fighter dependent on surprise for her effectiveness the defender prime brought them down just four kilometers behind the destroyer the climber rocked the missile accelerated at g it arrived before the destroyer knew it was coming one for the good guys beckhart grumped as the climber went up again what was that von staufenberg demanded admiral youre giving them valuable information just by blowing them out of space youre telling them we can do it youll get them wondering how head home before we give them any hard data lets save the surprises for when theyll do some good von staufenberg reddened there was no love lost between him and beckhart hes right manfred the defender prime interjected you almost wasted the climber advantage by committing them piecemeal during the war they would have more effective if whole fleets had appeared suddenly we would not have had time to adapt of course of course i was thinking with my guts program a course for the mother melene climbers did not have a long range a mother ship awaited this one a hundred lightyears homeward a small armada protected her this climbers crew regarded themselves highly three ad the main sequence benrabi slammed his scooter through the entrance to control sector seconds later the massive shield doors rumbled shut behind him the section was totally selfcontained now no one could come in or leave till those doors lifted moyshe stopped in a long squealing slide he jumped off slammed the charger plug into a socket ran through the hatch to contact you made it clara said we didnt think you would you live so far away here catch your breath my scooter was smoking better have it checked hans he settled onto a fitted couch ready clara asked no she smiled at him hans started massaging an odorless paste into his scalp clara slipped her fingers inside what looked like a hairnet you never are i thought you liked chub benrabi chuckled chub i like fine hes good people but id like him a lot better if he could walk in the door stick out a hand and say hey moyshe lets go grab a couple of beers chub was the starfish with whom benrabi usually linked xenophobe crap its not him its that outofbody feeling wrong moyshe you cant fool old clara i was babying mindtechs before you were born and youre all alike you dont want to go out because it hurts so much to come back yeah ready hans said clara slid the net onto moyshes head her fingertips were soft and warm they lingered on his cheeks momentary concern clouded her smile dont push yourself moyshe get out if it gets rough you havent had enough rest since stars end there isnt any rest for anybody we won hans reminded the cost was too high it was cheaper than losing benrabi shrugged i guess you people see things different i never would have gone in the first place you took your whippings and smiled back in confederation hans asked i never heard of that no we calculated the odds we picked the right time then we ganged up we didnt just go storming around like a rogue elephant getting hurt as much as we did hurt oriflamme hans countered what thats what they call payne sometimes its something from olden times that has to do with not taking prisoners oh the oriflamme it was a special pennon that belonged to the king of france if he raised it it meant take no prisoners it had a way of backfiring on him hans clara said moyshe is an academy man he can probably tell you how many spokes in the wheel of a roman war chariot take poitiers for instance who its a place in france which is on old earth i know where france is moyshe all right one of the big battles of the hundred years war was fought there and you could say that the french lost because of the oriflamme see they caught the english in a bad spot outnumbered them like ten to one the black prince decided to surrender but the french raised the oriflamme which pissed the english so they proceeded to kick ass all over the countryside when the dust settled the french were wiped out and louis was in chains theres a lesson in there somewhere if you want to look namely dont ever push anybody into a corner where he cant get out you see what hes doing hans clara asked you mean trying to educate us until the allclear comes through youre out of luck moyshe lift your head so i can put your helmet on benrabi raised his head his scalp began tingling under the hairnet device the helmet devoured his head stealing the light he fought the panic that always hit before he went under hans strapped him in and adjusted the biomonitors pickups can you hear me moyshe clara asked through the helmets earphones he raised a hand then spoke coming through clear got you too your boards look good blood pressure is up but thats normal for you take a minute in tsd relax go when you want his i dont want remained unspoken he depressed the switch beneath his right hand one click the only senses left him were internal total sensory deprivation left him only his aches and pains the taste in his mouth and the rush of blood once the field took hold even those would go in small doses it was relaxing but too much could drive a man insane he flicked his right hand again a universe took form around him he was its center its lord its creator there was no pain in that universe nor much unhappiness too many wonders burned there within the bounds of his mind it was a universe of colors both pastel and crisp every star was a blazing jewel proclaiming its individual hue the oncoming storm of the novas solar wind was a rioting psychedelic cloud that seemed to have as much substance as an old earth thunderhead opposite it the pale pink glimmer of a hydrogen stream meandered off toward the heart of the galaxy the surrounding harvestships were patches of iridescent gold a score of golden chinese dragons drifted with the fleet straining toward it yet held away by the light pressure of the dying star starfish benrabis sourness gave way to elation there would be contact this time he reached toward them with his thoughts chub are you out there my friend for a time there was nothing then a warm glow enveloped him like some sudden outbreak of good cheer moyshe manfriend hello i see you coming out of the light hello one ship is gone jariel theyre still evacuating sad chub did not seem sad this fish benrabi thought is constitutionally incapable of anything but joy not so moyshe manfriend i mourn with the herd the sorrows of stars end yet i must laugh with my manfriends over the joys of what was won the shipsthatkill werent all destroyed chub the sangaree carry their grudges forever ha they are a tear in the eye of eternity they will die their sun will die and still there will be starfish to swim the rivers of the night youve been puttering around in the back rooms of my mind again youre stealing my images and shooting them back at me you have an intriguing mind moyshe manfriend a clouded boxy mind cobwebby atticy full of trap doors what would you know about trap doors only what i relive through your memories moyshe manfriend chub teased and giggled like an adolescent lover by starfish reckoning he was a child hehad not yet seen his millionth year benrabi simply avoided thinking about starfish time spans a life measured in millions of years was utterly beyond his ken he only mourned the fact that those incredible spans could never touch upon worlds where beings of a biochemical nature lived the stories they could have told the historical mysteries they could have illuminated but starfish dared not get too near major gravitational or magnetic sources even the gravity of the larger harvestships felt to a starfish much as rheumatism to a human being they were terribly fragile creatures while chub teased and enthused moyshe turned a part of his mind to his private universe again red torpedoes idled along far away across the pink river against the galaxy yes chub said sharks survivors of stars end called them here they will attack they starve another feast for the scavenger things smaller ghosts in a mix of colors shadowed both dragons and torpedoes they were chubs scavengers the great slow ecology of the hydrogen streams had niches for creatures of most lifefunctions though their definition in human terms was seldom more than an approximation a convenient labeling moyshe yielded to nervousness chub reached into his mind calming him im learning chub i can see the river this time i can see the particle storm coming from the sick sun very good moyshe manfriend you relax now sharks come soon you watch scavenger things instead they tell when sharks cant wait anymore they get dancey moyshe laughed into his secret universe starfish believed in doing things with deliberation as might be expected of creatures with vast life spans young starfish tended to be restless and excitable they were prone to flutter impatiently in the presence of their elders the old ones called it getting dancey chub was dancey most of the time the old ones considered him the herd idiot chub said they regretted exposing him to human hastythink while he was still young and impressionable is a joke moyshe manfriend is a good joke yes yes very funny for a starfish the old ones had to be the most phlegmatic humorless pragmatic intelligences in all creation they couldnt even grasp the concept of a joke with the exception of chub benrabi found them a depressing mob i was lucky to become your mindmate chub very lucky he meant it he had linked with old ones he compared it to making love to his grandmother bareassed on an iceberg with a crowd watching drawing chub was the best thing that had happened to him in years yes we halfwits stick together venceremos comrade moyshe benrabi filled the universe with laughter where the hell did you get that your mind full of cobwebby memories moyshe manfriend one time you play revolutionary on hard matter place called dustball yeah i did about two weeks then it was duck bullets all the way back to the embassy you live much in few years moyshe manfriend ten times anyone else linked by starfish chub many adventures think chub would make good spy who would you spy on yes problem very difficult to disguise as shark thats another joke isnt it yes you still spying moyshe manfriend not anymore im not thomas mcclennon anymore im moyshe benrabi ive found me a home chub these are my people now you cant spy on your own people oh saw shadows in your mind thought maybe secret spystuff lurked so hey maybe someday you go spy on hard matter place people be double spy double agent oh yes that right words no more spying chub im going to be a mindtech dangerous so is spying in more ways than youll ever understand hurtsoftheheart dangers you mean i dont know why they tell you youre stupid youre a lot smarter in a lot of ways than most people i know you see things without having to have them explained helps being starfish people cant look inside moyshe manfriend you have to tell you have to show you not the kind of man to do that yeah lets talk about something else huh running out of talk time moyshe manfriend scavenger creatures getting dancey you not paying attention i still havent got the hang of seeing everything at once that was one of the beauties of the mindtechs linked universe he was not subject to the limitations of binocular vision but he did have to unlearn its habits blind people made better techs faster they had no habits to unlearn no preoccupations to overcome but blind people who suffered from classical migraine were scarce scarlet torpedoes edged toward the fleet they were not yet wholly committed hunger still had not banished good sense sharks were slow of wit but they knew they had to get past the harvestships to reach their prey that was the whole point of the starfishstarfisher alliance cant visit anymore chub were not going on minddrive so ill have to help fight oh yes moyshe manfriend shoot straight i help putting right vectors in your brain all right aloud into his helmet benrabi said gun control a second later his earphones crackled gun control aye mindtech in link and free to assume control of a sector battery sharks will attack repeat will attack shit all right buddy but never mind the sector battery master gunner says he wants you to feed the main battle tank think you and your link can give us good realtime input yes chub murmured deep in benrabis hindbrain yes moyshe said and wondered why it was not something he had ever tried monitor all go gun control claras voice interjected green boards all across ive just keyed the translator you can bring the computer online whenever youre ready stand by for draw linker moyshe said clara dont take any chances key out if it gets rough drawing linker for an instant benrabi felt as though some intangible vacuum were sucking his mind away a smatter of panic quickly yielded to chubs soothing moyshe relaxed became a conduit he became an almost disinterested observer the scavengers suddenly grew dancey with a vengeance attack imminent benrabi muttered those pilot fish were excited because they would feast no matter what the outcome of battle they would be perfectly content nibbling dead shark or dead starfish a dozen crimson torpedoes suddenly misted stretched into long fuzzy lines and solidified again near the starfish herd a hundred swords of light started carving them into scavenger food sharks were easy meat for particle beams teach them to try end run through hyper chub whispered the starfish herd had not bothered to dodge they would not begin maneuvering till the protection of the human ships began breaking down it might not hold benrabi reflected five vessels could not establish a sound fire pattern there would be blind spots big holes to fill them would mean risking hitting your own people the shark packs milled they had not yet found workable tactics for assailing a fleet of harvestships their intellectual slowness was the only hope for starfish and starfishers alike something had happened to the sharks their numbers were expanding almost exponentially they were becoming ever more desperate in their quest for something to eat their prey historically had been the stragglers of the great starfish herds the feeble and injured and careless but now they assaulted the strong and healthy as well and had even begun turning on their own injured even the firepower of a harvestship could not hold the massed packs at bay when hunger heterodyned into a berserk killing rage not look so promising as you thought moyshe manfriend all going to come at once from everywhere crazy just killing and dying there was dread in chubs thought moyshe was dismayed even in the hell that had been the battle at stars end the starfish had not lost his good cheer the starfishs prediction proved correct the red torpedoes suddenly exploded in every direction moyshe had seen the same reaction among humans the first had been by a band of fairweather revolutionaries who had heard the police were coming another time a terrorist had lobbed a hand grenade into a crowded theatre but the sharks were not fleeing the instantinsanity had seized them they were spreading out to attack they arrowed in on the harvestfleet laser and particle beam swords stabbed danions fire was deadly the realtime simulation from the minds of a man and a starfish linked gave the weapons people a fractional seconds advantage over their brethren in ships relying on normal detection systems the shark wave rolled round danion like a breaker around a granite promontory they could have worn her down in time had they had the patience of the sea and the seas resources for endlessly sending in another wave they had hurt her bad at stars end it only took one shark getting through with its multidimensional fires to ravage a whole section of ship but this horde was more limited in its numbers and more driven by hunger oh christ benrabi swore as an explosion ripped a huge chunk from a sister ship a shark had gotten through there the service ships still evacuating jariel and trying to plug the holes in the fire pattern swarmed toward the fragment clouds of frozen water vapor boiled round it as atmosphere poured out a shark flung itself into the starfish herd the great night beasts were not defenseless one burped a ball of the nuclear fire that burned in its gut flung it with robin hood accuracy the shark perished in the fading flash of a hydrogen bomb one predator was gone and one starfish was disarmed for hours it took the creatures a long time to revitalize their internal fires benrabi had seen the peaceable starfish use the same weapon against sangaree raidships at stars end fur is flying now moyshe manfriend chub was straining for humor we doing all right you and me maybe your old ones decide you not stupid after all left unthought was chubs hope for the same reaction from his own old ones by way of support benrabi replied this is a new era chub its going to take hastiness and danciness to survive sharks coming again once more danions weaponry scarred the long night moyshe wondered what some alien would think if he happened on its unconcealable mark a thousand years from now a thousand lightyears away both sides had used retrospective observation techniques during the ulantonid war a battles outcome might be fixed but it could be studied over and over from every possible angle the second assault was more furious than the first benrabi stopped trying to think he had to give his whole attention over to following the situation more sharks dropped hyper drawn by no known means the rage took them too they attacked everything including wounded brethren floundering around the battle region this was the root of chubs fear that more and more sharks would be drawn till they simply overwhelmed everything it was the future foreseen by both starfish and starfishers the terror that herd after herd and harvestship after harvestship would be consumed was the force that had driven the maverick commander of this fleet to hazard the defenses of stars end the arrivals slowed to a trickle chub thought we going to win again moyshe manfriend see the pattern the glorious pattern they waste their might devouring their own injured benrabi searched his kaleidoscopic mindlink universe he saw nothing but chaos this he reflected is the sort of thing czyzewski was thinking about when he wrote the old god so much of czyzewskis poetry seemed reflective of recent events had the man been prescient no he was far gone on stardust when he did the cycle including the old god the drug killed him less than a month after he finished the poem the images were just the flaming madness of the drug burning through dont you get tired of being right he asked when the first sharks fled never moyshe manfriend but learned long ago to wait till event is certain predestined to make observation error is painful the scorn of old ones is like the fire of a thousand stars i know the feeling for some reason the face of admiral beckhart his onetime commander drifted through his universe here on the galactic rim fighting for his life against creatures he had not suspected existed two years earlier his previous career seemed as remote as that of another man of another incarnation or something he had read about the assault collapsed once the first few wellfed sharks fled the starfish had suffered far less than their inedible guardians not one dragon was missing from the golden herd defended by the harvestships but another ship had been injured severely a traitorous thought stole across moyshes mind on mousesoft feet chub was less indignant than he expected on a strictly pragmatic level the starfish agreed that getting out of the interstellar rivers would be the best way to conserve starfisher ships and lives theyll never go chub the harvestfleets are their nations their homelands theyre proud stubborn people theyll keep fighting and hoping i know moyshe manfriend it saddens the herd and makes the old ones proud that they forged their alliance so well but why do you say they we then part of the time most of the time im an outsider here they do things differently than what i learned sometimes you miss your old life moyshe manfriend sometimes not often and not much though id better tend to business he had to focus his attention to force his physical voice to croak gun control mindlink the sharks are going theyve given up you can secure when the last leaves firing range you sure linker dont look like it in the display tank im sure let me know when i can stop realtiming this is my second link in eight hours right will do the man on the far end seemed impressed claras voice broke in are you all right moyshe the strain getting heavy we can bring you out im okay for a while i remember what i am just be ready to hit me with that needle at stars end danion had lost half her native trained mindtechs because they had stayed in link too long or had been mindburned by sharks breaking through the defensive fire screen the best guess was that the former had become lost in the special interior universe of the linker dozens occupied a special hospital ward where doctors and nurses had to handle them like newly born babies their bodies lived on their minds it was hoped might sometime be retrieved in all the history of the high seiners no lost linker ever had been recalled the starfishers were living on hopes these days stars end had been one for weapons capable of shattering shark tides benrabi did not understand how the seiners had hoped to accomplish what generations of madmen fools and geniuses had failed to do stars end was a fortress unvanquishable it was a whole world earthsized that was a fortress or planetary battleship or whatever it could be approached by nothing the technologies of its defenses were beyond the imaginations of any of the races aware of its existence its builders had long since vanished into the abyss of time generations of men had lusted after the weapons of stars end thousands had died trying to obtain them and the fortress world remained inviolate why had the seiners been convinced that they would have better luck you were right linker computer says theyre pulling out going to let you off realtime now we can handle it from here without thank you gun control the sense of drain stopped abruptly benrabis universe reeled chub reached in and steadied him time to break moyshe manfriend you losing sense of reality and orientation in spacetime im not lost yet chub you all say so no more you can do here manfriend the crackle of reality beginning to fall into shards rose from benrabis hindbrain it pushed a wave of terror before it chub did nothing to soothe him clara the needle im coming out he slapped the switch beneath his left hand they were waiting for him the agony persisted for only a few seconds that was bad enough he screamed and screamed it got worse every time four ad the main sequence they put him into hospital block this time he was under sedation for three days two people were at his bedside when the doctor came to bring him out the thin pale blueeyed woman with the nervous hands was amy the little oriental with the presence of an iceberg was benrabis friend mouse amy would sit for a minute picking at her jumpsuit shifting this way and that she would cross and uncross her legs then would rise and pace around for a minute before sitting again she did not speak to mouse most of the time she deliberately tried to distance storm from herself and moyshe it was almost as if she saw mouse as a competitor for benrabis affection the men had shared missions under fire sometimes they did not like one another much their backgrounds were day and night centuries of prejudice had erected walls between them yet an indestructible bond had been forged and hammered on the anvils of shared peril they had guarded one anothers backs and saved one anothers lives too often to let go mouse waited without moving with the patience of a samurai he was a dedicated archaicist he had just encountered his own ancient heritage and in imagination was trying the samurai role for size the code and conduct suited the warrior within him but it did nothing for the libertine and mouse was a classic of that genre at least with the opposite sex masato igarashi storm did nothing by half measures the doctor coughed softly will he be all right amy demanded hell come out okay i know what you told me but mouses facial muscles moved slightly his wan expression spoke volumes about his disgust at her display the doctor was more patient just an enforced rest miss thats all it is theres nothing wrong that rest cant cure i hear he did a hell of a job feeding realtime to weapons control he just pushed himself too far a look flickered across mouses stony face whatre you thinking amy demanded just that hes not usually a pusher amy was ready for a fight the doctor aborted it by giving benrabi an injection he began to come around mouse seemed indifferent to amys response but not oblivious he was an astute observer he just did not care what she thought doc he said is there any special reason for sticking with this kind of medical setup the woman held benrabis wrist taking his pulse what do you mean its primitive almost archaicist obsolete they had sonic sedation systems before i was born easier on the patient and staff both the doctor reddened mouse had been out of the hospital only a few weeks himself he had spent a month recuperating from a severe wound received from a sangaree agent who had tried to seize control of danion he was not pleased with the quality of medical care and made no secret of it but mouse hated all doctors and hospitals he could find fault with the finest benrabi had tracked the sangaree woman down and had shot her mouse had the nerve to stand toetotoe with the devil and tell him to put it where the sun doesnt shine we have to make do with what we can afford mr storm so ive been told mouse did not pursue it though he thought seiners pleading poverty was on a par with midas begging alms on a street corner benrabi opened his eyes how you doing moyshe storm asked trampling amys more dramatic opener his presence there betraying his concern embarrassed him the fabric of centuries takes the stamp they mark the children indelibly their legacy remains as invisible and irresistible as the secret coded in dna the young mouse had learned that old earthers were pariahs mouses family had been in service for three generations they were part of confederations military aristocracy benrabis forebears had been unemployed social insurees for centuries neither man considered himself prejudiced but false truths sown in the fallows of childhood planted deep continued to sprout unrealistic realworld responses benrabi had begun bridling his prejudice early he had to survive there had been only two old earthers in his academy battalion he needed a minute to get his bearings what am i doing here he demanded you needed rest amy told him lots of it you overdid it this time come on i can take care of myself i know when crap the doctor snapped every mindtech thinks that and then they turn up here burned out i change their diapers and spoon feed them what is it with you people benrabi you all got egos two sizes too big for a small god moyshe was fuzzy he tried to say something flip his tongue felt like it was wrapped in an old sock he saw tears in the doctors eyes did you lose someone at stars end my sister she came out of creche just before you landsmen came aboard she was only seventeen benrabi im sorry no youre not youre a mindtech anyway sorry doesnt help not when i have to take care of her every day she was just like you benrabi she knew she could handle it she wouldnt listen either none of them would not even the controllers who shouldve known better they put her back in with only four hours rest benrabi kept his mouth shut what could he say he had been introduced to contact during the battle at stars end the main contact room had been a shambles dozens of mindtechs had given everything to save danion he never would have seen contact or even have discovered its existence had those linker casualties not been cruel in those days he had been a distrusted landsman a convicted enemy spy who was screened from all seiner secrets they had drafted him into contact only because he might give danion a millimeters better chance of surviving he had made his decision to cross over after stars end virtually in the hatch of the ship designated to return the landsmen contractees to confederation he had waited too long half of his personal possessions had departed with the ship he had not recovered them the service ship crew had gotten into a row with customs the bureaucrats had retaliated seizing everything not bolted to the ships frames benrabi took amys thin cool hand howve you been darling you look tired how long has it been she felt so cold she was a spooky woman why had he fallen in love with her he always fell for the strange ones the neurotic and just plain rotten ones alyce in academy what a loser she had turned out to be and the sangaree woman marya who had been a vampire in the midst of his last two missions im all right now that i know youll be okay moyshe please be more careful she seemed unusually remote benrabi glanced at her at mouse and back again more problems with mouse her dislike for his friend had taken a quantum leap recently mouse did not talk much the inevitable chess board had accompanied him but he did not offer to play amys presence restrained him chess was one of his great passions rivaling his passion for seducing a parade of beautiful women hey mouse ever wonder what max is doing these days referring to someone they had known before coming out here was the only way he could think of to pull his friend into the conversation probably getting richer and wondering why we dont come into her shop anymore i dont think beckhart will bother giving her our new address yeah benrabi laughed he should have heard the news by now dont you think or pretty soon hell foam at the mouth for amys benefit he explained max was a friend of ours in luna command she ran a stamp store best hobby shop in the moon mouse said amy did not respond she simply could not comprehend what these two got out of accumulating small bits of paper that were ages old and required jewelers grade care and stamps were not the only thing between them they seemed to collect everything coins stamps all kinds of ancient miscellania mouse had little wroughtiron trivets and other oldtime dohickeys all over his quarters the one collection she could appreciate was moyshes butterflies he had a frame of exotics on his wall they were incredibly beautiful the seiner ships were ecologically sterile only their zoos contained nonhuman life and that the large wellknown mammals amy had no hobbies of her own she read for relaxation she had acquired the habit from her mother mouse even managed passably with a clarinet an antique woodwind seldom seen anymore he claimed to have learned from his father what about greta mouse asked you think the department will take care of her amy jumped at the name you never did tell me about greta moyshe that was in another life they were lovers but they did not know one another well benrabi did not like stirring up the snake pit of peoples pasts there was too much chance of finding something nasty it was there in every life but he answered amys question i told you before shes a kid i met the last time i was on old earth the last time i visited by mother she wanted out her friends wouldnt let her go i arranged it for her and ended up sponsoring her sort of like being a foster parent mouse explained guess shed be eighteen now i havent thought about her in ages you shouldnt have mentioned her mouse now youve got me worried hey dont max will look out for her maybe but thats not right putting it on somebody else is there any way i could send her a letter now and then amy just to let her know im all right and thinking about her id let you or jarl write it if you wanted you could even run it through the crypto computer to make sure its innocent thiss just a kid amy demanded yeah she reminded me a lot of me when i came off old earth awful lost i thought i could help out by sponsoring her and then i kind of ran out when the bureau sent us out here i told her wed be back in a couple of months its been almost fourteen ill ask jarl he lets a little mail go out some of us have relatives outside but its slow that doesnt matter amy youre a jewel i love you well if youre going to get mushy mouse said standing ive got to run a citizenship class its from hunger moyshe me and emily hopkins and this fascist bastard of a teacher maybe ill hurt the arm again get back in here so i can miss a few too behave do what the doctor lady says or ill wring your neck he made his exit before moyshe could embarrass him with many thanksforcomings youre awful quiet today honey benrabi said after a while perhaps if the doctor had not been there im just tired were still doing double shifts and barely keeping our heads above water were going to be in the yards a long time assuming danion doesnt fall apart before we get there assuming the sharks dont knock us apart youve mentioned these yards about fifty times and wouldnt tell me about them do you trust me enough now theyre what the name sounds like where we build and fix our ships moyshe youre not going anywhere for a while tell me about you what i met you the very first day way back on carsons when you signed your contract we lived together for months before i even found out youve got a daughter i dont know anything about you greta isnt my daughter honey i just helped a kid who needed somebody its almost the same thing isnt it legally i guess on paper theyd have trouble making it stand up in court tell me everything there was little else to do but talk he talked the doctor lurking in the background watching suspiciously had made it clear that he would be stuck here for a while all right let me know when it gets boring he had been born in north america on old earth to clarence hardaway and myra mcclennon he had hardly known his father his mother for reasons he still did not understand had elected to raise him at home instead of burying him in the state creche only a few social insurees raised their children his early years had been typical for homeraised si children little supervision little love little education he had been running with a kid gang before he was eight he had been nine when he had seen his first offworlders spikes they had called them these had been navy men in crisp dress blacks diligently pursuing the arcane business of offworlders those uniforms had captured his imagination they had become an obsession he had started keying information out of his mothers home data retrieval terminal he had not had the education to decipher most of it he had started teaching himself building from the ground up toward the things he so desperately wanted to know at ten he had quit the gang so he would have more time to study halfway through his eleventh year the revelation had come he had to get into space he had approached a navy recruiter clandestinely the man had arranged for him to sneak through the academy exams he never would have made it had there been no special standards and quotas for old earthers he would have gotten skunked had he been in direct competition with carefully prepared outworlders many of whom had grown up in the military life half the officers in service were the children of officers service was a complete subculture and one that was becoming increasingly less connected with and controlled by the overculture he had had motivation at twelve he had run away from home fleeing to luna command and academy in six years he had climbed from dead last to the th percentile in class standing at graduation he had taken his line option and been assigned to the fleet he had served aboard the destroyers aquataine and hesse and the attack cruiser tamerlane before requesting intelligence training following a year of schooling the bureau had assigned him as naval attaché to the embassy on feldspar he had had a half dozen similar assignments on as many worlds before his work attracted the attention of admiral beckhart whose department handled dangerous operations and tricks on the grey side of legal he had taken part in several tight missions and had reencountered his former classmate mouse they had shared several assignments the last being to join the starfishers to ferret out information that could be used to force the seiners to enter the confederation fold some of it amy had heard before some she had not she was not satisfied her first comment was you didnt say anything about women what do you mean whats that got to do with anything everything as far as im concerned i want to know who your lovers were and how come you broke up what they were like youll shit in your hand and carry it to china first lady he was still a little dopey he did not realize that he had said it aloud till he began to wonder why she had shut up so suddenly after one stunned gasp amy blew out of the room like a tornado looking for a town to wreck the lady doctor came out of the background took his blood pressure shes pushy isnt she i dont know whats got into her she wasnt like that before youve had an interesting life not really i dont think id do it the same if i had it to do again well you could couldnt you i dont understand rejuvenation i thought it was available to everybody landside oh yes more or less some of the brass have been around since noah landed the ark but fate has a way of catching up with people who try to slide around it wish we had it out here you dont look that old i was thinking about my father hes getting on now i see how soon can i leave any time really but i wish youd wait a couple hours youll be weak and dizzy mouse was right about sonic sedation i know but i dont write the medical budget good luck mr benrabi try not to see me again i hate hospitals doctor he did his only stays had been at bureau insistence to modify him mentally or physically he did a few minor exercises before catching a public tram home amy was waiting oh moyshe that was stupid of me you were right those things arent any of my business she had been crying her eyes were red its all right i understand but he did not his cultural background had not prepared him for personal nosiness in confederation people lived now they did not consider the past its just that i feel well everythings so chancey the way it is between us here she comes he thought hints about getting married marriage was important to the seiners in confederation it was more an amusing relic an entertainment or daydream for the young and the romantic he could not reconcile his attitudes with seiner seriousness not yet the starfishers had won his loyalty but they could not make him a different man they could not make him reflect themselves merely by adopting him was mouse having the same trouble he wondered probably not mouse was a chameleon he could adapt anywhere vanish into any crowd i have to go to work amy told him weariness seemed to be dragging her down youd better get some rest yourself honey after she left he took out his stamp collection and turned the wellthumbed album pages mouse had opened a pandoras box by mentioning max and greta after a while he pushed the album aside and tried to compose a letter to the girl he could not think of much to say five ad the contemporary scene admirals and generals did not have to endure the usual waiting and decontamination procedures getting into luna command the security checks were abbreviated no staffgrade officer had gone sour since admiral mcgraw had turned freebooter following the peace with ulant admiral beckhart entered his office just three hours after his personal shuttle berthed a little south of the sea of tranquility he had not spared the horses in the vernacular of another age the mother had dropped hyper midway between luna and l the first message he had received had been codetagged personal presence required immediately critical either the bottom had dropped off of the universe or mcclennon and storm had come home with their saddlebags dripping delicious little secrets the crew as he called his handpicked braintrust were in the office when he arrived he raised a hand as you were what have we got jones asked you dont want to shower and change beckhart looked ragged almost seedy like a derelict costumed as an admiral you clowns sent a personal presence critical if ive got time to shit shower and shave you shouldve said it was urgent maybe we were hasty namaguchi admitted wed just scanned the crypto breakdown we were a little excited breakdown what the hells going on beckhart tumbled into a huge chair behind a vast gleaming wood desk get to the point akido namaguchi jerked out of his seat flipped a square of manila across the gleaming desk numbers your handwriting hasnt improved the sections doing up a printout that sir is what storm had for us well morgan standard coordinate data sir a stellar designation took us two days to convert it from the sangaree system sangaree holy christ is it what weve been waiting for all our lives where to find their home star ah god ah it cant be two hundred years weve been looking cutting and dying and generally carrying on like a gang of fascist assholes so it paid off i bet my butt on a long shot and it paid off give me the comm somebody give me the goddamn comm jones eased it across the desk beckhart punched furiously beckhart priority hey i dont give a damn if hes banging the queen of sheba personal critical and im going to have your ass for breakfast if you dont excuse me sir his manners improved dramatically yes sir it is i want a confirmation of our position on memorandum of permanent policy and procedure number four specifically paragraph six a long silence ensued beckharts cronies leaned closer and closer to their chief the man on the other end finally said something yes sir absolutely i have the data in my hand sir just decoded give me von drachau and the first fleet yes sir what i want is a blank check for a while i can get started tomorrow more silence then yes sir i thought so sir i understand sir thank you sir beckhart broke the connection he wants to take it up with the chiefs of staff theyre going to back down now after all the lives weve spent commander jones do you realize the enormity of what i just dumped on him let me draw you a picture i interrupted him while von staufenberg was briefing him on what we saw centerward which was about what we expected to see and as pretty as a barge loaded with dead babies some psychopathic race is doing its damnedest to kill off anything sentient it can find then i horn in and ask for a confirm on memo four slash six which is a vow to exterminate the sangaree whenever we find out where the hell theyre hiding their homeworld were supposed to be the good guys jones the things hes looking at right now kind of tend to put the damper on the fires of that good oldtime antisangaree righteousness i dont see the problem sir pragmatically it doesnt exist having seen whats going on centerward id say four slash six is a strategic imperative weve got to get those bloodsuckers off our backs fast they ate us alive during the wars with ulant and toke any time theres a dustup between nonconfederation worlds they come on like jackals raidships in swarms not to mention the price we pay in stardust addiction hell half the fleet is tied up protecting shipping four slash six would free those ships and if we burned the sangaree the mcgraws would close up shop those are the arguments in favor akido take the devils advocate it was an old game namaguchi knew his commander well sir how in gods name can we go to the people of confederation not to mention our allies with the news that weve destroyed a whole race just when were about to pump them up with moral indignation so we can justify a preemptive strike against a species we claim is guilty of the identical sin let me understate sir and say that the positions are inconsistent let me say sir that were on a quick slide down into a moral cesspool we would quite simply be the biggest hypocrites this universe has ever seen shit jones responded with no great force there isnt one in a thousand of them would ever see the inconsistency theyll cheer about the sangaree going down then go sign up for the war against these centerward creeps akido youre giving mr average man too much credit he cant even follow his credit balance let alone weigh a moral one charlie that attitude is going to destroy luna command and when we go confederation goes when confederation goes the barbarians come in in the words of the roman centurion publius minutius speaking of the legions we are the empire just a minute beckhart interjected akido come over here he pushed the comm across the desk punch up the library and get me an abstract on this minutius uh i thought so another one of your outofthedark authorities namaguchi chuckled it was a favorite trick his boss was the only man who caught him every time actually old publius probably said something more like which way to the nearest whorehouse buddy but ill stake my reputation on the fact that some roman soldier said it somewhere along the way it was true the army was the empire you dont have any reputation to stake akido jones quipped the army got a lot of help from the fact that everybody in the provinces went along with a lot of tacit rules akido beckhart remarked were getting off the subject what about mcclennons report theyre still working on it first abstracts should be up any time now the key thing weve gotten is that the starfishers did go after stars end so you guessed right on that one too i didnt guess i had inside information whatever thats where storm came up with the sangaree data raidships hit the harvestfleet there they came out on the short end the point is the seiners were sure they could pull it off the battering the sangaree gave them is what kept them from trying how soon will those boys be done debriefing i want to see them silence hit that room like a cat jumping on a mouse it stretched till it became an embarrassment well uh not one of your more endearing traits akido i dont need protecting out with it who got hurt how bad was it its not that sir they didnt come back theyre dead how did they theyre alive but they crossed over they what remember mcclennon was programed for it i know that it was my idea but he wasnt supposed to make a career out of it he didnt deprogram what the hell was wrong with storm whats his story why didnt he bring thomas out were working on it sir interrogating returnees when we can lay hands on them they scattered after they hit carsons before we knew we had a problem near as we can tell storm stayed behind because he didnt want to leave mcclennon there alone the programming must have broken down mcclennon asked to stay they kept storm from bringing him out i see that would be like mouse dont leave your wounded behind hes too much like his father i knew gneaus storm when you get to the bottom line it was his sense of honor that got him killed well ive got my honor too even if its a little discolored around the edges i dont leave my wounded behind either akido i want those boys brought out jones snorted charles whats biting your ass i was just thinking that anybody who cared as much about his troops as you put on wouldnt have thrown them back in the furnace before theyd cooled off from the broken wings and you hit them with that one before theyd cooled off from hey charlie its my conscience im the one whos got to live with it storm could handle it he didnt get the deep psychbriefings but mcclennon you probably overloaded the poor bastard he was goofy at his best times thats enough right now right here we finish crying about storm and mcclennon that understood we start figuring out how to get them back and in our spare time we worry about the four slash six and come bedtime if you get tempted to waste time sleeping start figuring how were going to get a hammerlock on the starfishers before they get their hands on stars end sir namaguchi inquired one of you clowns told me they were sure they could get in you know what happens if they do sir we bend over and kiss our asses goodbye because were dead we can hope but well still be in the line to the showers i dont follow your reasoning this time youre not looking at the whole picture thats why the gestalt if thats the right word look if they get those weapons before we do they can tell us to go pound sand and make it stick we wont get control of ambergris production meaning the fleet will have to do without adequate instel communications meaning its chances against those centerward things will go down to zit they arent your candyass ulantonids planning to give us a fair shake after they whip us on the other hand namaguchi suggested if we get the fishers under the gun in time well not only be able to equip the fleet well have the potential of the stars end weaponry assuming its adaptable there beckhart told the others you see why akido is the crown prince around here you take a stick and whack on him long enough and he actually starts thinking lets do a little brainstorming gentlemen along the lines of turning our liabilities into assets jones suggested regarding the four slash six paradox the right leak of the right info at the right time at the right place might give luna command a public opinion base that would make the kill a matter of popular demand there are some real pros in the public information office theyve done a hell of a job creating a climate of trepidation with hints about trouble in the march suppose they let a little truth wriggle out now just enough so people start asking what kind of horror were covering up by giving our friends from ulant a bad press there isnt anything the public wont swallow quicker than a good conspiracy theory especially a coverup conspiracy beckhart chuckled what is this two brains working in one room at the same time gentlemen thats a first so weve got a couple of things to work on will they let us orchestrate the show why dont we just do it it wouldnt be the first time but it could be the last weve reached a crossroads we and i mean everybody in luna command are going to have to finetune the luna command machine it wont have the internal tolerance for playing games with each other we dont have much time to get ready for this centerward race that plan is simple were going to hit them first hit them hard and keep hitting them with everything weve got the way ulant did us exactly the prime defenders general staff is doing the planning based on their intelligence shell modify it daily keeping as close to the realtime situation as she can we come up with something itll be programed in if the centerward crowd do something unexpected thatll go in too theyve sent out a whole fleet of selfdestruct equipped instelled scout ships to keep track of whats happening sir that strategy didnt work for ulant before it may not work this time but its the best shot weve got ulants intelligence analyses paint a pretty grim picture the numbers youll see the tapes while youre watching remember that youre only seeing one battle fleet ulant has identified another four they just seem to skip from star to star behind a swarm of scouts coming out the arm scouring every inhabited world of any sentient life the comm hummed beckhart stabbed it with one finger beckhart yes sir the sound was unidirectional the picture flatfaced television the others could not hear nor could they identify the caller after listening awhile beckhart said very well sir in an unhappy tone he punched out that was the csn theyve decided to go with four slash six but theyre not going to let us run it he said theyll use von drachau but r and d will have operational control r and d what the hell what have they got going over there what dont we know the comm hummed again beckhart answered said this ones for you charlie jones sat on the edge of the vast desk turned the comm his way go ahead in a few seconds his tall lean black frame began quivering with excitement good all right thank you well beckhart growled one of my electronic intercept people they just picked up a message from the starfisher council to confederation senate routine request for clearance to hold an ambergris auction they asked for the broken wings usual rules and mutual obligations the same request they send whenever they hold auction on a confederation world the broken wings is close to stars end any other reason to be excited paynes fleet is going to sponsor beckhart stared at his hands for more than a minute when he looked up his expression had become beatific gentlemen the gods love us after all cancel all leaves cancel any computation capacity loans we have out pass the word that were going on overtime everybody including the janitors and shredder operators ive got a feeling well find a rose in this dungheap yet he laughed demoniacally eyes open and ears to the ground gentlemen everything that comes in from now on and i mean everything goes into the master program for correlation and have the programming teams start working backward i want the biggest and best goddamned model outside the high command strategic analysis lets see if we cant do this all up in one big pretty package beckhart departed his desk and unlocked his personal bar he took out glasses and the half gallon of genuine old earth scotch he saved for occasions of millennial significance a toast to successes and victories hopefully ours he poured doubles six ad the main sequence the five great harvestships barely moved their velocity relative to the debris was a scant three kilometers per hour gnatlike service ships flitted before the head and flanks of their line nudging any flying mountain that threatened collision it was almost an embarrassment the way those swift monsters of the spatial deeps had to crawl elsewhere they could have sprinted off and left light lagging like a toddler behind an olympic runner here they could not match the pace of a lazily strolling old man those battered survivors of paynes fleet had been making the passage for a week the dense boulder screen gave way to a less crowded region occupied principally by asteroidal chunks the size of small moons the harvestfleet accelerated the line dispersed well you kept asking about the yards amy told benrabi were there she indicated the viewscreen they had been watching yes but all moyshe saw was a big asteroid illuminated by danions powerful lights a few smaller boulders drifted around it not one star was visible in the background all outside light was screened by the dust of the nebula danion seemed to be stalking that big asteroid but what theres nothing here were in the tail end of nowhere i expected a hidden planet maybe even osiris something first expansion strange cities drydocks planetary docks how could we take danion into atmosphere or lift her out of a gravity well most of your navy ships wouldnt try that but youd have to have thousands of people to work on a ship this big tens of thousands not to mention a hell of an industrial base and one alltime grandfather of a drydock the docks right in front of you what where watch and see he watched and he saw a gargantuan piece of rock began separating from the asteroid in time it exposed a brightly lit interior vast enough to accept a harvestship diminutive tugs swarmed out some pushed the cork some hurried toward danion like eager bees to a clover patch benrabi saw a glow in the remote distance another asteroid was opening its stone mouth were going inside you got it you catch on quick dont you smart mouth theyll lock the door behind us then theyll flood the chamber with air the work goes faster that way and the dock will hide us from any snoopers who wander by who would come poking around in a mess like this that would be asking to get fineground between those flying millstones benrabi was less surprised by the existence of the nebula than by the seiners willingness to hazard it similar asteroidal shoals existed inside several dust nebulae but they come anyway moyshe thiss the three sky nebula no not really yes i guess youre serious one of the most dramatic actions of the ulantonid war had occurred in the outer shoals of the three sky nebula after the war the repatriated human survivors had circulated stories of having seen abandoned alien ships there some had been wrecks some had appeared to be intact three sky had won an immediate reputation as a sargasso of space the treasureseekers xenoarchaeologists and official investigators who went there hunting the alien ships were seldom seen again the expeditions there must have been fifteen or twenty that disappeared what happened to them we interned them before they could stumble onto something and run home to report it theyre doing what they came to do they just cant go home why risk setting up here if the traffic gets so heavy the risk isnt that big we dont have visitors very often not when they always disappear and of course its such an unlikely place to look for us still theres been talk at luna command off and on about sending a squadron to back up an investigation in case its mcgraws or sangaree that have been getting the others if that happened wed fight and wed win only a fool would attack what weve made out of three sky weve been here since before the ulantonid war thats a lot of time to get ready itd be almost like guerrilla warfare we think we can hold off confederation if we ever have to i think youre a little overoptimistic for people who dont have the muscle to duke it out with the sharks ill let you know for sure after ive looked things over why do you say that because i havent met a seiner yet who had the least idea of just how big and strong confederation is or how tough luna command can be when they put their minds to it or that your weapons systems are prehistoric relics danions got a ton of firepower but one empire class battleship could carve this whole harvestfleet up like a side of beef and never get in a sweat i think youre probably too impressed with your navy our shortcomings were calculated into our defense plans benrabi decided not to argue each of them was telling the truth as he or she knew it are the creches here some all of them will be someday its a big job civilizing a nebula mainly an engineering problem id think yes but it takes time and money especially money we have to buy everything we cant manufacture ourselves which means we have to wait for the auctions because our credit is pretty slim ah i begin to see why the good doctor was making do with primitive equipment weve colonized more than seven thousand asteroids moyshe amy proudly declared but weve only just begun theyre all cramped the harvestships are cramped our other hidden places are overcrowded weve been taking in confederations dropouts for two hundred years the ones who didnt become mcgraws or run away to the outworlds outworlds was a word as relative as yonder for benrabi born an old earther it meant anything off old earth around luna command it meant any planet not one of the original seven founders of confederation those seven usually called themselves the inner worlds but out on the fringes of confederation outworlds were human planets not signatory to the federal pact benrabi was unsure which meaning amy wanted to convey you didnt answer my question he said why here because of the industrial advantages the stories those internees took back were true theres a lot of salvageable stuff here weve identified over thirty thousand wrecks and abandoned ships built by seven different races really he ticked fingers he could name five not counting humanity six if he counted the prehistoric race that had built stars end ill give you human and ulantonid from the war who were the others i thought youd wonder why theyd be here he frowned at her was she trying to bait him by showing off her superior knowledge savoring one minuscule advantage he knew more than she about almost everything and she seemed to take it as a personal affront i imagine because its a good place to lay an ambush thats why carolingian came here during the war her smile shrank yeah and because its close to the obvious space lanes moyshe thereve been battles here for ages probably for millions of years or even billions except for the wrecks from the ulantonid war which i didnt even count none of the ships here were built by any race weve ever met they were all extinct before man ever left old earth or at least they were gone from this part of the galaxy they all predate any of the races we have encountered ask the starfish about them we did were not stupid but they dont have much to tell they dont pay any more attention to hard matter races than we do to bacteria less really because were curious and they arent were pretty sure one bunch of ships though belonged to a race that moved the ancestors of the sangaree from earth to wherever it is their homeworld is ah dont let mouse know about that hell drive you crazy trying to get to them only in this century had geneticists surrendered to the popular notion that human and sangaree sprang from the same root stock the man in the street would not believe in a parallel evolution so similar that it could produce a being indistinguishable from himself scientists had demurred citing no evidence on old earth for extraterrestrial intervention then the abandoned alien base beneath the moons dark side had been discovered some major rethinking had been necessary then had come confirmation of reports that the human female could occasionally be impregnated by the sangaree male the most famous or infamous of sangaree agents michael dee had been half human mouse will be protected from himself benrabi studied her she wore an oddly ferocious expression amy ive been here almost fourteen months and youre still springing surprises on me when are you going to run out he stared into the hollow asteroid and awaited her response moyshe what happened to the people who built stars end well probably never know unless somebody cracks its defenses well do that were going back that was a rhetorical question wait a sec back to stars end after what happened youre out of your minds youre all raving lunatics she laughed moyshe they left their ships behind when they disappeared right here god knows how many of them there are three sky occupies a cubic lightyear we havent explored a tenth of it they had their yards and secret places too most of the ships we find were theirs they were the people who transported the sangaree we think we have explorers who dont do anything but hunt for their hideouts every one we find is one we dont have to build for ourselves he spoke to the engulfing maw in the viewscreen shes serious absolutely darling absolutely oh were not really sure that it was the same race that did all three things but the computers go with the probability see these are mostly good ships moyshe they arent derelicts some of them still have a little emergency power left they try to scare us off with mind noises the way stars end does and they have parts missing somebody took off all their weapons i wish we had a whole army of xenoarchaeologists and anthropologists its really interesting i always go see what theyre working on whenever we come in the scientists dont go very fast theyre mostly ones we captured so they arent real enthusiastic about helping us out they train some of our people as aides sometimes old folks and birth defect types who cant do much else that dont make sense people dont abandon good ships amy where did they go why how and if they did build stars end why she shrugged they werent people moyshe not our kind dont judge their motives by ours i wouldnt though some ideas would seem universal just thinking questions out loud the questions are why i wish we had more scientists she switched the viewscreen over to a stern camera danion was well into the asteroids interior they could be the same creatures that did the tunneling at luna command but were they really is there a connection between the moon and three sky and stars end were we meant to find stars end and three sky is it all some kind of big puzzle that were supposed to figure out is it a test you think they were planning to come back who knows the questions are all a hundred years old the answers havent been born and if we ever do answer any of them then right away were going to ask three more anyway those old ships are our main reason for being here some we fix up and use they make good service ships if they can be adapted we scavenge some for materials to build harvestships we only buy outside if we have to usually the freehaulers make our purchases landside for a commission and make delivery to an asteroid at the edge of the nebula they think its just a way station they dont ask questions too many questions is bad for business they dont try very hard to follow us around either theyre good people is that a cut if you think so i suspected the freehaulers i know they had something to do with me and mouse getting caught hows chances of me getting to look at one of those ships i know a little about xenoarchaeology a girls face crossed his mind alyce she had been his academy love she had been a recorder at the alien digs in the moon she had taught him a little and the bureau had taught him more sooner or later the bureau touched every base youll have to ask jarl i dont think hell let you though were going to be awful busy repairing danion plus youve got your citizenship classes and your beer nights with mouse now dont start that again hes my friend and thats the way its going to stay it dont hurt for him and me to play a couple of games of chess once in a while you can come keep an eye on us if you think were cooking up a plot against the greater seiner empire lieutenant she ignored his sarcasm i dont feel like it i always she stopped before she began waving the red flag their positions were inflexible argument would be pointless moyshe weve got to get danion whipped into shape fast the fleets are coming in as soon as theyre all here were leaving for auction and another crack at stars end stars end stars end thats all i hear anymore and its completely insane we cant stick our necks in that noose again amy look what it cost last time and remember i was there too i was outside with the starfish i know what that planet can do weve got to have those weapons moyshe you saw the casualty reports you saw the extrapolations what the sharks are doing now is going to look pacifistic in ten years were talking survival love and youre still thinking power politics youll just get yourselves killed either way then but well handle stars end honest the fish really do know how to open the way they found the key while we were there before huh he had not caught a hint from chub the sangaree or confederation theyd better come toting their guns if they want to steal it from us moyshe because theyll have a hell of a fight on their hands theres a lot of us honey and were looking for a fight people have been pushing us ever since i can remember were tired of it once we get those weapons and sharks darling dont forget the sharks oh its bound to be a gay party how do i get transferred to a ground job you dont she laughed i just heard a couple hours ago youre going to be transferred to security for the auction project she did not tell him that the auction project would be a pilot for a more ambitious program if he and storm performed well and faithfully they would be given joint chieftainship of their own espionage outfit she did not think her own boss jarl kindervoort knew yet the ships commander seemed reluctant to discuss it with the man auction thats mouses special haunt howd he get stuck with it anyway its going to be yours too our new mindtechs will start coming aboard in a couple of days and youll move over to the project why because you know the broken wings yeah and i want to forget it his previous mission as a bureau agent had taken him to the broken wings it had been a nasty affair thats where the auctions going to be held they already sent the permission request its just form from here on form what you want to bet the place is crawling with confies and sangaree you people stirred up some bad feelings she hit you pretty hard eh what the woman the sangaree woman that marya strehltsweiter what how did you mouse shooting off his mouth he didnt exactly volunteer it and he told jarl not me i found out when i was looking through the files for something else all right his heart hammered for no reason he could justify to himself so he had gotten involved with the woman he had not known she was sangaree then its over i know i knew that a long time ago mouse wrote that report after you shot her i guess he thought it was important for jarl to understand what you were going through that did not sound like mouse she wouldve killed all of us sooner or later i had to do it i never shot anybody before especially somebody you still halfway cared about eh yeah can we drop it did mouse really do that inject her children with stardust yes mouse plays for keeps he doesnt have trouble with his conscience not the way i do you really think the sangaree will be at the auction theyll be there they hold a grudge the way mouse does amy i dont want to get involved in that im happy where im at i like linking chub is a good friend i was just scared there at first ive been getting to know the other members of the herd hell sometimes i go in just to bullshit with chub benrabi could relax with the starfish as he could with no human he did not feel naked when he let the starfish see what he really felt and thought chub made no value judgments his values were not human he had in fact helped moyshe make some small peace within himself parts of his mind remained inaccessible to the starfish whole sections were hidden behind rigid walls moyshe could not guess what might lie there he could sense nothing missing from his past seiner life was changing mouse too he reflected storm was becoming even more sure of himself more biggerthanlife than he had always been benrabi could not pin it down one or two nights a week playing chess together was not the same as sharing a minute to minute life under fire mouse was an operative born he had changed allegiance but not professions he had become part of jarl kindervoorts staff flying easy that was what benrabi had been doing since his release from the hospital the only pressure he faced was amys nearmilitance in hinting about their getting married under chubs ministrations his neuroses were scaling away he had come to the seiners with a great many not much more to see amy told him the rearmost cameras were inside the asteroid the tugs were guiding the cork back toward the entrance what oh id better go say goodbye to chub he reached contact almost as quickly as he had the day of the last battle clara wheres hans hes off we dont have anything going i want to go in theyre telling me im going to be transferred you cant were closed down moyshe theyll be cutting power in a minute heck the herd should be out of range by now clara i probably wont ever get another chance ah moyshe its silly but all right get on the couch she prepared his scalp and the hairnet device in seconds the helmet devoured his head almost before he could catch his breath he shifted to tsd then onward the colors of the nebula were incredible it was a dreary place to the eye completely dark unless illuminated artificially in this internal universe moyshe could reach out and touch all the specks of it the clouds of luminescent dust the glowing asteroids majestically circling the nebulas center in their millionyear orbits he could even sense the protostar down in the nebulas heart lying patiently in its timewomb gathering the sustenance it would need to blaze for eons chub his mind shouted into the color storm are you there can you hear me for a time he thought there would be no answer the herd lay far off the bounds of the nebula beyond the pain threshold of its diminutive gravitation then moyshe manfriend what is happening the link was tenuous he could barely discern the starfishs thoughts he could not locate the creature with his inner sight i came to say goodbye chub they say im not going to be a mindtech anymore you were right they want me to go back to being what i was ah i am saddened moyshe manfriend i am saddened because you are sad we have been good friends i am pleased that you thought it important to let me know so many linkers just disappear perhaps this last time we can break through those barriers moyshe manfriend but those corners of benrabis mind would not yield moyshe claras voice seemed to come from kilometers away theyre going to shut the power off youve got to come out farewell moyshe manfriend benrabi could feel the sadness in the starfish go softly golden dragon he whispered my heart flies with you down the long dark journey chubs sadness welled up moyshe could not stand it he pounded the switch beneath his left hand there was very little pain he had not been under long i dont need it clara he pushed the needle away moyshe youre crying no but no just leave me alone all right he heard the hurt in her voice he struggled off of the couch pulled her to him im sorry clara i havent known you very long but youve been a good friend ill miss you and hans too tell him to behave i see that he does hes my grandson oh i didnt know what had he heard about hanss sister or was it mother she had been lost with jariel clara had never let on therere a lot of things you dont know moyshe benrabi about people because you never get around to asking clara clara come visit will you yes promise amy would love to meet you i promise now get out of here before somebody calls the boss and wants to know what the hells going on up here thanks clara thanks a lot for everything his return trip was less precipitous he was not eager to get home amy was bound to be waiting with some unimaginative new approach to the subject of marriage seven ad the main sequence whats the occasion benrabi asked he had come home to find amy clad only in a negligee she had been playing body games all week he supposed she was holding out in hopes lust would make him propose she was going to be disappointed he was not seventeen the tactic did not bode well for their relationship there was no future in any relationship where one party practiced extortion upon the other no one endured that for long and benrabi had had his fill of it from alyce way back when was this why he was so reluctant because amy came on like a spoiled child why did he resist it if he was to make a life here he had to surrender to the culture this one had scant tolerance for prolonged bachelorhoods older singles tended to get shoved beyond the social fringes he was out there now and mouse for all the charm he exuded was slipping too the ladies were not buzzing round so much anymore he had made it too clear that he was available for good times only not for long times and oldstyle fidelity if amy was the best available why not part of it was habit he had been a loner for too long caught up in a profession where responsibilities to anyone else made a deadly liability that was why through mission after mission he had fought his growing friendship for mouse he had failed at that and mouse had too they saw so little of one another nowadays that was a pity just when they had given in to it life had taken a twist and spun them along separate paths that would end with his transfer to security wouldnt it theres a bright side to everything i guess he murmured thinking about mouse he remembered their last evening together he could have sworn mouse had been hinting that he should do something about amy it was a damned conspiracy why the hell would mouse want him married mouse did not believe in the institution he should take the plunge but not too soon he could not let amy get the idea that she could manipulate him he sat with his head in his hands scurrying around the slottracks of an uncertain mind the tracks did not always follow sane routes there were moments when he did not know who or where he was sometimes he did not understand what was happening or why sometimes he woke up thinking he was back on the broken wings or in luna command there had been a night when he had called amy max while they were making love and a time when he had thought she was greta frightening though they were those had been isolated incidents so far he and amy made love fiercely desperately she started getting dressed immediately afterward whats going on he asked you forgot were supposed to have supper with the sheik and his harem one thing im going to tell you right now woman and you better understand it that mans my friend learn to fly with it he had forgotten the dinner completely there wasnt a ghost of memory to be found anywhere in his head they joined mouse and his shrinking clutch of dollies an hour later benrabi found his eye roving mouse had several honeys he would not mind topping himself he dared not let amy notice him looking any woman who got that jealous of a male friend this affair is headed for trouble he thought kindervoort appeared suddenly jarl kindervoort was a tall lean man who reminded benrabi of don quixote or the pale imperator in czyzewskis novel his banners bright and golden like amy and most danion seiners he was pale blond and blueeyed benrabi liked him as a person and found him physically repulsive it was a combination he did not comprehend he did not quite understand kindervoorts position in the danion scheme either kindervoort was apparently amys immediate superior amy was only a lieutenant a lowgrade officer yet her boss seemed to speak for danions whole security force the ship had a population matching that of a fairsized city could the police force be that small kindervoort had high cheekbones and a lantern jaw they gave him a deaths head look his pale eyes were seldom happy he could have given mouse lessons in cold stares yet he was a genuinely warm and caring person he asked may i join you sure jarl mouse said glad to have you amy and benrabi nodded kindervoort settled down plunged into his meal tray he did not join the table banter neither did benrabi though amy brightened for a while and kept up with mouse in a thrust and parry duel of the risqué and outré during his dessert kindervoort asked you told him yet what oh i forgot amy replied told me what benrabi asked were moving you to security starting tomorrow for the auction project oh that i know who told you im not stupid jarl i may act it but im a trained professional i can see the signs and add the numbers ah exactly thats why we want you on the auction thing youre a professional and you know the broken wings paynes fleet has gotten the shove into the barrel this time payne thinks danion should provide the protection for our auction crew off the record id guess we get the auction because gruber doesnt want any payne people with him at stars end what stars end christ im starting to hope a rogue singularity comes romping around and gobbles up that goddamned gunrunners pyramid like a big fat chocolate cherry moyshe what in the name of jarl you people are crazy every last one of you i wont stand around on the steps of the senate screaming beware the ides of march but only because none of you whackos have got the sense to listen its going to kill you cant you get that through your thick heads but what do i care youre only taking me down with you all right what do you want me on the broken wings for security shift leader down in angel city night shift i picked your men already i want you to start drilling them tomorrow the feedback we get says it might get hairy whatd i tell you benrabi told amy to kindervoort at the risk of sounding inane why me you and mouse both because you know the city yeah and he gets stuck with the other shift twelve hours at a crack wait its only nine on the broken wings but thats bad enough watch and watch with some guy around every corner waiting to burn you you know what youre asking us to walk into what kindervoort would not meet his eye he knew mouse killed her kids i shot her here and you let her get away shell be there if she has to walk halfway across the galaxy when she hears our fleet is going to handle it it wont matter if she can get her peoples okay shell come kindervoort with every goddamned thing she can lay hands on come to think of it the heads will probably back her even if they dont like it theyre going to be damned hot about what happened to the raidfleet at stars end anything else bothering you moyshe what id like to hear all your objections now so we can get them out of the way ahead of time all right why trust me im the man you caught leading navy ships to your herd remember three points one youre a convert i saw your test results two the ships commander recommended you and the third id rather keep to myself benrabi tried to remember all the tests he had taken both before and after deciding to remain with the starfishers they had seemed standard but he might have missed something typical securitytype job three hours sleep and ten minutes for personals every day need them or not probably kindervoort smiled his smile did not have the desired effect on benrabi moyshe saw it as grim not friendly then id better settle my affairs because i dont expect to get through this one alive i was going to put this off a few days mouse want to be best man jarl you can stand witness everybodys invited ill put on a party in my room afterwards if we can come up with anything drinkable nobody said anything for several seconds mouse stared blankly kindervoort managed to appear both surprised and amused mouses girls just looked puzzled amy showed a half dozen quick reactions lack of comprehension stunned disbelief shock distress that threatened to become anger it isnt fair she murmured she wanted a pompous ostentatious archaicist affair with all the splendor of oldtime royal weddings youre making fun of me their friends knew how badly she wanted him to propose he had to reassure her quickly jarl can we get it done now we could start in ten minutes if youre serious go ahead moyshe that isnt fair amy cried you never even asked me and im not dressed for it and i havent got anything to wear and she had a whole list of ands and buts benrabi and kindervoort waited till she got them out of her system do i call or not amy kindervoort asked oh she hit the table with her fists yes yes dammit call him moyshe benrabi you are the meanest connivingest man ive ever known how can you do this to me hey youve been all over me about it isnt love wonderful mouse asked the air amy stopped bitching mouse had given her a look which warned her that she was pushing her luck the ceremony was not what she wanted moyshe kissed her and whispered if i get out alive youll have the real thing the big one you want thats a promise after the reception began kindervoort pulled mouse and benrabi aside finally got some word on that failsafer back when the landside contractees had been boarding the service ship for return to confederation a man had tried to kill them when it had become obvious that they were staying behind he had suicided after missing they had assumed he was a bureau agent failsafing them the autopsy finally got done kindervoort said he was sangaree sangaree mouse said it as if it were a swear word yes and he did commit suicide he was wearing a poison ring nobody killed him there wasnt a second failsafer benrabi shook his head that doesnt make sense it didnt make sense when we thought there were two of them and one got away mouse said looks to me like he was strehltsweiters man not the admirals makes sense in that context she wanted us pretty bad thats the way i figured it kindervoort said till now i halfway thought it might have been a setup to make you look more palatable it doesnt look that obvious anymore im confused though she was in intensive care all the time isolated how did she make contact how did she relay the order even assuming the failsafer was preprogramed if you come up with any theories let me know id hate to think my own people helped her uhm benrabi glanced at mouse mouse shrugged i was sure he was beckharts ever heard of a sangaree suiciding it happens borroway those were kids they didnt have any other way out and they knew too much he had to be programed whats going on amy demanded consoling the victim mouse you look like your best friend just died well talk it out later mouse no we were just talking about something jarl brought up sort of a puzzle lets dance honey it was a zestless party it did not last long neither did the honeymoon mouse dragged benrabi out early next morning hey im supposed to be a newlywed come on you been tapping it for eight months getting married didnt make it new jarl wants us time to go into training benrabi spent the next fourteen hours talking about angel city studying maps teaching the use of small arms in a coliseum cube that had been commandeered for the purpose his group consisted of twentyfive people mouse had another the same size mouse drilled his mercilessly in unarmed combat his was the easier task his students at least had some idea of what he was talking about benrabi worked at it but thought the seiners were taking everything too damned seriously despite his own admonition about how rough it could get he vacillated between a belief that they would find the broken wings hip deep in sangaree and the opposing view that navy security would be so tight that not one unfriendly would get through his fourth morning of teaching was interrupted by kindervoort moyshe sorry got to take you off this today theyve got a tour planned for citizenship applicants cant it wait this auction wont and these clowns are so bad they couldnt hurt themselves i argued i got shouted down i guess they think its important that you know what youre fighting for yeah i never did before and i did my job oh youre bitter today just frustrated the more i see the worse it looks were going to get hurt if this thing goes roman candle jarl we wont be ready do the best you can thats all you can ever do moyshe sometimes thats not enough jarl i want to do enough make a vacation out of today just relax i dont think its that important theyre supposed to show you what lifes like for starfishers who dont live on harvestships probably do you good to get away from amy too i dont know whats the matter with her shes even bitchy around the office anymore youve known her longer than i have you figure it out you tell me mouse stalked in you ready moyshe i scrounged a scooter lets go before somebody liberates it back eight ad the contemporary scene hel did not belong it was a plutosized twerp of a straggler planet which like an orphaned puppy had taken up with the first warm body it had come across when it did so it set up for business too far from the unstable cepheid it adopted even at perihelion in its lazy eggy orbit it did not receive enough warmth to melt carbon dioxide hel was a black eight ball of a world silverchased by ice lying in the canyons of its wrinkled carcass its sun was but the brightest of the stars in its sky no one would expect such a planet to exist and no one would want to visit it if a suspicion of its existence arose those were the reasons confederations navy bureau of research and development considered hel the perfect site for a bizarre dangerous and ultrasecret research project hel station lay buried in a mountain like a clam in sand its appendages reached the surface at just two points the station was not meant to be found ion marescu was a sight his waistcoat was soiled ragged and wrinkled his hose was bagged and falling his wig was askew his facial makeup was caked and streaked ion neidermeyer said a second time catching his friends elbow you hear the news von drachau is coming here marescu yanked his arm away who at the moment he did not give a damn about anything pauls news included the agony was too much for mortal man to bear he yanked a grimy silk handkerchief from a pocket cleared the water from his eyes paul should not see his tears von drachau jupp von drachau the guy who pulled off that raid in the hell stars a couple of years back you remember the commentators called him high commands fairhaired boy they talked like hed be chief of staff navy someday oh another one of your militarist heroes marescu could set in abeyance the worst blues for a good fight about the services fascist lackey paul grinned refused the bait not me ion i know you too well no fight marescu faded off into his internal reality damn her eyes how could she have done it and with that that blackamoor hey ion is something wrong more than normal ion marescu was hel stations resident crank and grouch its leading mr blues and vinegar most people shunned him unless work forced contact he had one real friend astrophysicist paul neidermeyer a lady love named melanie bounds and managed a certain strained formality with his boss kathe the eagle everybody else was fair game for his vituperation von drachau hes line isnt he why would they tell a line officer about this place they planning on locking him up ion man whats wrong you look bad why dont we take you down and get you a shower and a clean jumper one of the curiosities of ion marescu was that he appeared to change personalities with his clothing when he wore standard navy work clothing he was almost tolerable when he donned his archaicist costume he became arrogant argumentative vipertongued and abnormally misty as if half the time half of him truly did exist in eighteenthcentury england marescu paused before a mirror inset in the passage wall ignoring the people trying to pass i do look a little ragged dont i he muttered he adjusted his wig straightened the ruffles at his throat thought i wish this were georgian england i could call the bastard out settle this crap with steel but you would not have done that with a negro would you youd have gotten some friends together and played dangle the darky from a tree limb if you could have stood the shame of confessing to your friends marescu was not one of hel stations more polished archaicists the others had brought their costumes and research materials with them he had taken up the hobby only after the isolation had begun to grind him down he had sewn his own costume with melanies help he was more devoted than most station archaicists he prided himself on that as he prided himself on his contrariness his crotchets and the perfection of his work with the test programs he liked to think that he was the best at whatever he did including at making himself obnoxious he seldom noticed the compensatory sloppiness he expressed in his personal habits and hobby he had not researched his period thoroughly he winged most of it his hobbyera values and beliefs were based on hearsay there were those who thought the dichotomy between a perfectionist work life and slovenly play life taken far too seriously was indicative of deep disturbance admiral adler disagreed she felt marescu was all showoff marescu started walking he had forgotten paul neidermeyer seized his arm again ion if i cant help who can weve been friends for years its not something anybody can help with paul its melanie i got off shift early the quark tube was acting up the strange positives and bottom negs were coming off almost a millidegree out of track they couldnt inject them into their orbital shells they shut down she had mitchell with her neidermeyer murmured an insincere im sorry he thought so what and wondered if marescu was not getting a little too far out of touch maybe the staff psychologists should hear about this a man who started confusing the mores of now with those of his hobby period was more than a little unstable ion always had been neurotic now he seemed to have become marginally psychotic how could she do it paul calm down youre shaking follow me my son what you need is a little firewater to settle the old nerves eh none of that now doctors orders drink up then tell me about it and well scope something out yeah a drink okay marescu decided to get blotted tell me about this von dago von drachau rhymes with cracow like in poland poland where the hell is poland where they raise the chinese pigs neidermeyer grinned marescu stopped walking his thin little face puckered into a baffled squint seconds passed before the intuition that made him one of confederations better test programers clicked the non sequitur game we havent played in ages have we poland chinese pigs poland china hogs isnt that the strain they were talking about on that ag show the other day they want to breed back to something extinct i dont know what they smell like okay paul im all right now ease up that was a weak one anyway just give me the story on your mercenary hero neidermeyer refused the challenge i dont know much its just something i overheard at security they were chasing their tails getting ready guess it took them by surprise were here whatre you drinking they stepped off the escalator into soft luminescence just bright enough to prevent stumbling over furniture the lounge had been designed to give an impression of being open to hels surface its protective dome was undetectable the lighting was too diffuse to glare off the glassteel the dome itself pimpled from the flank of a mountain overlooking dark peaks and cruel gorges the milky way burned above a billionjeweled expanse of glory ever notice how it seems colder up here marescu asked for at least the hundredth time in their acquaintance he stared out at the poorly illuminated skin of the dead world the inconstant cepheid sun hung behind a peak limning it with a trace of gold in its off moments that sun was little more noticeable than the brighter neighboring stars you pick it paul im not particular today but build it big neidermeyer collected brandy and glasses from behind the bar francis must have gone down for the security festival he said a marine with an unpronounceable old earther name dubbed francis bacon by the research staff usually tended bar security had very little to do most of the time so filled time by trying to make the station more endurable for everyone people came to hel on a oneway ticket only the director of research and chief of security ever ventured off world for security reasons there was no instel comm system available isolation was absolute brandy marescu asked startled paul was a whisky man old earths best ion almost makes being here worthwhile marescu downed half a snifter at a gulp they ought to turn us loose now paul we built their damned bombs all were doing now is piddling around with makework they wont though security wont be any leaks as long as they keep us here paul how could she you knew she was when i got involved i know i keep telling myself but that doesnt make it hurt any less paul what can i tell you marescu stared into his empty snifter ion maybe you ought to ease up on the archaicist thing try to get your perspective back the modern perspective sucks paul you know that theres no humanity in it you probably laugh at me because of this outfit its a symbol paul its a symbol of times when people did have real feelings when they cared ive got feelings ion i care about you youre my friend you dont not really youre just here because having feelings bothers you neidermeyer glared there were times when being ions friend was work marescu refused to apologize paul took his brandy to the side of the dome he stared at the indistinct hide of hel the critical question glared back from the serpent eyes of his own weak reflection should marescu be reported was he that far gone nobody wanted to turn in a friend the psych people could lock him up forever their zoo of helborn mental mutations was a bluechip growth industry the project was too delicate to risk its compromise by the unbalanced but the production team needed ion nobody had his sure delicate touch with the test systems best let it ride and hope he would come around this thing with melanie could be a positive if it jarred him back to reality paul turned he looked at a thin short weary little man who had a thousand years etched into his face and a million agonies flaring from his narrow little black eyes right decision those eyes were lamps of torment backfired by incipient madness something rattled the foundations of the universe the snowy landscape glowed a deep bloody red the glow faded quickly marescu turned an ashen color he stumbled to the dome face caressed it with shaking fingers paul that was damned close they could have destabilized one of the test cores wed have been blown into the next universe fear had drained neidermeyers face too he mumbled but nothing happened im complaining anyway they ought to have better sense feeling the breath of the angel on his neck had snapped his streak of selfpity he stared into the darkness outside a pale new light had begun etching the shadows more deeply one brilliant point of light slid across the screen of fixed stars growing more intense theyre coming in fast hels surface was screaming under a storm of violetwhite light when the dome polarized the glass continued to respond to the light beating against it its inner surface crawling with an iridescence like that of oil on water doctor neidermeyer mister marescu excuse me a moment they turned marine major gottfried feuchtmayer stood at the escalators head he was deputy chief of security and a man who appeared to have just stepped out of a recruiting commerical he was the quintessential marine bet he wakes up looking like that marescu muttered what is it major neidermeyer asked we need your assistance in the arsenal we need two devices for shipboard installation marescus stomach went fluttery the butterflies donned alpine boots and started dancing major briefing in final process in fifteen minutes gentlemen thank you neidermeyer nodded the major descended the escalator so marescu snapped theyll never use it eh youre a fool paul maybe they wont you dont know maybe its a field test of some kind dont lie to yourself no more than you already are the damned bomb doesnt need testing i already tested it theyre going to blow up a sun paul ions mouth worked faster and faster his voice rose toward a squeak not some star paul a sun somebodys sun the goddamned murdering fascists are going to wipe out a whole solar system calm down ion calm down i cant i wont how many lives paul how many lives are going to be blasted away by those firecrackers weve given them theyve made bloody fools of us havent they they suckered us smug little purblind fools that we are we made ourselves believe that it would never go that far but we were lying to ourselves we knew they always use the weapon no matter how horrible it is paul did not respond marescu was reacting without all the facts and saying things everyone else thought but did not say for the research staff service at hel station had been a deal with the devil each scientist had traded physical freedom and talent for unlimited funding and support for a pet line of research the station was ultrasecret but the knowledge it produced was reshaping modern science the place seethed with new discoveries all navy had asked for its money was a weapon capable of making a sun go nova navy had its weapon now the scientists had scrounged around and found a few hawking holes left over from the big bang had pulled a few megatrillion quarks out of a linear accelerator which circumscribed hel itself had sorted them had stacked them in orbital shells around the minisingularities and had installed these cores in a delivery system the carrier missile would perish in the fires of a star but the core itself would sink to the stars heart before the quark shells collapsed mixing positives and negatives in a tremendous energy yield which would ignite a swift and savage helium fusion process navy had its weapon and now apparently a target for it what have you done paul i dont know ion god help me if youre right the passageways were acrawl with marines marescu swore i didnt realize there were so many of the bastards they been breeding on us wheres everybody else the usual back and forth of technical and scientific staffs had ceased civilians were scarce at final process they were told to report to the arsenal instead they found three civilians waiting outside the scarlet door the director though was an r d admiral in civilian disguise thiss a farce marescu growled at her two hundred comic opera soldiers can it ion paul whispered the director did not bat an eye theyre watching you ion they dont like your mouth marescu was startled ordinarily even the eagle did not bite back whats going on kathe neidermeyer asked marescu grinned kathe adler kathe the eagle it was one of those nasty little jokes that drift around behind an unpopular superiors back admiral adler had a thin wedge of a face an alltime beak of a nose and a receding hairline never had a birthname fit its bearer so well theyre taking delivery on the product paul i want you to work with their science officers ion youll prepare a test program for their shipboard computers theyre going to use it arent they marescu demanded i hope not we all hope not ion shit i believe that like i believe in the tooth fairy he glanced at paul neidermeyer was trying to believe he was like all the science staff keeping himself fed on lies ships down major a marine lieutenant announced very well feuchtmayer replied wed better get lined out the director said paul pick whomever you want to help ion youll have to visit the ship to see what youll be working with i want your preliminary brief as soon as you can write it josip get with their weapons officers and draw up the preparatory specs for carrying mounts and launch systems have the people in the shops drop everything else josip asked we have to build it all here from scratch orders but gentlemen theyre in a hurry i suggest you get started they brought the whole ship down paul asked ships seldom made planetary landings thats right they dont want to waste time working from orbit that would take an extra month but that was dangerous business the ships crew would stay crazybusy balancing her gravity fields with the planets if they made one mistake the vessel would be torn apart it shouldnt take more than twelve days this way admiral adler speculated assuming we hit no snags lets go she pushed through the red door the completed weapons had a sharkish deadly look looking nothing like bombs the four devices were spaced around the arsenal floor each was a lean needle of black a hundred meters long and ten in diameter they were longer than the shuttle craft intended to lift them to orbit antennae and the snouts of nasty defensive weapons sprouted from their dark skins like scrub brush from an old burned slope they were fully automated little warships the essentials of the nova bomb occupied space that would have been given over to crew in manned vessels they were fast and shielded heavily enough to punch through a powerful defense the weapon remained largely theoretical but the men who had created it were confident it would function neidemeyer whispered to marescu as they donned working suits trying to convince his friend and himself that they were just gearing up for a field test im sure the money people just want to see if theyre getting any return on their investment he insisted you cant blame them for wanting to try their new toy yeah our hero von drachau is going to take potshots at a couple of insignificant stars right right youre a fool paul a band of strangers entered the arsenal they stared at the four dark needles clearly awed and a little frightened thats von drachau on the right paul whispered i recognize him from the holo only he looks a lot older looks a little grey around the gills id say von drachau did look depressed he spoke with the major and kathe adler kathe led his party around one of the missiles von drachau became more impressed there was something about the big terrible ones that excited a resonance in the soul it was almost a siren call marescu felt it himself each time he touched one of the monsters he was ashamed of himself when he did little boys play with firecrackers and big boys play with bombs he muttered ease up kathe meant it when she said theyre watching you feuchtmayer isnt one of your big fans ion ill stay out of his way the days whipped past technicians swarmed over the pair of weapons von drachau selected marescu tested systems and supervised the installation of special shipping aids josip brought the missiles computation systems into communion with the battle computers aboard von drachaus ship technicians designed and installed adapters and links that would fit the securing rings and launch vanes going onto the belly of the warship neidermeyer prepared a manual for the science officers responsible for arming the sunkiller and monitoring its gluon pulse in passage watching for that tiny anomaly that might forecast the expansion of a quark shell into disaster marescu could not believe there was so much to do his shifts were long and demanding he felt a lot of sympathy for paul whose personal research project seemed threatened with death by inattention neidermeyer watched his friend more closely than he did the gluon pulse hunting some telltale psychological anomaly marescu seemed almost too much in control and had thrown himself into his work with a nearfanaticism that bespoke a very fragile stability fighting its last stand yet there were positive signs ion had shed the filthy archaicist outfit he had begun devoting more time to his personal appearance then it was over kathe adler joined them in the lounge let the firewater flow she proclaimed its time to say the hell with it and turn loose of the brass ring for a while marescu gave her an odd look the celebration became a premature new years bash the pressure was off the antagonisms went on the shelf for the day guilts got tucked away scientists and technicians made shows of comradeship with the marines a handful of von drachaus officers joined in drinking lightly listening to the jokes but seldom laughing for them its just begun ion murmured he glanced around no one had heard him von drachau was a focus of brooding gloom he seemed to have sunk twothirds into another universe ion watched him glare at paul as if neidermeyer were some small venomous insect when paul tried to strike up a conversation about the raid in the hell stars von drachau disappeared only minutes later dont think you made an impression my friend ion said kathe agreed hes sensitive about it paul hes a strange one you should have heard the row he and ion had marescu met pauls gaze it wasnt any big thing i came on a little too strong thats all what was it neidermeyer asked about the morality of using the weapon kathe said von drachau is damned near a pacifist ion was pretty shook when he found out the man could adapt his convictions enough to let him use the weapon ions problem is that hes an absolutist hes got to have everything black or white and hes getting worse is there any way we can get him into therapy without having him committed you think theres a reason to worry his profiles keep coming up offcenter but they never show any danger sometimes lately hes got a creepy feeling to him except for that argument with von drachau hes swung too far away from what he was im nervous about the backswing like i can hear the timer clicking he might break loose going the other way they had begun talking about marescu as if he were not around for the very good reason that he was not though neither of them had consciously marked his departure kathe adler had called von drachau a cryptopacifist and marescu had seen red literally the dome and people went raggedly liquid and red then it was all clear all perfectly clear he had to go see melanie and explain he was walking down a passageway time seemed to have passed he had the distinct feeling that his head was on sideways that mercenary von drachau the man had kicked the foundations out from under him a flexible morality how could there be such a thing a thing was either right or it wasnt the nova bomb was the most evil thing yet conceived by the military mind and he had helped midwife that evil into this universe he had allowed himself to be seduced he had whored himself there had to be a way to show them what they were doing he shook his head violently things were foggy a band seemed to be tightening around his temples there was something wrong he could not force his thoughts into a straight line for an instant he considered finding a psych officer von drachau seemed to laugh at him again you fascist bastard christ some torquemada had taken another turn on the strap his skull was creaking with the pressure where am i he blurted his feet had been moving without conscious direction he tried to concentrate on his surroundings what am i doing here he wanted to turn and go back his feet kept going in the direction he was headed his hand pushed on melanies door he was an alien a passenger aboard a body under anothers control he was a slightly panicky observer of actions being carried out by another creature the little gasps and grunts lashed that devil punishing it like a wizards curse he stared at the eightlimbed twentytoed beast it heaved and lunged its four blind eyes rolled swiftly its three uncontrolled mouths made wet hungry sounds the ion of him silently screamed and turned inward refusing to see any more a darkness closed round it a clumsy puppeteer jerked him around dragged him out the door and down the passageway with jerky meandering drunken steps when next the ion rider surfaced it found its steed in the arsenal clad in its georgian bent over the computer board in the heavily shielded test control kiosk the clock claimed that hours had vanished from his life his hands and fingers were flying a pair of pale white dancing spiders they were doing something dreadful he did not know what and they would not stop when he commanded them he watched them like a baffled child watching slow death an image here an image there surged into his mind playing back fragments of the missing hours ion marescu crawled over a long black needle ion marescu crouched beneath the needle connecting the heavy cables that ran to the test station ion marescu squeezed through the cramped interior of the black ship removing safety chips ion pauls voice barely penetrated the thick stressglass of the booths walls he was screaming ion realized the yelling had been going on for a while he glanced at paul puzzledly barely recognizing him he did not stop working this was the most important test he had ever run for the first time in his life he was doing something of real worth he had found himself a holy mission what was it he shook his head tried to clear the mists they would not go his hands danced kathe adler joined paul they pounded the unbreakable glass with their fists then the woman fled paul grabbed a fire axe and swung away when ion next glanced up the vast arsenal floor was acrawl with marines major feuchtmayer had his pale face pressed against the glass directly in front of him his lips writhed obscenely he was screaming something ion had no time to listen he had to hurry what the hell was going on out there the observer part of him wondered he finished programing the test sequences each weapon had to be run through a simulated plunge into hels own sun ion usually performed the test series on a systembysystem basis with the drive never operational and the safety chips preventing the weapon from going active how do we know the drive will work marescu muttered we just take their word for it paul and the marines stopped trying to break the glass with hand tools ion saw the major laying a sticky grey rope of something round the door frame plastic explosives my god what are those madmen trying to do his right hand depressed the big black palm switch that opened the arsenals huge exit doors it was through those very doors that that hired assassin von drachau had moved his two missiles to his ship people flung in all directions as the arsenal air burst into hels eternal night baffled marescu watched their broken doll figures tumble and bloat his left hand danced initiating the test sequences the arsenal drowned in intense light the stressglass of the booth polarized but could not block it all the sabotaged holding blocks fell away from the number four weapon it dragged itself forward off its dolly it flung off clouds of sparks and gouged its spoor deep into the concrete floor wait a minute ion said wait a minute theres something wrong its not supposed to do that paul where did you go paul paud did not answer the black needle its tail a stinger of whitehot light lanced into the night dwindled the little star of it drifted to one side and downward as its homing systems turned its nose toward the target whats happening marescu asked plaintively paul what went wrong the eye of the black needle fixed itself on hels sun it accelerated at g and in the booth where the atmospheric pressure had begun to fall ion marescu realized the enormity of what he had done with a shaking hand he took a suggestion form from a drawer and began composing a recommendation that in future all test programs be crossprogramed in such a way that the activation of any one would automatically lock out the others we have influence commander lieutenant callaway reported take hyper von drachau replied and destroy that hel astrogational cassette as soon as you have her in the hyper arc for the record gentlemen weve never heard of this place we dont know anything about it and weve never been here he stared into a viewscreen slumped wondering what he was what he was doing and whether or not he had been told the whole truth the screen went kaleidoscopic at the instant of hypertake then blanked seventeen minutes and twentyone seconds later the sun of the world he had just fled felt the first touch of a black needle the little manmade gamete fertilized the great hydrogen ovum in a few hours the nova chain would begin there would be no survivors security allowed no ships to remain on hel the station personnel could do nothing but await their fate and nowhere else did there exist one scrap of information on the magnificent deadly weapon created at hel station that too had been a securitydecreed precaution nine ad the main sequence mouse drove down to the same departure station that had witnessed the sangaree failsafers suicide a half dozen bewildered former landsmen were there already he and benrabi were last to arrive all but one of the others were women they havent shown yet ellen mouse asked no did you hear anything you know what its about not really benrabi tuned them out he walked through those last few minutes before kindervoorts men had come to disarm mouse and he had walked into the failsafers line of fire he went to the spot where he had been standing turned slowly jarl was here mouse was there bunch of people were there they brought maryas intensive care unit down that way before jarl showed and took her right into the service ship he walked through it three times he could not recall anything new he had been distracted at the time he had believed that mouse was shanghaiing him and had not wanted to leave then jarl had distracted him hey mouse walk through this with me maybe you can think of something a scooter rolled into the bay a pair of unfamiliar starfishers dismounted you the citizenship class the woman asked hello there mouse said like a man who had just crossed a ridgeline and spied all seven cities of cibola the woman stepped back her eyes widening must be storm the man said my wife mister storm well you win some lose some you dont know till you try i suppose not all right lets check the roll then get started looks like were good weve got the right number of heads all right what were going to do is leave the ship through the personnel lock and line over to one of the work bays on one of the mooring stays theres zero gravity in the work area so you dont have to worry about falling follow me he went to a hatchway opened it stepped through the future seiner citizens followed mouse tried hanging back to get nearer to the woman benrabi gouged his ribs come on let her alone moyshe shes driving me crazy shes prime yes and married and we dont need any more enemies hey it isnt sex i mean shes fine like you say prime stuff what im saying though is this is our shot at somebody from outside whatre you talking about shes not from danion how the hell do you know that benrabi ducked through the third of the lock doors youve maybe been around the world here but i dont think youve gotten to them all not yet we havent run into a hundredth of danions people but the ones we have all came from the same mold oh christ benrabi slithered out of the ship he stood on her skin offering mouse a hand in both directions as far as he could see were tubes cubes spars bars hectare on hectare of abused metal overhead the laserpolished stone of the asteroid arched in an almost indiscernible bow danions outermost extremities cleared it by a scant hundred meters those hundred meters had mouse petrified mouse was scared to death of falling the phobia usually manifested itself during a liftoff or landing when up and down had a more definite meaning you all right storm was shaking sweat beaded his face he shoved a hand out the hatch twice like a drowning man clawing for a lifeline the others were handoverhanding it along a cable spanning the gap between ship and asteroid come on mouse it wont be that bad how the hell had he gotten through all the eva exercises and small boat drills they had had to endure in academy mouses phobia perpetually astonished benrabi nothing else fazed the man whining bullets and crackling lasers simply created the background noises of his work his work assassins mind mouse go into assassins mind the state approximated a meditational trance except that while he was in it mouse was one of the most deadly men who ever lived was he too much out of practice mouses shaking slowly subsided his eyes became glassy all right benrabi said come on slow take the handholds and work your way over to the line thats good good now across to the balcony moyshe spoke softly without inflection in this state mouse had to be handled gently anything could set him off anyone not programed in as friendly could get broken up pretty bad the woman instructor overtook benrabi on the line whats wrong with your friend hes an acrophobe a navy man i know be real careful for a few minutes keep the group away hes not very stable right now he got mouse onto the balcony with his back to the vast mass of the ship and talked him down in five minutes storm was asking you ever meet anyone on danion who wasnt blond with blue eyes some not many anybody with black blood no i rest my case mouse surveyed the harvestship damn she took a beating huh different perspective moyshe its not up and down from here benrabi scanned the battered ship mouse i think weve been set up what i thought it was a little weird coming out the way we did i was going to ask the lady why they didnt have something better he pointed with his chin a half kilometer away a telescoping tubeway connected the ship with the rock face benrabi soon indicated a half dozen more connections each was large enough to use to drive heavy equipment onto and off the harvestship think theyre just working on you and me or the whole group fly easy benrabi suggested its my ass in a sling moyshe ill be your basic model of decorum are these two part of a plan take it for granted the question is was it supposed to be obvious or are they just clumsy to quote a certain admiral who used to tell us what to do just lay back in the weeds and let them show their hand he was good at mixing metaphors hows the writing going moyshe they turned to follow the seiner couple who were shooing the others into a tunnel i havent written a page in months i dont know why time thats part of it but i always found time before atop all his other hobbies benrabi dabbled at writing short fiction traveling to carsons from luna command an eon ago he had looked forward to the starfisher mission as a vacation operation during which he could get a lot of work done he had expected to stay a maximum of six weeks the admiral had promised a year had passed and he had completed one dreary story the manuscript of which he had not seen in months once they departed the central hollow of the asteroid they entered local artificial gravity there was little visible difference between ship and shore oh boy mouse said more brand new same old thing this is going to get boring in a few years moyshe sorry you decided to stay mouse eyed him momentarily no his expression became a little strange but benrabi paid it no attention look mouse kids i havent seen any kids since we left luna command hooray come on man look at that must be some kind of class tour twenty little girls around eight years old were giggling along behind an old man the old man was explaining something in a crackling voice several of the girls were aping him behind his back some of the others were making faces at the mockers call me back in ten years mouse said i got no use for them till they get ripe you have got to be the sourest it some kind of crime not to like kids speaking of which i never saw you get along with any but jupps boy and that greta and she was sixteen going on twentysix jupp von drachau had been their classmate in academy he was now high commands special errand boy he had helped with their operation on the broken wings later it had been his assignment to provide the firepower when it had come time to seize paynes fleet they had thought his premature approach and detection had left them stranded for the full year they had contracted to work for the seiners horstjohann i didnt see him last time we were in luna command thats two years ago now damn time flies bet hes grown half a meter their male guide said people well lunch in one of the workers commons before we show you a typical creche dont be shy visit people here are as curious about you as you are about them wed appreciate it if youd stay close though if one of you gets lost well both have trouble explaining great mouse said still more brand new same old thing doesnt anybody ever eat anywhere but in these goddamned cafeterias id sell my soul for a go at a decent kitchen on my own you cook im a man of myriad talents moyshe think thats what ill do when we hit the broken wings figure out how to make myself a homecooked meal and devour it in private not out in the middle of a goddamned football field with five thousand other people youve got one classic case of the crankies this morning my friend i didnt get any last night besides im not patient with crap and this whole field trip is main course horseshit without the hollandaise the commons was as predictable as mouse feared so was the food the conversation did not sparkle either till mouse took the offensive grace whats the point of this exercise i dont understand your question mister storm moyshe grinned behind his hand the woman was sensitive to that overpowering mouse charm she had become as decorous as a schoolteacher by way of compensation this bullshit exercise you dragged us away from work we dont have time to get done right anyway you run us out on a goddamned wire then walk us all to hell and gone when we could have done the whole thing on a bus you tell us were going to see how seiners live when theyre not in the fleet but you just show us the same old stuff and since youve only kidnapped us for today youre not really serious about showing us anything i mean an idiot would realize that it would take weeks just to skim the surface of a civilization like yours the womans dusky face darkened with embarrassment i mean here we sit eight former landsmen all with that much figured out and all of us on our best behavior figuring its some kind of test or someone wants us off danion for a while whichever its dumb youre wasting our time and yours mister storm dont mind him moyshe interjected its old age creeping up on him hes not as tolerant of gamesplaying as he used to be mouse grinned and winked benrabi grinned back their guides surveyed the other landsmen they said nothing but aggravated agreement marked each of their faces theres no point in going ahead then the male guide said your response is data enough finish your meals ill be right back he disappeared what is the point benrabi asked grace shrugged i just work here psychologist she was startled how did you know i can smell them you really married to him no she laughed weakly hes my brother ooh mouse said it softly only moyshe heard you swallow something radioactive mouse what you just started glowing the lady psychologist was not immune mouse wangled a date before her brother returned benrabi did not doubt that mouse would make the date an interesting experience he could not fathom mouses method even knowing they were being manipulated knowing mouses reputation women walked right in indeed mouses reputation seemed to make him more interesting their guide returned he deposited his halffinished tray on the conveyor to the sculleries he waited impatiently while his flock followed suit he scowled at mouse who had opened up with the big guns and had grace laughing like a teenager at stories woollier than the mammoths they antedated style benrabi told himself thats what hes got excuse me one of the ladies asked talking to myself ellen its the only way to hold an intelligent conversation you think theyll be mad at us because of this maybe more likely at each other like mouse said it was a dumb idea no matter what the point was unless its a cover thats a possibility the man had a bus waiting outside the cafeteria in ten minutes it reached the departure bay they had left so laboriously earlier by then mouse was holding graces hand he had her purring and almost unable to wait till he got off work come on storm her brother snapped back to your assigned department the rest of you go back to your jobs grace for gods sake oh shut up burt hes got a name one of the ladies crowed mouses mutinous attitude was catching the seiners had tried to put something over on the landsmen and they were responding with a mocking camaraderie come on mouse moyshe grumbled lets dont start anything right at eight grace bye storm bounced onto the scooter he had commandeered for the ride to the departure station moyshe took the seat behind him new worlds to conquer eh thats one way of looking at it moyshe this old one is starting to wear they must have some kind of open contract on me some kind of bounty for the girl who cons me into the i dos they wont take no for an answer not and stay friends weird people what the hell are you doing here kindervoort demanded when they strolled into the coliseum where he was overseeing some especially poor marksmen surprise mouse crowed the game was called on account of rain whats he talking about moyshe it was some kind of dumb exercise im sure you know what it was all about i told him it was stupid who the ships commander hes up to something with you two i dont know what remind him that one of the reasons i crossed over was because people wouldnt play games with me here id have a job i knew what it was id have a place in the scheme tell him that if the crap keeps up i hike my ass back to contact and chain me to a couch he can put his auction project where the sun dont shine its a stupid operation too calm down moyshe just go back to your job when kindervoort turned away mouse said good to see you stand up on your hind legs moyshe it takes me awhile to get fired up like the man said lets go to work weve got a long way to go with these clowns the next morning whispering with motionless lips as they hurried along a crowded passageway mouse said they used the time to fix us up with a new set of bugs moyshe very good stuff better than anything kindervoort stocks the kind that hook into a stress analyzer theyre putting the big eye on us moyshe from now on youd better play safe no matter where you are or who youre with what would they be looking for we dont have anything to hide who knows but dont forget that theyre looking ten ad the main sequence benrabi was trying to clip a couple of stubborn noxiouslooking hairs out of his right ear amy called ready yet honey half a minute he had butterflies he did not want to go the stalls and arguments had run out though he had to meet amys family such as it was he was about to be exhibited to her mother a prime trophy he thought former landsmen turned seiner on his way up a prize for any single girl he had been getting that feeling from amy the new was wearing off the magic was fading he was becoming an object of value instead of one of emotion was the problem his or hers was he reading her wrong he always misinterpreted women moyshe will you come on he stepped out of the bathroom how do i look perfect come on well be late for the shuttle i want to make a good impression stop worrying mom would be happy with a warthog so long as i was married thanks a lot a flash of the old amy returned any time they rode a scooter out one of the connecting tubes into the halls of the asteroid amy slowed to pass a series of doors with temporary plaques hung on them reading names moyshe found meaningless were here the plaque said stafinglas amy parked the scooter among a small herd nursing charger teats whats that mean stafinglas moyshe asked i dont know i think its made up thats where your mother lives amy nodded weve got to hurry theyll start pumping the air out of the lock in a couple minutes they wont let us board after they start could he stall that long he decided that would be a petty trick much as intuition warned him that the trip was a waste it was important to amy the thing to do was grit his teeth and ride it out the shuttle was a small boxy vessel useful for nothing but hauling passengers the seats were full when moyshe and amy boarded dozens of people stood in the aisles benrabi recognized a few as danion crewfolk lot of relatives of danion people in this stafinglas eh yes the old harvestships are like family enterprises three or four generations have served in the same ship it gets to be a tradition almost nobody ships outside their own fleet they say thats why were getting into this nationalistic competitiveness between fleets theres talk about having a computer assign new crews by lot moyshe smiled bet thats a popular idea like the black plague his feet hurt and his back ached before the shuttle reached its destination it was a sixhour passage he spent every minute standing stafinglas was exactly what moyshe expected an asteroid with kilometer upon kilometer of broad tunnels which served as residential streets im home he told amy its just like luna command she gave him a funny look really on a smaller scale he wanted to tell her it was not a natural or comfortable way to live instead he asked you ever been down on a planet no why just curious he could not explain she did not have the experience to understand anything else i should know about your mother i want to make a good impression stop saying that amy snapped stick to literary things you cant miss duck an argument shes contrary as hell shell start a fight just to find out how stubborn somebody is he looked at her askance we had some beauts when i was young nothing i did and nobody i knew was ever good enough talk libraries if you know anything about them shes librarian for stafinglas the more amy talked about her mother the less he wanted to meet the woman he had encountered dragons before they rolled right over him were here amy stopped at a door reluctant to take the last step well biting her lower lip amy knocked four hours later they excused themselves to go out for lunch neither spoke till they had drawn their meal trays as he settled at a table moyshe said jesus do i have a headache headache not here tension headache not migraine it had been bad much worse than he had expected the woman was a classic he glanced at amy want to know what a woman will be like in twentyfive years have a good long look at her mother im sorry moyshe i i cant even make excuses for her there isnt any excuse for that kind of behavior uhm maybe id better get used to it maybe she was just saying what a lot of people think me and mouse and the others may have to live with that the rest of our lives you should have fought back would that have changed anything no it wouldve kept her going that much longer moyshe was still numb as an old earther he had been fighting prejudice since entering the navy he had thought he possessed a thick hide but never had he encountered anyone as virulent as amys mother outworlders went through the forms of equality keeping their prejudices subtle and silent amys mother was open and vicious and adamantine about hers neither suasion nor force would alter her thinking in the least she had disowned amy before it was over you want to try again amy asked he was startled what she is my mother moyshe he reached across the table took her hand for a second i know she was doing her brave act to conceal her pain i know ive got one too and she isnt that much different they want the best for you and they think theyre the ones to decide whats best amy gulped several mouthfuls mother never was good at expressing feelings positively maybe thats why im a little weird i spent a lot of time with her while i was growing up she never qualified for fleet duty that was the big disappointment of her life till we gave her something else to feel sorry for herself about amy almost never mentioned her father all moyshe ever learned was his name and the fact that he had been killed in an accident here in the nebula apparently despite protestations to the contrary amys mother had found the accident convenient wed better not go back moyshe amy decided not today lets give her a chance to calm down and get used to the idea okay they had to kill four hours before a shuttle became available moyshe thought amy would use the time to visit old friends she did not she said all her real friends were aboard danion she became defensive she did not want to face any more disapproval the stayathome seiners were apparently less cosmopolitan than the people of the harvestfleets going back amy suggested if you want tomorrow we can sneak over and see those alien ships the research center isnt that far moyshe perked up a little all right thats a good idea ive been looking forward to it what do we do about our work assignments ill take care of everything amy took sleeping pills as soon as they reached their cabin despite a long long day moyshe was not in the mood for bed he strolled down the passageway and awakened mouse howd the gettogether go mouse asked and without awaiting an answer that bad eh its a whole different world mouse i thought i knew how to handle prejudice i never saw anything like it her mother was the worst but there was plenty everywhere else we went too i know grace took me for a little tour this morning you guys got out of bed long enough hey you got to do something the other twentythree hours of the day so tell me and wheres the board ive been here three minutes and i still havent seen a chess board sorry mouse grinned benrabi had accused him of being unable to relate with the human male unless a chess board was interposed guess im preoccupied she show you anything interesting im not sure you cant break the habits of tradecraft so you look and you listen but you dont find anything that gives you a handle on these people whered you go to some kind of office complex first like a government and trade headquarters we hunked around there for five hours they had everything out in the open you know like no confidential files or anything and nobody getting excited because you pick up a paper and read it you take white but there wasnt anything there i mean nothing anybody back home would give a damn about i didnt see a damned thing worth remembering what the hell kind of weird move is that mouse smiled some seiner pulled that on me the other day and lost yeah but i was better than him hey you know what theyre doing theyre getting ready to go back to stars end that isnt any secret no but theyre so damned serious i mean grace and i went to this one asteroid they were making into a drydock after we left the other place i got to talking to this engineer her husband is on the team thats adapting a shuttle to piggyback the stars end weapons to orbit benrabi raised his attention from the board curious everywhere you go theyre so damned sure of themselves arent they awfully maybe were too sure they cant do it maybe they have an angle mouses attention had left the board too he seemed to have a question he was afraid to ask moyshe felt the intensity of it boiling there behind his friends eyes ive got a hunch that they do through the starfish somehow mouse returned to the game his unorthodox opening got him into trouble early benrabi had him on the ropes but let him wriggle loose by making a tooeager move it cost him a knight you always did get too excited mouse observed how has your head been i had a headache today just tension though why just asking a move later what i meant was that disorientation stuff you had because of the psych program any trouble not much not like it was i have my moments you know blanking out for a second then coming back wondering where i am and who i am they dont amount to anything they dont last long enough for anybody to notice good i was scared when you were doing that contact stuff thought you might get mixed up while you were in and come back somebody else permanently you didnt by chance have anything to do with getting me transferred did you i would have if id thought i had the drag for your own good but i didnt mouse rose indicated that moyshe should follow him he stepped into the passageway tapping his ear what is it dont want them to know i know this the orders came from up top way up top i know this woman who works in communications she told me a couple things she thought i already knew naturally i played along naturally if its female youll go along with anything mouse grinned one of these days ill tell you about the admiral sending me to pimp school whoring isnt the oldest profession pimping is youd be knocked on your ass if you saw what a really good pimp can do with women he sent you to school yeah hell moyshe its the oldest trick in the spy business you teach a guy how to make a woman fall for him then turn him loose on the women who work for the organization you want to penetrate i thought it worked the other way around women seducing men its done it doesnt work as well men dont respond the same to emotional blackmail what did your friend have to say we cant stay out here too long buddy were headed for the top somebody upstairs has decided were the medicine seiner foreign relations needs this auction project is a test if we come through theyll give us a shot at setting up our own secret service benrabi had had a few hints he had formed a few suspicions still he was not ready for the truth a real fleetwide secret service inside and out intelligence and counterintelligence the works for all the starfishers the way it sounds theyll give us anything we want and turn us loose theyve got friends landside who try to keep them informed the friends have fed them enough the last couple of years to get them worried about whats going on in luna command ah i begin to smell the rat weve got connections we could turn a few of our old buddies youve got it how do you feel about it i was about to ask you moyshe after you all right all right it would be a challenge wed be going head to head with the old man it would be a hell of a matchup benrabi was not pleased i take it youre excited damned right i am not meaning to brag but if wed gone back id have had beckharts job eventually he said so himself and youd have become my chief of operations he thought we had what it takes moyshe you see what im driving at i think so benrabi was disappointed for a moment there was not a shred of loyalty in mouse his attitude was wholly mercenary what the hell am i crying about he wondered i started this sidechanging stuff he cast mouse a sharp glance more and more he suspected his partner had stayed here only because he had not out of conviction what did that mean when taken with this sudden enthusiasm for directing an organization targeted against their former employer what had become of his obsession with destroying the sangaree so what i think you should maybe be thinking about mouse said is how we could set it up who we should use where we should keep our eyes open like that and structure too youre more of a theorist than i am communications would be the big problem mouse he tried not to take mouses chatter seriously the obstacles to creating an effective seiner secret service were insurmountable how do you run an s or k net without communications see what i mean were out here and the targets are the hell and gone somewhere else you and i were always where we could use a public comm if we had to or we could use the navy nets say we got somebody into luna command he finds out something we should know right now what does he do run outside and yell real loud well figure it out moyshe dont worry about the details that way dont be so negative all the time instead of saying its impossible say how can we do it figure a way then organize to fit it lets get back in there before they get too suspicious they exchanged a couple of moves moyshe said i yield i wouldve had you this time except for that one stupid move it was a bad opening i deserved to get stomped another game just one then id better turn in amys sneaking me out for a look at their xenoarchaeological project tomorrow wish i could go but jarl will have fits enough about you the main research station was awesome what they did amy explained was take over one of the drydock asteroids so they could study the ships inside the planetoid was smaller than the one that had engulfed danion but still was vast at least a hundred ships floated in its interior some were so alien their lines almost hurt the eye around the inner face of the asteroid lay an office and laboratory level it was roofed by a layer of glassteel the researchers and their staffs could look up at the ships floating overhead people in the bay could see what was going on in the offices and labs the asteroid had been given spin along its longitudinal axis instead of using artificial gravity generators which would have been in continuous imbalance by facing inward moyshe and amy entered through a lock in the asteroids end and observed briefly from a lookout there moyshe was impressed the line of ships marched on till it vanished in the distance they bring them in this end amy said they look them over study them and the ones that arent useful they move up the line she indicated a remote vessel tugs were guiding it away the far end is industrialized the ships the scientists dont want they break up for raw materials or refit for us to use lets see if we can find a scooter an hour later amy introduced him to a woman named consuela elsanga consuela is an old friend moyshe consuela moyshe might be able to give you an idea or two consuela elsanga was a small dusky woman in her early fifties she bore the stamp of the preoccupied researcher of a person who had devoted a lifetime to her curiosity moyshe liked her immediately and as quickly felt a kinship she was a shy diffident individual in matters outside her expertise are you a xenoarchaeologist mister benrabi no amys exaggerating im not even a gifted amateur my only claim is that i followed the lunar digs close till a year ago i had a friend on the project darkness hit him it had the impact of a physical blow a womans face floated before him he had not seen that face in years alyce academy love the girl who had worked at the lunar digs moyshe amy sounded frightened whats the matter are you all right he held up a hand patted at the air okay okay im okay he shook his head violently just a delayed reaction to the spin here he lied ive never been in centrifugal gravity inside panic what the hell was this it had not happened for months he realized he was talking and talking fast i was at the digs a year and a half ago theyd just opened a new chamber in almost perfect condition they thought some of the machinery might still work amy and consuela watched him carefully you sure youre all right amy asked sure sure miss elsanga what could i do to help i really dont know we could walk you through one of the ships we think relates to the lunar base for a laymans opinion were sure there was a connection but because of politics we cant work with the people there its a pity too come along well start with artifacts recovered from the ships so youre married now amy benrabi caught an odd note in what could have been either statement or question he gave the women a closer look there was a slight tenseness between them as if there had been more to their relationship than friendship and shared interests he filed it in the back of his mind took me long enough didnt it amy tried to sound light she failed the moment of disorientation had turned something on inside moyshe his mind went to work agentwise the cameras rolled the crossreference computer clicked his surroundings took on more depth more meaning they became brighter and more interesting his movements became quicker and more assured this is what we laughingly call the museum consuela elsanga said pausing before opening a door its not really its just a storage room whoever those people were they didnt leave much behind mostly just trash but thats all archaeologists ever have to work with broken points potsherds and whatever else the ancients threw out behind their huts moyshe moved up and down rows of metal shelves they contained hundreds of items each tagged with a date ship number inventory number and brief guess as to what the object might be some were referenced to other inventory numbers twice he paused reexamined an item said i saw something like this at the lunar digs id say theres a definite connection the second time consuela elsanga responded not necessarily parallel function say a comb any creature with hair would invent a comb wouldnt you say so the existence of a comb wouldnt prove anything but a common physical trait and when moyshe finished with the racks and shelves she said now into my office ill show you our two real treasures moyshe and amy followed her through another door you havent seen these either amy we found them while you were out they were both part of the same find consuela elsanga took two plastic cases from her desk she handled them with loving care moyshe accepted one amy the other the item benrabi held was a piece of paper that had been torn into small fragments a very few faded marks were visible is it a photograph amy asked good guess consuela said we had a hell of a time with them moyshe traded with amy the second object was an extremely faded flat twodimensional photo it had been torn in two consuela continued first we pieced all the tears together then we did scans with lowintensity lasers and computer enhancements we came up with these the woman glowed with pride as she handed over reproductions of the items the photo in color was of a creature very similar to the lunar dig reconstructions benrabi said as much the other object appeared to be a handwritten letter any luck interpreting this moyshe asked no we havent even determined which direction its supposed to be read you havent found any technical manuals or anything not a speck just a few characters on nameplates stuff like youd find around instrumentation and doors on any ship any time theres more than three characters theyre arranged in matrices like these maybe they had a holographic system for reading no doesnt go with a twod photo we dont think very interesting moyshe said studying the picture again a dear john letter and the guy or gal gets mad and tears up the lovers letter and picture but then cant bear to part with the pieces thats one of our hypotheses moyshe scanned the letter thirtyfour different characters here some punctuation dont try to figure it out in your head even the computers cant get a handle on it just think how hard it would be to break our language without a starting clue big letters little letters script punctuation spelling variations by dialect different type faces all the stylized lettering and special symbols we use for technical stuff you see wed need a whole ship full of old letters novels and newspapers to break it not just a few plaques on an instrument panel dont worry consuela amy said well be into stars end soon youll find your answers there if im lucky enough to go they havent picked the science team yet im worried youll go youre the best benrabi looked at the woman and slowly shook his head that stars end insanity again i dont know what id do if they turned me down amy its my whole life im not getting any younger and they might use my age to keep me home dont worry you know they cant leave you behind theres nobody better than you and they know how much it means to you how soon amy do you know it hasnt been decided yet but it wont be long a month or two consuela brightened youre sure theyll send me of course dont be silly thats what i am you know a silly old woman amy enfolded her in gentle arms no youre not no youre not come on now show us one of those ships consuela elsanga led them to a little fourplace air scooter flew them out to a vessel benrabi felt lightheaded in the lack of gravity i feel like i could fall all the way to the end he said staring down the length of the hollow the ship was one of the least alien of those in the lineup form follows function moyshe muttered remembering the luna command constructs which had very much resembled small human beings the ships lock was open consuela made fast led them inside she was small but even she had to stoop in the passageways moyshe wandered around for an hour he finally summed up his impressions by observing its not that strange just kind of dollhouse like it was built for children you can figure out what half the stuff is its just parked places we consider weird you said it yourself form follows function consuela replied weve done comparative studies between these sangaree ulantonid and our own ships the physical requirements of bipeds appear to be universal scales seem to be the most noticeable difference that ship two ahead of this one what built it a giant slug we dont know its funny theres something almost repulsive about it you have to work yourself up to it if its your turn to study it its like the alienness oozes out of the metal its more of a mystery than the other ships its almost contemporary if our dating technique is valid it shows battle damage its the only one of its kind weve ever located it was as clean as these others one of my colleagues believes the crew were forced to abandon ship after an accidental encounter during some crisis period like the ulantonid war when everyone was shooting at anybody who didnt yell friend fast enough curiously though it was surrounded by a whole squadron of our little friends here enemies consuela shrugged or purely chance the ships arent contemporary with one another what were they doing together there arent enough books to write down all the questions mister benrabi it gets frustrating sometimes i can imagine could the crew have been studying the old ships when they were attacked by a third party thats a possibility we hadnt considered ill bring it up consuela someone shouted into the vessel is that you in there yes robert what is it somebodys looking for those people who came to see you a man named kindervoort he sounded pretty excited ohoh amy said im in trouble now i thought he wouldnt notice consuela id better call him she placed the call from consuelas office jarl foamed at the mouth and ordered them to return to danion now he snarled at benrabi moyshe i dont care if you cut those nitwit citizenship classes theyre a waste of time anyway but youre not ducking out on the training schedule now come back here and get your men ready youve got the rest of your life to look at old ships the auction is now amy was quiet throughout the return passage once she whispered hes really going to give it to me and clutched moyshes hand she was shaking hes an amateur benrabi told her you havent been chewed out till youve taken it from admiral beckhart a moment later he grinned and added but if its private he lets you yell back soon after they returned they heard that another of the great harvestfleets was entering the nebula the news generated a fresh air of excitement aboard danion one by one the harvestfleets came in scores of fresh eager young faces appeared aboard danion as graduates of seiner technical schools filled the billets of people lost at stars end the howl and hammer of repairs went on around the clock the excitement and tension continued to mount they were going back this time in full strength and to stay a prideful nationalistic bellicose mood gripped the fleets moyshe benrabi and masato storm pursued their instruction of the teams they would direct on the broken wings their days were long and exhausting moyshe often tumbled into bed without enough energy left for a goodnight kiss he began to feel the pressure it started to intrude into his sleeping hours he began to dream of the girl he had left behind so long ago he suffered more momentary lapses of attention while he was awake he began to grow frightened of what might be going on back in the nether reaches of his mind eleven christmas ad the contemporary scene tension gripped the bridge of the attack cruiser lepanto one minute to drop the astrogation officer announced jupp von drachau scanned his people they were poised like runners in the blocks awaiting the crack of the starters pistol they would have to grab an enormous fund of data in a few brief minutes lepanto was coming up to an enemy star there was no way of guessing what might be waiting detection gear would not work from hyper unless initial detection had been made in norm the cruiser was going in blind no one knew the capabilities of the sangaree detection systems operating from norm they would not have the same handicap a force might be moving toward the drop zone now thirty seconds stand by weapons von drachau ordered button up people he sealed the faceplate of his own helmet one quick drop to get his bearings then a short arc in to the fringes of the sangaree sun five seconds four three the figures on the bridge hunched forward a centimeter more one drop screens up commander heavy vessels bearing display active three ships bearing range to star one point three two au we have a local inherent velocity of attack missiles bearing bridge weapons launching two salvos the vessel shuddered and rocked von drachau stared at the display tank six red blips had come to life there they sped along projected curves which would bring them within spitting distance of lepanto tiny ruby pinpoints raced ahead toward the cruiser time to intercept fortyseven seconds the hyper alarm commenced its hooted warning to the crew time to hyper one minute a voice boomed someone said commander weve located the planet bring me up a visual aye sir von drachaus command screen came to life for an instant it displayed a computer graphic of the local solar system the schematic yielded to a visual from an external camera it showed a white thirdcrescent the amplification rose quickly revealing a world heavy with clouds and seas looks a lot like old earth von drachau murmured yes sir are you taping were getting everything we can sir twenty seconds to hyper von drachau glanced at the display tank the missile salvos were driving closer weapons department was not bothering with anything but defensive fire considering the nature of the mission engaging a handful of raidships was pointless anything near that sun he asked no sir we have a lot of activity near and on the planet that made sense the sangaree would be scrambling everything in fear that lepanto might be the spearhead of a thrust against their homeworld that was the doom they had dreaded for centuries hyper in five seconds four von drachau did not think these picket ships would jump with him they should await the rest of a suspected battle fleet one taking the universe shifted screens went blank the display tank cued in norm remained active von drachau stared willing the sangaree raidships to remain where they were one minute to drop astrogation had programed a very short slow arc von drachau reached back into his soul searching for any wisp of feeling that might bear on the orders he had to give he did not want to do this thing every cell of him protested and yet and yet he knew too much he knew the critical importance of obtaining results and he had his own orders special weapons party stand by his orders would be a formality the prelaunch program had begun an hour ago the only significant command he could give now would be the abort he checked the tank again damn they were coming their detection gear was good they knew no one else was coming in right away looks like we knocked over a beehive he said the six raidships from the drop zone were being joined by a horde quartering in from the planet twenty seconds till drop it would be a narrow squeak making the launch and getting clear in time and some of them would chase him all the way home astrogation program your next jump for carsons he did not want to lead the pursuit too close to the action on the broken wings sir pull the cassette and reprogram an attack squadron would be on station near carsons he could scoot in and cling to its protective skirts yes sir drop special weapons party launch when ready there it was too late to take it back too late to keep from having to live with it the rest of his life special weapons launch in three minutes twelve seconds launch party captain replied whats the holdup weve got sangaree crawling up our backs sorry sir a coupling jammed long range hunter missiles bearing visuals please von drachau said his screen came to life show me the star in a second he was staring at an endless plain of fire broad continental reaches of darkness lay upon it the star appeared to be passing through a period of heavy sunspotting but as he remembered it the sangaree home star was supposed to be highly active with exceptionally intense solar winds two minutes to special launch von drachau checked the display tank the sangaree were coming on in a mob they were not organized but there were too many of them lepanto wouldnt have a prayer in a headsup fight astrogation hows your program coming five minutes sir we dont have five minutes make it a basal arc thatll drop us in the neighborhood do your fine calculation during the fly yes sir to intercept fiftytwo seconds von drachau glared at the tank they would have missiles in their pockets by launch time power weapons would be pounding lepantos energy screens damn it looked bad time to launch one minute the bridge watch took on that hunchbacked look of people anticipating the kiss of the whip sixty lousy seconds that could make a damned short life mayflies lasted longer to intercept fourteen seconds that was close and the next salvo would be closer astrogation one millisecond free hyper straight linear von drachau snapped sir do it the alarm hooted as the ship lurched the ships commanders screen returned to life the sangaree sun had moved he could see a horizon line it had no curvature weapons department howled they had to reprogram so do those boys over there special weapons time to launch thirtytwo seconds sir missiles bearing two fiveniner relative one two degrees nadir time to intercept two six seconds von drachau sighed that was right on the line gentlemen were going to make it the bridge watch did not relax they knew his remark was half prayer the tank proclaimed that in its totally unambiguous display a saturation barrage was hurtling toward them and it was a long long run back to friendly space ten seconds to launch and there was the problem of the weapon safely reaching target if the sangaree sniped it lepanto would have to try again a second pass could get hairy lepanto shuddered and lurched someone yelled that was too goddamned close two one launch weapon away the warship lurched again one tenth second free hyper straight linear von drachau ordered detection lock on that weapon i want to know if it makes it the cruiser dodged von drachau shifted attention between display tank and screen following the weapon into the sun sangaree missiles had no chance to catch it scores of laser and graser weapons probed for it caressed it with their deadly tongues telemetry how are its screens holding perfectly sir lepanto rocked time was running out shes in sir they cant stop her now her sun screens are stable astrogation get us out of here you still want an observation pass sir r d had asked them to hang around and study the results the hell with that noise get out of here before they barbecue us the hyper alarm hooted the ship twisted away into an alternate dimension von drachau turned to the display tank some of them are good he murmured very good four vessels had caught the trail already and were coming hard drive run your influence factor to the red line sir you heard me youll take it over if you have to stand by for it yes sir von drachau glanced at the sun shape dwindling in the display tank the weapon would be sinking toward its heart the killing process would begin in a few hours he turned into himself again looking for his feelings all he found was a big vacancy an arid desert of the soul he did not think much of jupp von drachau just then book two the broken wings twelve ad the contemporary scene lemuel beckhart felt totally vulnerable while walking the streets of angel city the berg was domed of course but the glassteel arced too far overhead he had been born in luna command and had spent most of his life there and in warships he needed overheads decks and bulkheads close at hand before he felt comfortable worlds with open skies were pure hell for him he shoved his hands into the pockets of the civilian trousers he wore it was coming together the timing looked good the leaks had the commentators howling for blood funny how they became raving patriots when it looked like their asses were going to go in the can too those people in public information knew their trade they were keeping a fine balance they were generating alarm without causing panic they were stampeding legislative sessions hither and yon herding them like unsuspecting cattle getting everything luna command wanted confederation senate was passing appropriations measures like the gold seam had no end the real victory was a stream of confederacy applications from outworlds that had remained stubbornly independent for generations welltempered fear that was the lever let them know confederation would defend its own and ignore the others when the hammer fell those cunning politicians they were using the crisis too everybody was scoring on this one would the maneuvering and manipulation settle out in time it was human nature to go on wasting energy on internal bickering when doom was closing in those pi people they were something they still had not released anything concrete the propaganda machine in high gear was a wonder to behold beckhart was bemused by his own pleasure at observing a high level of professional competence in a department not under his own command his mood soured when he reflected on the latest news from his colleagues in ulantonid intelligence that centerward race they seemed to draw some special wholly inexplicable pleasure from killing the latest ulantonid package had included tape taken on a world with a bronze age technology it showed small suited bipeds built like a cross between orangutans and kangaroos armed principally with small arms systematically eradicating the natives there was ample footage of shattered cities burning villages and murdered babies not to mention clips of cadavers of virtually every other mobile lifeform the planet boasted if it moved the hopping longarmed creatures shot it if it did not they dug it out of hiding and killed it anyway there had been no sky full of ships for this primitive world just a stream of transports sending in troops munitions small flyers and the equipment used to hunt down the wilder creatures of mountain and forest the ulantonid experts estimated a troop input approaching ten billion soldiers beckhart could not grasp that number ten billions for one primitive world confederation and ulant together had not had that many people under arms during the most savage years of their conflict theyve got to be crazy he muttered he paused near the building where thomas mcclennon now moyshe benrabi had kept the sangaree woman distracted while storm had torn the guts out of her angel city operation christ but hadnt those boys pulled a coup and now they had come through again giving him the sangaree homeworld he had to bring them out somehow he refused to write men off while they lived he was determined there had to be a way to apply enough leverage to force their release if it came to that alone and he could prise no better yield from the coming encounter he would be satisfied the thing looked made to order for another coup down boy he muttered first things first youre here to get your boys back anything else comes second still it was coming together the word was the sangaree wanted revenge it was a good bet the seiners would have another go at stars end the rumors and leaks from luna command had everybody excited about an ambergris shortage a lot of eyes would be staring down gun barrels at this end of the arm he was pleased he had choreographed it perfectly only he and high command would be thinking about von drachau if von drachau succeeded the news would hit like the proverbial ton of bricks he strolled on to the warehouse that had headquartered the local sangaree operation it was a fireblackened pile of rubble the authorities had not cleared it yet sometimes lemuel youre not a very nice person he murmured he was repelled by some of the things he did but he was sincere in his belief that they were necessary he was terrified of that centerward race the hungry bunnies he called them for no truly good reason ten billions for one world tens of thousands of ships how could they be stopped why the hell were they so determined to kill there was no logic to it was there anything more he could do anything he had overlooked he lay awake nights trying to think of something he suspected that everyone in high command slept poorly of late running the same perilous race courses in hopes of finding the key to escape from the nightmare his beeper squeaked he raised it to his ear hand delivery only urgent for blackstone a remote voice told him he returned the beeper to his belt and walked briskly toward his headquarters the courier was a full commander he wore a sidearm and carried the message in a tamperproof case that would destruct should anyone but lemuel beckhart attempt to open it the case bore a high command seal sit commander whats the news from luna command the commander was a taciturn man we seem to be in for some excitement sir thats a fact you came in with the squadrons taking station three heavy squadrons had taken orbit around the broken wings they were there at his request yes sir aboard assyrian popanokulos still ships commander beckhart placed his thumbs at the proper points on the case something whirred he prised it open with a fingernail yes sir how is he he was one of my students years ago he was reluctant to open the plain white envelope lying within the case hes in excellent health sir he asked me to extend his best regards extend mine in return commander he initialed a pink slip for the second time indicating that the contents of the case had been received he would have to do so twice more indicating message read then message destroyed the commander moved slightly in his chair he appeared impatient to return to assyrian beckhart opened the envelope removed what appeared to be a sheet of plain white paper he pressed his thumbs against the bottom corners invisible microcircuitry read his prints a handwritten message slowly took form appearing at the rate it had been written l alltime screwup at r d research facility cause unclear system destroyed total loss vd away with apples public disclosure disaster unavoidable m beckhart laid the sheet on his desk covered his face with the palms of his hands there went a key hope without telling his ulantonid opposite number why he had asked for additional deep probes toward galaxy center hoping to locate homeworlds that could be shattered with the new weapon he had hoped the grandeur and viciousness of the thing could be used to intimidate the centerward race into abandoning their insane crusade a total loss all the info both on the weapon itself and what had gone wrong damn it to hell anyway he initialed the pink slip burned the message and initialed the slip again thank you commander he handed slip and case over there wont be a reply very well sir have a nice day beckhart wore a puzzled smile as the officer pushed out the door a nice day not likely he keyed a switch on his desk communicator i need major damon a few days later his comm whined at him yes communications sir the commtech sounded choked signals from assyrian sir the starfishers are here just detected beckhart felt a stir of excitement he asked whats the problem sir i let me feed you the assyrian data sir beckhart touched a button the tiny screen on his comm crackled to life a series of computer data began flashing across it then came a schematic of a ship he read the size figures three times before murmuring holy shit he leaned back said communications keep running that till i say stop yes sir he watched the report three times through before he was satisfied so those were harvestships they were selfcontained worlds if navy could lay hands on a few of those and arm them with empire class weaponry communications page major damon tell him to come to my office the commander of the marine military police battalion reported only minutes later major therell be an adjustment in our plans watch this beckhart ran the report from assyrian damon was suitably impressed major sit were going to do some brainstorming the session lasted the day and the night and into the next day it ended when communications interrupted admiral signals from assyrian sir theyve intercepted signals between the seiner ships they thought youd be interested of course i am give it to me the relay was not long and it was both baffling and exciting the starfishers were going to put his own boys in charge of their auction security effort he had it run twice satisfied he said major go get yourself eight hours then get back here and well pick up where we left off this changes things again we work it right now and were in the chips after the major departed he had assyrian open an instel link with luna command he spent an hour in conference he broke off smiling a weak smile this auction might be more than serendipitous he dragged himself to his cot hoping to catch a few hours but could not fall asleep his conscience kept nagging him once again he would have to use men cruelly for the sake of the services and confederation he was so weary of that thirteen ad the main sequence paynes fleet dropped hyper a sol system radius from the broken wings danion formed the point of the arrowhead of ships flashing toward the planet accompanying the harvestships were a hundred service ships borrowed from other fleets the seiners wanted to make an impression they believed this show of strength would rivet all eyes on the broken wings while the credit from the auction was important to them distracting attention from stars end meant even more almost all seinerdom had taken hyper for the fortress world the harvestfleets had gathered a hundred harvestships a thousand service ships and untold millions of people would be involved in the effort to recover the citadel worlds weapons that gargantuan armada bearing the hope of a nation was avoiding traffic lanes flying easy awaiting word of the success of the auction diversion a confrontation with confederation had to be avoided the seiner leadership understood the swift doom inherent in a twofront war a onefront war was a terrible enough hazard weve got trouble jarl kindervoort told his staff weve just received a scout report from stars end the sangaree have moved in there mouse made a sound suspiciously like a purr wont hurt my feelings if they get crunched again somebodys going to get crunched the report says therere hundreds of raidships there storm and benrabi became more attentive mouse asked hundreds that would take hell the families would all have to be working together they dont do that kindervoort replied they seem to have their hearts set on grabbing stars end they arent the only ones benrabi muttered he snorted in disgust shook his head whos fault is that jarl what do you mean moyshe consider our last runin consider one maria elana gonzales technician alias marya strehltsweiter sangaree agent remember her the lady who tried to kill danion i shot her and stopped her and you nice people politely patched her up and sent her home with the other returning landsmen bet you she ran straight to her bosses and set this up nice doesnt pay jarl mouse shifted his chair so he could stare at benrabi he said nothing once upon a time on a faraway world called the broken wings a partner of mouses wearing the workname dr gundaker niven had stopped him from killing a sangaree agent named marya strehltsweiter moyshe reddened lets not cry about what we should have done kindervoort said were here now let me have those situation reports amy amy pushed a sheaf of flimsies across the tabletop navy is damned interested in this end of the universe too three heavy squadrons off the broken wings squadrons hapsburg prussian and assyrian empire class mouse asked all of them they mean business dont they therere battle squadrons at carsons and sierra too our friends the freehaulers couldnt get close enough to identify them and no telling whats in the bushes benrabi mused moyshe theyre playing poker jarl theyve shown us a couple of aces face up what you have to worry about is their hole cards what have they got cruising around a couple of light years away ready to jump in you think theyll try a power play no not like that but it might behoove us to spend a little brain power figuring what theyre up to navy doesnt put that much power together unless theyre scared theyll have to use it you hardly ever see a patrol of more than two ships you know service thinking better than me whyre they so excited the dispositions look defensive moyshe said and that leads us to our lack of landside intelligence whats the planetary defense forces alert level in the transverse have they activated any reserves if so which units we could extrapolate their fears from that kind of information we have the liaison team report kindervoort shuffled flimsies mouse and benrabi had insisted on sending a few men ahead weeks ago ive seen it moyshe said theyve given the broken whigs the usual temporary free planet status theyve pledged an open auction the city authorities are so nervous theyve called up their police reserves and asked marine mps to help they expect trouble nobody is saying why the coded reports said there were three hundred privately owned ships orbiting the broken wings each had brought a negotiating team hoping to carry off a supply of ambergris most of the vessels appeared to be armed all known space was apparently in the grip of an undirected war fervor no one was behaving normally the auction had a potential for becoming a wild brawl mouse moyshe kindervoort said i dont mind telling you this thing has me scared its too big and it looks like it could get bigger be very very careful it could get too big for anybody mouse said his voice was soft and thoughtful it could roll us all under for two days danion and her sisters drifted slowly toward the broken wings watching and listening they kept their presence secret longer than moyshe expected he and his compatriots obtained two days worth of observations they provided no comfort angel city was hell incarnate armies of undercover people had materialized there they were warring with one another with a fine disregard for reason and local tranquility the war scare had set off a chain reaction of insanity as a landing team leader benrabi now rated his own office and a parttime assistant his wife filled the assistants role till this is over at least im important he thought he put little stock in mouses theory that they were being groomed to master a starfisher secret service he had been able to make no independent corroboration of the claim benrabis intercom buzzed benrabi here jarl moyshe i need you over here now right final meeting im on my way he gathered his papers donned fatalism like a cloak and stalked toward kindervoorts office he met mouse outside kindervoorts door broomstick fly mouse said no lie anybody with any sense would cancel the auction mouse grinned not the seiners you got to remember this auction is part of their big picture i think theyd go ahead even if it werent come on in kindervoort called a moment later he began introducing them to the ships commanders and chiefs of security of the other harvestships of paynes fleet the gentlemen were present only as holo portrayals kindervoort storm and benrabi would be aboard their vessels the same way they and the holo equipment and technicians reduced kindervoorts office to postage stamp size you bring your final reports kindervoort asked benrabi nodded mouse said right here but youre not going to like them why not theyre realitybased meaning they recommend that you cancel or postpone benrabi added we cant handle security with what youve given us not under the conditions obtaining weve been talking about that how many more men would you need about a brigade of mps mouse growled moyshe you look surprised kindervoort said just thinking that this isnt like working for the bureau you ask the admiral for more than he gives you he takes half away and tells you to make do id say another hundred men and two more months to train them mr storm are those realistic figures one ships commander asked minimum realistic my partner is one of your incurable optimists but there is an alternative cancel this shore leave plan dont send anybody down but members of the auction team we can set up a compound danions commander interrupted sorry no can do mister storm we promised our people liberty mister benrabi well give you as many men as you want but the thing has got to be done now youre going to lose people benrabi protested he was so irritated he stamped a foot shore leave is stupid the more people you let wander around down there the fewer im going to be able to protect he had lost this argument several times before the brass had promised everybody a chance to see what life on a planet was like they would not go back on their word despite having learned that the angel city situation was more deadly than expected moyshe had begun to suspect that the complication was deliberate and purely for the propaganda possibilities inherent in potential dead or injured tourists if his guess was correct then someone upstairs was as coldblooded as his old boss admiral beckhart thiss the way its going to be then moyshe said youll have ten thousand tourists on the ground all the time thats going to make the angel city merchants happy and me miserable ill have half of a hundred fifty men if you give me the hundred i just asked for that doesnt divide out too good so the tourists will be on their own if they get into trouble tough ill cover auction people and vips god can take care of the rest he surveyed his audience he did not see any sympathy there you pushed me into this job he growled why not let me do the damned thing mouse backed him up the same goes for my shift gents thats the real world down there the world of confederation espionage and bad guys i should say those people dont do things the starfisher way ive been led to believe that moyshe and i were given our jobs because we know the broken wings and confederation and the intelligence viewpoint i wish youd accept our expertise and quit trying to make other realities conform to your views about the way things ought to be storm winked at moyshe they had taken the offensive they had gotten in their licks kindervoort said lets calm down thiss no time for tempers the job has got be be done like it or not kindervoorts comm buzzed security james radio sir is the ships commander there the ships commander stepped to the comm what is it weve noticed an increase in coded traffic sir it could mean that weve been detected within minutes several other departments reported similar suspicions the interruptions kept mouse and benrabi from arguing their case the ships commander excused himself as did his executive officer the holographic visitors faded away the holo technicians started packing their equipment well damned me moyshe grumbled what do you think kindervoort asked its hideous mouse snapped moyshe benrabi spread his hands in a fatalistic gesture what the hell nobody listens to anything i say you think theres any chance they could lay hands on somebody who knows something worth their while of course theres a chance youve seen the damned situation reports they mean business down there im trying to do a job if nobody will let me moyshe im not the ships commander just between you and me i think youre right i argued your case harder than you think the ships commander just doesnt see the rest of the universe in anything but seiner terms he thinks confederation is just like us only working against us he thinks this is some kind of competition between fleets hes wrong but hes in charge if he wants shoreside liberty thats what he gets do what you can and grit your teeth if you lose a few just dont let them find out whats going on at stars end before we get hold of the weapons that will mean fighting the sangaree again jarl which means we wont get any backup here if this show blows up in our faces true were on our own so we stall we go slow we keep the auction piddling along with luck gruber will finish before weve lost our distraction value thats candy mouse grumbled from hunger benrabi agreed they had begun to slip into landside idiom again youre all hyper bent the public address system came to life the ships commander asked for volunteers willing to join the auction security effort down in angel city people started showing up immediately amy was the first applicant youre not going moyshe told her thats the final word she fought back the argument became bitter lieutenant moyshe said you will remain aboard ship thats an order jarl will you support my directives kindervoort nodded damn you moyshe benrabi honey im not letting you get killed shut up and go back to work there were thousands of volunteers everyone wanted an extended vacation landside no one believed there was any danger previous auctions were reputed to have been long wonderful parties you got your list moyshe asked storm nodded they had interviewed the candidates who had survived an initial screening each had noted the most likely names they had agreed to take the first hundred names that appeared on both their lists orbiting in to the broken wings moyshe found the recent past beginning to feel vacationlike in retrospect he and mouse would not make overnight soldiers of their volunteers even the old hands were terribly weak seiner lives revolved around space and ships and harvesting they would make perfect navy people groundpounders never the toughest hurdle was to make them understand on a gut level that someone they could see could be an enemy a given of seiner life was that those you could see were friends their enemies always existed only as blips in display tanks its a hard lesson for landsmen mouse said thats why marines stay in basic so long our culture doesnt produce the hunterkiller naturally we ought to build us a time machine so we can go recruit in the middle ages moyshe chuckled they wouldnt understand what the fighting was about mouse theyd laugh themselves sick danion and her sisters went into geosynchronous orbit well above angel citys horizon the message was not lost on anyone if there was too much foolishness downstairs the fire could fall moyshe in spacesuit wrestling a load of armaments joined storm for the journey to their departure station wish we had real combat gear mouse said these suits wont stand much punishment be nice get any sleep couldnt i kept watching the news from angel city moyshe had been shaken by the reports me too something big is happening therere too many undercurrents be careful moyshe lets dont get bent with it you ever feel like an extra cog since the first day i worked for beckhart there was always something on that i couldnt figure out here we are and jarl looks excited kindervoort was overseeing the loading of the four lighters that would make the initial landings in pairs at fifteen minute intervals storm and benrabi would command the teams aboard the lead pair youre going overboard jarl benrabi said as they approached kindervoort why the more we impress them now the less trouble well have later you wont impress them not when they have three squadrons here go take a look at what operations has on those ships three empire class battlewagons jarl the second coming wouldnt faze them i smell beckhart mouse said something about the way things are going hes back in the woods somewhere poking holes in our plans before we know what they are ourselves kindervoort said make sure that i know i know benrabi snapped weve been over everything fifty times just turn us loose will you go easy moyshe mouse said you take it easy mouse he replied gently storm had begun shaking he was thinking about the long fall to the planets surface ill be all right when things start rolling ill go am if i have to things are rolling now kindervoort said get moving take your musters work helped settle moyshes nerves he mustered his men checked their suits made sure their weapons were ready and that they had the first phase of the operation clearly in mind he rehearsed it for himself the lighter sealed off from danion moyshe joined the pilot he wanted to remain near the ships radio all go moyshe from kindervoort landing party go pilot ships go stand by for release the pilot hit a switch his visuals came up presenting views of danions hull stars and the broken wings in crescent the planet was a huge silvery scimitar its surface lay masked by perpetual cloud cover the broken whigs was a very hot very wet world with a nasty atmosphere its handful of cities were all protected by huge glassteel domes dropping kindervoort said the magnetic grappels released the lighter the pilot eased her away from the harvestship radar showed mouses boat almost lost in the return from danion doing the same a hundred meters away they picked up their service ship escort and began the long plunge toward angel citys spaceport kindervoort would lead the second wave behind him would come armed lighters from other harvestships ready to provide close air support if that proved necessary the planet grew in the viewscreens on infrared it looked rather like old earth moyshe told his pilot the first survey teams thought this would be a paradise the pilot glanced at the screen its not its a honey trap a greenhouse effect made it a permanently springtime world it was a riot with a roughly permian level of life its continents lay low much of the socalled land area was swamp methane made the air unbreathable the planet was on the verge of a mountainbuilding age three hundred kilometers north of angel city lay a region locally dubbed the land of a million volcanoes it added a lungsearing touch of hydrogensulfide to the air the first wisps of atmosphere caressed the lighters the escort braked preparatory to pulling out the landing teams would be on their own the last meters mouses boat screamed down less than a kilometer from benrabis their pilots kept station almost as skillfully as marine coxswains they had handled atmosphere before somewhere moyshe became ever more tense awaiting some sudden unpleasant greeting from below there was none it was a picnic fly except that it was a penetration run without thought to economy or comfort just getting down with speed moyshe kept a close monitor on the radio chatter of the second wave already in the slot and coming down the lighter rocked and shuddered braking in benrabi staggered back to his men there was barely time for him to hit his couch before with a bonejarring smack the ship set down moyshe sprang up and turned to the opening hatch laserifle in hand behind him came two men with grenadelaunchers then the rest of the team moyshe jumped out dodged aside two hundred meters away mouse hit tarmac at virtually the same instant his pathfinders spread out to place the target markers for vessels yet to arrive the thing became anticlimactic no one was home the field was naked of ships and people then a stiffnecked thin old man in a bubbletop the broken wings swampers outsuit stepped from a utility shed beautiful landing thomas he said on radio ah and mouse too youve taught well boys but you had the best teachers yourselves beckhart mouse gasped you were expecting st nick son you said you smelled him benrabi snapped mouse raise danion tell them to stand by on the main batteries general alarm have jarl come close circle with the air support thomas thomas what are you doing the question is what are you doing he covered beckhart while mouse handled the communications chores kindervoort came up on the suit frequency chattering wildly he wanted an explanation for the panic i just came out to welcome you beckhart said i wanted to see my boys all operatives were son or my boys to beckhart he treated them like family when he was not trying to get them killed benrabi had strong lovehate feelings for the man he stifled his emotions for the moment beckhart had to be considered the most dangerous enemy around his presence altered everything what is all this the admiral demanded an invasion this is a free planet thomas benrabi foresaw a sorry sad old man act the act that so often won the admiral his way one means of beating it was to throw him a hard slider what the hell was his first name using it would rattle him we heard there was some dust getting kicked up here mouse said nicolas will you get those men deployed what the hell do you think this is the seiners were standing around gawking stricken motionless by the sheer hugeness of the planet how could you be military the first time you saw open spaces and an infinite sky we dont take chances admiral beckhart chuckled there was a spot of trouble ive got it under control we heard something about martial law benrabi said how does that fit with your standards of neutrality we pick on everyone separately but equally beckhart chuckled again he glanced around at the starfisher landing parties then at the sky theres no violation in spirit thomas i need what youre selling youll sell it in peace if i have to break every head on the planet thats why i elected myself your welcoming committee now then i think ive got everything ready for you why dont you ride in with me and tell me about your adventures mouse and benrabi exchanged glances this was not what they had expected it stank of beckhart scheming but if the old man said things were under control they were he rarely lied though he enjoyed razzledazzling you from the other room right moyshe said making a snap decision nicolas kiski pack up your weapons and get over here admiral whats the transportation picture the spaceport like any built with an eye to safety was well removed from the city it served excellent it should be arriving ah here it is a column of marine personnel carriers rumbled onto the field did you bring the guinness mouse asked we might as well be sociable a shipload beckhart replied and with any luck von drachau will show up and share a few before we close up shop jupp benrabi asked really he looked forward to that jupp was still a friend though he was on the other side now he and mouse shuffled their men into the first few carriers advised kindervoort of the altered situation and left for angel city as the second wave began rumbling down the sky fourteen ad the main sequence beckharts word proved good angel city was quiet central park a recreational area at the citys heart had been equipped with field tents trailers and miscellany the admiral had borrowed from the corps storm and benrabi set up for business before noon mouse benrabi said you get the feeling were being rushed its not a feeling moyshe its a fact how do we stall men with briefcases were lining up to obtain the little catalogs moyshes team had brought along buy time jarl had said it did not look like they would be given a chance the various purchasing agents impelled by the war scare wanted the bidding to begin right away the marines proved to be perfect policemen they helped immeasurably they showed favoritism only to starfisher tourists the admiral seemed determined to avoid a significant incident and to help the local shopkeepers relieve the seiner sightseers of all their hard currency storm lost his first tourist their second day on the broken wings the man turned up again before mouse learned that he had been taken he was none the worse for wear he was a mess cook from danion who knew nothing anyone wanted to know its started mouse told benrabi when moyshe relieved him make sure everybody checks in before they wander off check their passes the ones we have to watch have been given a red one you know who grabbed the man no i didnt try to find out i just passed it to beckhart i figure we might as well let his people do it well have more people to watch our criticals moyshe lost several people on his shift there was only one incident with anyone who mattered his people handled it perfectly and presented the wouldbe kidnapper to beckharts marines the man turned out to be a frustrated newshawk trying to get around seiner and confederation censors beckhart booted him off planet days ground by producing no insoluble problems the auction bidding was wild prime ambergris nodes repeatedly brought record prices there were rumors that confederation meant to get a stranglehold on the trade outsiders and private industry wanted to grab while the grabbing was good that rumor made moyshe nervous the way the admiral shrugged it off he suspected the bureau had an angle the war scare if not genuine was convincing confederation and ulantonid forces were marshaling on the boundaries of the march of ulant people were getting scared did they mean to fight one another or some third party the news people were wondering too luna command had been leaking one line of news one week another the next news snoops became moyshes biggest problem they used every trick to capitalize on an opportunity to approach real seiners moyshe did three interviews himself someone had tipped the media that he was a former bureau agent he refused interviews after someone discovered that he and mouse had been responsible for jupp von drachaus famous raid in the hell stars then seiners ceased to be newsworthy the swordrattling on the frontier faded away luna command had admitted that a secret research station and its entire solar system had been destroyed the hitherto hypothetical nova bomb had been developed there and proven in unfortunate circumstances maybe there is a god moyshe thought a loving god willing to turn an insane weapon on its creators there was a tape of the disaster navy claimed it had been shot by a supply vessel entering the system by happenstance it got hours of air play it was awesome but there was something odd about it moyshe could not shake the feeling that it had been faked beckhart seemed to be amused by the whole thing that was not his style not in the face of a genuine disaster moyshe was using a free minute to try digesting sixteen months of back news when amy walked into his traileroffice what the hell are you doing here he demanded thats some greeting from a husband she pouted i thought youd be glad to see me she pulled his rolling chair from behind his desk spun him and plopped into his lap im not its too damned dangerous you mustve found yourself a girlfriend yeah i know all about you navy men the danger all right i give up he hugged her let me knosh on your neck woman there was a knock up girl enter a harassed and apologetic youth bustled in messages and mail he said looks like some real excitement starting how so read read the messenger folded his receipt and left the top flimsy was a copy of a terse communique from gruber he had sent a strong probing force toward stars end it had been driven away by a combined force of sangaree and mcgraw pirates amy read that she did what an alliance between the sangaree and pirates he initialed the copy flipped it into mouses in box the next flimsy was intriguing freehauler merchantmen off carsons and sierra reported that the navy squadrons there had taken hyper he passed the copy to amy all naval personnel here have had their liberties cancelled two of the squadrons up top have been told to make ready to space what do you think the war thing about the break he shrugged the only other item was a magazine literati with attached envelope handaddressed to a thomas mcclennon captain cn it baffled moyshe i see youve been promoted amy said suspicion edged her voice he glanced at her surprised anger and fear colored her face in turn what the hell he set the envelope aside and turned to the magazines contents page halfway down he encountered the title all who were before me in jerusalem followed by the promoted name no murmured and i dont understand this what is it amy looked over his shoulder am i supposed to congratulate you i dont understand whats happening i dont either love believe me i dont he slipped one arm around her waist turned to the story it was the version he had written aboard danion before deciding to become a seiner how had the magazine obtained it he threw his thought train into reverse he had not packed the manuscript in any of the bags he had lost when his gear had gone back to confederation without him though he had not seen the manuscript since then he was sure it was in his cabin he had not moved it he was absolutely certain he had not amy remember my story the one you never could understand you know what happened to the manuscript no i figured you trashed it i didnt ask because i thought youd get mad i never gave you any time to write and i know you wanted to he made a call to security aboard danion fifteen minutes later he knew the manuscript was not in his cabin thinking it safely stowed away he had not worried about it before he worried now everything he and mouse had learned about the starfishers had been in that manuscript penned between the lines and on the backs of sheets in invisible ink if that had reached the bureau amy that business with the sangaree failsafer come on weve got to talk to jarl he grabbed her wrist and dragged her he snatched the flimsies from mouses in tray what are you mad about she asked slow down moyshe youre hurting me hurry up thiss important they found kindervoort at a place called pagliaccis it was a dusky scenty parkfacing restaurant where both seiner and confederation luminaries dined and amused themselves by pumping one another over pasta and wine benrabi pushed past the carabinier doorman overran a spiffy maître de stalked across a darkly decorated main dining room through garlicy smells to a small private room in the rear admiral beckhart held court there these days he and kindervoort were playing a game of fencewithwords kindervoort was losing he was relieved by moyshes appearance moyshe slapped the papers down in front of kindervoort weve been had kindervoort scanned the top flimsy wherere your ships headed he asked beckhart the admiral chuckled i dont ask you questions like that but not to worry my friends it doesnt involve your people not directly he chuckled again like an old man remembering some prank of his youth kindervoort read the second flimsy then thumbed through the magazine i suppose you want me to congratulate you moyshe so congratulations jarl i didnt finish that story till a couple days before the landsmen went home and i came into this mess graded commander someone had to put the story on the ship to carsons and it wasnt me that did i left it out of my stuff because it carried the notes id kept for him ah i see kindervoort considered beckhart the admiral smiled asked this lovely lady your bride thomas amy favored him with an uncertain smile watch him honey hes another mouse he can charm a cobra kindervoort stared and thought finally he asked did they get anything critical i cant remember i think it was mostly social observations like that impressions guesswork sit down thomas beckhart said mrs mcclennon drinks something to eat its benrabi now moyshe benrabi benrabi grumbled im used to mcclennon you know surely you cant expect an old dog to learn new tricks he rang for service mrs mcclennon youve caught yourself a pretty special man i consider my men my boys like sons so to speak and thomas and mouse are two of my favorites benrabi frowned what was the man up to so though he defected and it hurts i try to understand im glad he finally found someone he needs you missy so be good to him amy began to relax beckhart charmed her into giving him a genuine smile there we go there we go i recommend the spaghetti children astonishingly good for this far from nowhere jarl coughed a none too subtle reminder that there was business to be discussed all right beckhart said turning to kindervoort im exercising an old mans prerogative im changing my mind im going to spill the facts before theres a bad misunderstanding yes do benrabi snapped thomas thomas dont be so damned hostile all the time he sipped some wine first lets swing back to the ulantonid war to their rationale for attacking confederation our blue friends are obsessed with the long run us apes the best we manage is a tenyear fleet modernization program or a twentyyear colonial development project they figure technological and sociological effects in terms of centuries wed save ourselves a lot of trouble if wed take a page from their book thomas sip your wine and be patient im politely getting to the point what i want you to understand is they roam pretty far afield in order to figure out whats coming up the day after next year whats that got to do with whatever youre up to now kindervoort asked im getting there im getting there see this right here is whats wrong with our species were always in such a damned hurry we never look ahead my point ulant does when the war hates settled down and we let them build ships again they resumed their deep probes so moyshe said he was trying to fly easy but for some reason he had a chill crawling his spine let an old man have his way thomas it isnt every day i spout cosmic secrets in an italian restaurant here it is then about thirty years ago ulant made an alien contact this was a long way in along the arm they eventually brought it to our attention people this race makes our friends the sangaree look angelic ive seen them in action myself really words cant express it what i mean to say is i hope i dont have to see them again here in our space theyre bad people really bad when they get done with a world theres nothing left bigger than a cockroach the admiral paused for effect his audience did not respond he looked from face to face thats a bit much to swallow moyshe said it is of course it took us a while to bite when the blues brought it to us by us i mean luna command they knew better than to go to that dungheap called a diet for a good many years now with the minister the only civilian in the know weve been working with ulant to get ready benrabi recalled his visit to luna command before drawing the starfisher assignment the place had gone completely weird the tunnels had been filled with rumors of war and crowded with military folk from a variety of races and scores of human planets beyond confederations pale even then there had been the smell of something big in the air then this confrontation with ulant is a smoke screen a light show cooked up with prime defender so she and you people could con bigger appropriations admiral the first lesson pounded into me at academy was that the services dont make policy yep and its the first lesson an officer unlearns thomas one of my staff boys quoted me a roman soldier a while back we are the empire thomas the services are confederation those of us who have gotten old in our jobs take that to heart we make policy me i shape the whole confederation outlook im doing it right now by talking about this its no big thing though the news is starting to break so many people are in the know now truth cant hide in three months every citizen will have seen tapes documenting the murder of the world i visited i can run that tape for you if you want just come over to headquarters sometime then you wont think im blowing smoke i dont think it i know it but moyshe was not sure he had known the admiral for a decade he never had seen the man more excited or more intense he had assumed an aura the way mouse did when he talked about sangaree you talk like a man whos found religion beckhart nodded youre right im getting carried away but ive seen it it doesnt make any sense and thats why its so damned scary they hop from world to world like galactic exterminators im doing it again sorry why are you telling us now kindervoort demanded trying to shed some light on what were doing were going to make our first spoiling strike before the end of the year we have just a couple of things left to straighten out before we move benrabi had a sudden intense feeling of danger startled he glanced over his shoulder there was no one behind him beckharts explanation mad as it sounded did tie the bureaus frantic behavior into a neat ball whats still on your job list moyshe asked he glared at beckhart daring him to say something about starfishers the original assignment now made military sense communications were the backbone of the fleet every ambergris node obtained would improve navys combat efficiency beckhart surprised him again sangaree thomas the worms that gnaw from within moyshes mental alarms jangled you dont expect the sangaree to be a longterm problem no thanks to mouse what kindervoort and benrabi spoke together why were you sent to the starfishers thomas to locate you a starfish herd to get navy a source of ambergris it wouldnt have to share so you thought so you thought actually incorporation was a political goal not military it hasnt been important to luna command weve known how to find paynes fleet for years thats right captain kindervoort starfishers can be recruited i have agents aboard danion thomas suspected as much when he charged in here with his magazine but there was no pressing need to incorporate you grabbing a fleet might have started a fatal uproar nowadays if i was a starfisher who hoped for a future in my business id polish up on my confederation studies kindervoort smiled a thin wicked smile i dont think we need to worry admiral beckhart winked at moyshe jerked his head to indicate kindervoort doesnt know me does he thomas the mission was aimed at the sangaree you should have known thats all mouse works dont interrupt your elders boy benrabi had intended to ask why he had been sent along i thought the starfishers because they deal with the freehaulers and mcgraws might have a line on homeworld too my guess was wrong but my intuition was right youre lying moyshe thought youre editing the past to fit the needs of the present you knew and controlled more than youll ever tell beckhart said mouse found what i needed he got it out of the astrogational computer of a mindburned raidship captured at stars end he extracted the data and sent it out von drachau was given the attack mission judging from the fleet alert he pulled it off hes probably on his way home now likely with a mob chasing him the pressure should ease for you at stars end jarl you might not have to fight your way in after all you might say weve done you a favor beckhart leaned back in his chair grinning at kindervoorts consternation you cant kid a kidder boy we guessed what you were up to before you got here our agents confirmed what we suspected if you knew that moyshe said why havent you given us any trouble id think youd jump on stars end like kindervoort kicked him under the table several reasons thomas were spread too thin already guarding against their raidships if they get too excited weve got no feud with you and you cant do anything but get yourselves killed out there anyway so why get excited benrabi studied the old man beckhart was excited what else was up his sleeve the theft of the stars end weaponry after the seiners opened the planet had mouse reported their suspicion that the seiners could manage it why was the admiral here now instead of in luna command stars end would be a damned good reason it came down to mouse had mouse simply yielded to his hatreds and passed on the information about the sangaree or was he still reporting kindervoort asked if youre spread so thin how could you mount a raid on homeworld it wasnt a raid it was a wipeout lets say the nova bomb disaster wasnt as complete as the news people have been led to believe lets suppose a couple of the weapons were taken out before the blowup lets take it a little further and speculate that a certain jupp von drachau tumbled one into homeworlds sun benrabi snapped up out of his chair breaking amys sudden iron grip on his arm he stared over beckharts head into cruel vistas of selfcondemnation a whole solar system destroyed youre insane youre all insane i wish you could know how much soulsearching went into the decision thomas i honestly do and despite the four slash six memo i dont think the decision would have been made had it not been for the centerward race thomas come and see those tapes before you judge us all right benrabi ignored him he was back to that failsafer day again how did mouse get the manuscript out to beckhart kindervoort had watched them every second beckharts seiner agents must have handled it while mouse was holding everyones attention he remembered a seiner known as grumpy george old george was a coin collector he and moyshe had done business several times george had had a superb collection he had claimed to have made an outstandingly lucky blind purchase during an auction held on the big rock candy mountain years ago any truly devoted collector was vulnerable and george was an obsessive this same george had come to angel city with the first group of tourists he had stopped by the office to ask about hobby shops moyshe had passed him on to storm mouse had given him a list how many hobby shops does the bureau run admiral beckharts eyebrows leapt upward damn thomas but you always were intuitive just one these days oddly enough its right here in angel city in other words the place has served its purpose beckhart leaned toward kindervoort you see why he made captain so young kindervoort simply looked baffled an ulcer that had not bothered moyshe for a year took a sudden bite from his gut someone pounded on the door mr benrabi are you there come in whats up someone just tried to kill mister storm what how it was a woman sir she just came up and started shooting is he all right yes sir he took off after her she headed into old town old town was that part of angel city which had lain under the first settlers dome today it was largely a warehouse district it was the base of the citys small underworld you think its the sangaree woman kindervoort asked marya a grudge like that is the only thing that would set mouse off benrabi replied how could she be here amy demanded id better go dig him out moyshe said if its all right with you jarl its your shift do what you want amy stay with jarl moyshe told the messenger find me six offduty volunteers tell them to meet me outside my office armed yes sir moyshe bent kissed amy in a little while hon he wished he could have been a more loving husband lately events had permitted them only the most brusque of relationships he caught beckhart giving him an odd look a baffled questioning look what did that mean puzzled he went to the door he paused there glanced back kindervoort and amy were sipping their drinks lost within themselves poor jarl the pressures here were too much for him he was becoming less and less active more and more a figurehead was it cultural shock he would survive he would make a comeback in his own milieu he did not worry moyshe his concern was the almost magical disappearance of the admiral while his back was turned he hated to admit it he loved that old man like a father their relationship had that attractionrepulsion of fatherson tension but he could not trust the man they were of different tribes now he had to hurry if he meant to stay ahead of beckhart he was a block from the restaurant when he encountered the first poster it clung crookedly to the flank of a marine personnel carrier he trotted past before it registered he stopped spun around his eyes widened yes the face of a woman a meter high smiled at him alyce he croaked wham darkness slammed home he no longer knew where or who he was he staggered past the carrier went down on one knee his head cleared he was in angel city he looked behind him there was a man following him no that was last time or was it for a moment he was not sure if he was gundaker niven or moyshe benrabi somebody was trying to kill gundaker niven he shook his head violently the mists cleared which name he wore did not matter niven mcclennon perchevski benrabi any of the others the enemy remained the same he returned to the personnel carrier the poster was gone he circled the quiet machine he could find no evidence one had existed what the hell is happening to me he muttered he resumed trotting toward his headquarters he encountered the second poster fewer than fifty meters from his office trailer it clung to the side of one of the tents his people used for quarters he reacted just as he had before he came out of it clinging to a tree gasping like a man who had almost drowned the poster was gone had it ever existed he wondered the fragile stability he had constructed with chubs help was fraying was he in for a bad fall he clambered into his trailer like a man carrying an extra fifty kilos dropped into his swivel chair his heart hammered his ears pounded he was scared he closed his eyes and searched his mind for a clue to what was happening he found nothing it had to be this contact with his past the benrabi personality was not really him it could not withstand the strain of the milieu of thomas mcclennon then he noticed the envelope lying on his desk the envelope that had been attached to the magazine literati he stared as if it were poisonous he tried to back away one hand stole forward it was from greta helsung the girl he had sponsored in academy his pseudodaughter it was a grateful anxious friendly missive seven pages of tight script reviewing her progress in academy and her continual fears for his safety she knew that he had been captured by enemies of confederation his friends had promised they would rescue him they would get her letter to him and this and that and she loved him and all his friends in luna command were well and happy and pulling for him and she hoped she would see him soon there were several photographs of an attractive young blond in navy blacks she looked happy there was also a note from an old girlfriend max expressed the same sentiments with more reserve what were they trying to do why couldnt yesterday let him be greta had such a cute winsome smile he sealed his eyes and fought to escape the conflicting emotions he began to feel very cold then to shake then to be terribly afraid fifteen ad the contemporary scene there were fifty ships in the exploratory fleet they had not seen a friend in two years it was a big galaxy they were lightyears from home moving toward the galactic core backtracking old destruction there had been eightyone ships at the beginning a few had been lost others had been left at regular intervals to catch and relay instelled reports from the probe most of the ships were small and fast equipped for survey and intelligence scanning the fleet was near its operational limit three months more and the ships would have to swing around the great questions still unanswered the advance coreward had been slow and methodical still space was vast and only a fragmentary vision of enemy territory had been assembled the stars were densely packed here the night around the fleet was jeweled far more heavily than farther out the arm the skies were alien and strange the worlds were silent and barren where were the centerward people building all their ships where did the killing hordes spring from the ulantonid explorers had detected convoys heading rimward they had seen a parade of dead worlds but they had located nothing resembling a base occupied world or industrial operation they had learned only that the enemy came from still farther toward the galaxys heart then too there had been the tagged asteroids in the dead solar systems huge metallic bodies three to five hundred kilometers long all similar in composition eleven such rocks marked with transponders had been located the ulantonid specialists had been unable to conjecture the meaning of the tagging the probe fleet had established five tracks along which enemy ships advanced out the arm each was a river of charged particles ions and free radicals contact was carefully avoided the mission was one of observation remote surveillance of the charged paths showed not only the occasional outward passage of a fleet but the regular back and forth of courier vessels that suggested the enemy had no instel capability which was an important deduction the allies would obtain a tactical advantage by being able to coordinate their forces over far vaster distances the centerpiece of the ulantonid fleet was its only true ship of war a vessel which beggared the human empire class it bore the name dance in ruby dawn humans named their warships for warriors battles cities old provinces lost empires and fighting ships of the past ulant used the titles of poems and novels symphonies and works of art each race found the others naming system quaint ruby dawn carried the liaison team provided by confederations bureau of naval intelligence those people had been away from home even longer than their ulantonid shipmates theirs was a grueling task they had to survey all incoming data and isolate those bits which justified transmission to luna command they had to be diplomatic with their hosts it was too much for twelve people eleven thousand lightyears from the nearest of their own kind an ulantonid officer stepped into their working compartment commander russell were getting something that might interest you russell was a short black man built like a tombstone he almost responded well get it in a while wont we wheres the damned hurry he did not the blues were so courteous it made him ashamed to think of giving them a hard time important he asked the blues were showing strain too though they were more accustomed to extended missions song of myrion reported a strong neutrino source it didnt look natural on the other hand it was twothirds of a parsec from the nearest star control is moving probe ships in from several directions it was felt that you would want to see the scans were getting of course of course doris you can get in touch through group voice nomahradine lead on group voice russell did not expect anything the blues came up with something new twice a week there was always a natural explanation but someone always went along it was part of the getalong policy never give the blues offense the squabbling and snarling had to be confined to liaison team quarters a communications officer greeted them with we might have something this time group voice he gestured russell surveyed the elaborate and only slightly alien equipment one huge display pinpointed the probeships involved in the current exercise they had taken positions on an arc one ulantonid lightyear from the neutrino source lines and arrows of colored light flickered in and out of existence russell was astounded the neutrino source was not a point the lines indicated that it subtended a half second of arc vertically and horizontally from the point of view of each observer he did some quick mental arithmetic jesus he murmured thats a globe almost six times ten to the twelfth kilometers in diameter thats five hundred tunes the diameter of the old solar system the group voice was equally impressed commander thats one hell of an artifact russell scanned the displays there was enough mass in the region to slightly distort space the stars behind did not show through could it be a dark nebula too dense youll take a closer look when its cleared up top whatever it is its moving at a damned good clip thats what makes us so interested commander russell looked for a spare seat there were none the word was out the place was filled with curious blues the heart of the shield or fleet admiral made her entry she spoke with her science officers and included russell as a courtesy russell simply listened it was not his place to offer his thoughts it took three days to design a probe mission a swarm of instrument packages would be placed in the great globes path well ahead passive hidden on old spatial debris care would be exercised so the ships placing the instruments would remain undetected it took three weeks to do the seeding another month passed before the globe reached the instruments during that period scores of couriers were recorded moving to and from the neutrino source two convoys swarmed out toward the remote frontier intense examination of space behind the globular revealed it to be the focus of tremendous activity enemy ships swarmed through that trailing space the globular had a cometary tail of vessels falling away and catching up it looks like the warfleets are clearing the way for this outfit russell told his compatriots arent they working a little far ahead i mean itll be thirty or forty thousand years before they reach confederation maybe its lag time in case the war fleets run into somebody stubborn stubborn they could roll over anything therere so many of them the numbers become meaningless still there seems to be a gap in weapons and communications technology between them and us id guess around two centuries that means well kill a lot more of them than theyll kill of us the blues think theyre frozen into a technological stasis their real weapon is their numbers if they ran into somebody very far ahead of us theyd suffer theyd win but it might take them generations id guess theyve been through it before which would be why the globular is so far behind the front probes into star systems behind the globular had shown for the first time the enemy actually living on planets billions of the little kangaroo people seemed to have been dumped apparently to rework the worlds to certain specifications the ulantonid experts thought they would be taken off after the terraforming was complete yet another puzzle more of the little creatures were occupied mining the asteroidal and cometary belts of numerous systems operating in hordes they stripped whole systems of spatial debris the significance of the marked bodies had become apparent the little folk were using that type asteroid as a portable world the big bodies were mined hollow given drives and turned into immense spaceships given spin they achieved centrifugal gravity built up in tiers inside they could provide more living space than any planet they could grow with their populations they must breed like flies someone suggested if they have to devour everything for living space question russell said the blues say they leave the planets after terraforming them why nothing about these things makes any sense a woman replied i think were wasting our time trying to figure them out lets concentrate on finding weaknesses russell suggested knowing why theyre doing what theyre doing might clue us how to stop them anybody think we can do that now ruby dawn was a ship of despair hope had vanished its crew no longer believed their peoples would survive the coming onslaught we need deeper probes russell said we have to get this far again past the globular if we really want to know what theyre doing from here it looks like a millionyear project to remodel the galaxy but we cant probe that deep no we cant unfortunately so well never know when the first remote instruments were activated by the globular everyone in the fleet made sure he or she could examine the incoming data within hours the sight of lines of huge asteroidships stacked tens of thousands high wide and deep killed all interest what point to staring into the eyes of doom let the watching be done by machines that could not be intimidated the probe fleet turned toward home pursuing the sorry knowledge it had sped ahead sixteen ad the main sequence six of moyshes best men gathered outside his trailer they had donned nighttime black they were buttoning buttons and making sure their equipment was in order each bore weapons carried a hand comm gas mask and any odd or end the individual thought might come in handy to a man they were still trying to rub sleep from their eyes benrabi leaned against the frame of the door to his office he was still shaky you guys willing to get into a fight to save my friend mouse youre on chief someone muttered hes just an immigrant you know we wouldnt be here if we werent ready jack another said were ready sir hes one of us now i never liked him much myself he stole my girl but we got to protect our own a third said klaus youre just spoiling for a fight so now i got an excuse maybe okay okay benrabi said keep it down heres the frosting for the cake i think the sangaree woman is involved yeah maybe this time well do the job right i tried before i didnt get a lot of support wont be nobody to feel sorry for her this time captain moyshe started looked the speaker in the eye he saw no offense was meant he and mouse did have brevetcommissions as captains of police with kindervoorts regular captains commission senior seiners seldom used their professional ranks and titles he grinned i think youre all fools he said and i thank you for it ill be with you in a minute he stepped back inside scanned the current data on number of seiners onplanet the count was way down people did not want to play tourist at night when most everything was closed he tapped out a red code to traffic aboard danion meaning something was up and no one else was to be allowed down till further word he guessed that within four hours there would be no seiners on the broken wings who were not part of the security effort he stepped outside lets go they whooped like a bunch of rowdy boys they worried moyshe they thought this would be fun he had to calm them down they could get themselves hurt he led them aboard a marine personnel carrier took the control seat himself the engine hummed first try he roared toward old town gears crashing and tracks whining he was so excited that for a few minutes he forgot to cut in the mufflers rumbling through empty night streets he tried to anticipate mouse where would storm go that would depend on his quarry if mouse lost her the warehouse important to their first mission would seem to him a likely place to pick up the track again the sangaree always nosethumbingly bold or stupid might be using it again the warren of tall crowded old brick buildings pressed in as moyshe plunged ever deeper into the inky silence of old town the wareshouse district was a nervetaunting area the smell of poverty and old evil reeked from every alley and doorway benrabi became jittery he put on more speed almost there men he swung into the street leading past the warehouse he wanted brought the carrier to a violent shuddering stop a bright actinic flash that left ghosts dancing behind his eyes proclaimed nasty business afoot a half block beyond his goal the old site had not been renovated the sangaree obviously were not using it stand by men looks like weve found him there was another flash he eased the carrier over so it would not block the street everybody out stand easy he used a pencil to scratch a diagram on the pavement he was amazed at how easily the old town layout came back it had been years nick you and clair come in this way klaus take mike and will and come in from over here kraft and i will go straight up the street test your comms okay move out bright laseweapons continued their ineffectual duel benrabi and kraft stalked forward clinging to shadow till they spotted one of the duelists moyshe studied the fire patterns three gunmen were besieging a warehouse one man was shooting back from inside he had skill enough to keep the three pinned they must have lost somebody already moyshe guessed the besiegers seemed to be in the grip of a crisis of nerve maybe theyre keeping him pinned for somebody else maybe the situation looked a little strange the man in the warehouse was not behaving like mouse mouse would not waste time sniping he preferred the attack what do you see moyshe asked his man was looking around with infrared nighteyes theres just three of them funny they look like pirates what give me those moyshe took the glasses kraft was right the besiegers wore mcgraw jumpsuits that made no sense this was enemy territory for mcgraws could be mouse inside though if they were pirates they were working with the sangaree now maybe storm was hurt whispering to his handcomm moyshe moved teams into position behind each sniper ready shoot on my mark shoot it did not go well the seiners did not have what it took to do a man first hand in cold blood they allowed a vicious exchange of fire before dropping two of the men the third escaped only after taking wounds no cosmetic surgeon would ever repair and still moyshe worried it seemed too easy he was changing he was hardening into the paranoid hunter bureau had made of him he did not recognize the shift right away all clear mouse he called ozone stench and the smell of hot brick assailed his nostrils sudden steam surrounded him rising from a puddle left by the programed rain of the dinner hour a quick pair of lasebolts had missed him low and high he scrambled for cover what the hell is the matter with that bastard has he gone hyperbent give me that stunner he snapped at kraft who was too scared to move he must be hurt bad here take this he shoved his own weapon into the seiners hands come on get yourself together youve got to help to the other teams via handcomm he snarled draw fire you guys and i mean give it to him im going to stun him a stunning would not please mouse but benrabi considered the alternatives even less pleasant beams on low setting tickled the ochre brick of the warehouse bluing the night weirdly the whole street crackled and flickered and came alive legions of shadows danced like spooks at midnight the return fire became erratic and completely ineffective moyshe pinpointed the source armed carefully held his trigger stud down get over there he growled at kraft the stunners spinetingling whine continued till several seiners pushed through the warehouses street door minutes later from the window someone shouted you got her moyshe her what the hell do you mean its a woman you got her clean dont look like theres any nerve damage a stunner sometimes played hell with its victims nervous system death or permanent damage could result it did not happen often is it strehltsweiter no come on over shes coming around what about mouse aint no sign of him a woman he thought as he started walking what the hell there were only two women involved in this business amy and marya the man would have screamed if this were either of them the sangaree woman was on the broken wings though of that he was convinced the woman was leaning out the window upchucking when moyshe entered the room whence she had been shooting her shoulders slumped with defeat moyshe watched her from the doorway she seemed vaguely familiar from behind chiefs here lady one of his men said his tone not unkind the woman pushed herself off the sill turned alyce the name came out a strangled toad croak thomas hammers of darkness pounded his brain hands as light as the wings of moths tried to bear him up a voice asked whats wrong moyshe from several lightyears away despite the additional impact of seeing the woman in the flesh the episode ended in seconds cold shaking benrabi fought for selfcontrol she deposited her behind on the filthy window sill her breath came in shallow difficult gasps her face remained curiously immobile despite its obvious effort to portray a variety of emotions shock he wondered he looked inside himself he was shocked shivering he tumbled into a dusty old chair stared at this impossible ghost of a romance past his thoughts swooped and whirled through a realm of chaos his soul cried in torment as it had done so constantly during his ancient introduction to the seiners all the demons he had thought fettered with his starfishs help were now breaking their chains and howling up from their dungeons the inexplicable mindsymbol he called the image of the gun flashed in and out of existence like some barbarous neon advertisement for mental disease he did not pass out again neither did he regain his emotional feet he fought what was happening in his head fending it while trying to analyze there was something a little changed about all those old spooks they were not quite identical with their predecessors had time eroded them helped them grow older and more mellow what moyshe what the hell is wrong klaus demanded woman what did you do to him moyshe heard he did not respond what could he do what could he say to klaus or alyce he had not expected to see her again ever even in the tight social environment of luna command certainly not out here on the fringes of confederation a thousand lights from the scene of their passion and pain it was too wildly implausible a coincidence yet there she sat as agonizingly real as death itself he ground the heels of his hands into his temples feeling the precursor pain of a savage headache he gripped his stomach where his halfforgotten ulcer was coming to sudden unpleasant life his thoughts churned and sprayed like wild white water his very brain seemed to be sliding on its foundations barriers came crashing down viewpoints shifted if he did not grab something as he whipped past his soul would be left a fanged wasteland as lovely and desolate as a bombedout city he caught a glimmer of what was happening he shied off like a whipped dog he clamped down shoving a hundred mental fingers into the sodden dikes if he could just hold on till he found mouse how are you alyce asked her voice was different it was older less musical more hardened by life her question had no meaning it was just noise meant to break a fearful silence he did not immediately respond his men watched him with wonder and uncertainty uncomfortably aware that they were on the brink of seeing a soul laid bare im fine moyshe finally mumbled howre you okay now but she was not she was shaking violently it was a common reaction to stunner shock she would be feeling as cold as he why were those men shooting at you he asked trying to gain some stability by concentrating on business whatre you doing here it was a girl thomas with your hair and eyes shut her up it began to twist and burn down deep inside the dikes began to give the demons howled and laughed that insane image of the gun thing superimposed itself over alyces face mike he gasped take two men outside and keep an eye out for mcgraws his second desperate attempt to achieve stability failed the dikes were bulging inward whyre you here he squeaked i thought it was all dead she said i thought id forgotten it but i cant thomas go away leave me alone leave her alone yes fine but how did he get her to leave him alone lady the chief asked a question his man nicolas growled answer up easy nick no rough stuff thiss personal not business he spoke too late not business snakeswift the seiner laid a hand alongside the womans face the blow hurled her to the floor he caught her hair as she fell yanked she screamed but her cry did not register with moyshe what did was her hair face and throat coming away in nicolass hand the seiner raised his trophy like the shrunken wrinkled head of a cyclops the unmasked woman seemed vaguely familiar but she was not benrabis old haunt moyshe you done been set up benrabi could not stifle a squeaky little laugh i done been nick nicolas wheeled on the woman you start talking what kind of game are you playing dont bother nick we wont get anything we dont have the equipment there were no tears in the womans eyes now she showed nothing but apprehension moyshe added i dont know if it would be worth the trouble anyway he did not need equipment despite the chaotic state of his mind a strong suspicion blossomed someone was working on him he had a good idea who and why hey moyshe another of the men called mike says we got trouble mcgraws a dozen or so out by the carrier he was regaining his composure it was a trap but it didnt go according to plan he turned to the woman the pirates werent in the script were they to his surprise she responded she shook her head you tell the old man to get him a better makeup crew nick weve got to get out of here see if you can get kindervoort on tac two tell him i need a pickup squad well let the corps worry about their carrier he had cobbled together a false peace within him he knew it would not last he had to finish fast he would begin crumbling again soon the one straw too many had been thrown into the camels back from here on in each period of tranquility would be just one more frantic holding action doomed to eventual failure the decay would accelerate whenever the survival pressure slackened he had seen it all before in fellow agents he was entering the initial stages of a spontaneous uncontrolled unsupervised personality program debriefing it could get rough there were so many identities in his background that he could lose his anchor to any of them what about the woman nicolas asked leave her shes not the enemy moyshe said another jarl says to meet him by jellyroll jones you know what he means yeah its a statue in the old park pass the word to mike he knows the place nick lead off keep close guys he turned to the woman goodbye he could not think of anything else to say she shrugged but seemed relieved they slid out the back way ran through a block of shadows benrabi began to worry about the time he had been away from his job too long how much longer but it looked easy there was a shot and a shout a second slug ricocheted off brick near benrabi cobblestones became arrowheads piercing his chest as he tried to get closer to the soil shades of his last visit to the broken wings he thought his men returned the fire their lasebeams scoring the brick of the walls of the buildings flanking the alley where the ambusher crouched come on benrabi snarled shoot at him dammit a fourth slug kicked chips of alley and lead into his face he wiped at tiny pearls of blood wondered why the assassin was concentrating on him was he maryas man where was jarl where were mike and his men dammit you guys dont you know this aint a goddamned game and where was mouse who had started this mess by disappearing emotion began to rage through him again undirected and confused he tried to control it failed his personality program resumed its dissolution the only anchor left him was a hard red hot anger a foot scraped cobblestone somewhere behind him he rolled shot hit a leg a man yelped scrambled for cover the gunman with the antique firearm kept booming away mcclennon benrabi took a second shot at his victim before he got out of sight another shadow drifted into the shelter of a doorway moyshes program ceased its disintegration his perceptions reached a high usually stimulated only by drugs he felt every point and angle of the cobblestones beneath him seemed to become one with the dampness left by the programed rain he saw the grey and brownness of stone the expanding sparks and yellows of another muzzle flash heard the thud as a bullet smacked brick behind him he smelled damp and sulfurousness of swamp the atmosphere systems could never completely overcome he could even taste it seemed something salty whoa that was blood from a chip wound dribbling into the corner of his mouth he edged sideways four meters and he would be in a position where the wouldbe assassin would have to expose himself to fire he made it the man shot moyshe shot back heard a yelp his men pursued him in his rush into that alley moyshe kicked the revolver away from the wouldbe assassin this clown is as incompetent as you guys come on get your butts moving before i heat them up myself he waved his stunner angrily there were shouts from the alley they had abandoned he spun dropped fired quickly followed his men the sting of his flesh wounds drove him like a hunted beast who am i now he wondered this isnt like me im not a fighter gundaker niven niven was supposed to be a hardcase the adrenalin had him on the verge of another case of the shakes he had been through this kind of thing before for the bureau but never had been able to achieve mouses calmness under fire he always got scared shaky and constantly had to battle the impulse to flee maybe that was why he had outlived several mouselike partners but they too had been programed to their roles he was doing well this time he thought he was showing flashes of casehardened calm and shooting when it was time to shoot he had not thought himself capable of that where the hell was that idiot mouse after a dozen twists and turns along his journey he slowed started trying to look like a tourist headed for the jones monument his men stalked along behind him the monument had not changed it was the same tall bronze statue surrounded by the same small park its boundary stockaded by imported pines and bushes between the trees and the statue there were a dozen lighted fountains where sea nymphs bathed in endlessly falling waters the park was the heart of an oasis in the desert of old town lining the streets facing it were several museums the opera a library and smart little shops which catered to the wealthy among them were homes belonging to some of angel citys oldest families the square was a tenacious place it refused to admit that old towns glories had faded most decaying cities contained a few such pearls seventeen ad the main sequence jellyroll jones as great men went was an accident he never had been a hero he came in near the foot of the list of spaceage memorables his most singular act had been that of arriving on the broken wings before anyone else native school children were taught to consider him a hero in the mold of a spacefaring magellan but his myths bore no relation to the truth his discovery had been sheer happenstance and against his will his ship had crashed here because of damage the guns of a palisarian directorate police corvette had done his astrogational computer he and his crew the women represented by the fountain nymphs had hidden here for a few months unable to take the heat humidity and stench any longer they had radioed for help the corvette had collected them old jellyroll had died in prison moyshe paused in a shadow he studied the statue and the dancing tips of water columns visible above the trees jarls on his comm man told him moyshe took the hand radio jarl where are you weve got people after us be there in five minutes moyshe benrabi heard strange sounds behind kindervoorts voice whats going on jarl roadblock trouble with the natives were talking them down dont take too long were only a jump ahead nicolas hand comm against his ear shook his head mikes three blocks from here says they might be pulling out maybe they read our signals jarl we look okay for now theyre maybe running well be waiting on the north side you get anything on mouse not yet moyshe out out benrabi returned the hand comm studied the park through nighteyes it seemed peaceful enough he started toward jellyroll flash shit not again from the frying pan into the fire twice maybe not the shot had not been directed his way there were more shots someone was fighting in there mouse it looked like a baby battle a duel two men moving between shots one was armed with a stunner only nick hold on here ill check it out moyshe trotted toward jellyroll the action seemed to be among the fountains beyond the statue benrabi pushed through the trees he tried to spot the duelists but they had stopped shooting was it over he slipped toward the statue jellyroll would make a good high observation point the firing broke out again the stunner seemed to be among the far trees the lasegun was among the fountains the lasegunner illuminated by the fountain lights was moving very carefully moyshe climbed three meters up jellyrolls pedestal slithered into a prone position between the old bandits feet it did make a nice vantage point but would be hell to get away from fast he edged forward trying to spot the duelists though the farther man was in darkness moyshe found him first the nearer remained veiled by the flying jewelry flung up against the evershifting colors of the fountain lights the water susurrated hypnotically as it tumbled back into the pools a lasebolt crackled through the branches of a pine the gentle breeze brought smoky resin scents redolent of evergreen forests the farther duelist snapped a shot in reply his face was visible for an instant mouse no doubt about it this time storm clutched his left arm as he dodged to a new position what the hell benrabi thought whats the fool doing out here with nothing but a stunner mouses opponent shifted position ha benrabi gasped it is her the sangaree woman had had cosmetic surgery but her catlike sensuous movements remained unchanged she just could not hide that deadly animal grace he tried to draw a bead on her welcome back sweetheart he murmured he was not at all surprised to see her this was another passage in her deathdance with mouse and himself she did not know another dancer was about to cut in he grinned a fragment of an old personality returned he became the hard half of gundaker niven again ha she was hurt too her left side sported a wet hasty bandage mouse had gotten close once but had missed his kill surprising that was not like him it said something about how good the woman was benrabi got a good bead he had no trouble shooting the woman yowled jumped like a brokenbacked cat collapsed on the colored concrete her muscles jerked spastically then she slowly stiffened into the almostdeath typical of a solid stunner shot to the head moyshe looked down at his weapon good shooting cowboy mouse he shouted to make himself heard over the fountains shes out moyshe storm called back is that you yeah mouse sounded weak you hurt bad ill live storm came into the open stumbling toward the statue he thrust his wounded arm into his jumper for support carried his stunner like a revolver he paused beside marya stared down checkmate finally his gaze flicked to the statue back down benrabi shouted what the hell happened i been running myself dead trying to find you she sucked me in showed herself took a shot then ran i lost my head i ran right into it he glanced up again his expression odd but she made a bigger mistake eh let her gut override her brain mouse smiled wickedly his lips stretched in a ferocious duplicate of the womans vampire grin you know the funny part moyshe she was working with mcgraws thats scary when you think about it mouse fell silent he stared at the woman for a long time as if loath to end the feud though benrabi did not like it time had proven the next move necessary she had been given two chances twice she had come back for more if mouse did not end it here they would have the hellsbitch on their trail again all fangs and claws once more she and mouse were two of a kind moyshe reflected only death would stop either of them youve got to be realistic thomas moyshe benrabi mumbled to himself whats got to be has got to be he waited mouse remained reluctant time stretched personnel carriers rumbled in the street outside the park moyshe looked back expecting to see kindervoort wrong marines but just as good back to mouse was he stalling because he did not have a lethal weapon he could use hers or his hands then he understood mouse was thinking about his holy grail the hatred that had driven him so long he would not yet know about homeworld but killing marya would be symbolic of the process he had initiated symbolic of attaining his lifelong goal jupp would be the weapon marya might be the last of the ancient enemy he would encounter the end of a road is always a disappointment moyshe reflected poor mouse down deep where he lived he knew that when marya went there would be nothing left to hate his grail for all its distant sparkle was just another empty cup where do we go from here tommy he asked softly in the shadows between jellyrolls legs benrabi mcclennon could do nothing but shake his head he did not know moyshe thomass mind was becoming pandemoniac the outside pressure was off there was nothing to hold the dissociation in check he was this man for a moment then that alyce crawled through his brain like a maggot through rotting flesh something within him kept shrieking i want and not letting him know what sudden storms of emotion racked him always without detectable cause anger hate love sorrow joy despair a moment of each whap like the impact of a fist then gone as if some storehouse had been broken open and all the containers inside dumped at random he wrapped his arms around his head and moaned softly he croaked i dont know mouse it seemed an hour after his partner asked his question benrabi wanted to say stars end and back to the high rivers but the other characters inside kept telling him he would never see a harvestship again would never track another herd would never again go into contact would never build that secret service for the seiners that alyce creature must have been a hypnotic key he thought she was supposed to unlock all the spooks hidden behind the barriers chub had been unable to penetrate but the key had not opened the lock all the way no more than mouse had back when when he had tried before their scheduled return to confederation something had shorted out something was trying to take him back not just to thomas mcclennon before this mission but all the way back to a day when he had not as yet undergone any personality programming he did not want to make that journey he wanted what he had found in the high rivers between the stars he fought deep inside he howled and clawed like a wild thing tangled in a hunters net there were angry shouts in the street whence he had come the marines were disarming his men ordinary precaution he supposed his team had been operating outside its reasonable jurisdiction mouse made his decision it favored discretion he stooped to recover maryas weapon dont the voice was soft enough not to be heard far yet commanding benrabi mcclennon shrank into the shadows of jellyrolls legs his amy manynames had appeared she bore a nasty little pistol her features were as cold as mouses became when he went into assassins mind mouse looked at her saw the absence of emotion slowly straightened he did not drop his stunner wheres moyshe she snapped the grubs will be after him ive got to find him first hes suddenly the key to everything you two never really crossed over did you the words tumbled out of her mouth almost faster than her lips could shape them mouse did not answer he just stared into amys eyes holding them he clutched his weapon and waited for her coldness to thaw or was he waiting for mcclennon thomas was not sure mouse might be turning his own peril into some kind of test mcclennon was sure amys determination would not persist she was not trained for it wheres moyshe she demanded again her voice rose squeaked here love he eased from the shadows dont move please her gaze darted his way noted his stunner mouse raised his weapon no mouse not my wife you dont mouse stopped mcclennons tone halted him he swung his head for a cautious look at his partner moyshe why amy asked plaintively her weapon did not waver a millimeter from dead center on mouses chest why what honey this betrayal we gave you everything what betrayal he could hear the i she was saying inside she had opened her fortress unvanquishable to him and now his promises appeared false he had come to her bearing banners of love false banners and had raped and plundered her soul he could hear her pain but hadnt any idea what had brought it on what betrayal he demanded whats happened the marines are arresting everybody interning them they call it your beckhart sent gruber an ultimatum we open stars end for navy or he nova bombs the yards no mcclennon thought theres something twisted here something not quite straight not that beckhart would not make the threat he would and would follow through for the sake of the stars end weaponry he was a man who believed in his mission but the timing seemed askew or was it the starfishers and sangaree were inextricably entangled at stars end beckhart was free to move against the home ground of either it was a remarkable opportunity earlier he had gloated about having hit homeworlds sun damn damn damn he thought the agent part of him the old intuition put together everything beckhart had and had not said and threw forth one incontrovertible answer the admiral had been after stars end from the beginning from the moment he had summoned cornelius perchevski from his interlude with his quasidaughter greta as moyshe benrabi it had been his mission to come up with leverage beckhart could use to force the seiners to open the fortress world to luna command he had been doing the admirals work even when he had thought he was working against the man damn damn damn and he did have the lever the admiral needed beckhart had given that away in threatening gruber the admiral needed the location of the seiner yards mouse must have told the old man his partner could clue him in gruber would yield to the threat not gracefully but he would yield no sane man would do otherwise once the fate of homeworld became known gruber would surrender the single most commonly known fact about beckhart was that he was a man of his word with a threat he would use the bomb if refused but mcclennon was sure the old man was running one colossal bluff right now he could not have the coordinates of the yards three sky was huge even if he knew to look there insofar as thomas knew there were just three people on the broken wings who could tell beckhart what he had to know jarl and amy would not talk he was in one hell of a tight place the starfishers did not call their nebula three sky among themselves mcclennon doubted that one in a thousand knew that landside name and not one in a hundred of those the coordinates for the yards themselves mouse did not know mcclennon had acquired the information entirely by accident while arguing with amy wheres jarl he asked he wondered how effectively his orders had been carried out after he had alerted the fleet well probably amy was carrying on like they were the only red pass people left tears rolled as she replied hes dead moyshe he killed himself only about fifteen minutes ago i got away while they were distracted while who was distracted the military police so that roadblock had been a setup and jarl intuiting beckharts thrust had gone the only way he could to avoid checkmate and amy intended eliminating another information source him where was the harvestfleet had beckhart gotten his bluff in on payne too then what would amy do about herself put a lasebolt through her own brain she was capable she seemed a bit selfdestructive what if beckharts claims about a centerward race were valid that meant the whole human race as well as several neighboring races were threatened with extinction it seemed a lot more than seiner freedom lay on the line the weight of the decision he had to make seemed as heavy as that atlas had borne heavier hundreds of worlds might depend upon his choice ambergris and the stars end weapons they might make all the difference what to do he leaned against jellyrolls leg and stared at the symbols of the sides of his conflict which should he betray which should he destroy it was in his hands alone now and there was no evading the decision he could not let it ride in hopes it would sort itself out no god from a machine would swing down on a wire to relieve him of his burden he had always had a yearning to become a hero even for the few shooting star moments confederation culture allowed he would become one to the trillions if he delivered stars end and its arsenal he would stand beside jupp von drachau destroyer of sangaree but that would make him iscariot to millions of starfishers his fingertips sensually caressed his weapon there lay all solutions in the gun the final argument in the words of ancient mao all power comes from the mouth of a gun war and violence he thought a certain breed claimed they solved nothing those folks ignored the fact that dead men seldom argued he remembered a small ulantonid nun seen in passing in the blake city spaceport on carsons an eon ago while he and mouse had been waiting to join the starfishers she had served a dead man he was vacillating avoiding decision riding a period of stability for all it was worth one squeeze of a trigger would settle a trillion fates his friend or amy his love those symbols remained as motionless as the man between whose legs mcclennon stood they waited too aware that for the moment he was possessed of godlike power mouse had mcclennon was sure known the ramifications for some time perhaps since before the mission had begun mouse stared at amys weapon half hypnotized by the death lying there death had never touched him he had been immune for so long amy was pale and growing paler she had had time to think to see some of the possibilities and to grow scared her gun hand quivered mouse began moving almost imperceptibly bringing his stunner a little farther forward wait mcclennon snapped this is silly theres a way out they looked at him their faces grave and baffled his finger danced on his stunners trigger amy squeaked as she fell mouse looked infinitely surprised shaking mcclennon peered into the street beyond the trees behind him the marines seemed uninterested in the park good if the men just kept their mouths shut he scrambled down collected weapons stunned marya again her breathing indicated she was partially recovered and probably gathering herself for something he had to keep the three of them out of the way while he twisted the admirals tail maybe he could salvage something for everybody though beckhart would resent it all to hell but dammit it wasnt necessary to have big winners and losers everybody could lose a little and win a little and come out ahead in the end beckhart would give in if he could not catch up fast enough he had to have those coordinates soon or see his whole intrigue blow up in his face mcclennon laughed he was going to get the best of the old man and that was as rare as rocs eggs still chuckling he threw amy over his shoulder and headed for the tight darkness of old town she would come out of this hating him but by doing it this way he would give her more than he ever could with love he searched his mind for signs of instability all the gears were in place and working smoothly some sort of balance had been achieved not a natural one but one that looked good for a while he was now a little of everyone he had ever been and a little more too he hoped it would last long enough eighteen ad the main sequence what the hell is going on damon beckharts voice had a sawtoothed edge storm and the sangaree woman were in that park storm called to say he was going in after her mcclennons men admit he went in you chased the seiner woman in there four people where the hell are they now i dont know sir the major confessed we went in as soon as we knew where to look they werent there anymore no shit youre aware that three of those people are professionals arent you yes sir and two of them are ours with no reason to run one of them im not sure what mcclennon thinks he is its not his fault but he has his head on backwards and its falling apart he probably doesnt know who he is or who hes working for half the time hes the one im worried about he needs psychiatric attention fast beckhart massaged his forehead he was growing a bitch of a headache just when it looked like he had it nailed down he had to snag thomas or his woman before gruber called his bluff he had to show at the yards before the harvestfleets extricated themselves from the standoff at stars end he had to move before the sangaree raidfleet learned about homeworld why the hell did that idiot kindervoort have to go and kill himself he evidently had strong feelings theyre a stiffnecked mob ive never figured them out that damned payne is still up there making nasty talk with three squadrons sitting on his back just pride talking sir we screwed up damon if we dont find those people alive were had we do i make myself clear abundantly admiral ive got all my men digging the local police dont have any decent tracking gear but its still only a matter of time the shorter the time the better major high command is breathing down my neck the csn has a personal stake in what were doing he isnt very fond of me so dont forget that water and horseshit both go downhill message received admiral good get out there and find them and dont forget that theyre professionals the marines did not turn up a trace all night beckhart spent the time tossing sharing his cot with a cruel dread he was afraid the sangaree woman had gotten the drop on storm and mcclennon and had spirited them out of the city she had gotten out once before time trudged along the tension built he began snapping at everyone around him like a mad dog he overheard one of his technical ratings say that hit him like ice water it made him count ten before speaking he had an image of himself as a reasonable fair and fatherly superior his pride demanded that he treat his subordinates well after thirty hours he locked himself in his tiny cubicle of an office he drank coffee gobbled aspirin and wondered if he was too old to start praying admiral an excited voice called through the closed door comm call field channel three its mcclennon sir beckhart slapped his drab navy comm unit muffing the channel selection twice come on you bastard a moment later thomas where the hell are you son whats going on wheres mouse you all right were fine mouse is tied up at the moment mcclennon giggled all three of them are hes gone beckhart thought cracked completely where are you thomas around and about right now im here mcclennon report to me immediately in person no sir what thomas the whole damned thing is going down what was mcclennon up to give me one little thing admiral thats all im asking one thing and i give you stars end on a platter what the hell do you think youre doing when did commanders start bargaining with admirals captain that can be rectified mcclennon im tired and im aggravated dont give me any shit tell me where you are so i can send somebody to pick you up no sir not till i get what i want ive got something you need you give me something back you want to talk about it ill listen thomas thats all thats all had anyone had sense enough to try for a fix on mcclennons transceiver probably not too much to expect of these people its simple admiral ill give you the coordinates for the yards after you execute some instrument guaranteeing the starfishers independence recognize them as an independent political entity offer to exchange embassies offer mutual nonaggression pacts all those kinds of things that will make it hard for luna command to subjugate them without a big public outcry holy shit youre out of your mind i know it beckhart heard mcclennons pain and fear the man was scared silly he knew he was on the edge its getting worse i need help chief but ive got to do this first thomas the answer is no you know damned well that i couldnt agree to something like that even if i wanted which i dont i dont have the power high command does ill listen on this channel you let me know when the treaties are ready thomas youre committing suicide youre throwing your career away really you mean you havent used me up yet thomas you cant hide from me forever i can try admiral i can sure as hell try thomas im going to have your balls for breakfast shit he was talking to himself mcclennon was gone he hurled a halffinished mug of coffee across his office the brown liquid dribbled down the wall onto a stack of memos that had accumulated while he worried someone knocked enter major damon stepped in we triangulated the call sir no luck he wired a standard navy comm into a public box and made the call from a public box somewhere else i told you were dealing with professionals but lets consider the bright side its a small city and he has three prisoners to watch feed and keep clean hell make a mistake storm will jump him or well find him keep looking damon left beckhart cleaned up his coffee mess settled into his chair he felt better almost relaxed the worst possibilities were for the moment no more than ghosts of evil chance he made some elementary calculations the lead time he had on the seiners if he and they started for the yards together stars end was eight days rimward of the broken wings the yards were somewhere back toward the inner worlds how long till a sangaree courier reached stars end with the news about homeworld the sangaree had no known shipboard instel capacity they communicated by courier exclusively so his agents told him so he hoped the scheme depended on a long news lag and starfisher stubbornness he smiled if the fastest ship known had left homeworld immediately after von drachaus attack he should have fourteen more days thomas theres no way you can stay ahead of me for two weeks not in this burg confidence soon yielded to doubt high command withdrew his marines over his protest the doubts grew stronger on day seven the csn personally called beckhart could conceal the truth no longer he covered for mcclennon by declining to name names he was loyal to his men thomas was no turncoat he was a victim of his occupation and faulty technical preparation sooner or later every agent encountered the crisis mcclennon had had the misfortune to hit his at an historically inopportune moment heads were going to roll among the psych crew on day eleven beckhart came to the conclusion that the first head lost would be his own the csn kept making sounds like a happy executioner sharpening his axe come in major i take it youre going to tell me the same old thing unfortunately sir hes just not leaving any tracks we did find a cellar this morning that someone had been using but they were long gone when we broke in weve covered sixty percent of the city now were reasonably sure he hasnt slipped back into what weve covered reasonably sure damon i dont want reasonably sure i want absodamnposilutely sure and instead of sixty local police reservists i want my battalion of marine mps what could i do they took them he said into beckharts scowl i see it taking seven or eight days of searching with what we have major we dont have that much time the probability of contact is going up faster now sir he has less room to maneuver the computers almost guarantee well find him within five days the statistical profile is against him ive had my people stop using the regular comm nets he may have been monitoring our traffic of course he was hes crazy not stupid all right carry on beckhart leaned back thought thomas ive got to give you credit youre good when you have to be and what the hell is wrong with storm he should have done something by now he knows mcclennon better than anybody else hes the best man ive got was the little bastard in on it the possibility had not occurred before mouse was the perfect agent you did not suspect his loyalty but storms loyalty was to his dream of exterminating the sangaree of avenging his family he had no motive but habit for taking a bureau line in this and he and mcclennon had become close friends they had done too many missions together they might have cooked this whole thing up with that seiner bitch admiral the csn on instel relay from assyrian oh christ again he sounds upset hes always upset switch him through a moment later good morning sir you found that man yet no sir were closing in the computers say well have him any time now ive got computers too beckhart and a lot more input resources i have the sangaree raidmaster at stars end getting the word sometime day after tomorrow we dont know what those people will do maybe go crazy ive ordered the attack squadrons back off courier intercept thats hopeless theyll return to carsons and sierra hittite is moving up to blackworld two conqueror class reserve attack squadrons are moving into the twentyfirst transverse in case they break through the twentythird what concerns me more than the sangaree though is what gruber is going to do when hes free to deploy id guess hed head for the yards from what ive been told if he gets there ahead of you we lose theres supposedly no way we can root them out and no way to get close enough to deliver the threatened nova bomb this isnt news to you i repeat it in case youve lost sight of the facts your loyalty to your people is laudable but im aware of the problem sir it was my intention to calculate a most probable quadrant and send von drachau to wait there while i rooted this man out that would give us a few extra days added to the lead time we have because of the additional distance from stars end to the yards youre dealing with a stubborn man beckhart you havent found him yet let alone gotten him to talk you apparently know him how long can he hold out after you take him i dont know sir beckhart did not like admitting that it was a question he had been trying to ignore he had not come out equipped for mind probing he had not begun to worry about possibly needing the equipment till lately why is he doing this you mean his motives i dont know faulty psych programming is what set him off you might call it induced schizophrenia even hes not sure what hes doing or why or even who he is a good part of the time i suppose you still insist on protecting him yes sir i dont believe hes responsible for his own actions i dont want him punished because of technical errors made by the people who prepared him for his mission okay beckhart this is the word from high command prepare to meet his demands if you havent got him in hand by noon tuesday luna command time you give him what he wants sir thats the word wed rather have stars end and the seiners if we can but stars end is for sure we wont risk our shot at that weapon technology sir its not subject to debate beckhart it sounds spineless to me too and its my idea but thats the way its going to be if you get hold of him before deadline well reevaluate our position but only if you get hold of him beckhart tried several arguments none made any impression high commands position was understandable the very existence of the race was on the line but still get me major damon he ordered after the csn secured damon word from high command we find him by noon tuesday their time or he gets what he wants do the best you can beckhart leaned back closed his eyes he felt tired and old he went over all the old ground there must be a way of smoking thomas out he just had to look at it from the right angle but oh was it an elusive angle nineteen ad the main sequence mouse came around first he saw mcclennon sitting a meter away thomas wore a grave expression mouse groaned christ my head what the hell happened i shot you stunner why storm tried to sit up he could not he was tied hand and foot aw shit tommy what the hell come on cut me loose i cant whats wrong with you man i spent four months fixing it so we could get out i couldve left you behind we bought the mission off moyshe tommy with ten thousand percent interest damned my head get me some aspirin mcclennon had them in his hand a plastic cup sat on the dirt floor between himself and mouse open your mouth i gave you a little too much all of you i had to shoot fast i dont have your finesse mcclennons face settled into tired lines he had had no sleep more water dribbled to the floor than passed mouses lips mouse swallowed but too late to avoid the aspirins sourbitter taste he spat youd better explain i got backed into a corner mouse i had to make a choice you were on duty when the old man finally got around to laying the truth on the line beckhart our own fearless leader who was born without a mouth yes mcclennon repeated beckharts story about the centerward peril word for word did you believe him he was convincing hes always convincing that doesnt make him any less a liar and hes the worst ever born mcclennon was surprised he had thought that mouse shared his belief in the admirals basic honesty still that little fable would shed a lot of light on all the weird things that have been going on around luna command the last four or five years i never did buy that crap about ulant getting ready to hit us again you sure he was telling the truth you should have seen his eyes when he described the ulantonid intelligence tapes but what really convinced me was when he said theyre reactivating the climbers no lie thats straight wow what do you know about that mouse shook his head in amazement it was a difficult task lying on his side on that filthy floor you were going to explain why im lying here in this muck tied up so i cant even scratch my butt it came to a choice mouse mcclennons voice grew plaintive between betraying navy or the starfishers when i heard jarl was dead i dont follow you tommy in fact maybe you dont either you dont look very stable i think wed better get you to a psych center i know i can see whats happening to me mouse i cant stop it he closed his eyes momentarily but im holding it off i have to because when jarl killed himself that only left two people who could tell beckhart where the yards are and hes trying to bluff gruber by telling him hes going to hit the yards if the seiners dont pony up stars end and the harvestfleets me and amy and maybe you are the only ones who can give him the coordinates i cant tommy thats one nobody let me in on they didnt trust me the way they did you they werent supposed to i didnt know for sure i mightve left you behind if i had no i couldnt have you know too damned much about angel city you wouldve found me tell me what the hell youre doing im going to trade stars end for the starfishers what im going to hide till he gets luna command to agree to let the seiners be in writing in public then ill tell him where the yards are and he can hold them up for stars end that way nobody loses but me youre out of your head tommy you wont pull it off hes got too much time to find you and hell roast you alive when he catches you no hell be damned nice to me hes got to get me to talk he doesnt have any psych probe gear with him and hell probably hold off getting physical for a while mcclennon had made his decision in an instant every second since he had been trying to justify it and find ways to make it work he guessed that he would have to stay missing for a week he had decided he would not move during that time except to do a few things that had to be done right away no movement no tracks for the hunters to pick up i got to piss tommy bad mouse examined his surroundings christ this is the hole where the sangaree used to hide the refined stardust and it wasnt in our reports what are you going to do mouse try to jump me first chance you get or will you wait it out mouse just looked at him he had donned his poker face mcclennon wore a half smile when he cut the cords binding mouses ankles take your leak in the corner with no hands theyre tied in front or hadnt you noticed a tiny smile flickered across mouses lips youve been hanging around me too long youre getting too cool go do your business this place is going to get ripe i dont doubt it it was an earthenfloored cellar already rank and humid mouse stumbled as he walked damned legs are numb he unzipped leaned against the wall panted as he urinated a stunner blast could leave a man debilitated for days mouse finished he turned thats a load off my mind mcclennon let storm take three steps before stunning him across the thighs ah shit tommy whyd you have to go and do that had to youre getting hard old friend its the company i keep mcclennon looked at the sangaree woman she was aware now and watching with cold gunmetal eyes he untied her ankles your turn she rose and took care of it without a word she did not complain or seem surprised when he stunned her too mouse demanded what the hell is she doing here anyway lets say im keeping a card up my sleeve she and mouse did not know that homeworld had been hit she could be told and released her response might make a spectacular diversion amy took forever recovering and it was with her he had tried to be most gentle he was sorry as soon as she did come round her he had not tied he had thought it unnecessary he was playing chess with mouse using paper pieces on a board scratched into the earth he did mouses moving for him he was losing as usual behind you mouse whispered clothing rustled he hurled himself aside rolled grabbed his stunner fired amy moaned fell she dropped the length of pipe she had been about to swing it scattered the chessmen mcclennon could barely tie her so badly were his hands shaking she remained conscious but refused to talk neither mouse nor the sangaree woman made any comment marya did smile a thin hard smile the walls seemed to push in for an instant he was not sure where he was or what he was doing then for a moment he relived part of his first visit to the broken whigs his name was gundaker niven and he and the sangaree woman were bedmates again tommy mouse said tommy snap out of it that did it for a few seconds long enough for him to see all three captives trying to gain their feet and mouse dead last in the race cold calm washed over him he shot all three in the head it was dangerous for them but a lot less dangerous for him if he was going into one of his episodes he went and became quietly crazy for a while he was a starfisher named moyshe benrabi a navy gunner named cornelius perchevski a naval attaché named walter clark a sociologist named gundaker niven hamon clausson credence pardee thomas aquinas mcclennon a boy wandering the cluttered light canyons of a city on old earth and getting a stiff neck looking up longingly at the stars exhaustion overcame him he fell asleep he wakened before his captives his grasp on identity and reality had recovered but all those other men were still there inside clamoring to be released he wondered if he would be able to hang on he needed psych attention bad his stomach churned and growled he was hungry food was the weak link in his plan he had not yet obtained any he would have to risk capture to do so he checked the time sixteen hours had elapsed since he had spirited the three out of the park the admiral would not have panicked yet he reasoned it would be awhile before the streets became too dangerous to risk he stepped down the stunners output and gave his prisoners a few more hours worth of unconsciousness then he took mouses comm and went into the streets he made his first stop at a used clothing store a marginal charitable operation a few blocks from his hiding place he purchased worn unstylish workmans garb he changed in an alleyway he repeated the process in a more stylish shop and farther away still deposited his seiner jumpsuit in a collection box belonging to the charitable organization he worked hard to keep the surly gundaker niven personality in the forefront of his mind when he was most successful he hunched slightly spoke crudely and looked too tough to mess with he purchased a collection of small tools then a large womans wig which he trimmed to a style favored by angel city thugs he placed a small bandage on one cheek and a pebble in his shoe he no longer looked or moved anything like any of the people the marines were hunting mobile patrols were everywhere astounding the citizenry with their busyness but he was not stopped or questioned they were seeking a starfisher they would get organized soon he knew it would be difficult to evade them then whenever he was safely out of sight he used mouses hand comm to eavesdrop on their radio traffic they were confused they had four people to find but did not know which was doing what to whom their interest of the moment was to make sure no one sneaked out of the city after the boltholes were sealed they would launch their systematic search he wondered if he ought not to let beckhart stew the confusion would give him an edge but no the admiral would need time to approach his superiors he stole an out of order sign off a public comm booth and carried it several blocks to a functional booth he hung it and began making like a repairman the gimmicking took longer than he expected the comm was of local manufacture he had to figure out the colorcoding of the circuitry then it became a classroom exercise he installed mouses comm and closed the housing in minutes he noted the terminal number and departed finding groceries required imagination home cooking simply was not done rich and poor angel citys people ate out or had prepared meals delivered most food was artificial and recycled anyway only a few terran tropical plants were adaptable to the broken wings atmosphere and climate no local was gourmet enough to have invested in the genetic engineering needed to adapt a wider range of food plants he ended up buying field rations from a swamp dredgers supply house the saleswoman said he didnt look the type but asked no questions the underworld used the swamp for its own purposes curiosity could be harmful to a questioners health he had no local money left when he returned to the cellar he had seiner cash and conmarks both of which were negotiable but did not want to draw attention by spending outside currency conmarks were never rare but still he searched his prisoners and confiscated their limited wealth most of that was confederations interworld currency they submitted sullenly no one was talking he did not try starting a conversation he gave them another taste of the stunner and returned to the streets he found a public comm and called the booth he had jiggered the handcomm there broadcast what he had to say the admiral was not pleased with him finished he patrolled around and rented two small apartments and an office so he would have somewhere to run if the marines closed in on his cellar and finally he braved central park by night to steal an allbands tactical transceiver scanner from the inattentive mps he used an old crate for a seat and the cellar wall for a backrest he closed his eyes and listened as the tactrans scanned the bands he heard a movement after a while he opened one eye mouse was trying to sit up tommy you cant keep doing that youre going to hurt somebody mcclennon turned the scanner down sorry mouse but i dont have a lot of choice he leaned toward the transceiver it was staying busy his call had stirred beckhart up good how long would he have to stay lost days passed he lost track one moment it seemed only a few had gone by the next it seemed a lot every hour was an eon trudging wearily off into eternity he thought he was doing well he had kept three willful angry prisoners hidden and controlled for days beckhart had not caught a trace of him he had driven his mental problem into a straight jacket that jacket was not strong enough he was somewhere in luna command a beautiful blonde not more than seventeen clung to his left arm she whispered something into his ear she called him commander perchevski he was supposed to know her he did not he wanted to attack her another woman took hold of his right arm she insisted his name was walter clark she wanted to take him away from the blonde morsel the females released him and assaulted one another they fought over his name he kept trying to tell them they were both wrong that he was really credence pardee or was it hamon clausson wasnt he hamon clausson that time on shakedowns he forgot the women while he tried to locate his id badge it had fallen off his tunic there it was beneath the edge of the carpet he yanked it out a kid with a somber serious face stared off the card the kid said gundaker niven and grinned viciously he screamed there were men all around him some were a little shorter or a little taller a little heavier or lighter but each one had stolen his face they pummeled one another mercilessly whenever one broke free and charged him the others piled on from behind he jumped closed his hands around the nearest throat ill kill them he gurgled ill kill them all then theyll leave me alone he fought till he had no strength left weary he fell to the floor darkness descended he wakened in a dank cellar on the broken wings three people watched with the cold hungry eyes of vultures perched over a dying thing he glanced at his watch he had been out ten hours what they had not jumped him they were still here he staggered to his feet took a step fell as vertigo hit him he shook his head hard the cobwebs broke up they drifted away he looked around again mouse quietly proffered the stunner their eyes met mcclennon took the weapon mouse did not say a word he crossed his wrists and offered to be tied again thomas said nothing either nothing needed saying he retied his friend and sat down to wait the hours groaned on he had not expected it to take so long how long could the old man hold out why was he being so stubborn giving in would not cost him much confederation did not control the starfish herds anyway he supposed beckhart was trying to save a political coup that would help overshadow the homeworld abomination mcclennon had to move only once to remain ahead of the search then the admiral ran out of stall time von drachau returned from homeworld mcclennon caught the news on his scanner he guessed that it would not be long till the news reached stars end that confrontation would dissolve gruber would rush to defend three sky that old traitor time had turned its coat again he was not surprised when his hand comm crackled and beckhart came on thomas are you listening this is admiral beckhart thomas are you listening im here talk that was all he said for fear they would triangulate his position thomas youve got what you want personally guaranteed by the chief of staff navy he paused for mcclermons reply thomas did not speak thomas are you there im listening i said youve got what you want whatre you going to do about it he had not thought beyond forcing their acquiescence how could he get it nailed down on paper publicly without them dragging him into some back room and running him through a psychological grist mill ill call back he glanced at his prisoners he had learned that he could not serve two masters and remain loved by the bondsmen of either amys hatred tortured him mercilessly and mouses anger but mouse was helping if only by not doing anything when he had the chance he had allowed friendship to obscure duty had let it make him give the benefit of the doubt mcclennon would not have made it otherwise but amy she refused to see what he was trying to do she called him judas maryas sullen displeasure he could bear he had had plenty of practice her sultry sangaree face became a mild passive resigned reflection of everything he saw in his wife with mouse he had no longrun worry mouse would get over his anger he would forgive the treason they were friends so he thought time to face the old man his wolves will be at the door the second i tell him where admiral mcclennon here thomas i dont have much time youre getting what you want can we speed things up i want someone from the judge advocates there what youre not being arrested youre not even being charged i went to bat for you son just give me the word where the hell are you i want him to witness not to represent me christ thomas youve got my word thats all i can give you it would take a week to get one of those space lawyers here now pretty please will you get organized okay okay maybe beckhart was right he was wasting time and the man was giving his word he told beckhart where to pick him up twenty ad the main sequence four angel city police officers came to the door to escort mcclennon to his commanding officer he was puzzled but did not ask why they were doing corps work he untied mouse marya and amy and said lets go gentlemen he had butterflies the size of owls they were mating on the wing the streets were barren angel city had become half a ghost town where is everybody he asked he had heard nothing on monitor that would explain this emptiness drafted one of the cops grumbled what almost everybody old enough was in the reserves it was a good way to pick up a few extra marks they got called up this war thing must be getting grim must be the policeman admitted they called up everybody in the transverse navy marines planetary defense whatever not only that they took all the equipment that wasnt nailed down the officers were walking their charges to beckharts headquarters mcclennon saw very few vehicles what about the gang upstairs he asked jerking a thumb skyward the heavies still there lets hope they hold those sangaree you and your buddy here and your admiral and his crew are the only military people left here guess we do have to take it serious mouse said the old man plays games but theyre not this expensive mcclennon could not help being startled and disturbed this general mobilization was a distressing indicator it suggested that confederation meant to hurl everything but the proverbial sink into the first passage of arms his thoughts strayed to his homeworld had old earth been stripped of men and equipment too if so he had to be glad he was in the outworlds that madhouse planet would descend into an age of barbarism if the policing divisions vanished confederation did not interfere much but did keep the violence level depressed a blowup had occurred during the ulantonid war and to a lesser degree several other times when the confederate presence was weak after settling with ulant luna command had had to reconquer earth when the mailed fist vanished the cults and movements beat swords from plowshares eager to settle old scores mouse he said its a strange world i call home storm read him at a glance it wont be as bad this time tommy ive seen some of the standing mobe plans theyll do some creative drafting something like the ancient press gangs theyll grab anybody loose and ship them out all over confederation theyll scatter them so they dont cause much trouble sounds good break the whole mess up if they take enough of them it would tap a big manpower pool old earth didnt contribute a thing during the war with ulant amy marya and the policemen all watched curiously even mouse did not understand old earth earth was the land of the timid tailor the world cramped with a people from whom all adventure had been bred the pioneer genes had departed long ago the stayathomes were in the opinion of the rest of humanity the culls of the species even mcclennon willingly admitted that his fellow old earthers were determined to live up to their derelict image the average old earther would faint at the suggestion of going into space and yet he could be astonishingly vicious with his fellows savage decadence that was the way mcclennon saw his native culture lo thy dread empire chaos is restored light dies before thy uncreating word he muttered what mouse asked from a poem by pope mouse grinned welcome home tommy youre acting like my old friend again mcclennon grunted grabbed his stomach his ulcer ripped at him with dragons claws like something trying to tear its way out he nearly doubled over with the pain tommy ulcer weve got to get you to a doctor a little while yet a little while i can hold out whatre you going to be like afterward ive got to see it through only after he had fulfilled his selfappointed mission would he dare concern himself with tuckpointing the mortar of body and soul the weeks of waiting had brought the ulcer back to life the anticipation had been terrible he had defied beckhart before but never in anything this important he was terrified what would the man do the admiral was fair but would not let fairness interfere with his carrying out his own orders mcclennon tried to banish worrying by studying his surroundings the few angelinos in the street seemed subdued their auction excitement had been replaced by trepidation mcclennon noted one odd common piece of behavior every angelino occasionally paused to glance upward he mentioned it to mouse maybe theyre worried about the raidfleet he too glanced upward at times but not in search of an alien doom he told himself he was taking last fond looks at a sun the cothen zeven the prison for military officers lay almost a thousand kilometers below the surface of old earths moon psychologically it was as far removed from mainstream life as any medieval dungeon the selfdelusion did not take he was looking for something he had lost something now so far beyond the sky he would never see it again paynes fleet had taken hyper during the week his starfisher surrogate homeland was gone forever in here said the officer in charge of the police group he led them through the entrance of a secondrate hotel beckhart was tricked out full dress he stood at a stiff parade rest as they entered his face was corpselike only an almost undetectable tightness of the eyes betrayed the anger pent within him lock the women up he said tonelessly staring through mcclennon amy broke down she exploded mixing pleading weeping and outrage marya considered her with obvious disdain thomas wanted to hold her to comfort her he did not trying would only make things worse a bit of the true beckhart slipped through the glacial shell he took amys hands be calm mrs mcclennon youll be headed home in a few days unless youd rather stay with thomas stay she laughed hysterically she got hold of herself sniffled ill go home embarrassed by her outburst she stared at the raggedly carpeted floor past her to marya beckhart added i think well release you too madam he smiled it was that killer smile thomas had come to know with mouse he saw it only when maryas people had been done some special injury how we can be cruel he thought were always willing to play petty torturers with our dull little knives mouse understood that smile too von drachau had scored he seemed to glow he assumed the mantle of torquemada he laughed the sound of it was a little mad he really did it he broke through storm spun toward marya let her live by all means let her live he put on a big cruel grin life for her would be crueler than death she could look forward to nothing but flight and fear and utter lack of hope till a relentless pitiless enemy finally ran her to ground mouse told her jupp von drachau our old friend from our younger days here visited your homeworld dear marya understood mouse had taunted her with his chance discovery during their captivity he had mentioned the nova bomb she did not break she did not give him an instant of pleasure she simply smiled that hard gunmetal smile and promised with her eyes nothing ever could more than lightly scar her outer defenses not after she had had to watch mouse inject her children with the deadly drug that formed one of the foundation stones of sangaree wealth the police removed the women there was a long silence mouse and mcclennon faced their commander thomas felt mouse drawing away closing up becoming a bureau man once again sit down gentlemen beckhart said youll have to bear with me im a little edgy the broken wings has been rough on me mouse you go first i want a detailed report mcclennons eyebrows rose beckhart was not going to press what was he up to mouse talked mcclennon retreated into introspection he wrestled all the doubts he had held at bay since making his decision the unanswerable want began insinuating sinister tentacles into his soul he became increasingly confused thomas it was the third or fourth time his name had been called what your report on the last two weeks i have to develop a position youd better think about what youll say in your written statement too i tried to cover but i couldnt not all the way youll have to stand a board of inquiry he began with pagliaccis lingered over the encounters with the alycefaces he tried to make beckhart understand that that deception had instigated his determination to scuttle navys plans for the seiners that was a mistake beckhart admitted ive made several classics during this operation the intent wasnt malign thomas i meant it as a hypnotic trigger way back when before you were supposed to return to carsons mouse showed you a chinese coin that was supposed to be your cue you didnt respond that failsafer he was ours yes another of my grand mistakes beckhart did not apologize for the murder attempt they were professionals they were supposed to understand they were living chessmen playing a giant board luckily mouse outguessed me on that one mcclennon wandered through his tale trying and failing to elucidate his behavior intellectually i know what youre saying beckhart interjected emotionally i cant connect thomas im one of those fools who actually believe in their work it may be because thats all i have or maybe i never outgrew my idealism about confederation but thats neither here nor there you havent given me those coordinates i havent seen any guarantees thomas ill promise you anything high command has cleared it theyve published it well make it stick even if it costs us a senatorial review we can get around those but thats something to worry about next month right now we need to get a hammerlock on stars end and then what you just lost me son what happens to me does it really matter he wondered who cares technically youre under arrest till you receive a board ruling you put yourself in a spot you could end up the hero or the goat of this mess which one probably depends on how the first battle goes id just as soon forget the whole thing myself but its too late they know about you back at luna command look on the bright side tommy mouse said they cant legally make you work while youre under arrest youll get a vacation in spite of the bureau beckhart flashed storm a daggers look can the spacelawyer crap son the arrest will be strictly a paper technicality thomas in practice youll be part of my staff till we sort out the seiners and stars end mouse youll drag around with thomas and me as of now youre his keeper mcclennon caught a faint taste of life as he had known it before joining the starfishers he looked forward to the change it might keep him too preoccupied to whine about his losses poor amy first order of business those coordinates then we get thomas to a psych team a policeman came in marathons stabilized orbit admiral her shuttle will be down shortly thank you marathon mouse asked i thought she was in mothballs she was when you left nothing is anymore theyre crewing the older ships with reserves theyre replacing regular fleet patrols the initial battle will involve every first line ship we have they sent one old cruiser to replace three heavy squadrons mcclennon asked not exactly marathon is mine intelligence admirals dont rate thomas are you going to spill beckhart turned to the policeman who had remained near the door officer start moving our gear sergeant bortle was supposed to scrounge up transport mcclennons immediate concern was that he had not had a bath sixteen days of grime and he had to board a navy ship whats the program mouse asked first we bluff the fishers then we move to stars end and ride herd on the scientists marathon brought out theyll supervise the seiner teams when im satisfied with progress we space for luna command after debriefing you loaf till thomas board is over i imagine thomas will get hung with a desk he might even move back to the line how hard will they be on him the board will clear him on psychological grounds theres precedent but theyll want him off operations which makes sense i guess he could be burned out he might still do commercial or diplomatic work that wouldnt waste his training you i dont know about yet mouse mcclennon looked inside himself and could find no remorse over his potential loss of job he did not like his profession much i might retire mouse mused captain draws a good pension though he smiled the coals of lost dreams lay banked behind his eyes he had fulfilled his goals too early in life not till after the war you wont beckhart said nobody retires till then thomas are you going to give me what i need do i have to rub your nose in our intelligence tapes first all right its three sky nebula inside the wedge and pointing toward galactic center beginning about one au inside give me a pen he wrote a series of numbers on a memo sheet therere your jumpin coordinates from there you go ahead in normspace i cant give you the route through the junk people who know it arent allowed to leave three sky really i thought it would be way outside our usual sphere beckharts stiffness began to fade he became the admiral of old smiles and friendship and willingness to spend a mans life the purloined letter thing thats why ships disappear there after a pause i have things to do before we leave meet me in the lobby in half an hour ready for space ready for space mcclennon asked that was a subtle hint son get cleaned up ill have a man bring you a uniform and try to make peace with your woman thank you sir he set a record for bathing shaving and shifting to the clean uniform he had ten minutes left when he finished one minute later he entered the room beckhart was using as a brig it was just a hotel room without windows with two guards posted outside its only door amy and marya sat against opposite walls ignoring one another amy she refused to acknowledge his presence he grabbed her chin forced her to face him look at me dammit for two weeks he had been trying to make her understand she had refused he wanted to beat it into her stubborn head it took an effort to speak calmly were leaving in a few minutes if you want you can come with us she glared well end up at stars end i thought you might want to join your research team there instead of being sent straight home still she glared if you go back with the internees youll end up at the yards with your mother i thought maybe youd want to go where you had a friend she would not say anything all right be stubborn he turned to the door officer im ready moyshe wait i yes ill go he sighed finally the first yielding ill clear it with the admiral a wan smile teased his lips as he left the room it would be a long journey maybe long enough for him to win his case beckhart did not like his idea at first sir mcclennon explained shes best friends with one of the senior fisher scientists if we can tame her she can help sell cooperation you keep talking about ulantonid intelligence tapes use them to persuade her we dont really have to turn her just to open her mind thomas i can see right through you you dont give a shit about all right its another tradeoff bring her but youre responsible for her tell the guards to turn her over to me go get her will you youre wasting time an hour later they were aboard the shuttle to marathon mouse was shaking beckhart was lost in dispatches that had come out aboard the cruiser amy had her eyes closed she was pale and grim mcclennon stared at her and mentally roamed fields of mighthavebeens and shouldhavedones he had gotten her to admit an intellectual understanding of his actions and her inability to differentiate between personal and social allegiances she could not see his betrayal of her people as impersonal she wanted his feelings for her to have been an agents playacting somehow that would absolve her of complicity she was a selftorturer could he criticize her or anyone else he lived his life in a selfinflicted iron maiden he and amy had been doomed from the beginning his programs instability had made him a natural victim for her inadequacies they had been too much alike and she too much like the alyce creature programmed as one of his triggers maybe his ideal woman was a marya a cold gunmetal woman armored at the pain points a woman with whom it was unnecessary to exchange emotional hostages had he changed during this mission people did but usually too slowly to notice he did not trust the changes he saw too many might be artificial the psychs would sort him out a small team had come out aboard marathon maybe when they finished he would know who he really was he was not sure he wanted to know book three stars end twentyone ad the main sequence the lights came on mcclennon mouse and amy sat in silence the tapes had been grotesque storm finally squeaked admiral thats really what were up against mcclennon peered at amy she met his gaze for an instant moyshe she whispered i think im going to be sick it is beckhart promised mouse its tough to swallow even when youre there yourself all that ruthlessness for no discernible purpose only makes it more frightening mcclennon took amys hand it was cool she was shaking you need something ill be all right just give me a minute mcclennon turned admiral ive seen that kind of ship before what where how beckhart came toward mcclennon like a tiger stalking game he seemed to have caught a sudden fever a haze appeared on his upper lip where he breathed the seiners have one at their xenoarchaeological research facility you remember amy i asked if it had been built by an intelligent slug the one nobody wanted to work thats right youre right moyshe it was exactly like the ships in the tape tell me about it beckhart said there isnt much to tell mcclennon replied the seiners found it in the nebula they considered it comparatively modern they found it surrounded by ships left behind by the people they think built stars end the same people who i think built the base darkside they assumed the ship had been attacked by accident during the ulantonid war i said its crew might have been studying the ships belonging to the stars end race thats all beckhart became thoughtful that isnt all thomas theres always more you just dont know it is there a connection think about it stars end might be more than just a handy arsenal beckhart was talking to himself not his audience mcclennon smiled the admiral was making the sort of random connections that when they paid off caused him to be so effective thomas i want you and amy to talk to doctor chancellors people they came off the lunar digs there might be an angle they should get together with amys friend consuela elsanga shes more knowledgeable than we are fine fine well arrange that meantime get your brains boiling open them up to unexpected possibilities tell you what well have another little gettogether after dinner with them included marathon brought me some new material ill lay it out then mcclennon caught a bleak note bad eh worse than youve seen beckhart used the evening session to present the report from the ulantonid deep probe afterward he asked any speculations people the science people were guarded they wanted more data mcclennon asked did luna command run that through the big brain yes and it asked for more data too i think it has a human bias built in it wouldnt accept the numbers it suggested that commander russell be replaced by somebody less inclined to exaggerate looks to me like theres enough data to draw some first approximation inferences like the globular and war fleets represent an effort to destroy any present and potential sentience it looks like an effort to eliminate competition and remodel the galaxy for the comfort of one race a scientist protested you cant draw those inferences theyre anthropocentric it could just as well be a religious crusade what mouse snarled dont be ridiculous easy mouse beckhart said no idea is too bizarre right now the truth is going to be something off the wall brainstorm people come up with as many ideas as possible then winnow them as we accumulate more data we shouldnt use the facts to build something acceptable the truth may not be the scientists were becoming restive beckhart continued one unpalatable fact that jumps right out is that theyre going to try to destroy us add to that their incredible numbers add to that the fact that the globular is forty thousand years away people i think weve found us a war that will last forever mcclennon could not handle the numbers forty thousand years eight times as long as recorded history that was one longterm operation the other side had been involved for the gods only knew how long already millions of years the oddities of the alien base on the moons dark side the abandoned ships in three sky and stars end itself seemed a little less strange when seen in that light presuming the mysterious builders had been enemies of the centerward race their works might constitute a counteroperation of equally cosmic scale he tried to tote up a picture based on known factors it did not scan there were too many questions what was the role of the sangaree what had become of the builders mouse leaned his way this is a little much for me tommy im just a simpleminded soldier mcclennon grinned ill go along with the simpleminded he had spent the afternoon with a psych team they had performed wonders he felt content and optimistic mouse was out of sorts he had come off the broken wings moody and uncommunicative the definitive proof was that the science team boasted several attractive women none had yet been honored by the swoop of the eagle amy had mentioned it in one of her friendlier moments mcclennon had not noticed it himself you going to be in the mood for a game after this mcclennon asked mouse had not shown much interest in chess lately either i dont think so whats going on a petty officer was whispering to the admiral beckhart announced the sangaree just left stars end they left the mcgraws to the starfishers he smiled looks like the incidence of piracy may fall off what will they do mcclennon asked we dont know lets hope they give it a good think i left strehltsweiter with a message for her bosses maybe homeworld will make them listen what kind of message mouse demanded i told them to change their ways i said im not interested in wiping them out but i will if they dont shape up i told them i could repeat the lesson at osiris if they insist i let her think we know where osiris is too do you thomas asked no i lie a lot for the next week mcclennon split his time between the psych and scientific teams the psych sessions bled the pressure off his chaotic mind gradually one personality mcclennon took hold he suffered only one minor episode marathon dropped hyper off three sky signals from von drachaus lepanto indicated that she and her escort had penetrated the yards there had been a few skirmishes but nothing serious the starfishers were talking but stalling the admiral observed gruber is trying to fox us hes sitting tight at stars end know what hes doing betting to an inside straight hes thinking if he can pull some of those weapons out quick enough he can turn the tables on us beckhart thereupon demonstrated his proconsular power he contacted the seiner leadership told them the time he designated it as launch minus twentyfive hours he ordered the channel kept open and the countdown broadcast at fiveminute intervals incoming traffic was to be recorded and otherwise ignored requests for delays and further negotiations consequently fell on deaf ears at launch minus two hours twelve minutes the seiners of three sky surrendered unconditionally fleet marines began occupying key installations immediately beckhart summoned mcclennon thomas weve finished twisting their arms here find your lady and ask her if shes going or staying we space for stars end in one hour yes sir sir i just came through communications the sangaree raidfleet is still headed for homeworld good well be able to release a few squadrons then his eyes went glassy the big strike is getting closer the blues have picked their spot were waiting till the other side walks into it find your lady amy was easily found she would not leave her cabin unless dragged he knocked its mcclennon he said the admiral sent me she seldom talked to him unless under pretext of business what does he want were spacing for stars end you want to stay here or go along they gave up they didnt have much choice she sighed moyshe i try hard to understand whats happening but i cant do you think hell keep his word i dont know i really dont well find out the hard way hell leave people here to establish the new order i wish i could find out what their instructions are what are you going to do you have to decide quick were ready to leave im going to stars end consuela is out there they made her head of the whole team well good for her he did not depart immediately she refused the opportunity he offered it keeps right on hurting he thought as he stalked along the passageway she wont even try to understand after relaying amys decision he went looking for his partner he found mouse in the wardroom staring mindlessly into a holovision cube he sat whats the matter old buddy want to talk reluctantly mouse killed the holoshow not yet tommy im not ready all right you noticed that little blonde lieutenant from weapons tanni something from b missiles primo stuff looks like shed turn a man every way but loose theres something about the little ones they say shes a scorpio mouse laughed you didnt fix me up did you mouse had been known to opine that scorpio women were the hottest in the known universe mcclennon could not get him to elucidate the workings of a geocentric astrology transferred to outworlds skies not exactly i asked a few questions i figured the answers might pique your interest im interested that little bomb is ready to go off you can tell just by the way she moves blow in her ear and youre liable to start something five guys couldnt handle but im also not interested if you know what i mean no i dont youve been celibate for a month i thought id see entropy shift into reverse first i got things to work out tommy can we drop it if you want were heading for stars end as if to back him up the ships hyper alarm sounded i heard they finally gave in now all weve got to do is impress gruber the old man will find a way he always does doesnt he tommy what do you think our chances are what our chances of coming through this thing with these centerward creatures well never know mouse its going to go on for a long time our greatgrandchildrens greatgrandchildren are going to be fighting this war and its a sad thing sad how so it may destroy us as a race i dont mean destroy like wipe us out i mean put an end to what makes us what we are ive been thinking about it a lot you know how i get you think too much mouse smiled the human race is crazy see no two of us are alike and when we form up in mobs no two mobs are alike were always flying off in a skillion different directions everybody doing their own thing every culture too and thats a survival trait i think theres almost a darwinian thing with cultures some die out and others come to life therere always some on the way out and some on the way in the thing is therere always a lot of different ones around when one goes down theres always another there to take its place im not following you mouse said in a slightly amused tone whats that got to do with anything look this centerward race to fight it were going to have to pull together generation after generation like an anthill were going to turn into a warfare race our whole focus will be the struggle kids will be born to a system that will turn them into the best soldiers possible if theyre survivors theyll work their way up and get old in harness theyll have kids of their own who will follow in their footsteps after a few generations nobody will know theres any other way of life and then in a way well be just like the things were fighting the diversity will be gone and well be trapped in a dead end because every culture is a dead end eventually i mean what does a warfare society do after it polishes off its last enemy turn on itself mouse looked at him askance you do worry yourself about some strange things my friend i think its a valid concern i think we should start taking the long view now and try to retain all the diversity we can so write a report suggesting a study i think i will it wont matter much when they wipe us out tommy and from where i sit that looks inevitable all we can do is delay it thatll be like trying to keep the river from getting to the sea by bailing it with a teacup maybe maybe the ship shuddered it seemed to twist away around them marathon was on her way to stars end that legendary inviolable virgin goddess of a fortress world that had intrigued a half dozen races for countless centuries twentytwo ad the main sequence marathon dropped hyper ten days after departing three sky she cruised norm thirty hours before being joined by the heavy squadrons from the broken wings beckhart was afraid gruber might still need convincing therere a hundred harvestships there amy protested you know how big they are moyshe plus all the service ships what makes anybody think a few dozen navy ships could whip them the whole sangaree raidfleet couldnt i hope you dont have to find out mouse explained these ships were built for that kind of thing amy all they can do is destroy especially the empire class other ships orbital fortresses cities on the ground they were built to chew them up what you starfishers have is a bunch of ships built to do other things their guns were hung on them as an afterthought your harvestships were put together in jumbles just growing never designed for any special purpose i still think youre all overconfident both thomas and mouse shrugged mcclennon said you could be right were supposed to believe were invincible he glanced at mouse maybe thats why this centerward thing is so oppressive it shakes our faith they were in marathons wardroom most of the science team were there too the countdown to hyper drop had declined past the tenminute mark people with no duty assignment had gathered to look at what mcclennon called a thirtyfirstcentury war god an untouchable world a dead metal machine voice that shrieked against the big night threatening anyone who came near stars end the arsenal of yesterday more securely defended than the virtue of any medieval virgin you dont need to worry mcclennon said if there were any chance of trouble we wouldnt be sitting around here wed be on battle stations the weapons people arent on alert mouse said he was staring at a small blonde woman wearing weapons insignia over her lieutenants stripes watch how she moves tommy mcclennon smiled i think hes coming around the tomcat is coming through mouse reddened slightly jesus mcclennon said softly you embarrassed i dont know tommy it seems like ive changed a little i dont understand myself one minute to hyper drop a remote voice announced it drowned in the chatter of the wardroom beckhart and the chiefs of the science team stalked in and took seats near the holo globe that had been set up at the compartments center looks smug dont he mcclennon said the wardroom fell silent marathon dropped hyper in moments a featureless ball filled the holo globe surrounding details appeared as the ships sensors picked them up first came the escort vessels then the harvestfleets then vistas of lifeless wreckage left by the fighting with sangaree and mcgraws the planet though showed no changes mcclennon had seen it before he was not amazed the builder race had removed any topography stars end may have had it was a world machined smooth like a bigass cue ball mouse murmured it doesnt look so friendly when it opens up thomas said he shuddered remembering it gets what looks like a sudden case of acne someone sat down beside him at the same moment he saw a communications messenger whisper to beckhart and pass a flimsy what was it he wondered commander mcclennon he glanced to the side and found himself face to face with the little blonde weapons officer yes he gulped taken aback hi im tanni lowenthal weapons she wriggled her diminutive derriere a centimeter closer mouse chuckled thomas turned storms attention seemed inalterably fixed on the holo globe as was amys though color was climbing her throat what can i do for you thomas asked nothing i just wanted to meet you someone said you were you so i thought i would introduce myself youre famous you know she laid a hand on his it was small and hot and felt strong he nearly jerked away mouse made a small sound again its really strange isnt it the woman asked stars end i mean very especially when its in a bad mood oh thats right you were here before werent you when you were with the starfishers the conversation lasted only a few minutes the woman abruptly said thats my cue off to the salt mines bye she squeezed his hand and looked him directly in the eye for a second bye baffled he looked around to see what had happened during his distraction beckhart apparently had announced something he had missed it what was that mouse the seiners have it open already we can send our people down right away storm was fighting laughter he nodded toward tannis departing figure thats what you get for asking questions tommy the word gets back amy glared into the globe her jaw was tight her face was red smoke seemed about to pour from her ears how did that halfwitted sex machine ever earn a commission she demanded still grinning mouse said shes probably quite competent at what she does i dont doubt it a bit she looks the type mouse made a little wave signal to tell mcclennon to make himself scarce amy was ready for a scene a scene she had no right to make inasmuch as she had declared her relationship with mcclennon void mcclennon rose and moved nearer the admiral when he had a chance he asked will i be able to go down just to poke around beckhart looked thoughtful i suppose it seems safe theyve been down for a week and nothings happened but wait till the science people are all down ask amy to see me in my office later will you i think ive got a liaison job for her yes sir he wandered back to mouse and amy storm had calmed her down he was still grinning tommy i think ill take you up on that game youve been talking about you see a table the new was wearing off ships crew were drifting out over there amy the boss wants you to come to his office when you get a chance he and mouse pushed through the crowd and seized a pair of table seats mouse produced his portable chess set i wish youd wipe that smirk off your face makes you look like an idiot i cant help it tommy its really funny the way she zeroed in isnt she something no doubt about that im wondering what i couldnt decide if you were going to attack her right there or have a stroke you can find out what you know she told you who she was and where to find her now its your move science team people began descending to the planet next working day the afternoon of the same day witnessed the arrival aboard of a company of stonefaced seiner dignitaries mouse and mcclennon were assigned to make them welcome amy turned out to help mouse asked whats that youre wearing my dress uniform what dress uniform my police uniform your admiral had it flown over during the night mcclennon observed i didnt know you had one ive known you a year and a half and never saw you wear it thats where we went wrong moyshe we spent all that time hiding he expected a difficult delicate afternoon he did not argue you may be right he scanned a list on a clipboard how many of these people do you know she scanned it too only a few by reputation gruber payne theyre all fleet and ships commanders over a hundred names were on the list mouse we cant give them all honors he glanced at the sideboys waiting to pipe the visitors aboard no shit itd be tomorrow before we finished amy had seen enough of the back and forth of senior navy officers to know what they were talking about dont bother she suggested we dont do that kind of thing they wouldnt know what it was just be polite mouse went to talk it over with the chief petty officer in charge of the sideboys mcclennon stood with amy studying his list in order to avoid eye contact you look good in that uniform she said softly all those medals beckhart likes to hand them out youll get another for this business probably moyshe something i should tell you when i said we were hiding from each other i was hiding from you and fooling myself the reason i was so eager to throw a net on you he glanced at her she was showing a lot of color yes its embarrassing i dont like myself very much when i think about it well i dont like the things ive done either i was the ships commanders special agent i was supposed to keep an eye on you and report to him because he wanted to make you into the head of a starfisher secret service that meant you were going to be important i wasnt important i wasnt ever going to be the only way i could have gone any higher was if jarl died or left danion mcclennon saw what she was trying to say its all right i understand and now i know why you did so many things i thought were strange moyshe forget it weve got pain enough dont drag up any old stuff a red light came on over the lock housing the shipwide address system announced the arrival of the visitors shuttle it admonished all hands to remain courteous and helpful in every circumstance the lock cycled a great burly bear of a man stepped inside he looked around as if expecting to be assaulted by the legions of the damned gruber amy whispered get him mouse thomas said me you got more balls and more suave than me mouse introduced himself as captain storm of admiral beckharts staff he introduced thomas and amy then asked the fishers to follow them the sideboys stood at superb perfectly matched attention while the seiners disembarked the marine sentries at the wardroom door were military perfectionists too they snapped to present arms admiral beckhart was waiting inside he wasted little time introducing himself or excusing himself for having assembled them virtually at gunpoint he presented the ulantonid tapes while they ran mouse and mcclennon passed out copies of the known data on the centerward threat amy distributed copies of the tapes the lights came up beckhart said gentlemen youve just seen the reason for our unfriendly behavior ill now answer any questions doctor chancellor captain mcclennon captain storm and your own lieutenant coleridge will also speak with anyone who likes mcclennon was amazed by the reserve of the seiner leaders even the worst tape scenes cause no stir they remained obstinately uncommunicative danions ship commander isolated amy they fell into heated discussion the others asked only a few questions while amys interrogator worked then conferred with payne and gruber the fishers ignored storm and mcclennon completely replying to a gruber query beckhart said well be completely open with the available data in accordance with high command directives youve received copies of almost everything the centerward race threatens all of us mcclennon told mouse ever notice the old mans split personality hes three different people depending on who hes talking to mouse smiled we all are more than three usually hes just obvious think theyre buying it paynes people are most of the others arent gruber looks like hell give us the benefit of the doubt he picked lint off his dress black tunic were victims of our reputation they cant believe were being straight gruber proved willing to listen that willingness extended the session for hours stewards came in set up tables served a meal gruber finally seemed satisfied his subchieftains began filing out following mouse to the lock amy walked with mcclennon starting at the desk she said im going back to danion now okay moyshe im sorry i am too amy about everything i never wanted to hurt you stay happy moyshe you too she was the last seiner into the lock mouse turned to mcclennon thomas nodded mouse ordered the lock cycled think it went over mcclennon asked i dont know tommy i dont tommy whats the matter chief help me here stretcher somebody get a stretcher the episode was mcclennons worst yet it took the psych team three days to bring him out it had surprised him completely twentythree ad the main sequence i dont think you should go thomas the admiral said let mouse handle it suppose you had one of your attacks ill be all right look ask lieutenant corley she says itll take a week to reach another crisis point mouse somebody has to look over their shoulders right otherwise we wont know if theyre getting anywhere thats just the way those people are theyre not going to say anything till theyre sure nobody can shoot them down scientists would rather be dragged through the streets naked than be wrong if tommy goes well have twice as many eyes all right thomas you know the woman who heads the seiner team talk to her take a recorder i want to hear what she says twelve hours later mcclennon and storm accompanied by a pair of marine sergeants entered the cold metal halls of stars end the dock ring of their landing bay was a good twenty kilometers below the featureless planetary surface the plunge down the long dark shaft had been harrowing mouse had lost his supper the marines began horsing an electric truck off the shuttle mouse walked along a steel passageway away from the dock ring he peered into what had to have been ground control in an age gone by tommy come take a look in here mcclennon had to stoop beneath the passageway ceiling he joined storm what he saw nothing but a marine sentry by that console thing oh a skeleton the reports said bones could be found throughout the fortress thousands of skeletons had been encountered were ready sir one of the marines said mcclennon snapped a picture of the bones all right mouse lets hit research central first right well probably get everything there anyway be charming consuela elsanga looks vulnerable am i ever anything else the little truck streaked through the endless halls down ramps around perilous turns ever deeper into the metal world the marine driver fled on as if being pursued by the shades of the builders he shuddered visibly each time they encountered one of the skeletons they passed through one chamber where a score of the builder folk had died the bones that have touched and shaped our lives thomas said from afar like virgin princesses you getting poetic again i do when im depressed he glanced at the marines they stared forward impassively and this place is depressing the soldiers seemed to have come out of a robot factory they had shown no reaction to the admirals tapes the drivers suicidal rush was the only evidence that either man was disturbed the truck swooped into a level with ceilings vaulting a hundred meters high brobdingnagian machines crowded it rising like the buildings of an alien city there was life here and light but it was all machine i wonder what they are accumulators for the energy weapons mouse guessed some of them some of them must be doing something with the air look mouse squealed sergeant stop back up back up a little more look up there tommy on the fourth catwalk up mcclennon spotted the androgynous little machine it was busy working on the flank of one of the towering structures a maintenance robot yeah all right sergeant go ahead they descended more levels some as highceilinged as that of the robot they saw more of the mobile machines built in a dozen different designs obviously only the builders had perished their fortress was very much alive and healthy storm and mcclennon saw no evidence of breakdown its like walking through a graveyard mouse said after their driver had had to wend his way across a vast open floor where hundreds of skeletons lay in neat rows chilling know what mouse i think this is really a pyramid its not a fortress at all youre not serious why not think about it can you think of any strategic reason for putting a world fort out here sure such as right over there are the magellanic clouds sic somebody on me willing to spend a few hundred millennia conquering the galaxy and chasing me and id build me an alltime fort across my line of retreat before i jump off for a friendlier starswarm now whos getting romantic romantic hell they could just go around it mouse that centerward mob dont go around anything theyd just stay here till they cracked it open maybe youre right but im going to stick to my theory they reached the research center a few minutes later mcclennon located consuela elsanga almost immediately and found her completely free of animosity he was surprised why she asked im no seiner im just one of their captive scientists i didnt know he introduced mouse he wondered if consuela had heard from amy moyshe that wouldnt be right would it mcclennon thomas but call me whatevers comfortable thomas this is the most exciting time of my life we can finally compare notes with your people its like opening up a whole new universe come on let me show you what were doing her walk had a youthful bounce despite the higher than seinernormal gravity mouses eyebrows rose questionably mcclennon shrugged come on before she changes her mind a horde of people were at work in a nearby chamber where hundreds of folding tables had been arrayed in long rows most were burdened with artifacts papers or the tools of the scientists and their helpers to one side technicians were busy with communicators and a vast waistlevel computer interface consuela explained the people at the tables are examining and cataloging artifacts we brought along several thousand laymen to help explore whenever they make a find they notify comm center we send an expert to examine the site the confab over there is an ongoing exchange with your lunar dig people the people at the console are trying to reprogram stars ends master brain so it can deal directly with human input you found a key to the builder language thomas asked no that will come after we can talk to the computer you just lost me that sounds backwards it works like this the starfish commune with the machine they relay to our mindtechs the mindtechs relay to our computer people they build parallel test programs communications send them down our computer people here try to feed it back to the master brain the starfish read the response and feed it to the mindtechs again and round the circle the idea is to help the computers develop a common language so far weve only managed a pidgin level of communication we think were on the brink of breakthrough though math ought to be a snap mouse said its got to be the same all over the universe but i can see how youd have trouble working toward more abstract concepts unfortunately were using a nonmathematical interface consuela replied the starfish arent mathematically minded their conscious concept of number is onetwothreemany thought you said they were smart tommy consuela said they are but theirs is an intuitive rather than empirical intelligence but were making headway when our computers can link be careful mcclennon admonished be very very careful why this is the boss machine right so the fish say okay that makes it big and powerful it might be playing games with you its insane come on mouse protested how can a machine go crazy i dont know i do know i was in contact during the first battle i got a little direct touch it was plain out of its microelectronic mind id be afraid it could use its capacity to seize control of my own command computers hes right captain thomas we know its a real problem most of the starfish are riding herd on its psyche only a few are helping communicate it seems to have several psychological problems loneliness a god complex a deeply programed xenophobia and bellicosity it is after all the directing intelligence of a weapons system a defensive weapon mcclennon suggested mouse laughed at this but think about it is stars end a pyramid i dont understand im going to wander around mouse said dont run off without me tommy i wont by pyramid i mean it serves the same function as old earths egyptian pyramids a tomb i dont think so the idea isnt new but its been mostly a metaphor assume the builders knew you dont have all the data he explained about the centerward race and his suspicion that the builder race had been fleeing it okay they come to the end of the road theres nowhere to run unless they jump off for the magellanic clouds i think they gave up i think they stopped built themselves a pyramid put their treasures inside and died out miss elsangra smiled a romantic theory that fits the known facts and a few youve conjured up i think ingenious thomas i suppose well be able to answer you when we complete contact with the master control a boyhood incident came to mind he had discovered independently so far as he could discern later that a squared plus b squared equaled c squared he had been excited till he had explained it to a friend the friend had laughed and told him that pythagoras had crossed the finish line thirtyfive hundred years ahead of him he felt the same deflation now i hear you and amy broke up yes i didnt realize you knew she called yesterday she was very depressed about it she took something personal that wasnt that was the feeling i got her story was onesided but i got the impression you were trying to do what was right for everybody i tried i dont know how successful i was you two shouldnt have gotten involved in the first place landsmen and seiners dont speak the same language ive been with them thirtysix years and i still have problems we were both looking for something we were too eager to grab it ive been through that too help her will you i never meant to hurt her i will and dont feel so guilty shes more resilient than she pretends she likes the attention i thought you were friends she was a lot more than a friend for a while captain till she met heinrich cortez oh hey tommy mouse bore down on them like a minijuggernaut come here he aboutturned and steamed a reverse course excuse me consuela he chased mouse down what mouse stopped i just talked to a gal whos doing the same thing for the fishers that were doing for beckhart she was pissed these clowns some of them have been here for ten days the fishers have eight thousand people down already and they havent even started looking at weapons systems they dont even care all they want to do is collect broken toothbrushes and sort old bones theyll get to it mouse youve got to give them a chance to let the new wear off and theyve got to get a dialogue going with the master control if they manage that itll save time in the long run the machine can redesign the weapons for us that would save ripping the old ones out of here orbiting them then building ships around them mouse calmed himself okay maybe youre right but i still dont like to see everybody doing something else when weapons are the reason were all here what if the weapons technology requires other preexisting technologies what do you mean go back a hundred years build me a pulsegraser with the technology available then you couldnt do it youd have to create the technology to create the technology to construct the pulse accumulators right sometimes i dont like you a whole lot tommy mouse grinned ill tell the seiner lady to be patient if the captains will excuse me the senior of their marine custodians approached them yes sergeant thomas asked the admirals compliments sirs and he needs you back aboard ship immediately what is it he didnt say sir he said to tell you its critical mouse looked puzzled mcclennon was very much so the news hit the busy chamber before they departed the starfish had had a brief skirmish with sharks hordes of the predators had appeared a continuous stream were still arriving holy shit thomas said id forgotten about them they didnt forget us mouse grumbled damnation people swirled this way and that the mood approached panic doctor chancellor rushed over i heard youre going up take this to the admiral just in case he shoved a folder into mcclennons hands thank you he dashed toward the team working at the computer they were trying to prepare an instantaneous shutdown of the roundrobin should the sharks attack they should tell the idiot box to scrub the problem for them mouse said as they pulled away what did he give you his notes they look like a cross between a journal and regular scientific notation give me some of those their driver flew around worse than he had coming the other direction heres an interesting one mouse said no furniture what the exploration teams havent found any furniture there goes your pyramid theory hes right i didnt see anything but machinery the bodies are all laid out on the floor maybe theyre invaders too mcclennon shrugged heres one that will grab you how big do you think stars end is uhm venus size close earth minus two percent but the planetary part is smaller than mars the rest is edifice what his word ill give you the question since most of the structural volume would be hollow how come the place has so much gravity its a couple points over earth normal mouse sneered come on tommy maybe its the machines nope youre going to love it according to this the builders before they started building took a little planet and polished it smooth then they plated it with a layer of neutronium the fortress structure floats around on the neutronium which may be a cushion against tectonic activity whoa mouse clung to the truck as its driver made a violent turn how did they stabilize the neutronium figure that out and how they mined it in the first place and you and me will get rich whats the kicker he doesnt have one here i think its implied i didnt see anything at the lunar digs or three sky that would suggest that level of technology so the little people are interlopers just like us maybe mcclennon had an image of bronze age barbarians camped in the street of a space age city keep talking i dont want to think about the fly up a navy lieutenant awaited them at marathons ingress lock if youll follow me sirs the admiral awaited them on the bridge ah thomas i was beginning to wonder is it critical sir we havent slept for ages its critical but the seiners say it doesnt look like itll break right away rest up good before you go over over im sending you to danion i want you to go into link and give assyrian and prussian a fire control realtime you have got to be kidding why my calculations show them capable of cleaning up that little mess out there its a chance to show gruber what can happen if he gets tricky point sir youre overoptimistic sharks are super deadly they throw antihydrogen when they get mad second point why me a seiner mindtech could do the job and probably better theyre better trained i want you i dont want some seiner wholl adjust the data to make us look bad i have to go its an order then make it another ship im liable to get lynched aboard danion danion is grubers choice thats the ship we know he has secrets too thanks a lot sir mouse stagewhispered the ships legal officer would back you if you want to refuse you dont have to work when youre under arrest i got troubles enough without getting the old man mad at me madder at me beckhart glared at mouse youre going with him son head bodyguard take your two marines tommy if it will make you more comfortable stay with the psych people till time to go i will danion had not changed except there were no friendly faces aboard now amy met them at the ingress lock a squad of grimfaced security people accompanied her she installed the party aboard a convoy of small vehicles people spat and cursed as they passed tell me something mouse said how come everybody knows were here this isnt navy amy replied curtly you keep on and i wont make love to you anymore mouse laughed when she turned to glare at him easy boy mcclennon said weve got to get out of here alive something thrown whipped over their heads did you see that mouse croaked that was candy she wanted to marry me amy have you shown people those tapes what tapes the centerward mouse nudged him i smell a little political skulduggery old friend a little crafty censorship old gruber is afraid he cant keep people cranked up if they find out whats really going on youre not to discuss that amy said mouse grinned oh the saints forfend never my dear what are you going to do about it if i do i saw consuela yesterday mcclennon said heading them off amy softened how was she twenty years younger happy as a kid loose in a candy store shes hoping youll come down you went yesterday its interesting but i dont think well get as many answers as questions the convoy entered operations sector a huge door closed behind them isolating them from the rest of the ship mouse wondered aloud why no one answered him mcclennons former tech team hans and clara awaited him their faces were not friendly but were less inimical than any he had seen outside operations clara even managed a smile welcome back moyshe you even get your old couch clara i want you to meet somebody before we start you never got the chance this is amy clara extended a hand amy i heard so much about you when moyshe was with us mcclennon removed his tunic handed it to mouse the marine sergeants considered the couch and its technical stations posted themselves to either side out of the way the contact room had fallen silent people stared obviously no one had been warned that contact expected visitors thomas settled onto the couch clara im not sure i can do this anymore you dont forget hans hans said you let your hair grow moyshe ill have to gum it up good havent had time for a haircut since we hit the broken wings he shuddered as hans began rubbing greasy matter into his scalp and again when the youth slipped the hairnet device into place a moment later the helmet devoured his head theres a fish waiting moyshe clara said just go on out and good luck tsd took him then he was in the starfish universe stars end was a vast milky globe surrounded by countless golden footballs and needles the three empire class warships became creeping vortices of color they were at full battle stations already with their heaviest screens up golden dragons slid across the distance orbiting well beyond the ships and beyond the dragons against the galaxy my god he thought he saw great shoals and thunderheads of red obscuring the jeweled kirtle of the galaxy the sharks were so numerous and excited that he could not discern individuals yes moyshe manfriend will attack soon a voice said inside his mind chub hello welcome home i see by your mind many more adventures lived moyshe manfriend i see doors opened where once shadows lay what in heaven youve changed chub youve become poetic windchime laughter tinkled through his mind have been so lucky moyshe manfriend first a spy linker who taught jokes then a she linker filled with poetry mcclennon felt the starfish reaching deep within him ferreting through the hidden places examining all the secrets and fears it had not been able to reach before you remember fast moyshe manfriend on cue an outside voice said linker communications we have an open channel to assyrian and prussian fire control please inform us when youre ready to begin fear stalked through mcclennon the starfish reached in and calmed him im ready now he replied he listened in as danions communications people closed their nets and linked with the dreadnoughts he heard the chatter as the navy and seiner fleets went on battle alert from his outside viewpoint he watched screens develop around the navy ships the two giant warships began creeping toward the shark storm the sharks sensed the attack before it arrived suddenly they were flashing everywhere trying to reach their attackers and the ships behind them mcclennon felt the flow from chub go through his mind into danion he saw the response of assyrian and prussian their weapons ripped the very fabric of space sharks by the hundred died and by dozens and scores they slipped past and hurled themselves at the massed ships around stars end in ten minutes space was aglow from the energies being expended and ten minutes later still mcclennon began to feel bleak to despair when he recognized the moods source he asked chub whats the matter too many sharks moyshe manfriend attacking was mistake even the great shipsthatkill of your people will not be able to endure mcclennon studied the situation space was scarlet yes but he saw no sure indicators of defeat still starfish could intuit developments before even the swiftest humancreated computer he began to see it fifteen minutes later whole packs of sharks were suiciding in the warships screens gradually overloading them they were doing it to every ship near stars end at least a dozen vessels were aflame with the fire that could burn anywhere as antimatter gasses slowly annihilated the metal of their hulls it got worse moyshe claras voice seemed to come from half a galaxy away youve been in a long time want to come out no im doing fine youre thrashing around a lot its all right its grim out here a driblet of fear was getting past chubs sentinel effort the starfish himself was in a state of agitation his kind were being slaughtered it got worse prussian was compelled to withdraw the sharks redoubled their assault upon assyrian hapsburg picked up the realtime link and replaced prussian the navy squadrons fared better than did the starfisher harvestfleets their fire patterns were virtually impenetrable from somewhere a voice screamed breakthrough breakthrough mcclennon did not understand till much later at the moment he thought it meant the sharks had managed their victory it was not till chub began exulting that he realized the tide had turned the sharks were turning on themselves pairing off and fighting to the death in ponderous savage duels winners searched for new victims here and there a few began to flee within half an hour the only red to be seen was that fading from fragments of dead shark space was aboil with the activity of the scavenger things that followed the sharks chub kept giggling like a teenager at a dirty joke we do it one more time moyshe manfriend this time when impossible and in grand style grandest style possible will make bet herd and harvestfleet will have no trouble from sharks again for age of man so many died here moyshe clara said still okay i think we should bring you out youve been under a long time a sadness came over mcclennon for an instant he could not identify its cause then he knew chub was sorry to see him go the starfish knew that this time it would be forever i dont know what to say chub i already said goodbye once chub tried a feeble joke mcclennon forced a charity laugh not so good not so good remember me chub always the spy man from the hard matter worlds will remain immortal in the memory of the herd stay happy moyshe manfriend remember there is hope gainst the worldslayers too the old ones tell me to tell you so they are remembered from other galaxies they have been stopped before other galaxies they come to all galaxies eventually moyshe manfriend they are the tools of the first race the hard matter folk of the beginning they do not grow old and die they are not born as you but in machine wombs from pieces of adults they are created things they do not reason as you they know only their task mcclennon felt the starfish struggling with concepts alien to the starfish mind there was an aura of the extremely ancient in what the creature was trying to tell him chub seemed to be translating very old mood lore into the relative precision of modern human thought they scourge the worlds that they might be prepared for the first race moyshe manfriend but the first race is gone and not there to take the worlds nor to end the work of their tools they were gone before the birth of your home star who built stars end do you know the little hard matter people as you thought those whose bones you found they were enemies of the first race they won that struggle but still run from the tools of their foes but chub knew his questions before he thought them they are old too moyshe manfriend they flee and the killersofworlds pursue this is not the first time they have passed through our galaxy you do not know stars end it is old moyshe manfriend older than the stones of earth the enemies of the worldslayers are but a ghost of what once was they perish in flight and decline and always they leave their trail of traps for their foes the herd knew them of old moyshe manfriend in other ages when the galaxies were young and closer together and our fathers swam the streams arching between them youre getting poetic the moods mesh moyshe manfriend the moods mesh moyshe youd better not stay much longer claras voice was more remote than ever he began to feel her urgency linker communications were breaking lock linker aye chub i coming to you moyshe manfriend you will remember the starfishs message puzzled mcclennon he would remember what something hit his mind it was an overpowering wave panicking he yanked upward on his escape switch chub my friend were his last screaming thoughts before the darkness took him pain overwhelming pain worse than any migraine his head was pulling itself apart he screamed hold him someone yelled he writhed against restraining arms something pierced his flesh warm relaxation radiated from that point the pain began to lessen soon he could open his eyes and endure the light get back clara snapped at someone moyshe how do you feel like death warmed over over though she looked relieved she growled i told you to come out why didnt you chub was telling me about stars end end about who built it and about the centerward race race it was important important you pushed it too far give me another shot shot ill be all right right hows the battle coming coming what happened anyway anyway hans held his arm while clara gave him the second injection the pain receded it became a slight irritation over his eyes like a sinus infection they made the breakthrough with the stars end master control moyshe hans said there wasnt the slightest animosity in the youth now you held them long enough once it found the key it broke our language in seconds it saw our problem it did whatever it did about the sharks what did it do do mouse stepped around where he could look into mcclennons eyes we were hoping you could tell us you were out there i didnt know what was happening happening one minute we had no hope hope the next minute the sharks sharks had been hit by a hurricane or something or something the empires didnt do so hot eh they did magnificently better than all of paynes fleet paynes fleet did during the first battle battle i think gruber gruber will be properly impressed impressed there was just more there there than anybody expected expected mouse frowned at him he asked clara why is he doing that i dont know ive never seen it before why am i doing what what echoing yourself what do you mean mean how soon can we move him mouse asked any time clara told him but he should stay here our medical people know how to handle mindtech problems no the admiral wants him right back come on thomas feet on the floor lets see if you can stand no problem problem he was weak but he could get around why were they all looking at him that way he began to remember he told me i would remember remember who told you mouse asked as he guided mcclennon toward the door and conveyances waiting outside chub the starfish fish im beginning to to mouse ive got to see the admiral admiral im remembering everything the fish know about the centerward race and their enemies enemies he turned clara it was good to see you again again hans be a good fellow mind your grandmother mother he reached with his right hand surprised hans shook it of course moyshe good luck he glanced at clara the woman said good luck moyshe maybe youll surprise us again mcclennon smiled weakly i hope not not no more battles anyway way mouse lets go go he was driven by anxiety he wanted to report what he had learned before the memories slipped away mouse stopped to talk to amy before he boarded the shuttle take care of yourself he told her and be happy whats happened wasnt your fault you could say it was fate i know mouse but that doesnt make it hurt any less she smiled wanly greater destinies its probably for the best sorry i was such a bitch mouse shrugged no problem take care take care of moyshe mouse looked at her strangely hes your friend but hes the husband im going to remember she leaned close whispered promise not to tell him till hes past the worst part weve got a baby on the way its a promise he doesnt need that on his mind too storm backed through the hatchway waved turned found a seat for a time he was too amazed to be disturbed by the fly mcclennon sat opposite him beside one of the marines writing furiously twentyfour ad the contemporary scene the defender prime of ulant gave the order the climbers left their mother ships pursuit destroyers moved to positions in reserveandchase ready to pounce on any courier or fugitive fleeing the battle the empires and conquerors and their ulantonid toke kharmehl and achyfnth equivalents began to move the cruisers frigates and bombards formed their holding screen a gnatlike swarm of singleships put on inherent velocity preparatory to a lightning pass through the enemy spewing energy and torpedoes and collecting totheminute intelligence for the defenders master battle computers the centerward people were unsuspecting even the folk they were attacking had no idea that help had come years of ulantonid staff planning had gone into this action it was their game for the first time ever confederation personnel were accepting orders from outside commanders even the warriors of toke set aside their pride and accepted direction from leaders more knowledgeable than they twelve sovereign governments of five races were represented in the allied fleet the climbers materialized amid the enemy force they expended their munitions stocks before their foes could react they returned to their mothers to rearm seconds later the singleships dropped hyper it took a special breed to fight the oneman scout ships egoists solipsists men convinced of their own invulnerability men who could not be intimidated by the knowledge that they had virtually no defense but speed and violent maneuverability the singleships streaked through the centerward warfleet spewing their hunter missiles and flailing with their lone nosemounted energy beams for some speed proved a liability there were so many enemy vessels shifting in confusion that there were collisions data flowed to the computers of the allied fleet the size disposition orientation vectors and velocities of enemy units began to appear in the huge displays of the defenders command and backup command vessels ships and installations belonging to the race under attack were identified and tagged friendly enemy command ships were identified and targeted for special attention by the next climber sortie the general staff of ulant had planned thoroughly and well there were no unpleasant surprises the heavies closed and began pounding a technologically inferior enemy the advantages were all to the allies all but one they were outnumbered a hundred to one they were a singleminded folk those centerward creatures when unable to fight a ship any longer they took to their shuttlecraft and tried to land on the planet the handful who reached the surface looked for something to kill and kept at it till something killed them aboard ship and on the ground they had only a limited concept of tactics tactics were unnecessary when the only strategy needed was the application of overwhelming numbers they seemed unacquainted with fear and constitutionally unable to retreat they simply fought and died and let someone else take their place the only ships to leave the battle were couriers departing at tenhour intervals the pursuit destroyers handled them as well as couriers coming in one by one allied warships were destroyed or injured beyond any capacity to continue fighting at hour forty of an action originally projected to endure about one hundred hours the defender prime instelled ulant she expressed her fear that her command was insufficient to fulfill its mission effective losses twentyfour percent of commitment current estimated active ratios in the enemys favor her figures did not take into account displacements her ships were concentrating on the more important and dangerous enemy vessels a significant percentage of the remaining ships were lightly armed troop transports the centerward people stubbornly insisted on devoting strength to their assault on the planet the defenders pessimism was not unwarranted her onehundredhour report showed the allied fleet over fifty percent neutralized all missile stores had been expended breakdowns were claiming the energy weapons she had lost the use of the last of her climbers her crews were drained by exhaustion she disengaged the enemy ignored her departure they closed ranks and continued their disrupted planetary assault the defender received instructions to stand off and observe confederation was sending reinforcements convoys bearing munitions and repair spares were in space in the end after a month of brutal fighting the last centerward warship was annihilated the allied fleet returned home to lick its wounds and reflect on the savagery of the encounter the defender departed without contacting the planets she had saved she wanted no replacement enemy fleet finding any information on the mysterious rescuers a great victory by numbers a huge slaughter but a pyrrhic affair the carefully husbanded and prepared strength of the allies had been decimated at least four more warfleets were moving out the arm nothing really had been won except the knowledge that such a monster force could be overcome the victory did not fill the several high commands with joy it simply unleashed an even more grim foreboding of things to come twentyfive ad the main sequence mcclennon had been relating his memories for months christ mouse im sick of it why cant people be satisfied with the deposition tapes mouse moved a pawn trying to initiate a trade because its so damned fascinating its like meeting somebody who can wiggle his ears you want to see him do his trick i cant help it either i wish i could get inside your head man remembering what the galaxy looked like before old sol was formed mcclennon refused the trade he moved a knight to support his own pawn glanced at the time four hours im beginning to dread it theyll do the whole debriefing routine for two years of mission and theyll stay on me about my starfish memories till they know the whole physical history of the universe mouse glanced at the clock too marathon would be dropping hyper soon preparatory to decelerating in to luna command debriefing doesnt excite me either on the other hand well get to see a lot of people we havent seen for a long time theyll all be changed maybe too much maybe we wont know them anymore mcclennon tried to focus on his friends in luna command max would be older greta would be a different animal he might not recognize her now his thoughts kept fleeing to the memories he found something new each time he checked them they were intriguing but he could not shed the disheartening parts there were not just five warfleets coming out the arm there were eighteen and the galaxy was infested by not one but four globulars he could not console himself with the starfish view that in the long run the enemy was never entirely successful he did not care that this was their third scourging of the milky way that life always survived and that sometime between the grim passages over the eons new intelligence arose to contest the worldslayers efforts he could not be consoled by the knowledge that the enemy would not reach confederation in his lifetime if there was a god he was cruel to have allowed the creation of such allpowerful enduring monstrousness chub thought he was giving me a gift mcclennon said he knew i was curious about the past and he knew his species had information we wanted it was a gift of despair it just showed us how hopeless the whole thing really is i wouldnt say that youre down too far why do you say that you told me the fish said they can be stopped that it had been done before the stars end people were working on it when the plague got them they were working on us mouse trying to breed some kind of killer race of their own mouse shrugged hi tanni mcclennon glanced up into laughing green eyes mouse suggested why dont you take my friend for a walk hes down again the woman laughed thats what i had in mind or would you rather play chess tom mcclennon grinned lets flip a coin ouch no fair pinching come on you ive got to go on station in an hour she undulated out of the wardroom wait till max gets a look at that mouse said hey she better not not ever hear the fireworks would make the nova bomb look pitiful mouse laughed im looking forward to it old buddy i cant forgive you for snagging that before i did you cant win them all mouse he hurried after tanni lowenthal stars end the mission starfish and centerward enemies forgotten he spent a month in the bowels of old earths moon the mindbutchers demolished his soul and on its foundations rebuilt to saner specifications the first three weeks were horror incarnate he was forced to face himself by mind mechanics who showed no more compassion than a marine motor pool man for a recalcitrant personnel carrier they did not accept excuses they did not permit stalling and even while he slept they continued debriefing him tapping the incredible store of memories given him by chub they were merciless and they were effectve his sojourn among the seiners had mellowed his memories of the cold determination of his navy compatriots he had come in unprepared he was less ready to fight the reconstruction it went more quickly than his doctors anticipated when he was past crisis they opened him up and repaired his ulcerated plumbing he was permitted visitors on day twentynine two at a time his nurse protested just two of you can go in disappear mouse told her yes sir captain sir mouse was nearly trampled by two women he dropped his portable chess set chessmen scattered across the floor oh damn greta plopped her behind on the edge of the bed flung herself forward hugged mcclennon im glad youre back ive been calling every day since i heard they wouldnt let me come before and max the old girlfriend christ walter what the hell did they do to you you look like death on a stick thats why i love you max youve always got a pleasant word he squeezed gretas hand how are you honey hows academy she started babbling max got on about some new stamps she had at her hobby shop she had been saving them for him mouse recovered his chessmen deposited the set on the nightstand took a chair he crossed right leg over left steepled his fingers before his mouth and watched with a small smile mcclennon turned his head trying to hide his eyes softly max said walter youre crying mcclennon hid behind his hand max it was a rough one a long one and a rough one i was lost for a long time i forgot i forgot i had friends i was alone out there mouse was there wasnt he mouse was there without him he brought me through mouse come here he took storms hand thanks mouse i mean it lets dont let it get away again for a moment storm stopped hiding behind the masks and poses he nodded greta resumed babbling mcclennon hugged her again im having trouble believing it i thought youd have forgotten me by now how could i what am i a sentimental fool who helped a pretty girl in trouble we never knew each other she hugged him a third time she whispered i knew you you cared thats what matters when you were gone your friends were always there to help she buried her head in his shoulder and blubbered mcclennon frowned a question at max who said your bureau took care of her like family shes got to be the most pampered midshipman in academy and you max shrugged i did what i could she seemed embarrassed well how else was i going to keep track of you i dont have connections im glad youre going to be all right greta murmured dad more tears escaped mcclennons eyes did i do wrong i didnt mean its all right honey its all right i wasnt ready for that he squeezed the wind out of her just get the hell out of my way woman someone thundered in the passageway outside beckhart kicked the door open see if you cant find a bedpan over around tycho crater eh go on get scarce the nurse beat her second retreat the admiral surveyed the room mcclennon stared at his professional paterfamilias looks like everythings under control beckhart observed place is drawing a crowd mcclennon said must be my animal magnetism beckhart smiled with one side of his mouth thats one crime they wont convict you of son lay out that board mouse ill beat you a game while we wait for the females the game had hardly started and mcclennon had hardly gotten gretas eyes dried the door swung inward again the nurse watched with a look of despair tanni lowenthals face rippled with emotions it selected an amused smile tom i thought id get here first i guess you dont run as fast when youve got short legs she crossed gazes with max the metallic scrang of ladies rapiers meeting momentarily tortured the air then max smiled and introduced herself she and tanni got past the rocky part in minutes beckhart checked his watch damn it theyre late im going to have somebodys the harried nurse stepped in she carried a portable remote comm call for you captain mcclennon let me have that the admiral said he seized the comm jones you find her got her on the line all right thomas your mother he handed the comm to mcclennon and returned to his game mcclennon did not know what to do or say he and his mother were estranged she was old earther born and bred and they had battled fiercely ever since his enlistment their last meeting just before the seiner mission had ended bitterly mother tommy is it really you yes i thought youd been killed when they came to the apartment god they say you were mixed up in this war business thats got the whole world turned upside down the spikes are everywhere theyre grabbing people off the streets i was in it a little she had not changed he hardly had a chance to get in a word of his own they said you got married is she a nice girl it didnt work out but yes she was you would have liked her he checked his audience only the admiral seemed to know his mothers half of the conversation they did not talk long there had been little to say since he had gone his separate way it was enough that for all their differences they could show one another they still cared mcclennon handed the comm to the admiral when he finished thank you sir i owe you thomas one mission and another i put you through hell for four years i wont apologize youre the best they demanded the best but i can try to make it up a little now i can try to show you that i didnt take it all away beckhart seemed unable to say what he meant thank you sir a baffled resigned nurse opened the door a youth in midshipman blacks stepped in uncle tom horstjohann jesus boy i hardly recognize you youre half a meter taller jupp von drachaus son joined the crowd the boy had been closer to mcclennon than his father since his parents had split the boy was in his fathers custody and resented him for being absent so much thomas did not understand the reasoning behind the feeling the boy saw jupp more often than him he thought of his mother and reflected that children applied a special logic to that species of adult called a parent he lay back on the bed and surveyed the gathering not a big circle he thought but all good friends surprisingly good friends considering what he had been through the past few years friends whom most of the time he had not known he had he really had been way out there lost in the wildernesses of his mind hadnt he the universe now seemed bright and new specially made for him even his starfish memories and his knowledge of the doom approaching from centerward could not take the gleam off horstjohann was first to leave after a promise to visit again come the weekend then mouse who had to return to his own extended debriefing then tanni who had to get back for her watch aboard marathon she departed after a whispered promise that left him in no doubt that his masculinity had survived the hospital weeks beckhart sat his chair silently and waited with the patience of a statue of ramses a half hour after tannis departure max announced we have to leave walter greta has to get back for morning muster you be good and try not to collect any more little blondes mcclennon grinned selfconsciously you coming back for sure im keeping an eye on you youre not sneaking off on me again its been a long time walter greta blushed thanks for coming and greta thank you come here he hugged her whispered im there when you need me i know its important to have somebody who needs you i know ill be back saturday after the women left beckhart sat in silence for several minutes mcclennon finally asked arent they going to miss you at the office im not as indispensable as i thought thomas i come back after six months in the field and find them caught up and not a problem in sight whats on your mind i really said it before about as well as i can that im sorry i had to do what i did sorry but youd do it again if something comes up i dont think it will things are damned quiet now the war has everybodys attention will we be able to do anything with stars end or what i learned from the starfish about the fish info i dont know it does prove theres a hope stars end our seiner friends have gotten it straightened out the place is almost a hightechnology weapons museum some of the simpler systems will be available when next we engage the gods are dead long live the gods mcclennon murmured what nothing nothing at all a long time ago in another life i promised you a vacation i sent you to paynes fleet instead this time im sending you home ive already sent word to refuge to get your house ready take mouse along mouse mouse took care of you when it got tough its your turn hes slipping the sangaree are gone that hate kept him glued together since he was a kid all right i understand a mountain of paperwork was needed to close out the mission and put the board of inquiry into motion the latter would be handled entirely by deposition thomas rolled through it nothing daunted him the psychs seemed to have rebuilt him better than original issue he worked like a slave and had energy left to flit from friend to friend evenings and weekends he reminded himself of mouse in days gone by when storm had been everywhere at once pursuing a hundred interests and projects mouse was the opposite he could not finish anything then it was all done marathon took them aboard and spaced for the quiet cygnian world called refuge which was home for millions of retired civil servants and senior service personnel but for tanni lowenthal the journey might have been depressing going home his showing for the mission some money some stamps and coins for his collections some new and old memories and an armistice with himself somehow it did not seem enough but he had found his friends the people he had thought missing so long so why was he disappointed there had been one soulscar the psychs had not been able to heal completely he could not forget amy they had never really finished they had not said the end they had just gone separate ways he liked things wrapped up neatly time passed cygnian summer faded into autumn fall segued into winter mouse and mcclennon played chess and waited growing closer till mouse revealed the whole story of his past of the origins of his hatred for the sangaree gently mcclennon kept his friends spirit from sliding away completely gently he began to bring mouse back the report of the board of inquiry delayed repeatedly drew no closer from cygnus it did not seem there was a war luna command had expanded its forces sixfold and had begun building new weapons and ships but otherwise confederation seemed to be going on as before tanni visited occasionally max and greta kept in touch and yet some nights when the dark winter skies were terribly clear mcclennon would put aside his stamp collection coins or the novel he had begun writing and would go out on the terrace shivering he would stare up at stars burning palely in unearthly constellations and picture huge ships like flying iron jungles he would think of swarms of gold dragons and a millionyearold beast he had taught to tell a joke he never loved her more than he did now that she was lost forever mouse had told him she might use his name to frighten his own child she would not hate him now she would understand but there would be appearances to be maintained and social winds with which to sail life never worked out the way you wanted everyone was victimized by social equivalents of the theories of that dirty old man heisenberg the comm buzzed mcclennon answered a moment later he called mouse jupps coming in to spend a few days he returned to the terrace the ship burned down the sky toward where the citys lighted towers made fairy spires that soared above distant woods mcclennon pretended it was a shooting star he made a wish want to play a game while were waiting mouse grinned youre on stop smirking im going to whip you this time old buddy and he did he finally did
