xanth chapter quest grundy golem stretched and bounced off his cushion he looked at himself in the mirror not totally pleased he stood the height of a normal mans spread fingered hand and that was fine for sleeping on a cushion but not all that great when it came to making an impression on the land of xanth it was a nice new day almost he was able to forget that he was the least significant of living creatures when he had been a true golem fashioned of wood and rag he had longed to be a real living thing supposing that he would be satisfied if only he could become flesh at last he had won that goal and for a time he had believed that he was happy but slowly the truth had sunk in he was still only a handsbreadth greater than nothing no one took him seriously they thought he had a smart mouth because he liked insulting people actually it was because he was trying desperately to cover over his deepening awareness of his own inadequacy when he used his talent of language to make some other person or creature feel low he felt a little higher himselffor a moment but now he knew that this was a false device and that his mouth had mainly brought him the contempt of others he wished he could undo that damage and make golem in the gear of himself a genuinely worthwhile and respected person but he didnt know how meanwhile he was hungry that was a consequence of being real he had to eat it hadnt been that way when he had been a true golem then he had suffered no hunger pain or calls of nature but he liked it better this way he decided because he also felt living pleasures and living miseries he slid down the banister and scrambled out the win dow that was normally left open for him he landed in a clump of toadstools that had sprung up overnight knock ing several over unfortunately a small toad had been sitting on one clumsy oaf the toad croaked righting himself watch where youre going listen frogface grundy retorted this is my path you have no business here i was on a toadstool as i have a perfect right to be the toad protested you just came barging through the creature had a case but grundy didnt care his irritation with the situationand with all ot xanth caused him to react in the familiar way that he wished he didnt know what i think of that ill bash all these stinky things to smithereens and he grabbed up a stick and laid about him knocking over toadstools right and left grundy was no giant but they stood only about knee high to him and were easy to dispatch help the toad croaked berserker on the loose suddenly there was a stirring throughout the weedy region beside the castle wall toads appeared hopping in toward the summonssmall ones at first then larger ones and finally one huge one grundy realized he was in trouble he tried to scramble up to the window but the monster toad opened his pon golem in the gears derous maw and speared the golem with his tongue the tongue was sticky grundy could not get free the toad retracted it and hauled grundy in eat him eat him the massed toads cried teach him to leave toadstools alone grundy clutched at a halfburied rock managing to halt his progress toward the maw but now the little toads hopped on him pounding him with their feet and one of them wet on him disgusted as well as frightened he grabbed that toad and heaved it into the maw of the giant toad the maw closed the tongue released grundy and snapped back home evidently the giant toad didnt mind what he ate but the little toads minded get that monster they croaked and snapped at him with their tongues they couldnt do him much damage singly but as a group they might he tried to dodge the snapping tongues but there were too many in addition the giant toad was catching on that it hadnt eaten the whole thing it reoriented on him then grundy spied a hypnogourd that might help he ran to it and dived behind it so that its peephole was facing away from him and toward the toads as the giant toad opened its maw and lined up its terrible tongue grundy shoved the gourd around so that the peephole bore directly on it the big toad lookedand froze its gaze had been trapped by the gourd so there filthtongue he cried now youre stuck but the little toads werent stuck they averted their gazes and came leaping at him one landed on his head bearing it down grundy shook the creature off but in the process caught a glimpse of the peephole himself suddenly he found himself inside the gourd he was oolem in the gears standing amidst giant wooden gears the huge toad was there too and had a leg caught between two of them the gears were drawing it slowly but inevitably between them crushing it halp it cried im gonna croak well you were gonna eat me grundy retorted but he didnt like this it was too ugly a demise he tried to pry the toad out but the gears were too strong then he saw a small loose gear he picked it up and jammed it next to the toads leg as the two turning gears ground together the loose one was crunched in a moment the moving ones shuddered to a stop now a huge stallion appeared virtually snorting fire his hide was midnight black and his eyes glinted blacker i should have known the night stallion snorted a golem in the gears there was a subtle flicker then grundy and the giant toad were back in the real world out of the gourd grundy realized that they had been ejected the big toads leg was whole but it seemed to have lost its appetite grundy realized that he had suffered the ultimate indignity he had been rejected by the hypnogourd no one had any use for him he scrambled again for the window and this time made it fouled with the sticky spittle of the giant and the wet ting of the midget he fell inside what a mess but worse than the ignominy of his present condition was his realization that he was of so little account that even a toad could humiliate him it wasnt just a matter of size it was an almost total lack of respect he was a nobody socially as well as physically what use was it to be a living creature if he was of absolutely no consequence he found a bucket of wash water left over from yes golem in the gears terdays scrubbing of a floor and labored to get himself clean while he worked he came to a conclusion an answer to his question it was no use to live without respect but what could he do about it he was what he was an insignificant creature as he ran across the room he heard stifled sobbing he paused for now he also cared about others he was seldom able to show it in ways they appreciated but he did care he looked about and discovered that it was a planta small green stem that looked rather wilted grundys magic talent was the ability to converse with other living things so he talked to the plant whats the matter with you greenface im wwilting the plant responded i can see that potroot why because ivy forgot to wwater me the plant blub bered shes so wrapped up with her mischief that it tried to squeeze out another tear but could not it had no water left grundy went to the bathroom climbed up on the sink and grabbed the damp sponge there he hauled this down dragged it across the floor and to the plant then he hefted it up and squeezed it in a bear hug so that water dribbled into the pot oh thank you the plant exclaimed as it drank in the moisture how can i ever repay you grundy was as selfish as the next creature but he didnt see any way the plant could do anything for him so he elected to be generous always glad to help a fellow creature he said ill tell ivy to give you a good water ing whats she doing thats so distracting im not supposed to tell the plant demurred golem in the gears now grundy saw what the plant could do for him didnt i just do you a favor wiltleaf the plant sighed dont tell i told ivys a terror when she gets mad grundy well knew that ivy was eight years old and a full sorceress no one crossed her without regretting it i wont tell shes teaching dolph to be a bird so he can fly out and look for stanley grundy pursed his tiny lips that was mischief indeed dolph was her little brother three years old and a magi cian who could change to any living form instantly cer tainly he could become a bird and fly awaybut just as certainly that would be disaster because if he didnt promptly get lost he would get eaten by some airborne predator this had to be stopped but grundy had promised not to tell he had broken promises before but he was trying to steer a straighter course also if he told on ivy he would be in immediate and serious trouble he had to find some private way to stop this he went through the motions of breakfast but found no answer to his problem he saw ivy going to dolphs room and knew he had to actwithout admitting what he knew so he pretended to encounter her accidentally intercepting her in the hall whatcha up to kid go away you little snoop she said amiably all rightill play with dolph instead dont you dare she said with moderate fury im playing with him we can both play with him grundy suggested to that she was unable to demur because she didnt want to give away her secret by being too insistent dolph was up and dressed and ready to play he was golem in the gears a handsome little boy with curly brown hair and a big smile seeim a bird he exclaimed and suddenly he was a bird a pretty red and green one ixnay ivy whispered but dolph was already chang ing back pleased with his accomplishment can i go out and fly now he asked why would you want to fly grundy inquired as if innocently he doesnt ivy said quickly but dolph was already answering im going to catch a dragon he said proudly no he isnt ivy cried thats very good dolph grundy said what dragon will you catch no dragon ivy cried stanley steamer dolph said hes lost grundy turned to ivy as if surprised whats he talking about you know hes not allowed to go out alone i told you not to snoop ivy said furiously its none of your business but you cant send dolph out if anything happened to him your father would ask the walls of castle roogna who put him up to it and then your mother would ivy put both hands protectively against her backside knowing where her mothers wrath would strike but ive got to rescue stanley she wailed hes my pet dragon but nobody even knows where he is grundy pointed out or even whether hes he had to break off because it would not be smart to utter the dread conjec ture in ivys presence stanley had disappeared when a monsterbanish spell had accidentally caught him of course he wasnt a monster he was a pet but the spell had not distinguished one type of dragon from another golem in the gears naturally ivy had pestered good magician humfrey about stanleys whereabouts but there were so many dragons in xanth that humfreys spells had not been able to isolate stanley or so humfrey claimed humfrey was younger than he once hadbeen and probably his magic wasnt up to snuff but he wouldnt admit that somehow ill find him ivy said resolutely hes my dragon there was some justice in that claim l obody could hold a dragon unless that dragon wanted to be held and it had been friendship that held stanley ivy had perceived him as her friend and her pet and her enormous and subtle magic had made him so grundy was sure stanley would have returned to her had he been able the fact that he had not returned strongly suggested that he was dead and ivy would not give up the search grundy knew her well enough to accept that yet if she were not dis suaded both she and her family might in the end suffer much greater distress than the loss of one little dragon such as the loss of a little brother ivy was a sorceress but she was also a child she lacked adult judgment grundy could neither tell on her nor allow her to pro ceed with this foolish project what was he to do it occurred to him that there was a noble way out of this dilemmaa way that just might bring him some of the esteem he craved ill find him for you he said ivy clapped her hands in the way that little girls had you will oh thank you grundy i take back half the mean things ive said about you half well half a loaf was evidently all he rated but while im doing it you mustnt do anything yourself he cautioned that could mess it up oh i wont i wont she agreed not until you bring him back golem in the gears in this manner grundy found himself committed to a quest he strongly suspected was futile but what else could he have done ivy needed her dragon back and he needed to be a hero grundy had no idea how to proceed so he did what anyone in that situation would do he went to ask the good magician he caught a ride with a passing thesaurus who was going that way the thesaurus was a very ancient breed of reptile who had picked up an enormous vocab ulary during its centuries of life it made for an interesting dialogue while they traveled however it had the annoy ing habit of never using a single term where several similar ones could be squeezed in for example when grundy inquired where it was going it swished its heavy tail and replied i am departing leaving removing embarking going traveling for distant remote faraway separated regions zones areas territories districts by the time they reached the good magicians castle grundy was glad to bid it farewell adieu goodbye and good rid dance now grundy stood before the good magicians castle each time he had approached it over the years it had looked different from the outside but very little changed inside this time it was suspiciously ordinary a circular moat gray stone walls scattered motley turrets and a general air of indifference to external things grundy knew this was illusory humfrey was the magician of infor mation and though he was young now he generally did know what was going on he didnt like to be bothered about inconsequentials so he established barriers to intrusions on the theory that only folk with sufficiently important concerns would navigate them well grundy had a concern and he knew he had to golem in the gears golem in the gears get past three obstacles to win entry what he didnt know was what they were or how to nullify them he would simply have to move ahead and do what he had to he stepped up to the edge of the moat the water lay there rippling at him naturally there was no way for him to cross the drawbridge was up well he would simply have to swim swim first he had better check out the moat mon sters hey snootface he called moat monsters were always varieties of water serpents and vain about their appearance there was no response well he could handle that say grass he said to the verdant bank wheres the monster on vacation ragbrain the grass replied grundy was surprised no moat monster on duty you mean i can safely swim across fat chance stringfellow the grass replied youd get eaten up before you got five strokes but if theres no monster the grass rustled in the breeze suit yourself wood nose grundy didnt trust this how can i get eaten if theres no monster but the grass had been ruffled find out for yourself clayface obviously it had some notion of his origin though he was no longer composed of string rag wood or clay he didnt really appreciate its attitude perhaps because it was so like his own something was definitely amiss he bent to poke a finger in the water but an anticipatory rustle across the lawn alerted him so he plucked a blade of grass evoking a strenuous protest from the bank and poked it in the water in a moment it dissolved into sludge this mote was filled with acid some obstacle if he had tried to swim in that he scrounged for a small stick and poked that in the moat it dissolved more slowly being dead and more solid he located a pebble and tried that and it didnt dissolve at all now he knew that the acid only affected animate mate rial unfortunately he was animate he would have to use some sort of boat to cross to keep his flesh clear of the liquid he searched the premises looking for a boat naturally there was none he heard a popping noise and discovered a popcorn plant but that didnt help he took a kernel of the corn on general principles however one never could tell when something might be useful in some obscure way then he found a giant snail shell the snail had long since passed away but its hollow shell was beautiful gleaming iridescently but what use was an empty snail shell suddenly he had a notion he took hold of the shell and dragged it toward the moat this was a job as it weighed more than he did he could have crawled inside the thing but that just might be what he needed he shoved it to the moat and nudged it in it floated with the hollow aperture up and it did not dissolve he pressed down on it but it contained a lot more volume of air than he could displace he could not push it below the surface of the liquid good enough again grundy hauled the shell back on shore then made another tour locating several long twigs of wood he brought them back set them inside the shell and launched golem in the gears it again then he climbed in himself carefully it sup ported his weight now he was floating he took a twig and used it to pole off from the bank he settled himself as comfortably as he could inside the shell and used a flattened twig to paddle the craft he had a snailboat before long his wooden paddle dissolved and he had to use another he had to paddle carefully so as not to splash any of the acid on himself progress was slow but the moat was not broad he judged he would make it safely across if he didnt panic just as long as no monster appeared at this stage no monster appeared monsters didnt like acid any better than living golems did an armored serpent might withstand the corrosion but how would it protect its eyes and mouth in due course he nudged his way to a landing inside the moat and stepped carefully to shore one hurdle down he stood and looked about he was on a fairly narrow beach between the moat and the wall the beach curved around the island that was the castle the wall was ver tical and fashioned of flat polished stone he could see his reflection in it but he couldnt catch so much as a fingerhold for climbing he would have to walk around until he came to a suitable entrance he walkedand soon encountered a large animal it was a unicorn there were very few of them in xanth they seemed to prefer to range in other pastures this one was a fairly disreputablelooking creature with a burr tangled mane and a gnarled horn it snorted as it spied him and pawed at the sand with a forehoof hi there warphorn grundy said in equine language with his usual politeness why dont you clean up that stinking coat golem in the gean ill clean up the sand with you you midget blot the unicorn replied with unprovoked bad humor oopsthis was evidently another obstacle i dont suppose youd care to let me pass so i can go on into the castle grundy said i dont suppose youd care to take a bath in the moat the unicorn replied in the same tone grundy made as if to scoot under the creature for there was no room to pass on the side the unicorn made as if to spear anything that tried that route it was obvious that he could not get by the animal was set to prevent it the golem stood back and considered how could he pass a creature who was determined to prevent it and had the ability to enforce the restriction there had to be a way he had a notion he turned and walked away he could circle the castle in either direction and reach the entrance either way the unicorn did not pursue him perhaps too stupid to realize what he was doing grundy walked threequarters of the way around the castleand stopped there was the unicorn facing the other way horn lowered wamingly obviously it had backed up to the entrance place used that wider region to turn and had come to block this route too it wasnt stupid after all it had known that it couldnt protect the entrance by chasing the golem around the castle well maybe he could trick it into letting down its guard or make it so mad it miscalculated grundy had a rare touch with insults when he put his beady little mind to it say founderfoot did they put you out here so you wont stink up the inside of the castle no they put me out here so you wouldnt stink it up the unicorn replied golem in the gears golem in the gears hm this might be more of a challenge than he had thought but grundy tried again did you get that hom caught in a hole in the ground no selfrespecting creature would carry a broken spear like that did you get that body caught in a shrinking violet the unicorn responded no selfrespecting midget would use it listen knotmane im a golem grundy exclaimed im supposed to be this size i doubt it that body is way too small for that mouth grundy swelled up to his full diminutive height ready to spew forth a devastating torrent of abuseand realized that the unicorn was winning the contest it was the one that was supposed to be getting mad he would have to try some other tack well if he couldnt beat it maybe he could join it what do you want most in all xanth he inquired to get rid of pesky golems so i can resume my snooze apart from that grundy said unevenly the unicorn considered well i do get hungry and meals are far apart id sure like a nice snack of something good that was more promising but grundy wasnt sure how he could provide such a snack if you let me into the castle maybe i could get you some nice hay or some thing he suggested if i let you into the castle maybe ill get my hide tanned before im ready to leave it the unicorn said maybe i could get you a snack without going in grundy said id be glad to have a snack without you going in the creature agreed somehow that didnt sound promising grundy stared across the moat where the grass was green and the brush was leafy surely there was plenty there to distract the unicornbut the unicorn couldnt cross to it and grundy himself would not be able to carry enough across in the snailboat to last for more than one mouthful at a time he spied a tall green plant that sported several tassles that jogged his memory maybe there was a way what kind of a plant are you he called in plant language the unicorn couldnt understand that of course so it didnt know what he was doing i am a popcorn plant the plant replied proudly i have the best popcorn on the bank grundy turned to the unicorn unicorns dont like popcorn do they of course they dont the creature agreed its mouth watering aha he remembered correctly unicorns liked all kinds of corns because they were magically related he returned his attention to the popcorn you dont look like much to me he sneered in plant language the plant huffed up and turned color im the top pop it proclaimed my kernels pop harder than any ones they do not grundy retorted i bet they fizzle fizzle the plant snapped outraged its ears turned an angry red ill pop off so hard youll think its an explosion i think its a fake grundy said the plants corns became so hot that the tassles browned and shriveled and the leaves around its ears split apart the kernels popped with the heat first a few then many until it did indeed resemble an explosion popcorn puffs flew out in every direction a number of them arcing over the moat and peppering the castle wall golem in the gears popcorn the unicorn exclaimed eagerly snatching up the fallen pieces but unicorns dont like popcorn grundy reminded it get out of here golem the creature cried angrily as you wish grundy retreated to the unicorns rear toward the gate and the creature was so distracted by the delicious popcorn puffs that it didnt notice grundy moved on up to the gate and through it without further opposition he was inside the castle very clever you little morsel a voice growled grundy looked startled he was in a moderately sized court with a dirt floor and before him stood an ant lion the monster could snap him up in a moment if it wanted to im just trying to get in to see the good magician on important business the golem said nervously indeed the ant lion yawned showing its enormous feline teeth it was playing catandmouse with him knowing that its six insect legs could overtake him any time i doubt you are smart enough to rate any of his time sure i am grundy retorted hotly im just not big enough to get by all you monsters i will make you a deal the ant lion said stretching languorously prove you are smart and i will let you pass it was up to something but grundy realized he had nothing to lose he was already in its power how do i do that you play me three games of lines and boxes the ant lion said if you can defeat me ill let you enter if you lose ill consume you thats very fair isnt it golem in the gears grundy swallowed he was not entirely pleased with the terms suppose we tie then i will let you enter anyway i can be magnani mous to an intellectual equal to make it even easier for you i will even grant you the first move each time grundy still didnt like this but he was aware of two things first he really had no choice as he could not otherwise get in to see the good magician and second he was a pretty good player of lines and boxes he could probably win i agree he said excellent the ant lion said heartily it leaped sud denly into the air and came down with its six legs straight it was a fairly massive creature so each leg sank into the dirt as it landed it stepped out of its tracks and six neat depressions remained then it jumped again this time landing a little to the side the three right legs landed in the dents left by the three left legs before and the three left legs made three new dents the monster stepped carefully back there before it was a neat pattern of nine dents forming a large square with one dent in the center there is the board it announced thats only enough for four boxes grundy pro tested the ant lion extended a claw and contemplated it so grundy decided not to protest further a small game was the same as a big one in principle after all and he did have the first move he stepped up and scratched a line with his foot between a comer dent and the center dent on his side the ant lion reached across and scraped another line from grundys center dot to the other corner dot one side of the figure was complete grundy drew a line from a near comer up to connect golem in the gear to the middle dot on that side the ant lion made another completing that side grundy drew one along the side closest to the ant lion and the ant lion completed this one also then they each put a line in the fourth side now the figure was a large boxand grundy realized he was in trouble he had no choice now but to draw a line from the center dot to one of the sides that would set things up for his opponent to complete a box with his line and then use his extra turn to complete another box and so on through the figure winning he had been trapped into a game he couldnt win moveor forfeit the ant lion said with satisfaction grundy sighed and moved whereupon the ant lion did exactly as expected filling in all four boxes and marking his neat letter as in each grundy had lost badly golem in the gears you the advantage of the first move every time and i am a creature of my word but the monster extended another claw and studied it sig nificantly grundy realized that he had to accept this gen erosity what was he to do the advantage clearly lay with the second playerand that advantage was going to get him consumed by the monster then grundy remembered something there just might be a way he had not played such small games before but the principle should hold the key was in the fact that a player did not have to complete a box if he did not want to provided he was able to make some other move instead that seemed like a losing strategy so it was seldom employed but it had its points he would use it here they started the second game of their appointed three grundy started exactly as he had before and the ant lion continued as before they completed two sides of the outer square then grundy made his surprise move he drew a line to the center golem in the gears golem in the gears its bonus line in the opposite side to avoid giving grundy a similar gift grundy filled in the last free spot now the diagram looked like this to fill in the last available free space it didnt matter which player took the box and the bonus line that extra line shifted the advantage to the first player the configuration now was this a g the ant lion got ready to draw his lineand paused there was nowhere he could move without setting grundy up for three boxes and victory ill be cursed it exclaimed you set me up merely playing the game to win grundy replied modestly with imperfect grace the ant lion drew a line at the edge and grundy filled in the rest marking gs in three boxes g g g a the score stood at one victory each the ant lion was very thoughtful as they commenced the deciding game this one started as the others had but when grundy offered the sacrifice box the other declined it choosing instead to continue around the rim now grundy was nervous could this force the win back to the ant lion then grundy saw the other side of the key he moved in and took the first box himself and used his bonus line the ant lion stared at it for a long time finally it shrugged and filled in a line grundy filled in the remain ing three boxes i learned something today the ant lion said philo sophically the ploy of the proffered box which is dis aster whether accepted or declined i congratulate you golem you have proved yourself to be smart enough to pass and the monster stood aside and allowed grundy to enter the castle grundys little knees were weak in retrospect he real ized that the good magician had surely known about the way to reverse the game so that it represented a fair test of ingenuity but how close he had come to failing the test now he walked through another gate and there was the veiled gorgon what kept you grundy she inquired solicitously grundy didnt have it in him to make a smart reply i just want to see the magician by all means but be careful hes grumpy today she ushered him into the good magicians office humfrey was perched on his high stool poring over a monstrous tome that was par for the course he was golem in the gears golem in th gears now about twelve years old physically having recovered that far from the overdose of youth elixir he had suffered five years before magician i need advice on grundy began go away humfrey grumped i just want to one years servicein advance this was of course standard procedure for the good magician but grundy had been shaken by the experience with the ant lion and his natural manner of expressing himself surged to the fore listen you rejuvenated freak youre such an idiot youve missed the obvious for five years you can be any age you want to anytime i can give you back a century of your life with one sentence then youll owe me a hundred answers this got the good magicians full attention prove it all you have to do is dunk a stick of reversewood in a cup of youth elixir then it will become age elixir humfrey finished amazed now why didnt think of that because youre an i heard very well golemyouve earned your answer ask your question ive earned all the answers i want grundy exclaimed no you have done me one service that i may exploit to my satisfaction how many years i use it for does not relate it is your year that counts ask grundy realized that the good magician like the ant lion was a creature of no compromise at least he had what he wanted how can i find and rescue stanley steamer oho youre doing something about that humfrey glanced at his open book it says you must ride the monster under the bed to the ivory tower you mean you had it open to the place all the time grundy demanded indignantly is that another question grundy ground his teeth the good magician didnt give anything away for nothing unless the visitor was a magician at least tell me where the ivory tower is do you want to pay your years service before or after i give you that answer you gnomish cheapskate grundy raged i just gave you back your age hardly a minute ago humfreys lips quirked and what have you done for me lately golem grundy stormed out of the room the good magician hardly noticed he was back poring over his tome chapter snortimer back at castle roogna grundy remained dis gruntled he had belatedly realized that the good magi cian hadnt even told him that stanley steamer was at the ivory tower he had just said to ride the monster there who could guess what complications would manifest at that point on the other hand humfrey also hadnt said that the quest was useless he might not know for sure golem in the gear golem in the gears whether stanley was alive but at least he had enabled grundy to find out first he had to explain things to ivy he suspected that would not be easyand he was correct you want to take snortimer she demanded indig nantly hes my monster but all you do is ignore him or tease him grundy pointed out thats beside the point she said assuming her little lady manner he belongs under my bed nowhere else but the good magician says i have to ride the monster under the bed to the ivory tower and hes the only monster under the bed i know well enough to ask the ivory tower she asked with a mercurial shift of mood thats where rapunzel lives grundy hadnt thought of that rapunzel was ivys punpal who sent her periodic boxes of puns in exchange for the mundane scraps ivy sent it had always seemed to grundy that ivy had much the best of the bargain and he wondered why rapunzel continued with the arrange ment but what could rapunzel have to do with the miss ing dragon surely she would have notified ivy if stanley had turned up there but he decided it was better not to raise such issues with ivy no good could come of it do you want stanley back or dont you grundy demanded gruffly oh pooh she said go do it then but if anything happens to snortimer ill never forgive you so grundy went to talk to snortimer the monster under ivys bed such monsters were an interesting species because only children and credulous folk could see them at all normal adults didnt even believe in them since grundy was small he had no trouble perceiving the mon sterand because he was small he had always stayed well out of reach now with some trepidation he approached snortimers lair snortimer he called from a safe distance something twitched in the dusky recesses beneath the bunk snortimer i know you understand me grundy called im speaking your language come out from under there i need your help a big hairy hand poked out from the deep shadow as if questing for something to grab that was of course the speciality of the species grabbing childrens ankles some mean children would dangle their feet down and snatch them away just before getting grabbed but most children were properly terrified listen snortimer i have a quest i need your help at last the monster spoke why should i help you cause the good magician says i have to ride you to the ivory tower to rescue stanley snortimer considered itll cost you golem grundy sighed he should have known that nothing about this quest would be easy what will it cost i want romance what ive been eight years under this bed grabbing at ivys ankles and hiding from her mother the same old grind day after day there must be more to life than this but thats what monsters under the bed do grundy protested they have no other purpose than to grab at childrens ankles and hide from parents then why am i supposed to help you snortimer had a point obviously there was more to such a monsters life than ankles umjust what do you mean by romance i dont know but ill know it when i find it golem in the gears golem in the gears why dont you just crawl off to another bed and find a uh female of your species and that isnt how its done no bed monster shares ter ritory i have to find someone who isnt yet committed to a bed where would that be the big ugly hand made a gesture of ignorance i have no idea i suppose i just have to travel about until some where i find her well i plan to travel grundy said if you will be my steed youd get to cover quite a bit of the country sounds good snoitimer agreed ill be your steed but only till i find romance grundy realized that that could get him stranded some where far away perhaps in the midst of uncommitted monster country but half a loaf was better than none agreed lets start right away come on out of there i cant snortimer said but you said i said id be your steed i didnt say id do the impos sible i cant come out until dark but i was planning on traveling in the daytime not with me youre not light would destroy me instantly why do you think we bed monsters never climb up on top of the bed to grab at ankles were confined to the deepest shadows he pondered a moment which is unfortunate theres a lot more than ankles up there why dont you go up and grab when the lights are out the hand spread in a whatcanyoudo gesture against the rules there has to be some limitation or all the bed monsters would take over the uppersides and put the children underneath we cant bother anything we cant grab when the lights on but you can travel from your bed at night some as long as i dont bother anyone i see but why dont you go out and look for romance at night on your own then i wouldnt dare do it alone suppose i got trapped by a sudden light and couldnt make it back to my bed before dawn what happens if you get caught away from your bed extinction snortimer replied with deepest dread but then how can you be my steed and travel to the farthest reaches of xanth in quest of romance i hadnt thought of that the monster said baffled grundy returned to ivy he explained the problem but there must be a way he concluded or the good magician wouldnt have told me to do it ill ask hugo she said she had evidently become reconciled to the temporary loss of her monster grundy suspected that little girls didnt really like having their ankles grabbed when they went to bed whatever they might say to the contrary cmon they went to the magic mirror and ivy summoned hugo the good magicians son hugo was becoming a halfway handsome boy of thirteen he listened to the problem and at ivys urging came up with the solution hell just have to take the bed along ivy turned to grundy see easy as pie just take then she did a doubletake hey thats my bed we all have to make sacrifices grundy said sup pressing an obnoxious smile but ivy surprised him with another change of attitude oh i was tired of that bed anyway you can take it with you ill sleep on cushions theyre comfortabler grundy doubted that but did not see fit to argue per haps for ivy it would become true golem in the gears golem in the gears he returned to snortimer problem solved he announced well just take the bed along how the monster asked good question obviously if snortimer were to be his steed he couldnt also carry a bed assuming he could move it at all but ivy had disappeared on some other errand and grundy knew he couldnt make hugo answer questions the way ivy could if only because the boy was usually rather stupid he would have to figure out some thing on his own i think well have to get help grundy said this was certainly becoming complicated let me know when you do snortimer said mean while ill snooze in a moment there was the sound of snoring from the shadow grundy wandered around castle roogna trying to decide on a suitable person to ask for help it had to be someone big and strong enough to carry the bed and stupid enough not to ask why someone like smash ogre but smash was married now and his wife tandy kept him on a short leash no hope there well maybe someone not stupid but not important either someone who had nothing better to do than carry beds around the countryside who would that be suddenly he had a bright answer he knew just the person thus it was that he came to talk with ivys other grand father bink bink had little to do with the activities of castle roogna and every month when his wife chame leon got smart and ugly he tended to make excursions around xanth on his own maybe hed be willing to take a bed along why not bink inquired amiably he was about sixty years old now but still hearty and a pretty solid man but even a small bed would get heavy soon enough ill ask my friend chester to help but im not sure we should make a big production of this grundy said i was thinking of a quiet quest bink looked at him smiling if i know my grand daughter shes into mischief and if i know you youre trying to keep her out of itand youre not allowed to tell something like that grundy agreed uncomfortably well then we wont tell no one will miss us any way youre very understanding sir grundy said bink might not seem like much but he was a former king of xanth which meant he had magicianclass magic though that wasnt evident it seemed to grundy that he had once known more about it but he seemed to have forgotten its been a long time since chester and i have had a decent adventure bink said that evening bink and chester showed up at the cas tle our wives arent too keen on this bink confessed theyre letting us go but only for two weeks that means one week out and one week back do you think you can complete your quest in that time i hope so grundy said he had no idea how long it would take to reach the ivory tower especially since he didnt know where it was i havent had a lot of expe rience with quests you know well lets get on with it bink said he carried a hefty coil of rope chester waited outside while bink marched in and upstairs grundy on his shoulder it seemed to grundy that someone should have shown up to inquire what in xanth they were doing such as ivys mother irene who normally had supersensitive golem in the gears gosem in the gears hearing and curiosity to match but luckily no one was disturbed and they reached ivys room undetected ivy was awake of course though in her nightie she almost flew to bulks arms ooo grandpa bink how exciting she exclaimed are you going to steal my bed now thats right sweetie bink agreed and methodically he opened the largest window wide tied his rope to the bed and lifted it up snortimer scooted away startled not so fast mon ster grundy said dropping down youre my steed remember it was dark in the room so he really couldnt see snor timer very well but the monster seemed to consist of five or six big hairy arms and hands and nothing else some what diffidently grundy climbed aboard and found a fairly comfortable seat at the juncture of the arms snor timer was not a large monster for he had to fit under the small bed but he was a good size for grundy bink heaved the bed out through the window and let it down with the rope it swung and bumped against the stones of the wall generating an awfiil clatter but still no one seemed to notice what phenomenal luck when the bed scraped its way to the base chester centaur caught hold of it with his powerful arms and set it on his back they had rigged a harness for him so that he could carry it without having to use his hands and its weight was no problem at all for him they bade farewell to ivy who remained thrilled at this secret adventure and perhaps a little jealous that she wasnt going along but she knew as well as they did that there was no way her mother would let her get involved in something like this and of course it was for the best of causes the rescue of stanley steamer they went down and out still without stirring up any commotion in the castle and rejoined chester quietly they walked away from the wall and crossed the moat and entered the main orchard the trees rustled their branches wondering what was going on but did not inter fere they wended their way on through the darkness unspeaking grundy was able to see very little but snor timer had no trouble the monster was of course a crea ture of the dark completely at home in it grundy began to appreciate the wisdom of selecting a steed like this though he remained uncertain whether the good magi cians advice was good for the long term he still had no idea where to find the ivory tower they came to a spot in the forest that chester knew where several great trees clustered to form a leafy bower they stopped we can talk here chester said no one will overhear us where do we go from here i dont know grundy confessed im supposed to go to the ivory tower but the good magician didnt tell me where it is if one of you happens to know not me chester said and bink agreed grundy sighed i suppose well just have to search for it i can ask the plants and things as we go along the good magician must have had a reason to have you ride the bed monster bink said maybe you had better just give the monster its head and see where it takes you i suppose so then grundy thought of something else i thought no adults could see the monster or believe in it we havent seen it yet chester growled its dark but people become more childlike as they grow older bink said maybe there comes a time when they believe in that particular monster again golem in the gears okay snortimer grundy said go where you have a mind and lets see if its the ivory tower i have no idea where to go either snortimer pro tested grundy could understand him perfectly but the others could not speak the language so couldnt partic ipate isnt that great grundy exclaimed four of us hereand not one of us has any notion how to proceed perhaps we should ask someone then bink sug gested mildly who would possibly know grundy demanded dis piritedly the female gap dragon chester suggested at least she has a motive to find stanley but she would gobble us up in a moment grundy protested not if you presented our case clearly bink said im sure it will work out the man was certainly a fool but chester agreed with him and grundy was dependent on them to carry the bed he had no choice i guess thats what well do then he agreed reluctantly first lets get a good nights sleep bink said well have some heavy traveling coming up but we have to travel by night grundy protested thats true bink agreed i had forgotten well lets get a good night and days sleep and be fresh for tomor row night grundy chafed at the delay then he remembered stella steamer the lady gap dragon and decided that delay was no bad thing what a bad beginning for this quest grundy worried that someone from castle roogna would discover them as they were not very far from it golem in the gears but still their luck held that was gratifying of course yet still he felt out of sorts this was supposed to be his quest but the others seemed to be running things pretty much their way he was still just a golem the least con sequential of creatures the following evening wellrested they started off grundy rode snortimer and had to admit that the monster got around quite well the only problem was the wan moonlight snortimer would not venture into even that dim illumination and plowed through the densest brush to avoid it since the magic path tended to be open quite a lot of it was moonlighted so grundy spent half his time off the path however snortimers big hairy hands grasped the brush with sure grips and seemed unbothered by even the thickest tangles and soon grundy stopped being con cerned after an hour or so they came to a surprise a detour a dark sign blocked the path grundy approached it until he was able to make out the print even in the shadow it said construction dtails shopping centaur thats odd bink remarked i hadnt heard about work on the magic paths well we might as well go leam the details chester said they seem to be at a good place he was a centaur naturally he saw nothing odd about the location but grundy didnt like this they took the indicated side trail they had been pro ceeding north toward the gap chasm the detour took them east the path seemed all right but grundy remained uneasy he had never heard of a magic path being closed off for construction gdem hi the gears soon they came to the shopping centaur this turned out to be not a place but a creature a lady centaur carrying a huge shopping bag she carried a lamp which made snortimer scurry to cover in the shadow offtrail so that grundy did not hear her dialogue with bink and chester in a moment she continued on her way and grundy was able to rejoin the others she says the tails belong to the bulls and bears and to be careful bink said the bulls always go up while the bears go down and it can get violent what are bulls and bears grundy asked mundane animals some must have strayed bink evidently wasnt worried they moved on the detour continued roughly east evincing no intention of turning north grundys discom fort increased he wasnt eager to encounter the gap dragoness but this eastward drift was only wasting time and effort as the first wan light of dawn threatened ahead of them snortimer got nervous and they had to make camp they found an open field and chester pitched the bed there and the bed monster scooted under it just before the light brightened chester and bink went foraging for food grundy tired simply lay down on the bed and slept that aspect was very convenient he would always have a comfortable place to retire grundy woke abruptly the sun was shining down slantingly and creatures were all around him at first he thought bink and chester had returned but this was not the case instead a herd of huge fourfooted hooved crea tures were milling around the bed they seemed to be heedless of the beds presence and grundy was afraid golem in the gears they would knock it over and thus expose snortimers retreat to the direct sunshine that would be disaster hey he cried watch where youre going still they ignored him pressing heedlessly closer each creature had a shaggy coat and two stout horns on its head one of them pressed in close to the bed almost brushing it whats up anyway grundy demanded standing on the bed up several nearby creatures swung their heads for the first time taking note of him they crowded in closer or down grundy cried what are you down several creatures cried horrified a kind of stampede developed momentarily abating the press of bodies about the bed but this turned out to be no improvement for now a new kind of creature showed up this was a hairy mus cular entity who lacked horns but had large teeth several of these surged toward the bed who are you grundy cried newly alarmed we are the bulls the homed creatures lowed we are the bears the toothed ones growled now grundy remembered the creatures the tails belonged to who aways went up or down he didnt like eitherbut he was stuck in their midst a bear scraped by the bed shoving it to one side grundy tumbled almost falling off hey watch it he yelled grabbing on to the bar at the foot of it but the bears ignored him as detenninedly as the bulls had down down they growled and indeed they seemed to be traveling downward for the field was tilted grundy realized that this situation was beyond him where were bink and chester he had to get the bed out of the field before these animals overturned it and he golem in the gears golem in the gears couldnt do that by himself but there was no sign of his friends more bears surged down gaining momentum the bulls were almost out of sight grundy knew he couldnt affect these blindly charging creatures physically but remem bered that he had made a slight impression with his words they seemed to be very sensitive to references about direction up down he yelled the nearest bears hesitated falling back for a moment but then they resumed their charge and the bed bumped across the field as their heedless imperative jostled it it started to tip over then plumped back he heard a whim per from snortimer underneath naturally the monster was terrified east west grundy yelled but this had no discern ible impression north south the charge continued the bed moved some more and a leg hung up in a hole again it started to tilt were in trouble grundy cried a passing bear paused whos in trouble it demanded this beds in trouble grundy replied if youd just stop shoving oh the bear said disappointed it lost interest and resumed its downward charge thanks a lot hairsnout grundy screamed after it may a green hornet buzz up your up another bear asked dismayed whats going up my blood pressure grundy retorted whats with you beasts but this bear like the other had lost interest and re sumed its charge so words had some effect but not a reliable one maybe he would do better yelling randomly pink moons in the lake he called it seemed to work what stock the nearest passing bear asked purple comets in the soup grundy responded more bears paused that sounds bad another said its terrible grundy agreed pleased with his prog ress but at that they all took off running faster than before threatening to sweep the bed right down out of the field and to flip it over several times on the way red planets taking a bath he screamed the charge slowed sell red planet a bear growled then the motion resumed consolidated nonesuch is going nowhere grundy cried yes yes the bears agreed and accelerated you stupes grundy raged just where do you think nowhere is bad news bad news the bears cried and pressed on grundy tried again amalgamated parrotox is buying out conpewter that nonsense should make them take notice it did thats bullish for conpewter a bear groaned buy pewter a bull lowed and now there was a resurgence among the bulls its a crock a bear protested but the tide had turned the bulls surged back on the strength of the pewter con the bears retreated in confusion the conpewter age had arrived this was too much success the charge of the bulls was just as dangerous as that of the bears the bed was getting rocked golem in the gear kissimmee river is telling grundy screamed telling a bull snorted dismayed thats not sup posed to happen well it is grundy said evidently the notion of anything telling dismayed the bulls they milled about uncertainly and the bears began to reform their formation this did little good for the bed though it got nudged right up against a tree yo a voice came faintly grundy grundy looked there was bink riding chester they were back over here he cried by the tree but the field was filled with milling bulls and bears and it was obvious that chester would have difficulty getting through a bull crashed against the bed and the bed slammed into the trunk of the tree and a fruit plopped into the center of the bed just missing grundy the fruit was as big as he was and shaped like a giant light bulb it would have flattened him had it caught him watch what youre dropping grundy yelled at the tree its your fault the tree retorted in plant language you stirred up the stockyard who are you to blame anything on me grundy demanded belligerently i am a power plant the tree replied proudly suddenly grundy saw a solution to his problem give me a bite of that he said pouncing on the fruit it had split slightly from the impact of the fall had it not landed on the bed it would have broken right apart grundy snatched out a juicy seed and chewed on it in a moment he felt its effect power rippled through him he did not become larger or more muscular he merely developed a lot more strength in what he had goiuiii in tho good that was of course the nature of the fruit of the power plant it made the eater strong for a little while grundy took advantage of the moment he jumped down to the ground and took hold of a leg of the bed were getting out of here he told snortimer who was huddled under the center shaking with fear just stay centered so the light doesnt touch you then he hauled on the leg the bed moved he strode forward hauling the bed along he moved it around the tree and on into the forest out of the press of bulls and bears by the time the strength lent by the power plant abated he had brought the bed to safety in a thicker part of the forest bink and chester rejoined him we feasted on loquats middlequats and highquats bink explained when we started back we encountered traveling nickelpedes and had to skirt widely around them then we heard a com motion in the field but we couldnt get to it quickly we were trapped amid rampaging bulls and bears grundy exclaimed those are the craziest animals i ever saw all they do is charge up and down up and down luckily i found a power plant at the last minute yes a fortunate coincidence bink agreed smiling obscurely grundy wondered what he was thinking of but wasnt in a mood to inquire lets get some sleep chester said gruffly he lay down letting his head and shoulders rest on a hummock it was strange to see a centaur in that position but of course chester was no longer as young as he once had been and had to rest in whatever fashion was best for him bink settled down against a tree shouldnt we post a guard grundy asked not necessary bink said and closed his eyes golem in the gears how could the man be so sure of that they werent that far from the stockyard where the animals ranged after all suppose a stray bull or bear crashed through here but grundy was quite tired in the aftermath of his exercise with the power plant strength one problem with that sort of thing was that there was a corresponding period of weakness to make up for the temporary power he flopped on the bed and slept binks optimism seemed valid for they rested undis turbed until nightfall then they roused ate some quats that chester had saved from breakfast and resumed their travel as they wended along the path which still bore deter minedly east they found themselves entering a more equine region there were horseflies sleeping on the trunks of horse chestnuts and night mares seemed to prowl they came to a fork in the path they paused uncer tain which one to take as neither went north while they hesitated two actual horses showed up horses were very rare in xanth being mainly mundane in their original form but of course if bulls and bears could stray here so could horses say you horses grundy called we want to get back to the magic path going north which trail should we take the horses paused one in each fork gee neighed the one at the right haw neighed the one on the left then they galloped on down their respective paths theyre just horsing around bink said philosophi cally i suppose wed better gamble on the more north erly path that was a decision grundy himself should have made the golem thought troubled but who paid attention to golem in the gears him even on his own quest they took the more north erly trail in due course they came upon a woman and a small equine creature the woman had a little notebook in which she was busily making notes by the light of the moon she looked up startled as they approached and who are you she inquired her pencil poised i am grundy golem on a quest grundy said impor tantly from just outside the beam of moonlight these are chester centaur bink and snortimer who are you snortimer she asked i dont see that one hes the monster under the bed most adults cant see him its your turn to answer toots how interesting she said the monster under the bed i thought those were just fantasies look cutiepie grundy said sneeringly are you going to answer a simple question or have you forgotten your name oh yes she said finishing her note im emjay and this is my ass i can see whereoh you mean that animal hes no common animal she said indignantly hes mike my righthand ass and he helps me a lot grundy studied the shaggy beast helps you with what helps me make my notes i couldnt get the job done without him what are you making notes about about everything in xanth for my lexicon what good is that well i hope it will be useful for those who want to know about anything in a hurry like who golem in the gears that seemed to stump her well somebody must be interested in xanth the only one i can think of is good magician hum frey and he already knows everything he wants to maybe the mundanes she said uncertainly mundanes what do they know very little she said thats why they need a lex icon female logic grundy said disparagingly now get out of our way so we can get where were going emjay looked a little annoyed for some reason but she rallied you said you were going on a quest what quest what business is it of yours i want to list it in the lexicon of course grundy considered probably there was no harm in telling her im going to the ivory tower to rescue stan ley steamer oh the little dragon she exclaimed checking the entry in her notes may i come along listen sister grundy said angrily this is my quest not yours i dont need any strange woman and her ass messing it up you are a diplomatic one arent you she exclaimed what makes you think i would mess up your precious quest youre a woman grundy reminded her of course youd mess it up she looked as if she wanted to argue but thought the better of it well suppose we tag along a little way and if we mess anything up then well leave you alone grudgingly grundy agreed bink and chester both married to women had maintained a remarkable silence they resumed their trek with emjay and ass falling golem in the gears in behind they made respectable progress for a couple of hoursuntil they encountered another woman this one was young and sultry well now she breathed what have we here we dont need another woman grundy snapped i am not exactly a woman the new one murmured you sure look like a woman what are you thena monster in my fashion she agreed i am a succubus on the prowl for business uhoh chester said we arent your business bink said firmly are you sure she asked archly she shimmered and suddenly she looked exactly like binks wife chameleon in her prettiest phase were sure chester said the succubus shimmered again and there stood ches ters mate cherie in her most fetching pose i do a lot of business with married males she said not with these ones grundy said go away you slut maybe ill just tag along a while the succubus said in case someone changes his mind she was magical they couldnt do anything about her but grundy had another irritation the succubus had tried to tempt both bink and chester but hadnt even bothered with grundy himself that showed how he rated of course he would have told her to go awaybut he felt insulted that she hadnt tried not eventhe most corrupt creature thought him worth noticing succubus emjay murmured making a note chester nudged bink were okay for nowbut what about when we sleep thats when a creature like that gets you golem in the gears golem in the gears there wont be any problem bink said no problem there would be an awful row when the wives heard about it grundy knew but as dawn loomed and they set about making camp for the day the solution to the problem of the succubus appeared oh i cant face the light she exclaimed and hurried away the fact that they were now sleeping by day gave them security from this threat had bink known or was it just a lucky break chapter conpewter in the evening the succubus was gone but emjay and her ass remained grundy muttered something about half a loaf being better than none and mounted snortimer maybe if they moved along rapidly theyd leave the lex icographers behind the path wended its idle way along teasing them now north now east they paused in alarm as a huge shape passed overhead but it was no dragon only a big house fly the thing had disproportionately small wings and an unstreamlined roof so that its flight was erratic it seemed about to crash at any moment but somehow it humbled on they paused to pluck some succulent fruit to eat until emjays ass brayed whatre you talking about you asinine creature grundy asked it well if you want to eat passion fruit the ass replied in braytalk passion fruit grundy asked dismayed sure the ass brayed we lexed that yesterday thats why the succubus hangs out here once a man chomps into that fruit they decided to pass the fruit by grundy heard a muffled curse from the side and realized that the suc cubus had been watching from hiding he was tempted to make an obscene gesture in her direction but knew shed take it as a compliment they found some innocent breadfruits and a fresh bab bling brook further along so were able to eat and drink safely the brook talked incessantly of course but that was the nature of its kind actually it had quite a bit of gossip to babble about the nefarious doings of the local creatures that grundy found interesting then abruptly the brook went silent grundy looked at it in surprise whats the matter wetback thethe giant the brook babbled briefly then froze up a thin film of ice formed on its surface it was stiff with fright grundy looked around giant i dont see any giant bink and chester and the ass all peered about nothing was visible that brooks got water on the brain the centaur muttered theres no giant around here then they heard a distant crash as of a boulder smash ing through brush and felt the ground shudder stray fruits and nuts were jostled from trees after a pause there was another crash slightly louder with more insis tent shuddering golem in the gears thats either a remarkable coincidencetwo boul ders falling out of nowhere bink began there was a third crash and shudder louder yet or the footfalls of a giant chester finished another crash and the brook saw it first because it flows in that direction grundy added its coming this way emjay said alarmed chester shaded his eyes with his hand peering in that direction i may be getting older but my eyesight shouldnt be that bad i dont see any giant they all looked the crashing footfalls continued get ting closer but none of them could see any giant this is crazy grundy said theres got to be something there then on a hill visible some distance away they saw the brush and small trees crunch down as if pressed by an invisible foot the sound came again do you know bink said i remember long ago when magician trent and i fought the wiggles and ches ters uncle herman gave his life uncle herman chester exclaimed respectfully the creatures came from all around bink continued large and small natural friends and natural enemies all united in that effort of extermination it happened again grundy said when little ivy spied another wiggle nest five years ago and one of the creatures was an invisible gianta big big man we couldnt see him at all but we could hear him and ah smell him he was a hero too he gave his life invisible giant emjay said making a note grundy caught on could he have left an offspring it seems likely most creatures do of course it would golem in the gears have taken several decades for a creature to grow that large and now it is several decades later chester said as the approaching crashings almost drowned him out are those giants friendly does it matter bink asked we cant see him and he probably doesnt see us but if he steps on us now they smelled the giant the odor was appalling i guess no lakes big enough for him to take a bath in grundy said wrinkling his nose i dont know about you folk the ass brayed but im getting my tail out of here he galloped off wait for me you coward emjay cried running after him there was yet another crash closer yet sounds like good advice bink said pile on chester said i can move faster than you can bink jumped on the bed strapped to the centaurs back and grundy scrambled onto snortimer the centaur was already in motion he galloped down the path in the oppo site direction to that taken by emjay and ass for which grundy blessed him but the terrible footfalls continued to come closer it seemed that the invisible giant was going the same way they were maybe the centaur hadnt been so smart after all being free of pesky company wouldnt be all that satisfying if they got squished flat under the heedless foot of the giant chester put on more speed as he encountered a straightaway and for a while seemed to be drawing ahead then the path curved again and he had to slow to make the turns and the giants feet crashed closer yet grundy saw that they couldnt take off to the side because the golem in the gears jungle here was impenetrable they could be squished by the edge of a foot before they got far enough away then grundy spied a cave look there he yelled in chesters ear maybe he wont step on a mountain chester saw the cave and veered to enter it as he did the trees immediately behind them bent down and snapped like twigs and the ground shook with force like that of a quake for an instant the centaurs hooves left the ground then he landed and charged at full velocity into the cave there was light inside perceiving that snortimer made a desperate leap to the safety of the shadow under the bed on the centaurs back grundy had to let go and catch hold of chesters human torso the light was not nec essarily a good sign because that suggested that it was inhabited and creatures like ogres and dragons were par tial to caves but the ground quaked again and rocks plunged down from the ceiling a stalactite speared past chesters nose they werent safe yet the cave tunnel led directly into the mountain and it was wide and straight chester made excellent progress despite his burden the crashing fell behind they had gotten far enough inside to be out of range of the heedless giant or perhaps the giant had simply passed by the moun tain proceeding to whatever mission moved him chester slowed to a trot then a walk and finally a standstill they were in a large bright cave whose walls were smooth and polished before them stood a metallic box with a series of buttons at the front and a pane of glass at the top greetings the pane of glass printed bink and grundy dismounted and greetings to you you rusty box grundy said facetiously your voice sounds familiar the screen printed what is your identity golem in the geors it communicates grundy exclaimed surprised usually the inanimate communicated only in the presence of king dor whose magic talent stimulated it grundy could talk to anything alive but this was obviously not alive answer the question the screen printed im grundy golem grundy snapped and who are you printface grundy golem the screen printed the one who stated that amalgamated paradox was buying out compewter yeah i guess so whats it to you metalbrain that was a libel as such it is actionable i dont like this chester murmured this thing is eerie what are you talking about glassyeye grundy demanded i am compewter i will accept your retraction and apology now apology grundy exclaimed indignantly why should i apologize to a grouchy metal box with a glass top for making up a nonsense sentence to distract the bulls and bears because you libeled me the screen printed no one has bought me out uh grundy bink murmured it might be better to but the golems dander was up you simple sheet shut your print before i break your face and he made as if to kick at the glass print flowed very rapidly across the screen golem lifts foot slips on grease spot lands on posterior grundys nonkicking foot slipped on a grease spot golem in the gears and skidded out from under him and he landed hard on his bottom youch he exclaimed what happened i revised the script the screen printed grundy climbed to his feet rubbing his rear the jolt of falling had cleared his head on one detail he now remembered that he had said conpewter not com pewter so he had been talking about something else and had not insulted this thing but his ire had been aroused and he was not about to tell it that i think youre a lying hunk of metal he exclaimed obnoxious oolem suffers temporary mouthful of soap the screen printed suddenly grundys mouth was full of foultasting sub stance hwash hth helth he spluttered trying to spit it out bink had a flask of water he held this carefully so that grundy could slurp from it and rinse out his mouth the flask was about as tall as grundy himself the difference between his physical stature and that of normal human beings became more obvious at times like this meanwhile the screen blithely printed rr is not hell as you so quaintly put it but simple justice simple justice grundy exclaimed as he got his mouth clear you metallic claptrap ixnay bink murmured again but again he was too late the machine had heard poulmouthed golem trips over own flat feet and falls in mud puddle the screen printed and grundy tripped and splatted into a puddle of mud that he was sure hadnt been there a moment before that thing is changing reality chester exclaimed everything it prints happens are you ready to apologize woodhead the screen inquired as grundy hauled himself out of the puddle oolem in the gear grundy i really think it would be better to bink began apologize grundy demanded furiously to a tin box with a dirty screen what do you think i am i think you are a loudmouthed swellheaded selfimportant ignorant excuse for a facsimile of a living creature the screen printed apt description chester muttered thinking grundy would not overhear unfortunately grundy did overhear his rage magni fied and youre a glasseyed buttonnosed excuse for dead garbage he yelled at the screen if you were alive id challenge you to to what the screen demanded grundy i think wed better not aggravate bink murmured grundy had broken off because he had been unable to think of anything horrendous enough binks attempt to caution him only gave him evil inspiration to prove youre smarter than i amjunkforbrains he cried you just sit there doing nothing trying to mess up those of us who have something important to do how great does that make you that is an interesting challenge the screen said let me consider it and the screen dimmed while the word considering appeared faintly the golem didnt mean it bink said quickly we dont need to challenge you we came in here by acci dent the screen brightened you came in here because the invisible giant herded you here it printed at the top of the screen the word considering remained in smaller print evidently it was able to converse while con sidering golem in the gears now bink was interested you wanted us to come here what are you that is not important the compewter printed why certainly it is bink persisted if we are to engage in a challenge with you we have a right to know what you are and how you operate that does not calculate the screen protested yes it does bink said we may have no quarrel with you at all we have to know you better to ascertain this the screen blinked evidently it was having trouble concentrating on binks point while also considering grundys challenge its metallic mind was divided and therefore less efficient bink evidently understood this and was taking advantage of it grundy realized this and decided that it was better to leave this in binks hands the old man was not entirely stupid exactly how did you manage to get us here if you cant leave this cave bink asked the screen hesitated then printed i arranged to place a dtour illusion on the enchanted path to divert travelers here once securely committed to dtour they were to be herded here by the invis ible giant grundy slapped his forehead with the heel of a hand they had fallen for an illusion there was no true detour and why did you want to bring travelers here bink asked again the screen hesitated as if the machine did not really want to answer but remained confused by the split thinking effort i am confined to this airconditioned cave it gets boring it is interesting to play with independent entities so there was the motive the pewter was looking for golem in the gears entertainment and they were it that pleased grundy no more than the rest of the situation did you cant act directly beyond this cave bink asked again the hesitation i can not i have no power of personal motion and the external extremes of temperature and humidity would damage my cir cuits i must act through others outside but inside this cave you control reality bink asked i can rewrite the script here it agreed how did you come to have such fantastic power bink asked i was made by the muses of parnassus to assist their work the screen printed reluctantly then why are you not with the muses they misdesigned me they wished to record real ity not remake it so they filed me out of the way in case they should ever need me again so here was this powerful bored pewter locked in this isolated cave trying to entertain itself grundy would have felt sorry for it if he werent already so mad at it he was caked with mud and his mouth still tasted of soap so your concern is not really with a stray remark grundy may have made among the bulls and bink was saying when the screen changed consideration completed it printed challenge accepted here are the terms hey wait grundy protested no longer eager to con test with a device that could change reality simply by printing it on its screen had he known more about the pewter he would have been more careful about his lan guage i change my mind the contest will occur in this cave the screen continued the four living entities vs the dead en goiem in the gears golem in the gear tity the four will attempt to leave the cave suc cess will bring freedom failure will bring eternal confinement here all four of them started snortimer remained hiding under the bed on chesters back but the bed shuddered with his reaction eternal confinement now we didnt agree to that bink said man protests but then remembers that he did agree the screen printed now i remember bink said we did agree excellent the screen printed the contest com mences immediately bink and chester and grundy exchanged glances they had been trapped by the pewters revision of reality if any of them tried to protest again the machine would simply revise the situation to make them conform to its script its attention was no longer divided it was now in command but were not clear on the rules bink protested simply state the screen printed then give your interpretation then state turns will alternate enter whatv grundy demanded you may have the first turn the screen printed then went blank the machine had told them all it was going to i think i understand bink said we shall take turns establishing our versions of reality whichever version proves to be more compelling will prevail its a contest of wits if we are to escape we must prove we are smarter than pewter is if we arent smart enough to escape than it will have proved itself to be smarter than we are but we had better establish some rules of procedure so we dont mess ourselves up rules of procedure chester asked perplexed we cant all enter statements at once we would be working against each other we need to be united i think the machine will play fair we just have to maintain our discipline and make our best choices i remember once long ago when i was down in the cave of thebut never mind we should choose one of our number to make the entries but that machine can be tearing us up while we dis cuss it among ourselves chester pointed out i dont think so machines dont have the same aware ness of time that living creatures do until we make an entry it will simply wait and until we execute nothing will happen who makes the entries grundy asked suspiciously why the leader of the party of course and who is that grundy was annoyed all over again because obviously bink had preempted his quest i should think that would be the one who is on quest bink said but thats we grundy said why so it is then you should make the entries grundy could hardly believe it what will the rest of you do we shall discuss the choices and offer advice bink said he turned to chester dont you agree chester looked uncertain but went along with his friend i guess so suddenly grundy liked bink much better okay whats your advice i think we need to devise a strategy of escape perhaps we can have a door open in the wall that leads outside great grundy exclaimed he faced the screen golem in the gears enter a door to the outside opens in the cave wall execute immediately a door opened where there had been none before could it really be that easy grundy took a step toward it but now print appeared on the screen unfortu nately the exit is guarded by ferocious lifeeating plants it showed grundy stopped still now the passage was wreathed by horrendous green plants that had large cupshaped leaves that drooled bright sap tendrils cast about as if seeking something to clutch some of the leafcups seemed to have teeth i dont think we want to walk there chester said shuddering i wish we had some agent orange grundy mut tered that would wilt those plants right off the wall why not bink asked all you have to do is enter it so he did grundy faced the screen again enter we find agent orange before us execute agent orange appeared before them but agent orange has the same effect on animals as on plants the screen printed can that be true chester asked concerned if we use it on those plants and then walk through well be destroying ourselves if it wasnt true before it is now bink said it seems that neither side can reverse the reality of the other but can modify what the other has we dont dare use agent orange now grundy agreed he wasnt sure what counted as ani mals but it certainly included snortimer and probably chester and grundy himself and might even include bink golem in the gem well have to try a new ploy he decided one that cant be reversed like that when i was in mundania bink said thoughtfully i found that in some regions they required a document to let a person travel it was called a passport i wonder whether that would work here how does it work grundy asked its a little book and you write in it where youre going and they check it to make sure you really go there that wouldnt work quite the same in xanth chester remarked no it wouldnt bink agreed grundy thought about that obviously a device to facil itate going somewhere would do it magically in xanth and unmagically in mundania if they had a magic book that conducted them outside enter he told the screen the travelers find four passports one for each of them four small books appeared bink picked them up and passed them around grundy could hardly hold his as it weighed half as much as he did bink carefully wrote in his gap chasm the others followed his example since no destination had been spo ken they hoped the pewter wouldnt catch on then they saw the print on the screen red tape pre vents the use of the passports now they saw the red tape festoons of it were floating down from the ceiling streamers settled about them and soon they were buried in the stuff it didnt hurt them it merely entangled them so that they could hardly move it was difficult even to see their passports because of the crisscrossing strands of ribbon evidently pewter has learned something about mun dania bink muttered disgruntled golem in the gears they struggled to free themselves of the tape the stuff tore readily but by the time they got it all clear the pass ports had been lost in the shuffle lets find another passage out chester said one too broad to be blocked by plants enter grundy said they find a broad clean pas sage clear of plants and all other barriers execute the passage manifested on the other side of course this one led further into the mountain but it was broad and nice but the screen printed they hear an awful roar and realize that a firebreathing dragon is coming down it the ensuing roar was indeed awful we cant go up that passage grundy said unless we find a way to deal with the dragon bulk pointed out what would scare off a dragon grundy asked a basilisk chester said good idea enter grundy said a basilisk walks up the passage toward the dragon glaring about exe cute the little reptile appeared the direct glare of a basilisk could kill another creature even a dragon but the basilisk changes its mind and starts back toward the group the screen said oopsy grundy breathed enter the basilisk remembers where it was going and heads back up the passage tuning out all distractions execute the others relaxed as the nasty little reptile resumed its progress surely pewter couldnt change that as it rounds the first turn the screen printed it encounters a mirror and stares itself in the pace golem in the gears naturally when that happened the little monster fell dead for no basilisk was proof against its own fatal stare nevertheless bink murmured we now have the initiative because we retain the tunnel there was another roar and the tunnel retains the dragon chester said touching his bow nervously ah but we also have the mirror bink pointed out pick it up turn it around and it will confound the dragon the same way it confounded the basilisk we can try it certainly grundy agreed enter the centaur picks up the mirror turns it about and proceeds up the tunnel when the dragon sees its reflection in the mirror it will think that is another dragon and will back off they watched the screen to see whether they had finally foiled the machine they had not there is the sound of rushing water the screen printed a river is draining into the passage and will wash everything out before it they werent getting anywhere every time they made a move pewter countered it yet bink seemed positive you know he said conversationally they have some worse monsters in mundania than in xanth some of the birds especially we have ogres and ogresses and drag ons and dragonesses and the like but i remember one there called the egret that had a long yellow beak if we could get one of those on our side what good would that do grundy asked the machine would just counter we need to get out of here not play with birds i suppose so bink agreed and you never can tell what those birds will do the female of the species is twice as bad as the male if we ever encountered a female egret wed be lost golem in the gears golem in the gears what was he getting at of course they wouldnt sum mon a female egret lets just try to open another door outone that cant be blocked by plants or dragons or water grundy said yes i suppose thats best bink agreed lets pro tect it against plants and dragons and water and egrets chester put in and egrets bink agreed enter grundy said they discover a new passage with no bad plants no dragons no water and no egrets it leads straight outside execute the new passage appeared it looked perfect but the screen was ready and there it printed dra matically is an egress and a big bird with a swordlike yellow beak appeared it took one menacing step toward them oops grundy said dismayed i forgot to exclude the female of the species but the female is not an egress bink said smugly pewter just assumed that applying logic to the name an egress is actually a form of exit a form of exit grundy asked but theres the bird egrets male or female are harmless bink said we wont take our turn to abolish it all we have to do is walk out of the true egress and he led the way the pewter was helpless for it could not act until they made another entry and gave it its turn they simply marched physically out the egress ignoring the bird a roll of confused symbols crossed the screen t t wh then it got its mechanism straight curses the screen printed foiled again they had escapedbut somehow grundy wasnt com pletely satisfied bink had found the way out bink was the true hero of this episode he grundy had failed again he remained a nonentity he had suffered almost as bad a setback as pewter had chapter mystery of the voles they camped for the day in the thick of the jun gle bink still seemed unconcerned about predators and felt no need for a watch for the night grundy was glad not to have to stay awake but felt obliged to grouch about it anyway what makes you so sure theres no danger he demanded we almost got stuck forever in that cave no we didnt bink said we got out readily enough that was a lucky break if compewter hadnt gotten confused about the female egret there would have been something else we would have gotten out one way or another unharmed mean while we had an interesting experience and learned some thing about another entity of xanth i think that was worthwhile grundy shook his head bemused bink seemed to be living in a fools paradise trusting to coincidence to rescue him from his own folly it was true that the man did seem to have phenomenal luck but luck could turn at any time it might be best not to associate with him longer than he golem in the gears golem in the gears had to because eventually they were bound to find them selves in a situation they could not escape but he needed bink and chester to carry the bed grundy was not happy with the present arrangement for several reasons but he was unable to change it he sighed and slept at night they ate and headed north they had lost the path perhaps it had not gone beyond the compewters mountain anyway as the machine had set it up to bring in entertaining people they didnt want to retrace their steps not only would that waste an extra day or more it would take them through the stockyard of the bulls and bears and the haunt of the succubus and the invisible giant they might even encounter emjay and ass again once was enough for all of those so they plowed through the dense vegetation going toward the gap chasm which they were sure could not be far distant the geography of xanth seemed to change every time a person went out in it like the good magi cians castle but the gap was eternal it sliced across xanth separating it into northern and southern halves and now that the remnants of the forgetspell on it had finally dissipated many folk remembered where it was of course there were still pockets of forget here and there and probably some of the mysteries associated with the gap would never be unraveled but certainly they would find the gap if they just kept going north chester paused listening now grundy heard itan ominous rattle as of a poisonous snake or a ghost trou ble friend snortimer said in monster language youre sure grundy asked i recognize the rattle its one of ivys friends well if youre sure snortimer took off at a lope his hands drawing him rapidly along through the brush grundy had to admit that in this terrain the bed monster was better than any con ventional steed would have been for bink and chester were quickly left behind soon they burst upona horse a rather shaggy stal lion with several bands of chain around his barrel these were what rattled thats pook the ghost horse snor timer said naturally snortimer could not speak the equine lan guage and the ghost horse did not understand bed monster language that was grundys talent it had been some time since he had seen pook so he might not have rec ognized him without snortimers assistance pook i pre sume he inquired of the horse oh i wanted to scare you pook complained i cant be scared right now grundy explained im on a quest a quest i havent been on one of those for centuries not since jordan the barbarian tamed me jordan is he here no it wasnt safe for threnody to be too close to castle roogna you know because of the curse so they moved away but we stayed halfway near because puck likes to visit ivy puck was the foal of pook and peek they were a family of ghost horses and the foal had remained young for centuries because ghosts changed slowly since grundy liked the pook family better than he liked jordan and threnody he was satisfied with this encounter were heading for the gap how far do we have to go not far pook said but the route is devious there are several hungry dragons and a monster or two in the way golem in the gears golem in the gears we dont have forever grundy said is there a good fast way there that avoids the hazards sure we can lead you through it if you like that was exactly what grundy would like thanks now peek and puck showed up peek was a beautiful shaggy mare with similar chains and puck was a frolic some young creature whose chains threatened to fly loose when he leaped they peered curiously at snortimer for though they knew what he was they had never actually seen him before it was unusual for bed monsters to stray far from their beds bink and chester crashed up to join them there were introductions then the ghost horses showed the route it was as if a path appeared where none had existed before suddenly it was much easier to penetrate the wil derness though their route was now quite curvacious nobody complained because everyone knew that this was necessary to avoid the lurking dragons and monsters actually it had been a lucky thing to encounter pook this help would save them a great deal of time and trouble grundy knew that bink took such luck for granted but certainly it was with them at the moment as dawn neared the terrain grew rougher there were numerous crevices in the ground near the gap chasm as if fragmented from it they decided to camp as they could not quite reach the gap before day the ghost horses could go abroad by night or day but preferred the night so they were satisfied puck trotted about locating fruits and nuts and water chester who had the appetite of a horse really appreciated that snortimer disappeared under his bed but the others remained up for a while talking grundy was happy to translate it made him feel important do you really want to go to the gap pook asked or do you need to cross it neither grundy explained were going down into it to meet the gap dragoness oh then you dont need to go to the brink i know of a tunnel that leads down into it jordan and i used it to get out four hundred years ago and im sure its still there great grundy exclaimed and translated for bink and chester who made the tunnel bink inquired interested we dont know its just there just there perhaps that was enough of an answer for a horse but grundy was unsatisfied someone had to have made that tunnel and now he was quite curious who after the experience with the path leading to the compewter cave grundy was more cautious about sim ply using what was there if the tunnel had been there for centuries probably it was safe but if it connected to corn pewters cave i think we ought to find out more about this tunnel before we commit ourselves all the way to it chester said its a long way down to the bottom of the gap chasm and if anything happened my thought exactly grundy agreed lets find out who made it then we can use it some things wait for a long time to catch the unwary they slept at night the ghost horses showed them to the tunnel it opened from the base of a small northsouth chasm as if it had been there before the chasm opened sure enough when they explored the opposite side of the cleft there hidden under a fall of debris was another tunnel the evident continuation of the other since the golem in the gem first tunnel proceeded down into the gap this other must go elsewhere and should be safer to explore grundy took charge lets send one party down into it while another watches from outside he said maybe we can call back and forth and trace it from the surface grundy rode snortimer into the tunnel while bink and chester stayed outside little puck followed grundy in planning to act as liaison between the two parties since the three of them were of small size it was easier for them to explore without disturbing anything there was a little fungus glow on the walls puck and snortimer didnt need it but that wan light helped grundy a great deal the tunnel wound along like a worm remaining approximately level which meant that the surface of the ground was not too far above but their hope of main taining voice contact was vain nothing could be heard puck could have returned to inform his parents where grundy was but that would have meant a long trot and he might have trouble finding grundy when he came back nothing was working out quite as planned they came to a fork in the tunnel grundy took the one to the right as it was slightly larger and cleaner but soon there was another fork and another in fact a lab yrinth was developing grundy was worried about getting lost but snortimer assured him that he could retrace his course anytime then there was a rumble and suddenly part of the tunnel collapsed behind them snortimer leaped forward avoiding the stones and sliding dirt and puck practically sailed ahead apparently their passage had shaken the old structure enough to start the shakedown they were unharmedbut now their return route was golem in the gear blocked snortimer might be good at retracing his route but he could no longer do that they could be in trouble grundy urged his steed on trusting that he would be able to find a way back around the blocked passage they had passed so many intersections that there had to be a connection meanwhile he wanted to finish the job he had come to do and get out of here before anything else happened the labyrinth of passages began to assume a form this seemed to be a series of concentric circles with the inner circles larger than the outer ones as if closer to the center of things whatever there was that was worth finding would surely be found in that center there was another shudder and they heard more stones falling to the side this time it couldnt be the fault of the three of them they had been stepping very lightly was something else causing it they went on more nervously grundy had never been bothered by tunnels or tight squeezes his size and agility had always enabled him to get clear now he was begin ning to be bothered it was obvious that neither snortimer nor puck felt any more at ease than he did the going got easier as the tunnels became larger these ones were in better repair their walls were turning smooth and their floors were firmer the fungus glow brightened snortimer began to grow nervous not liking the light but did not actually balk probably this glow would seem like deepest darkness in daylight so the monster was able to tolerate it finally the tunnels became so large and so close together that the spaces between them were more like walls then the walls disappeared and what remained was a fairsized chamber the center of the labyrinth golem in the gears in the very center of that chamber was a small ornate chest could it be a treasure excited now grundy went to it but what might be small to a man was large for him he was unable to lift its heavy lid let me do it snortimer said he reached forth with a huge hairy hand and grasped the lid hauling it off grundy grasped the edge hauled himself up and peered into the open chest he saw gleams of reflected light such as might come from jewels or glossy metal but couldnt quite make out what the objects were snortimer reached in and drew out a handful they seemed to be objects made of metalcurving spikes hollow inside grundy took one and found it heavy it was about a third his own length shaped like a very long thin drinking hom all of bright metal jewelry he asked neither snortimer nor puck could answer they had never seen anything quite like this well lets take one out with us grundy decided maybe one of the others will recognize it he was dis appointed that the chest had not contained treasure though he really had no use for treasure anyway it was mostly human beings and dragons who placed value on treasure so others tended to copy that attitude snortimer fastened one of the objects to pucks band of chains so that the little ghost horse could carry it back conveniently it was little enough as treasures went he was disappointed on another score here he had penetrated to the center of the labyrinth and unveiled its secretand found nothing worthwhile certainly no liv ing creatures had been here for centuries and there seemed to be no traps it was probably safe to use the other tunnel down into the gap chasm if it didnt collapse on them lets get out of here he said golem in the gears the others were happy to go they started backand heard another rumbling there was going to be another collapse suddenly grundy recognized a pattern chester those are his heavy footfalls he exclaimed hes trot ting around up there looking for usand knocking the stones down thats why tunnels keep collapsing that did indeed seem to be the reason chester slow down grundy calledbut when he raised his voice the sound echoed as if he were a giant and dirt sifted down from the ceiling of the chamber he could bring it down on himself silently they hurried back chesters erratic trotting continued to shake the chamber making them increas ingly nervous they reached the point of the first cavein now they had to figure a way around it intersecting their original tunnel on the other side that shouldnt be difficultbut grundy felt a tightening apprehension he guided snortimer to the left hoping to cut back right but though the passage soon forked neither fork bore back the way they wanted this was like the detour in the forest that had refused to return to the magic path the perversity of the inanimate if he had dors talent he could simply ask the passages where to go and they would answer for that matter he could have asked the metal thing what it was and solved the mystery but that of course was why dor was rated a magician and was now king his magic talent was more versatile than grun dys anyone could talk to living things if he knew how only dor could talk to the inanimate the tunnel forked again and again neither fork went where they wanted it to go grundy was about to turn golem in the gears back and try the other directionwhen there was another rumble and the passage behind them collapsed chester you hoofbrained horses rump grundy wailed impotently youre destroying us down here now they had to go on and none of them knew the best way through this maze they just had to keep going and guessing before long grundy knew they were lost the pas sages went on and on dividing and merging and there was no way to tell which way was out or whether any way remained open they were trapped grundy thought of something else to try maybe if we knock on the ceiling theyll hear us and can come in from the other side snortimer used one of his hairy hands to pick up a rock scrambled up the side and banged on the ceiling some pebbles were dislodged but there was no collapse he tapped in a pattern knockknock knockknock knockknock bang it worked the earth shuddered as the centaur trotted over orienting on the sound in fact it shuddered too much another collapse grundy screamed and they dived out of the way as the ceiling sagged and then fell they had almost brought disaster on themselves they choked on the clouds of dust in the air as the rocks settled they would never get out this way then sharpeyed puck saw something he neighed and started forward scrambling over the rocks watch out grundy cried youll bring another fall down on your head yo chester called you okay down there the collapse had opened up a new way out that was the night sky up there golem in the gears grundy mounted snortimer again and they scrambled nimbly up to the surface it was a tremendous relief to be free once he was far from the hole in the ground grundy described his adventure embellishing it only slightly and showed them the metal spike puck had brought out what do you think it is he asked neither bink nor chester had any idea not treasure certainly bink concluded more like a tool chester said but it has no han dle they decided to camp one more day then take the tunnel down into the gap obviously the tunnel repre sented no trap as long as they were careful not to trigger a collapse but as the day brightened grundy remained unsatis fied there were too many unanswered questions who or whathad made all those tunnels that network of passages surrounding the central chamber what had hap pened to those creatures why had they left a treasure chest full of hollow metal spikes he hated to remain in ignorance at last he got up and walked alone to the entrance of the tunnel to the gap he stood there and stared at it if only i knew who made you he exclaimed there was the rustle of leaves a giant ancient acom tree grew at the brink of the cleft some of its roots had been exposed but it had survived i can tell you that golem it rustled the tree it had to be many centuries old it had been here when the tunnel was new tell me grundy cried it was the voles the tree rustled the what golem in the gears goiem in the gears the voles human folk call them by other names but they havent appreciated the real voles what other names grundy asked perplexed wiggles and squiggles and diggles wiggles grundy exclaimed appalled are they swarming again of course not golem the tree rustled chuckling in its fashion but theyre related the wiggles are the smallest and worst and the diggles are the largest and best and in between are the squiggles theyre all related i know that barkface what about the voles the voles are the true name for that extensive family of tunnelers they were once more common than they are now you hardly see any of their family branches anymore but the greatest of them were the civilized voles bigger than the squiggles but just as tunnelsome it was here they had their main camp a thousand years ago i was just a sprout when they left but i remember they departed a thousand years ago grundy asked amazed give or take a century i lose track my memory rings arent what they used to be before the dominance of the goblins and harpies anyway the harpies and goblins havent been dominant since the days of king roogna just so the tree agreed these volesjust what were they like they were fairly bigbigger than the squiggles of today but smaller than the diggles big enough to make these tunnels centaursized then grundy said maybe a little smaller they didnt like to be crowded so they made their tunnels with some clearance its hard for me to judge because i was so much smaller then these volesthey were just big squiggles just tun neling everywhere they tunneled but they werent just squiggles the tree rustled they did things there underground they had conventions or something they made plansand then they went away where did they go that i dont know they just went leaving their tun nels behind so the tree really didnt know much but grundy tried again we found some sort of metal thing a chest full of them like hollow spikes only slightly curved do you know what those would be oh yes of course i saw those being used they are artificial claws what the voles dug so much they wore off their natural claws so they put on artificial ones made of metal very strong then they could dig twice as fast and not get as tired those claws were their most prized possession of course hollow claws put on over the natural ones like gauntlets that would greatly enhance the ability of a digging creature mystery solved but as grundy returned to the bed he realized that the greater mystery remained where had those voles gone and why it was evident that nothing had hurt them for there were no skeletons and there was no damage other than that done by chesters hooves they must have gone of their own volitiontheir own voleitionto some place of their choosing perhaps they were there today digging even better labyrinths but probably he would never know where or why it was a frustrating frustration chapter stella steamer in the evening they proceeded to the tunnel and entered it the ghost horses satisfied that all was well did not accompany them they preferred to graze on the surface again the dim illumination of the fungus helped them without bothering snortimer unduly it was almost as if the voles had had bed monsters in mind or maybe such fungus was part of the natural habitate of nocturnal monsters it was at any rate another fortunate coinci dence grundy led the way because snortimer was most at home in a dark passage like this and was very surehanded here chester and bink had to be more careful with their big clumsy feet once again grundy appreciated the good magicians wisdom in specifying this particular steed often humfreys prescriptions made a good deal more sense than they seemed to at first the tunnel wound down and around tantalizing them with a seeming descent to the bottom only to rise again obviously the voles had not considered directness to be a virtue this was probably their scenic route though all there was to see was round walls then an aperture appeared into which a stray beam of moonlight probed snortimer shrunk away moonlight wasnt deadly to him but he distrusted it on principle golem in the gears chester paused to peer outand whistled grundy dis mounted and went over to look climbing up to the cen taurs shoulder in order to reach the elevation of the hole now he saw it above the pale moon squatted on an unruly cloud below the awesome precipice of the chasm opened grundy felt suddenly dizzy as if falling into that terrible chasm chesters big hand caught him before he fell you need all four feet on the ground before you lean out that window the centaur murmured true words grundy scrambled back down and away from the hole he had had more than enough of it travel resumed progress seemed swift enough but was actually slower than it would have been on level ground because they were constantly stepping over stones and clearing cobwebs from their way somewhere around midnight they heard something and paused it was a low whistling or moaning coming from somewhere ahead in the tunnel somethings there grundy exclaimed horrified im sure its all right bink said nonchalantly how can you be so sure things will be all right all the time grundy demanded but bink only smiled and shrugged obviously he knew something grundy didnt and that annoyed grundy inor dinately they waited for there really was not much else they could do the noises approached and in due course a dark shape loomed in the tunnel grundy shrank back and chester drew his sword but bink remained uncon cerned it seemed to be an animal smaller than the centaur but massive it had front feet with enormous claws it moved along and it was evident that there was not room golem in the gears golem in the gears for it to pass them in the narrow tunnel yet it did not pause it just moved on at them just let the vole pass bink said its harmless a volet grundy asked the ghost of one bink said with that the creature moved right through chester through bink and brushed by grundy with no impact it was indeed a ghost it proceeded on up the tunnel going its mysterious way paying the living party no attention i daresay the civilized voles could be nervous about an apparition like that just as we tend to be about human ghosts bink remarked chester resheathed his sword his hand was shaking i daresay they could the centaur agreed relaxing grundy understood chesters embarrassment per fectly he had been on the verge of terrified yet obviously there had been no danger naturally voles had ghosts every species did but for a moment it had certainly seemed like a monster they resumed their trek down grundy pondered again what he had learned about the civilized voles it made sense that their ghosts could not accompany them most ghosts were locked to the region of their deaths but where had the living voles gone and why there was still no answer as dawn neared they reached the bottom of the chasm they simply set up the bed in the comfortable darkness of the tunnel then went out to forage for food but if you hear the dragon coming chester warned grundy get over to us quickly because youre the only one who can talk with it grundy smiled that was true enough without him there could be a most awkward misunderstanding he felt more important the bottom of the gap chasm was a fairly nice place at least in this region there were small trees and bushes and fruits were abundant the only thing that was missing was animal life that was because the gap dragoness ate all of that for a long time people had considered the gap dragon a terrible scourge serving no useful purpose now it was known that the combination of gap and dragon served historically to protect xanth from the worse scourges of the mundane waves of invasion that had become clear when the socalled nextwave surged through the gap had become a major line of defense grundy wondered how many other seemingly evil things of xanth actually had good purposes when understood there was a lot more to xanth than met the casual eye they finished their meal and slept around noon the ground shuddered somewhat the way it had when the invisible giant had stridden toward them but less so this was the familiar whomp whomp of the gap dragon suddenly the whole party was alert grundy stood before the tunnel exit ready to meet the dragon first this was his moment of power she whomped into view a long low sixlegged dra goness moving with surprising velocity steam belched from her mouth and nostrils adding to the splendor of her approach there was hardly a more impressive figure than the gap dragonor dragonessin full charge halt grundy cried holding his little hand aloft we come in friendship the dragoness whomped on her gaze fixed on chester hey grundy said slow down i told you oolem in the gears golem in the gears she steamed right by him her jaws opening chester no coward had his sword in hand ready to defend him selfbut no ordinary centaur was a match for such a dragon and chester was no longer in his prime grundy realized that the dragoness was so intent on her presumed prey that she hadnt heard him at all drag ons generally had limited intellects and could truly con centrate on only one thing at a time how could he get through to her before disaster he saw a shadow in the sky a roc was wheeling perhaps curious about the proceedings grundy had a notion hey brothers he squawked in roctalk lets go down and haul on that dragons tail stella steamer skidded to a halt blowing out a vast cloud of steam you try it and youll get such a chomp she hissed in dragonlanguage then she paused for the rocs were nowhere close its me stella grundy cried grundy golem were here on business im not stella she steamed im stacey oopshe had forgotten sorry i misremembered but i like stella better she decided anything you like he agreed as one does when facing a dragon now at least he had her attention youre not strays she growled not strays he informed her firmly we came to see you about stanley stanley you found him she had of course been advised of the disappearance of the little dragon no im on a quest to find him bink and chester helped me travel here i must ride the monster under the bed to the ivory tower but i dont know where the ivory tower is i was hoping you had heard something nothing she said with deep regret exhaling another cloud of steam of course i dont get much chance to talk to most passing creatures before i eat them and the rocs wont give me the time of day of course not grundy agreed theyve got stone for brains but even if stanley wasnt lost hed still be too young she growled discouraged she was patrolling the gap only temporarily it was normally stanleys job not necessarily he said theres been a technolog ical breakthrough reversewood and youth elixir he can be any age instantly any age she steamed delighted weve got to find him but if you have no notion then maybe the monster of the sea would know she hissed eagerly he came from mundania thousands of t years ago and knows an awful lot about the hiding places of monsters of all types if anyone would know where the ivory tower is he would ill be glad to ask him where is he he skulks off the east coast foraging up and down the length of xanth looking for maidens to eat or some thing she licked her chops the east coast grundy exclaimed my friends have to return home we couldnt possibly get that far in the time they have i will take you there she said animated by the pros pect of finding and maturing stanley you dont understand staceuh stella im riding snortimer the monster under the bed and the centaur is carrying the bed she nodded those bed monsters are sadly limited still i could tote that bed if thats the only problem golem in the gears grundy realized that this was another lucky break he could go on without the man and the centaur he switched to mantongue and explained good enough bink agreed we were about to have to turn back anyway its been a fine miniadventure but the wives im never going to get married grundy said wives are a terror chester waggled a warning finger at him you wont have a choice if some golem damsel sets her cap for you some golem damsel that sobered grundy there was no such creature he was the only one of his kind chameleon should be very pretty by the time i get back bink murmured mostly to himself grundy real ized that there had been method in binks generosity he had been adventuring during the period when his wife was least attractive and would return when she was most attractive even in old age chameleon in her pretty phase was something special grundy would have settled for a golem damsel of that nature it was agreed bink and chester returned up the tunnel after tying the bed to stellas back at the moment of parting bink turned seriously to grundy be careful he cautioned just as if he had paid any attention to that before then the gap dragoness whomped forward and grundy had to cling desperately to the bed to prevent himself from flying off at each whomp he hoped snor timer wasnt getting motion sick it was a long way across xanth especially by whomptravel and they were only partway along by nightfall grundy had managed to get some sleep during the day but now stella needed to rest they discussed it and decided that grundy and snortimer would go on ahead and stella would catch up to them the next day hauling the bed she was able to crawl out golem in the gears of the harness so that she could hunt and the truth was that grundy was happy to be elsewhere while she was hunting snortimer started out somewhat wobbly but got unkinked after a while and moved along well enough they made good progress along the valley of the gap keeping mostly to the shadows where the moonbeams couldnt reach but after a while a cloud blotted out the moon that suited snortimer just fine but grundy was annoyed who do you think you are cutting off my light he demanded in human tongue it was rhetorical only king dor could talk to the inanimate and have it answer the cloud only intensified sealing off the last vestige of light so that grundy could not see at all he was all right as snortimer remained perfectly surehanded in the dark but still it bothered him you fogfaced puff of dirty mist he railed at the cloud if you were a living creature id prick your mangy balloon there was a rumble of thunder oh noit was fixing to rain what noise is this grundy demanded you think youre pretty big stuff sounding off dont you well youre nothing but hot air there was a louder peal of thunder could the cloud hear him or understand him grundy remembered some thing ivy had said about a mean little cloud called cumulo fracto nimbus who thought it was a king maybe this was that one if so he knew how to insult itand he was in just the mood to do it you bag of wind he yelled you call yourself a king you stink to high heaven now there was no doubt the cloud heard him there was a gust of wind and a roll of thunder that traversed the chasm golem in the gears golem in the gears grundy was beginning to enjoy this he realized that he would get wet but he could handle that there wasnt much else the cloud could do because it couldnt see him in the dark and he was constantly moving you sound like a stinkhom he yelled smell like it too a bolt of lightning struck the ground where he had been oh that cloud was angry obviously it could under stand the human language and it had a badweather tem per ivy had described it perfectly a grandiose stormcloud with delusions of grandeur but now dawn was approaching that meant they would have to stop and camp for the dayand be a sitting target for the lightning grundy hadnt thought that far ahead what was he to do now and to his horror grundy realized he had made another oversight traveling without snortimers bed now the bed monster had no bed to hide under as the dangerous light came if the storm didnt get them the daylight would they would simply have to find a place dark enough to protect snortimer until the dragoness caught up with the bed look for a cave grundy directed his steed in monstertongue fortunately the gap was riddled with crevices and caves snortimer swerved to the side and up the sheer cliff surprising him grundy hadnt realized how well the monster could climb some distance up the side there was an opening and they crawled in inside there was a fairly comfortable cave chamber quite suitable for their pur pose it had enough curvature to guarantee that no beam of light could strike snortimer as long as he remained away from the entrance grundy however didnt need to stay back he dis mounted and stood at the front nyah nyah you fla tulent cloud he yelled your lightning bolts are too dull to stick in the ground furious the cloud hurled a bolt at him but it missed the broad surface of the cliff provided nothing for a bolt to fix on the bolt bounced off the stone above and clattered to the base where it lay dented and harmless slowly dulling from whitehot to redhot in time it would become cold iron gray and eventually rust away a spent bolt was a sad thing you call yourself a storm grundy yelled i call you cumulofractonumbskull oh the cloud was mad lightning flashed across it revealing a puffy cloudface surmounted by a foggy crown this was fracto all right i can see youre a real dunderhead grundy called taking off on the thunderhead he knew the cloud pre ferred to be called ill bet even can make water better than you can that did it fracto set about making water rain poured down splattering across the cliff some splashed in but promptly seeped out again this cave was not only secure from light it was safe from flooding too meanwhile day was arriving even the full fury of the storm could not blank out all the light of the sun youll dry up any minute mistforbrains grundy shouted the rain poured down with double intensity water sheeted along the cliff and crashed in a torrent into the ground below puddles developed and expanded it was grundy had to admit to himself an impressive effort but of course that wasnt what he told fracto if thats the best you can do cumulofatso youd better retire to some greener pasture and sprinkle their flowers a baby could dribble better than you can it wasnt possible for the storm to get any angrier but gotem in the geore it succeeded anyway a deluge came down while gmndy continued to hurl up insults he hadnt had a namecalling workout like this in years the puddles expanded to ponds and to little lakes still the water poured down the liquid had no ready egress grundy smiled as that word came to him thinking of birds and pewter from the gap so it piled up the bottom was becoming a single expanse of water like an inlet from the sea is that the best you can do you cumbersome fractious nincompoop kinky clown of a cloud he demanded the kingcloud was so enraged that jags of lightning shot out of its posterior illuminating the whole chasm thunder crashed continuously wind whipped violently about and rain came down in bucketfuls the water level rose creeping up toward grundys cave now belatedly he realized what could happen if the rainfall continued unabated it could flood the cave forc ing snortimer out into the light wiping him out then faintly over the constant noise of the rain he heard splashing he peered and saw a distant cloud of steam stella steamer was caught in the water and by the look of it she couldnt swim she was being carried along by the flow of it thrashing about trying to keep her head above the surface enough he cried ill stop insulting you feculo but now the cloud had the advantage and had no inten tion of letting it go the water descended without pause deepening the lake fracto didnt care if stella drowned as long as he got grundy too stella grundy screamed in dragontongue find something to hang on to but there was nothing to anchor her slowly she was carried on past his cave having increasing difficulty as golem in the gears the water deepened the bed was tied to her back ham pering her she was surely going to drown grundy scrambled back inside the cave snortimer the waters rising the dragons drowning and well drown too if we dont get out of here he exclaimed i can take care of that snortimer said you can how ill just pull the plug the what lets go snortimer said but youll have to shield me from the light grundy jumped on spreading his body as well as he could to intercept what dim light there was and the mon ster scrambled out of the cave snortimer winced as the palest light surrounded him then he dropped into the water and sank below grundy held his breath and hung on not knowing what was happening snortimer scrambled rapidly hand over hand down under the water moving along the bottom of what was now a deep lake in a moment he came to a large circular plate set in the ground he braced two arms against the ground grabbed the edge of the disk with two more and used another to steady himself he hauled on the disk slowly the disk came up then it was out of its hole and water was pouring through snortimer hauled it to the side and let it go it snagged in a crack and hung there letting the current go by now the water was sucking rapidly through the hole left by the disk snortimer clung to the ground and grundy clung to snortimer and the water rushed by them with increasing force grundy didnt know how long he could hold his breath but he had no choice if he stopped hold ing it he would drown surprisingly swiftly the water sucked down through golem in the gears the hole and the lake in the chasm drained soon there was nothing remaining but puddles already snortimer was scrambling in the direction the dragon had gone my bed he gasped his bed of course he had to get under cover before the cloud cleared up they found stella downstream shaking herself snor timer dived under the bed that was still strapped to her back the bed was soaking but it represented security for the monster just in time cumulo fracto nimbus seeing the drop in the level of water was giving it up as a bad job grundy was tempted to call good riddance at the cloud but refrained his mouth had caused enough trouble already where had all the water gone he wondered there had been so much of itand now it was all belowground was it rushing through endless caverns down to some sunless sea were there people down there or monsters and if so how were they handling all that water probably it would not be smart to stay around long enough to find out they might not be entirely pleased by the abrupt deluge stella seemed all right the water had drained in time and she was of a tough species grundy settled on top of the squishy bed and relaxed as she whomped on fracto his rage spent floated away and the sun reap peared slowly the bed dried out by nightfall it no longer squished this night grundy and snortimer did not range far ahead they decided to wait until the dragoness was ready to move in the morning after all there might not be another plug ahead golem in the gears golem in the gears good luck stella growled ive got to go back on patrol she whomped back down the chasm at night snortimer came out and foraged for the mak ings of a dummy he gathered driftwood that was bent into shapely configurations and tied it together with vine he was really pretty handywhich wasnt surprising considering that he was mostly made of arms and hands grundy searching for food suddenly felt his foot go cold it was as if he had stepped in deep snowbut there was no snow he checked and discovered that he had stepped on a burr no wonder those things were impos sibly chilly they set up the dummy at the shore then grundy imitated its voice oh help he wailed in the most dis traught femalish tone im in horrible distress nothing happened but of course it could take the mon ster time to arrive grundy repeated the call every hour or so hoping it would be heard dawn came and they retreated to the bed the night had been quiet but the day was otherwise first a little roc swooped down evidently taking the bed for a tidbit too late grundy realized that they should have concealed it the roc would simply lift it up and carry it away and he dreaded to think what would happen to snortimer grundy dashed across the sand to the spot where he had stepped on the burr it was still there he picked it up though it chilled his hand to the bone and charged back just as the roc arrived the bird was just extending its claws toward the bed as grundy hurled the burr at its head the roc with an automatic reflex snapped the bun out of the air and swallowed it then the bird froze not quite literally it forgot the bed and pumped its wings flying upbut there was a rather strange expression on its beak and ice was forming on the outside of its craw it flew away somewhat erratically grundy smiled it was a young roc still inexperienced a mature one would have known better than to eat the burr next time this one would know better he had just contributed to its growing pains so to speak he settled down to rest as there was nothing he could do about the bed right now at night he could get snor timer to haul it across the sand to cover for grundy himself lacked the strength but he remained halfway alert in the late afternoon he was roused by a distant scrap ing or brushing sound he jumped up and lookedand was dismayed a beachcomber was coming down the beach this was a giant comb with enormous teeth advancing across the sand combing out all debris behind it the sand was level and clean the debris piled up in front of it to be moved to some dumping site obviously the bed would be dumped along with the rest of the trash desperately grundy looked around he remembered seeing something that mightyes there was a small pumpkin growing at the fringe he dashed across to it used a sharp shellfragment to saw it free of its vine and shoved with all his might the pumpkin weighed more than he did but the beach was slightly inclined and he was able to start it rolling just as the beachcomber arrived the comb caught the pumpkin and tumbled it around the pumpkin burst getting its innards all over the combs teeth that was exactly what grundy had hoped for the teeth absorbed the juices of the pumpkin then the magic of the pumpkin acted on them they were pumped up swelling like balloons in moments the comb ground to a halt unable to push its own fat teeth through the sand the bed had been saved again golem in the gears golem in the gears when evening came they moved the bed to safety under a mystree where any intruder would have great difficulty figuring things out grundy continued to imitate the calls and pleas of the dummydamsel though he had some private reservations about seeking the aid of a mon ster that preferred to feed on this sort of prey next day about noon the monster of the sea arrived first a ripple developed in the water then a wake finally a grotesque head poked up the monster had a flexible pink snout bulging nostrils cauliflower ears and two enormous ivory tusks his eyes seemed beady but as he came closer grundy realized that they were more like bloodshot saucers it was the size of the creature that made them seem small grundy glanced down and discovered that his knees hadnt changed to jelly they merely felt that way did he really want to continue this mission thats the ugliest puss ive ever seen he breathed the monster honked grundy jumped naturally he understood the honk and what it signified was this and youre the least significant twerp ive ever seen those big convoluted ears were good at hearing im on a quest grundy replied defensively in honky arent we all the monster agreed you whats your quest i liberate damsels in distress the monster waded through the shallow surf toward the dummy he had huge flippers and a serpentine tail and he was even bigger than he had seemed strings of seaweed were festooned across his scales he smelled of ill fish um about that particular damsel grundy began be with you in a moment minipint the monster honked as he heaved himself out of the water and hauled his blubbery body somewhat awkwardly across the sand first things first but you see thats not really a i came to liberate her and liberate her i shall shes a dummy she dont call any damsel a dummy the monster chided him continuing forward but this one is really a grundy said the monster halted abruptly eyes on the dummy thats no damsel he honked its a dummy dummy grundy exclaimed ive been trying to tell you a mockdamsel the monster honked amazed who would do a thing like that well you see here i swam half the length of xanth at top velocity to reach the poor damsel before she expired and all for nothing what good would it have done her anyway grundy exclaimed shed be as well off dying of exposure as being gobbled by you what the monster honked perplexed why euphemize you may call it liberation but its their lives and your hunger you are liberating my dear insignificant golem the monster honked whatever gave you that idea its true isnt it you consume only damsels in dis tress i consume only plankton the monster honked affronted do you think there would be enough damsels in all xanth to feed me if your heinous charge were true grundy contemplated the enormous bulk of the crea ture and realized it was true a thousand damsels would not sustain that mountain of flesh plankton golem in the gear its a magic food found only in the sea very tasty i strain it through my teeth but those tusks are for selfdefense of course there are some pretty bad creatures out there uh i guess i was led astray by your reputation grundy said embarrassed you shouldnt credit hearsay the monster reproved him now why is this mockdamsel here i set it up grundy confessed it was the only way to summon you you perpetrated this indignity the saucereyes red dened alarmingly i need your help it isnt only damsels that get in distress you know the monster considered i suppose that could be true he said relenting on a scale of ten his orbs declined from a bloodshot factor of eight to six in what manner i need to get to the ivory tower the ivory tower the beast honked his eyes shoot ing up to nine i never go near that accursed device oh what do you have against it look at these tusks the monster honked waving them in the golems direction alarmingly of what do you suppose they are made uhivory precisely and that tower i see your point someone wants your tusks for that tower the orbs ameliorated actually no the tower has been complete for centuries but it was fashioned of the ivory of many innocent monsters like me and every time i hear about it i think of the sacrifice of those poor crea tures to the greed of the sea hag golem in the gears the sea hag she who crafted the tower a horrendous witch the scourge of the sea im not sure i like this grundy said i have to ride the monster under the bed to the ivory tower if i am to rescue a banished dragon a dragondamsel in distress the monster inquired intrigued no this is stanley steamer a male dragon formerly of the gap chasm oh thai dragon i wondered why he had been replaced by a female recently still if hes locked in the ivory tower im not sure thats the case grundy confessed i understand that rapunzel is actually at the tower and maybe she will know where stanley is theres a damsel in that tower she must be in dis tress well i dont know anything about her except that she corresponds with ivy the daughter of the human king if shes in that tower shes captive to the sea hag and shes certainly in distress grundy realized that this could be a useful interpre tation that might be the case perhaps she needs res cuing i hate the ivory tower and i hate the sea hag the monster honked passionately i shall have to rescue that damsel well since i need to go there anyway yes yes to be sure the monster agreed we must be instantly on our way theres no telling what horrors the sea hag visits upon that damsel daily to be honest ivy didnt say anything about horrors grundy said ivy sends boxes of junk to rapunzel and golem in the gean golem in the gean rapunzel sends boxes of puns i dont think its an even exchange but i wouldnt exactly call it horror either are they good puns or bad puns is there such a thing as a good pun of course not they must be bad puns if thats all she has to send she must be living in horror grundy nodded i hadnt thought of it that way youre right of course well have to rescue her but we cant start till evening because i have to bring snortimer along and his bed impossible the monster honked grundy thought fast a night start would be better to fool the sea hag the monster considered his blubber paled well wait grundy had won his point somehow he did not feel reassured what was there about the sea hag that put such a tremendous monster in fear when she wasnt even looking for ivory anymore grundy wanted to return to the bed and continue his daytime nap but was afraid the monster would change his mind and depart without them if he gave him too much leisure so he decided to keep the monsters mind occu pied the best way to do that he knew was to get him talking about himself where did you get the reputation for consuming dam sels in distress he asked now thats a long and sad story replete with irony the monster honked trundling down to the water that was exactly what grundy wanted a story that would distract the creature for a significant period im interested in learning the truth grundy said encourag ingly well let me get settled comfortably and ill tell you the monster completed his trundle to the water exca vated sand with his flippers formed a comfortable cavity and commenced his narration it all started back in mundania perhaps five thousand years ago give or take a few hundred it seems there had been a number of storms in the region of a land called ethiopia mundanes have strange place names and the superstitious natives believed that if they sacrificed their kings daughter to the sea the storms would stop that was nonsense of course any selfrespecting storm would simply take the damsel and continue unabated so they chained the beautiful virgin named andromeda to a rock by the sea and left her there now it was sheer happenstance that i was in the area and heard about it from the local fish they said that this truly luscious morsel of mortal distaff pulchritude was exposed near the shore with no one to help her that bothered me i dont have any particular brief for land creatures and less for those of the human persuasion but though the males can be troublemakers the females can be rather innocent they should have chained out a man in armor not a harmless damsel there wasnt even any storm in the area at the moment so i went to look and do you know she was indeed a luscious creature ripe and succulent and fully packed the tide was rising and a peculiar mundane fish called a shark i warned you about those names was circling waiting for the water to rise enough to enable it to swim to her and tear off some of that tender flesh even if the fish didnt eat her the rising water would drown her so she was obviously doomed well i decided to do something about it i wasnt lim ited to the water the way the fish was though i do prefer golem in the gears it it offers a usual support for one thing so i hauled myself out and approached her oh she was a lovely creature if i had any taste for flesh i would have slavered over her attributes she had more meat on her ribcage than i had seen in decades and her hams were plush indeed she saw me and ululated i presume with pleasure for it was obvious that i had come to help her i inserted a tusk into a link of the chain that bounded her hind foot and wedged it out of the stone that freed herbut i knew it would be useless to return her to the savage folk who had chained her so cruelly here i tried to tell her that if she would just climb on my back i would carry her safely to some more equitable culture but of course i could not speak her language so i tried to signify my intent by gestures and i think she was beginning to under stand then this idiot wearing winged slippers came flying by he had a sword in his right front appendage and a circular shield on his left and without waiting to ascertain any part of the situation he dropped down and pricked me in the snoot with his weapon now my snoot is very tender and he happened to strike a vein blood welled out and spread across my face splattering into my eyes had i realized his intent i would never have permitted him to approach i could readily have knocked him out of the air with a tusk but i have ever been slow to appreciate the malice of strangers until too late temporarily blinded by blood and still unwilling to appreciate the magnitude of his calumny i plunged into deeper water to wash off my snoot that was effective and the cut closed in a moment for we monsters are of hardy stock but in that time the lightfooted man whose name was something stupid like perseeus made off with the golem in the gears maiden he just carried her away i dread to think of her fate at the hands of that lech erous brute but i could do nothing they were already airborne when i broke the surface again i learned later that perseeus had vilely slandered me telling the damsel that i had come to consume her and that he had killed me he was of course wrong on both counts i had come to rescue her and the story of my demise was greatly exaggerated it was only a pinprick after all and a treacherous and lucky one at that but the credulous humans thereafter chose to believe that was the villain of the episode i who had broken the chain that bound her to the sea i had a lower regard for the human kind after that you may be sure still i perceived that there was a need to protect other such maidens from similar atrocities so i constantly patrolled the shores ready to rescue any that i spied this led to certain altercations with other idiots of the perseeus stripe as you may imagine i remember one of them called jason he had some foolish notion of locating the golden fleas that resided on a dragon what right he thought he had to such elegant fleas ill never know but he got himself a boat called the arrgh or some such and came pestering me evidently he presumed i was the dragon only the very stupidest of idiots could fail to perceive the distinction between a dragon and a sea monster but he fitted the description he stabbed at me with his pinpricker annoyed i simply gulped him down whole now i am not a flesh eater and this carrion had a foul taste revolted i soon regurgitated him but the damage was done the foul taste remained in my mouth for weeks i understood the fool finally found the right dragon and stole the fleas from it carrying them on a motley yellow golem in the gears golem in the gear sheepskin there seems to be very little justice in mun dania disgusted by episodes like these i finally migrated to xanth unfortunately the calumny ofperseeus pursued me and folk here too believed that i was looking for damsels to harm rather than to help but i refuse to be dissuaded by ungratefulness still i range the coast seeking damsels who require aid and that is my sad story and the reason for the misunderstanding that surrounds me the monster fell silent his tale done grundy wasnt quite sure whether to believe him but decided the more expedient course was to accept the monsters version of historical events as factual im certainly glad to get the story straight he said its good to get my side of it spread about the mon ster honked and strangely he no longer seemed as ugly as he had his appearance was the same but grundy just didnt perceive it as unpleasant this sea hag he asked just how bad is she ah the sea hag the monster sighed i really wish she werent involved in this i dont like the notion of tangling with her one bit but youre a monster the scourge of the sea grundy protested what have you to fear from her let me tell you about her the monster said she is a sorceress and no mortal creature can oppose magic of that level except another of that level a sorceress there are only three in all xanth today grundy protested iris irene and ivy the sorceresses of illusion growing and enhancement there arent any more there arent any more living in xanth the monster honked but the sea hag is off xanth and shes not exactly living that may be why she has escaped your notice but the good magician knows everything grundy said he would have told us if i have heard of your good magician the monster honked does he provide information for the asking not exactly grundy admitted and is he in full command of his faculties today i understand he is getting old hes young not oldor was when i saw him last young how can that be hes been sneaking nips of youth elixir he odd youth elixir wouldnt the hag be a terror if she got hold of that no one but the good magician knows where the fountain of youth is grundy explained and hes not about to share his secret with anyone else i hope not its just about the only thing that could make the hag more dangerous than she is just what is her talent immortality but you said she wasnt exactly alive precisely she occupies a body and lives till she tires of it then she kills it and takes a new body usually a younger one a fairer one of course it doesnt stay young or beautiful after shes used it a few years her haggish nature gradually transforms it to hideousness that doesnt bother her she can always change it for another but how its her talent when her body dies she is a ghost for a few hoursi dont know how long she can remain dis corporate but it isnt longand then invests a new host which she controls until its death she can do this as often as she wishes and she can invest any host golem in the gears golem in the gears any host grundy asked appalled any host that agrees to let her in the monster qual ified but who would do that no onein his right mind but she has ways of cloud ing minds thats why im afraid of her she might trick me into accepting her trick you how could she do that you can never be sure what her form will be because she can take over any living creature who lets her shes had centuries to practice her nefarious wiles she could be a damsel in distress oh and when the monster of the sea agreed to liberate her the agreement might constitute more than intended grundy appreciated the danger but he had another con cern why would she keep someone locked up in the ivory tower you havent perceived that the monster honked why would i ask if i had the hag has been in this vicinitythe eastern coast ofxanthfor centuries people are catching on mothers warn daughters about her im sure its getting harder for her to take over healthy human hosts animals too may be alert as i am she can take over any creature male or female though i believe she prefers female for long term use that doesnt mean males are safe it means shell use them only temporarily killing them off when she finds a better host so it makes sense for her to cul tivate a perfect hostsome young woman who cant get away and who doesnt even know what the hag contem plates but everyone in the area must know grundy pro tested yes except a person raised in an isolated tower who never talks to anyone else rapunzel grundy exclaimed finally catching the monsters drift that is why the hag built the ivory tower the mon ster agreed to enable her to raise a girl in each gen eration who was completely innocent yet healthy and intelligent and beautiful in the ivory tower there is no chance to leam about the real world yet that person can be quite intellectual the hag has fine taste in women since she likes to have the most attractive and useful bodies inevitably those bodies age and uglify under her influence but if they are outstandingly beautiful at the outset that process takes longer obviously rapunzel knows something grundy said that has to be the reason the good magician sent me to the ivory tower but if shes completely shut off from the rest of xanth how could she know where the missing dragon is she would know anything the hag told her the mon ster pointed out and the hag would need her to know the general geography and cultures of xanth because once the hag takes over that body the hag is restricted by the limitations of the host obviously she knows shes the hag and remembers what shes done but her physical and mental abilities are defined by those of the host thats another reason to have a substantial period of training just so long as the captive doesnt leam about the real nature of the hag herself so probably rapunzel knows where just about everything is so that the hag can find it when she has that host yes that makes sense grundy agreed from ivys description rapunzel is a nice person and a pundit golem in the gears who sends her puns the monster agreed but she wont stay nice once the hag takes over she is definitely a damsel in distress grundy con cluded and weve got to rescue her agreed the monster honked but this will be no easy task i believe others have tried to get into the ivory tower in prior centuries and all have come to grief i can imagine grundy said glumly it is an interesting coincidence that your good magi cian should send you on this mission just at this time when the damsel surely needs rescuing not coincidence at all grundy said half angrily the good magician must know about the sea hag after all and has dispatched me to break up her foul mischief undoubtedly the case the monster agreed unfortunately grundy was not at all sure he was up to the challenge he was after all only the height of the span of a human mans spread hand he was definitely no hero now it was dusk it was time to fetch the bed and snortimer and start on their swim to the dread ivory tower r chapter ivory tower they traveled south along the coast the mon ster was so big and steady in the water that he was like a floating island the bed simply perched on the bamacled back without falling off and grundy and snortimer perched on the bed the monster couldnt talk to them while swimming because his snoot was mostly under water but that was all right grundy had had his fill of conversation for now progress was slow however the monster was no speed freak the voyage required several days at dawn they camped on an isolated promontory that the monster assured them was safe there was an inlet that was almost a cave providing deep shade for the bed which made snortimer more comfortable the monster swam out to the deep ocean and fed on plankton while grundy found some edible lichen in assorted candy flavors snortimer had no trouble he fed on the dust under the bed as he always had he had evolved from dust and to dust he would return when ivy grew up and stopped believing in him that was the tragedy of all bed monsters as they wended farther south the complexion of the shore changed the normal greens and browns of trees faded to be replaced by tan and then yellow and finally golem in the gears golem in the gear bright gold whats with the land grundy asked when the monster paused didnt you know this is the gold coast oh that didnt explain much but grundy didnt want to admit his further ignorance so he did not inquire again at length they hove into view of the dread ivory tower it was grundy discovered a lighthouse a yellow beam of light swung around from its apex brightening the heav ing surface of the sea and the projecting rocks of the coast this was a lonely region forbidding and unpretty mun danes might find golden land beautiful but golems had better taste grundy would never have come here had he not been on quest they paused at a distance grundy knew that the mon ster dared not approach too close lest the sea hag spy him the next phase of this adventure was up to grundy himself it was possible the monster had assured him to reach the base of the tower from the land by crossing the shoals at low tide there would not be much time because the moment the tide reversed that section would fill in with water returning the tower to its island status however since snortimer could climb a sheer cliff face grundy wasnt worried about that aspect of greater concern was the whereabouts of the sea hag was she in the tower now or elsewhere it was fairly high tide now the monster nudged in close to the golden shore and landed them near a golden grotto lifting the bed into it with a flipper it was an awkward operation but successful now snortimer was secure under the bed in a deeply shadowed nook just the way he liked it still he complained i miss ivys cute little feet the sooner we get this quest done the sooner shell be using this bed again grundy reminded him if you dont find romance first um to be sure snortimer muttered as a splash of water drenched the bed he did not sound entirely sat isfied grundy decided to wait and watch for a while the monster believed that the hag made regular trips to and from the tower though he had never actually observed this being too nervous to remain long enough to watch in fact the monster was already gone having swum to deeper waters to feed he would be back in due course to help rescue the damsel in distressbut grundy real ized that it was up to the golem to work out the proper strategy he was in luck on the afternoon of the first day he saw a rowboat coming around the tower evidently the hag had it moored by the door at the base and was now heading to land for supplies if she stayed away until low tide grundy could cross to the tower and enter and perhaps rescue rapunzel just like that probably the hag locked the door from the outside so that the girl couldnt escape if he could just find a way to unlock it he waited nervously as the day waned the hag did not return he assumed it was the hag though he had not been able to get a clear view of the figure in the boat because it could be no one else certainly rapunzel wouldnt be going shopping but if the hag had someone else to do her bidding no it had to be her meanwhile the tide was going out at dusk the bar was beginning to show within another hour they would be able to cross still the boat did not return maybe the hag planned to return in the morning that would be so convenient for grundy that he hardly believed it golem in the gears as night became firmly established he roused snor timer they had to leave the bed in the grotto it was under cover and high enough so that high tide would not reach it but of course they did not plan to remain long at the tower this deed was best done quickly as the water receded farther they made the crossing there were still inlets and puddles to hurdle but snor timer could handle them grundy judged that they would have no more than an hour longer and the tide would trap them it was a farther distance than it had seemed the terrain of the bar was not even it was rough and craggy even at ebb tide the waves crashed against the rocks to a regular man this might not have been too bad but each wave was about nine times as high relative to grundy he could be swamped in water that was only kneedeep to a man once again he was reminded of his basic inad equacy as a hero he simply lacked the stature it took twenty minutes to make it to the base of the tower they scrambled around itand were dismayed there was no door the wall was a smooth cylinder throughout how had the hag gotten out grundy peered up into the sky the tower seemed immensely tall from this vantage poking up almost to the restless night clouds the only aperture seemed to be at the top a window not far below the rotating beam facing seaward she must have a ladder grundy concluded glumly but then he remembered his steeds ability well just have to climb up it the prospect scared him for it looked to be a very long way up but what alternative did they have he held on tight and snortimer took hold of the wall golem in the gears the huge hairy hands scraped across the polished ivory and found no resistance the ivory was simply too slippery for snortimer to scale the cliff of the gap chasm had been rough with a network of little cracks and crevices that assured a grip this wall had none they could not get up that way oh zombieslush grundy swore frustrated there was a sound far above as of a window being opened is that you mother sweetness a gentle voice called mother sweetness what nonsense was this why are you back early the voice called grundy had to answer ii am a visitor he called may i come up and see you there was a dulcet gasp oh i dare not talk to strangers naturally the hag had warned this innocent young thing against strangers but i have come a long way just to talk with you grundy called no mother sweetness is very firm about that no strangers there was the sound of a window being closed grundy thought desperately im not exactly a stranger he called im from ivy ivy the window reopened my punpal the same im on a quest for her and i must talk with you its very important she hesitated well i suppose for a moment but i dont know how to get in grundy called i cant find the door there was a tinkle of laughter silly there is no door ivory towers dont have accesses to the real world but then how does anyone get in just a moment while i let down my hair golem in the gears rapunzel this is no time to do your hair grundy cried again her laughter tinkled down upon them she seemed to be a merry soul its for you of course thats how mother sweetness comes up then a hank of fiber fell down to dangle just shy of the ground startling them grundy reached out to touch it and found it composed of fine silken fibers it was her hair he stared up the tower seemed to be hundreds of feet tall and the hair dangled all the way down it what amazing tresses she possessed but though he could climb well enough for a few feet he knew this was beyond him his arms would give out before he was more than a fraction of the way up and he would fall back to the rocky base if the sea hag could readily climb that distance she had to be one tough old creature then snortimer took hold he naturally had no trou ble he could climb anything once he got a grip on it grundy mounted and up they swarmed virtually running up the side of the tower in a few minutes they were near the top belatedly it occurred to grundy that the sight of snor timer might alarm the girl after all snortimer was the monster under the bed a figure of terror for most young folk close your eyes as we come in he called close my eyes she asked perplexed but how could he explain but then he realized that they had another problem her chamber was lighted snorti mer could not enter or turn out the light he said it its blinding me oh in a moment the light went out evidently she had the lamp within reach r golem in the gears snortimer scrambled on up in the dark and into the window the absence of light solved both problems neatly but once they were inside rapunzel wanted to light the lamp again if i turn it low your eyes will be able to adjust she said reasonably wait grundy cried the truth is i didnt come alone my friendhe cant face the light your friend she asked who is he he is known as thewell he lives under the bed nobody lives under my bed she said under ivys bed grundy explained somewhat lamely hehes my steed he can climb better than i can because hes got more hands ivys bed shes a child and all children havethings under their beds oh you must mean snortimer rapunzel exclaimed now i remember shes mentioned him but he cant come out into the light and we couldnt bring the bed up here so he can borrow my bed she said warmly ive always wanted a monster under the bed i dont know grundy said i think he can only live under ivys bed nonsense im her punpal that makes my bed just as good she moved about in the darkness where are you snortimer let me show you my bed i dont think snortimer said to grundy in monster tongue now ill be most unhappy if you dont try my bed rapunzel said beginning to sound unhappy ive never had a monster under my bed even to visit mother sweetness never would allow it whatever will i do if you refuse qolem in the gears better at least try it snort grundy mumbled feeling awkward this was the last kind of discussion he had anticipated but when rapunzel sounded happy she sounded very very happy and when she sounded unhappy it was awful grudgingly snortimer moved across the dark chamber to where she indicated her bed was a surprised snort followed i can use it snortimer exclaimed its com fortable gradea dust in that case perhaps we can light the lamp grundy said hes safe under the bed in a moment the light came on evidently she had a magic match at first it was indeed blinding then he adapted beautiful was hardly the word to describe rapunzel it was inadequate she was as lovely a creature as he had encountered she seemed to be about twenty years old with eyes that shifted colors in the angles of the shadows and hair like endless silk ranging in shade from almost black at her head to bleached white at the end of the tresses she wore an oldfashioned mundanian skirt and bodice with velvet slippers a series of stout combs buck led her tresses in place she was busy hauling them in and fastening them down hank by hank grundy wondered that the weight of it didnt drag her head down to the floor but her hair seemed to compact as it curled against her head so that no matter how much of it she piled on it remained of only ordinary volume obviously her magic talent was her hair it was both infinite and finite ohi thought youd be larger she said i guess i forgot to tell you grundy said im a golem a golem i was fashioned of wood and rag and string he golem in the gears explained several decades ago later i managed to become alive but my size didnt change thats all right she said i like you the way you are you do this too caught him by surprise of course there are advantages to being the right size and abruptly she was his size grundy stared where a fullsized human girl had been there now stood one slightly smaller than he was she was identical in every respect and every bit as lovely only smaller how he asked dazed im of mixed elfinhuman stock she explained it all started four centuries ago when my greattothenth degree grandmother bluebell elf met this handsome human barbarian warrior and used adaptation magic on him for a tryst ever since their descendants have been able to shift from her size to his and in between and beyond so i can be anywhere from your size which is smaller than an elf to giant size which is larger than human though thats about the limit some of my ancestors have married elves and some human folk depending on their tastes but the magic has carried through size really doesnt make much difference to me but ive tended to stick to human size because thats the way mother sweet ness is also my hair might not reach all the way down if i were too small though im not sure about that it does keep growing and i havent tried it in that size recently bluebell elf grundy repeated remembering some thing i know a human man from about that time named jordan he says he yes hes the one she exclaimed clapping her little hands enthusiastically i always wondered what became of him after he left the elven tree because my first female ancestor was elven she never knew more about golem in the gears golem in the gears the man because he was the roving kind as barbarians are that i can tell you grundy said pleased he liked this woman very well but there is something more seri ous i need to tell you first im afraid it will be very difficult for you to accept oh i dont think so she said cheerily she came to sit by him on the floor as the furniture was too large for either of them now her proximity had an electric effect on him for not only was she the loveliest creature of his size he had encountered she was treating him exactly like a person its so delightful to have companyive never had a visitor before you knowand even a monster under my bed even if its only a borrowed one it does get lonely being alone all the time when mother sweet ness isnt here of course i do correspond and exchange things with ivy though i dont have anything very good to send her compared to the wonderful things she sends me the wonderful she jumped up even prettier in her lithe activity than she had been when sitting see i have them here on a table here ill have to change to reach it she shifted to human size reached down her hand and picked grundy up setting him gently on the table her fingers were soft and fine and smelled faintly of bubblebath now hold my hand she said extending one finger grundy took hold of the fingereven the nail was smooth and sweetly shapedand suddenly she was small again and with him holding hands i cant do it by myself she exclaimed i have to stand where i change if you see what i mean i can get down by jumping and changing in midair but its hard to get up without breaking the table she smiled brilliantly but with another per son then i can be with that personand so here i am on the table with you indeed she was and grundy was mightily impressed he had never been with a creature like this before and he liked it very well his whole limited life seemed to assume more significance just because of her presence they faced a substantial collection of oddments bits of string pebbles sand flower petals fragments of pot tery a paperclip a mundane penny a fragment of colored glass and so on these were the ordinary things that ivy had sent in exchange for all the beautiful puns rapunzel had sent yet the woman seemed to be quite pleased with them im not sure that what you send her is inferior to what you have here he said cautiously but these are things of the real world she exclaimed happily all i have to send are used puns and theyre very cheap see theres some piled up in the comer she gestured and grundy saw assorted knickknacks there one was a green bottle another a branch of a tree and another was a ball formed of fingers and hands what are they he asked oh ones a club soda i havent sent her that because i dont want her to get clubbed that branch is an ever green it turns anything it touches greenyou can see how the floor has become green there and a handball and taillights i understand grundy said seeing the lighted tails punthings hardly relate to the real world rapunzel continued but these artifacts ivy sendseach a little bit of her realityhow i wish i could go there i want so much to join the real world i would like to take you there grundy said hardly believing that it could be so easy golem in the geon oh i cant go she said frowning and it was as though a cloud passed over the lamp dimming the room i have to mind the lamp the lamp he asked looking at it as the fog about it dissipated this is a lighthouse the beam has to keep swinging around and around so that the monster of the sea doesnt crash against the rocks in the dark oh the big lamp but the monster of the sea doesnt come here grundy exclaimed hes afraid of the sea hag the what the sea hag she what is this word hag was she teasing him thats what i have to tell you that you may not like maybe youd better sit down for this very well she agreed readily enough hold my hand he held her hand no great chore and they walked to the edge of the table then she jumped offand changed to human size in midair she landed solidly but grundy was still clasping one of her fingers then she lifted him down and across to the couch where she reversed the process now the two of them were sitting on the couch quite comfortable grundy remained somewhat awed by the facility with which she shifted size without sacrificing any of her daintyness but he forced himself to focus on the subject its about the one you call mother sweetness he said shemay not be quite what you believe but ive known her all my life rapunzel exclaimed how did you come to be here in the ivory tower golem in the gear he asked hoping to find a way to say what needed to be said without alienating her well i dont remember it myself but from what i have been told my parents were in trouble and mother sweetness arranged to help them and so they gave their next child to her to raise and that was me and i really have no right to complain for mother sweetness has been very good to me but sometimes there wasnt going to be any easy way outside she is known as the sea hag he said she takes young women andand uses their bodies i dont understand rapunzel said her brow furrow ing prettily shetakes over their bodies makes them hers i dont know what happens to thethe original owners so instead of being an old hag suddenly shes young and beautiful then she arranges for a new body for when she gets old again and needs it that way shes immor talonly not with her own body rapunzel stiffened i cant believe that i was afraid you wouldnt grundy said but if you dont believe it you may be doomed to a fate worse than death but mother sweetness has always treated me so well and never let you leave the ivory tower i explained about thalthe lightthe monster and i explained that the monster never comes this way except this time to help rescue you he knows the sea hag of old she shook her head you seem like such a nice person how can you say such a mean thing about mother sweet ness she refused to believe him for that he could hardly blame heryet somehow he had to convince her well golem in the gears i understand that she cant take over a persons body unless that person gives permission so if you dont give permission then maybe youll be safe even if you dont believe you dont want your body taken over by another person do you rapunzel shuddered fetchingly no of course not but i just cant believe that mother hagi mean mother sweetness would ever do such a thing shes taken such good care of me because the sea sweetnessi mean the sea hag wants to have the best possible body to use she has prepared you exactly for her purpose telling you only what she wants you to know preventing you from ever learning the truth does she know youve been corre sponding with ivy of course i was afraid she would be vexed but when she learned that ivy was only a child she decided that it was all right children dont know very much but im not allowed any other punpals because she doesnt want you to leam anything about the real world not until its too late rapunzel shook her head i just cant believe there was a voice from outside rapunzel rapunzel let down your long hair oh shes back the girl exclaimed her hand flying to her mouth in alarm she mustnt find you here grundy felt the same but he was trapped he and snortimer couldnt escape with the hag waiting below what was he to do now chapter the sea hag kapunzel the hag called more peremptorily from below oh i must let her in the girl said jumping off the couch and becoming humansized you mustnt grundy said she and i are natural enemies i dont know what to do rapunzel exclaimed dis traught whatever you do dont let her in grundy said she is an evil creature rapunzel the hag called again i just cant believe what you say about mother sweet ness rapunzel said going to the window grundy realized that the more he tried to condemn the hag the more it damaged his own credibility in the dam sels eyes he would have to face the hag directly he dreaded the prospect but saw no alternative then let her in he said with resignation rapunzel was already taking the combs out of her hair and letting it drop down outside the tower then she braced herself as the hag took hold below grundy saw how the slack went out of her hair and how it jerked as it was hauled on but this did not seem to discomfit the girl as it might have her head moved golem in the gears only marginally as the hair took the weight of the climber he realized that this was part of its magic not only did it add no particular volume or weight to her head it nul lified the weight of what touched it as far as rapunzel was concerned she really seemed to be a creature of two magic talentsbut he knew that the magic of heredity didnt count as a talent so her sizechanges werent a talent the rules of magic could seem devious at times but they were reasonably consistent what was he going to say to the dread sea hag he was horrified by the prospect of this confrontation she doesnt have any other magic he reminded himself des perately all she can do is kill herself and take over the body of whoever lets her i dont need to be afraid of that but he was afraid he wished he could have avoided this scene if only he had left before the hag returned all too soon the hag reached the window and scram bled in she was indeed an ugly creature she wore a black cloak and black cap with a dangerouslooking hat pin and black highheeled boots and black gloves even had she been beautiful her aspect would have seemed sinister her facial features were not physically deformed in a picture they might have seemed ordinary considering her evident age but evil animated them causing her mouth to be lined with cruelty her nose to project snoopiness her ears to be attuned to slanderous sounds and her eyes to focus on all that was ugliest in the situation grundy hated her instantly and thoroughlybut he was also sickly afraid of her mother sweetness rapunzel exclaimed embracing the hag that appalled grundy but he dared not protest the old woman glared about her nose sniffing i smell intruder she snapped then her mean old eyes fastened on grundy golem in the gears ii have a visitor rapunzel explained faintly thats no visitorthats a wretched golem the hag hissed you arent any great beauty yourself picklesnoot grundy retorted automatically before he realized what he was going to do his terror of the hag reduced him to his most fundamental nature the smart mouth ill get rid of it the hag exclaimed she strode to a closet and fetched out a broom whatcha going to do with that witchride it grundy demanded im going to sweep you right out of this tower she exclaimed coming at him with the broom oh rapunzel exclaimed appalled by this violence suddenly grundy realized that this could be a way to convince the damsel of the truth about the hag let the evil witch show her nature you couldnt sweep the dust out of your ears old snoop he taunted her dodging nimbly to the side as the deadly broom swept across stand still you runt and ill flatten you the hag grunted smashing the broom down at him but grundy had had decades of experience dodging just such attacks and readily avoided the blow however he paced himself so as to be just a little way clear so that the hag would not know how clumsy her attack was this had an unanticipated effect it fooled rapunzel too and she screamed as the broom landed ooo youll squish him she cried horrified grundy was quick to take advantage of the situation he scrambled to the damsel and hauled himself up her skirt and to her pretty shoulder dont let her squish me he pleaded in her fair ear the hag enraged raised the broom like a club and golem in the gears golem in the gears charged forwardonly to discover where grundy had gone she paused broom threatening what are you doing mother sweetness rapunzel cried distraught ive never seen you like this the hag lowered the broom and composed herself not wishing to disillusion the damsel after all if rapunzel ever got the notion that the hag was evil she would not cooperate by yielding her body for the hags use this grundy realized was the true confrontation the question of whether hag or golem was telling the truth if he could win that he would be able to rescue the dam sel if he could not then all was lost the hag forced a smile to her malevolent face i am only trying to rid this chamber of this rodent she explained ask her why she keeps you prisoner here grundy suggested but you are not a prisoner my dear the hag pro tested before rapunzel could speak this is your home ask her why you never get to go out grundy prompted but someone must remain to supervise the lighthouse lamp the hag said it operates independently but sometimes it glitches and then it must be promptly attended to you know that my dear now just let me remove this vermin she extended her gloved hand ask her why she doesnt tend the lamp while you go out grundy said quickly but you dont know the outside world the hag said yes i do mother sweetness rapunzel said you have taught me all about xanth havent you this made the hag pause she had of course taught the damsel only what she felt it was safe for the damsel to know and that would also be useful after she took over the body herself naturally a lot had been omitted but it would be awkward to admit that has she told you about the way the monster of the sea never uses the lighthouse beam grundy asked the damsel but the monster does use it the hag protested as innocently as she could pretend how odd that the monster told me the opposite grundy remarked rapunzel are you going to believe this little liar the hag demanded now rapunzel hesitated she really did not know whom to believe i grundy saw that straight dialogue was not going to do it he would have to force the hags hand more directly and that would be risky maybe im wrong he said to the hag if i stop insulting you will you let me alone the sinister calculations passed almost visibly across the evil face the hag didnt know how much he might have told the damsel before the hags return or how much of that the damsel believed certainly she didnt want him staying around to utter more truths to the dam sel she would try to eliminate him at the earliest oppor tunity why of course you littlecreature the hag said with a semblance of sincerity so far so good then ill just cross over to the bed and rest myself grundy said he climbed down rapun zel who was a bit startled by the procedure and scooted across the floor to the bed he hiked himself up the leg of it stay alert he muttered to snortimer as he passed he reached the top and made himself comfortable how about something to eat old crone he inquired politely the hag stiffened as he had suspected she had not golem in the gear taught rapunzel the meaning of terms like crone the damsel probably thought it was a respectful address and the hag dared not signify otherwise then the hag smiled though it was as if she had to use hooks to stretch her grim mouth into the configura tion of course golem ill be right back she trundled out to the kitchen mother sweetness always speaks the truth to you grundy asked in the moment that granted him he knew the hag was listening and would zip right back if he tried to disillusion the damsel always rapunzel agreed so if you ever found her deceiving you in one thing here is your food the hag said back already she carried a chunk of hardbread almost as big as grundy himself thats great old trot he said with a smile set it down right there he gestured to the foot of the bed but the hag was bringing it right to him i know this will do you good she said between her clenched teeth on your mark snort he murmured lowlevel suddenly the hag dropped the roll and grabbed grundy ha ive got you you little chunk of garbage she exclaimed what are you going to do with me grotesque hag grundy demanded loudly im going to wring your stupid tiny sniveling neck golem she said but you promised to leave me alone snotface and you were fool enough to believe me you bit of rag and bone she exclaimed with satisfaction but that means you broke your word prunebottom he said as if shocked golem in the gear oh rapunzel cried with maidenly dismay the hag glanced back at her oh shucks she mut tered well ill get her straightened around after im rid of you she always listens to my side when theres noth ing else and she took hold ofgrundys head and started to twist now snort he screamed a huge hairy hand reached out from under the bed and grasped the hags thin ankle it squeezed and yanked the hag let out a truly grotesque shriek and dropped grundy simultaneously there was a snort of deep disgust snortimers because of the poor quality of the ankle he had had to grab grundy was ready for this instead of falling he clung to the witchs hand scrambled to her arm and up to her shoulder there in her cap was the huge metal hatpin he had spied before while she flailed with her arms trying to catch her balance he took hold of the round knob at the base of the pin and hauled the length of steel out of the hat in a moment he had a fine sword the hag finally managed to wrench her foot away from snortimers grasp grundy jumped down to the bed hold ing his weapon he bounced several times as if on a mundane trampoline but kept his balance whats a monster doing under this bed the hag screeched grundy scrambled off the bed and dashed across to rapunzel are you satisfied now he called to her you saw her break her word there must be some misunderstanding rapunzel breathed distraught she couldnt have meant to hey old bag grundy called to the hag what are you going to do with me when you catch me again im going to bite your troublesome little wooden head golem in the gears golem in the gears off and spit it into the sea golem she called back right after i hack this bed monster to pieces and cook it in the pot no misunderstanding as you can see grundy said shes an evil old woman who has deceived you all along she cares nothing for you only for your bodywhen shes ready to take it for herself no no rapunzel cried completely shocked that cant be true hey old dog how old are you grundy called to the hag is it true you were born yesterday im thousands of years old the hag cried stalking him again with the broom thats impossible grundy exclaimed you dont look a day over a century this body is only sixty years old the hag said swinging the broom i took it forty years ago from the last girl i raised in this tower just as you are going to take rapunzels body grundy said sneeringly as he dodged the swipe of course nobody believes such nonsense nonsense she screeched im a sorceress you contraption of rag you mean to say you never cared for rapunzel at all old frump the hag intent on stalking him had grown heedless of the damsels presence of course not golem no more than i cared for any of the fifty maidens i used before theyre all mere fodder for my longevity grundy saw rapunzel lean against the wall as if about to faint she had had enough snortimer he cried in monstertongue when i douse the light you go tie the damsels hair to the chair get her out the window and help her climb down ill distract the sea hag snortimer snorted agreement from under the bed then grundy lunged at the lamp with his weapon running it through the glass chimney shattered the flame shot high then puffed out they were in darkness think that will save you golem the hag cried bashing at the spot with the broom no but maybe this will he cried he strode forward and plunged the hatpin where he judged one of her big feet was he scored the pin stabbed into bony flesh the hag let out an earsplitting screech and jumped back she wasnt seriously damaged for the leather of her boot pro tected her foot but now she was twice as angry as before there was an exclamation from rapunzel go with snortimer grundy cried to her make yourself small get on his back hell take you safely down but you she faltered grundy lunged at the hags ankle catching it a grazing blow i will follow once you are safe he jumped back as the broom came at him again telling its position more by sound than sight you little piece of excrement the hag cried when i get through with you you wont be more than a spot on the wall and the broom smashed down with such force that the wind almost blew him off his feet you cant even catch me you big piece of excre ment grundy responded just let me make another light the hag said she fumbled her way to the kitchen where there was evidently another lamp going down snortimer called in monstertongue on your way grundy replied i dont know how much longer i can distract her the hag came back carrying a new lamp light flooded golem in the gear the chamber wheres the damsel she screeched abruptly realizing what had happened shes gone old fang grundy informed her she has escaped your clutches at last the hag dashed to the window shes descending her own hair she cried ill cut it off she drew an immense carving knife she had evidently brought from the kitchen oops grundy hadnt counted on this one slash with that knife and rapunzel and snortimer would both plunge to the rocks below he charged forwardbut now the hag could see him she pointed the terrible blade at him come within range golem and ill skewer you right through your big mouth grundy hesitated her threat was no bluff she could and would do exactly that he would not be able to do anyone much good if she wiped him out strangely he felt no fear now just a wary frustration how could he distract the hag long enough to allow rapunzel and snor timer to reach the foot of the tower the hag reached behind her and caught the hank of hair that went out the window it was securely knotted to the chair and the chair was too big to fit through the window so the anchorage was good but now the hag slowly brought the knife to the taut hair one cut and poof she cackled grinning grundy thought fast if he charged in she would skewer him then cut the hair his hatpin was no match for her knife if he threw the hatpin at her it might distract her a moment but couldnt really hurt her and then he would be without any weapon if he insulted her again she would merely get even by cutting the hair he had to find some other way he found it logic if you cut that hair rapunzel will fall to her deathand you wont have a nice young body golem in the gears to take over youll be stuck up here with no way to get down and no body left to take but mine yuck she exclaimed she looked at the knife then withdrew it youre only halfright golem but thats enough im not limited to whatevers close at hand when i become a ghost i can travel any distance to seek a new host but it is true that i dont enjoy pot luck id much rather have the body i have so carefully prepared young and beautiful and packed with exactly the information i have chosen so i wont kill her she grimaced but you i have no use for you i can dispatch now she lunged for him her blade sweeping through the place where he stood but grundy alert for exactly this treachery jumped straight up came down after her hand passed and stabbed a mighty stab of the hatpin into the back of her hand yowch she screeched wrenching her hand away the pin was caught in it grundy had to let go lest he be carried along but he made good use of this new moment of distraction he ran to the lamp and shoved at its base trying to push it over in darkness he would be relatively safe oh no you dont she exclaimed recovering herself enough to snatch up the lamp it had been too heavy for him to budge quickly enough that ploy had failed grundy scrambled for the window he grabbed the hair and started to let himself down outside the hair was now slack below him snort and rapunzel had reached the bottom but now the hags head poked out the window i dont want her to die but im happy to have you die golem she exclaimed putting the knife to the hair again she had him this time grundy could neither let go nor stop her his life was in her hands but perhaps his wit golem in the gear could save him if you cut it youll still be trapped up there he said you can kill yourself and seek another bodybut right now rapunzel wont accept you so youll be stuck with whatever else is handy and then youll have to die again to get to rapunzel youll have to get her up here again without her hair to climb on thats an awful lot of trouble to get one silly golem confound it she swore i hadnt thought of that i dont like to die any more times than i have to it hurts for one thing and im disoriented for a while after i move into a new host the girl would be apt to get away too bad old wrinkle he agreed for a moment he thought he had overdone it for her knife slashed at the hair but then she stopped youll not trick me that way golem i will preserve my descent but maybe i can still get rid of you and she took hold of the hair and started to shake it grundys grip on the hair was already tiring for he was not used to sustained hanging now he was banged against the ivory wall he was in worse trouble than ever even if she stopped moving the hair it would not be long before he fell on his own it was a long way down but at least he had saved rapunzel if he had to die this was the way to do it he had at least done somebody some good get away monster the hag cried angrily grundy wondered at that as his hands lost power he was hardly a monster then his grip slipped his little hands tore free of the hair and he fell into the night chapter escape a big hairy hand caught him and hauled him in grundy tried to fight thinking it was the hagthen realized it was snortimer you caught me he exclaimed dazed well i was coming up to get you anyway the bed monster replied gruffly in monstertongue grundy shut up he was weak with relief he had thought he was going to die but was glad he had not after all he had not yet completed his quest it would have been very embarrassing snortimer carried him down to the base where rapun zel waited in the pale moonlight apparently this emer gency had caused the bed monster to become less shy of that light rapunzel was humansized and sitting in the hags rowboat for the tide had come in and flooded the island grundy wondered whether she had remained that size while snortimer carried her down the wall she must have been very heavy but if she had turned small then what about her hair that had remained fullsized well it wasnt worth worrying about they were all safely down and they had the boat but rapunzels hair was tied to the chair at the top of the ivory tower she could not travel from this spot unless golem in the gear the damsel drew out a pair of scissors oh i really hate to do this she exclaimed but but what choice was there they had to get moving before the dawn she handed the scissors to snortimer you do it she told the monster snortimer took the scissors in one big hairy hand and grabbed her hair with the other holding it firmly clear of her head he hacked away with the scissors in a moment rapunzels head of hair was short and wild while the remainder of her tresses swung from the tower it was done tentatively she touched her head how do i look awful grundy said without thinking rapunzel burst into tears my lovely hair she cried in anguish snortimer mortified scuttled under the seat grundy hated to see such a lovely creature in distress her hair was nightmarish but rapunzel herself remained beautiful he had to reassure her i meant he started i know what you meant she wailed but you were so brave to cut it off he said she brightened slightly was i really so you think youve gotten away do you the hag called from above well you havent im coming down weve got to get away grundy exclaimed rapun zel youre big enough to use the oars dont you dare the hag called you just sit right there girl until i come for you rapunzel sat frozen we have to move grundy cried take the oars and row golem in the gears i cant rapunzel said tearfully mother sweetness told me not to but shes not your friend grundy reminded her she only wants to use your body i know but still i cant directly oppose her shes all i have known grundy realized that he was up against a truly nice person rapunzel even though she now knew the facts simply could not bring herself to act in a contrary manner she couldnt betray the person she had known all her life meanwhile the hag was climbing out the window obviously she intended to climb down the hair land in the boat toss grundy and snortimer overboard and carry the damsel back up to the chamber atop the ivory tower with rapunzel captive again the hag would have all the time she needed to persuade her that it was all a bad dream and in the end she would have the body he had to do something but what it simply was not possible for him to man the big oars himself snortimer can you but then the moonlight intensified and the little mon ster scrambled farther under the seat he was no help not while the light was too strong grundy looked about above the heaving sea a mean little cloud hovered that was the one that had moved out of the way allowing the moonlight to shine down on them unimpeded was that coincidence that cloud had a familiar look could it be cumulo practo nimbus this was just the kind of thing that cloud would do when it saw its oppor tunity but maybe grundy could turn that malice to his advan tage he knew that fracto had a bad temper and a lot of hot air if he could make the cloud blow its cool golem in the gears golem in the gear hey fracto he called what are you doing so far from home youd better get back to land where its safe the cloud huffed visibly that was fracto all right meanwhile the hag was starting down the hair this was going to be close fracto youre nothing but a windbag grundy cried you used up all your power back in the gap you couldnt work up a decent storm now to save your foggy skin the cloud puffed up ominously an experimental bit of lightning flashed and there was a rumble of thunder dont pull your fakery with me foggybottom grundy cried i know youre just a cottonpuff all you can do is huff and puff and rattle around you dont have enough power to blow at that ivory tower even the cloud huffed and puffed and blew at the tower hey the hag cried watch what youre doing you soggy mass of nothing affronted fracto blew harder the hag swung about on the hair banging into the tower she was only a quarter of the way down and couldnt move well while the wind was blowing leave my ugly friend alone grundy yelled with sud den inspiration naturally fracto now concentrated on the hag the cloud moved nearer the tower and began spitting rain at it get away from here you vacuous piece of mist the hag screamed furious yeah cauliflowernimbus grundy put in do what she says the cloud was really worked up now it had swelled to triple its prior size and fairly glowed with contained lightning it oriented more carefully on the tower the hag perceiving this development hastily scram bled back up the hair toward the safety of the chamber she didnt want to get caught halfway down when that storm let loose fracto seeing her trying to escape hastily sleeted on her tiny pellets of ice bounced off the tower but they werent enough to make the hair slippery see grundy called nastily your real name must be cucumberfractionnimble a jag of lightning fired out of the cloud to strike the tower but the tower was impervious to influences from outside it stood unaffected the hag clambered back into the chamber then turned to lean out and shake her fist at the cloud ill occupy a roc and flap you into oblivion she screeched the cloud had not only driven back the hag it had blotted out most of the moonlight come on snortimer grundy said rapunzel clapped her hands that was very clever of you grundy she exclaimed goodshe had recovered from her stasis now if he could just get her safely away from the tower before the hag realized snortimer grabbed the oars and began to row but the boat was moored to the base of the tower untie it grundy cried for the knot was too massive for him to handle he had been speaking to snortimer but it was the damsel who did it that was interestingshe answered to the voice of authority wherever it might be they nudged out to sea but now the storm was striking in earnest hailstones plopped into the water all around them get under cover grundy yelled afraid the dam sel would be struck golem in the gears golem in the gears rapunzel changed to golemsize and ran under the seat snortimer shipped the oars and joined her grundy went there too as the hailstones began scoring on the boat the waves were getting so rough that it would have been useless to row anyway in fact they were too rough the boat rocked up and down proceeding from apex to trough in horrendous fash ion and water began slopping inside oh well drown rapunzel cried grundy knew he had brought it upon them he had used the storm to stop the hag but now it threatened to stop them too maybe i can summon the monster of the sea he said hes out here somewhere and if we drift far enough from the tower he can pick us up he climbed to the top of the seat oh be careful the damsel cried got to be done grundy said grimly he worked his way to the side youre so brave rapunzel said brave im terrified he said and he was but he saw no other course he braced himself stood up as tall as he could and yelled monster of the sea monster of the sea can you hear me there was no answer he called again and again but either the noise of the storm was too great or the monster was too far away to hear or both a larger wave washed over knocking him down one of snortimers hairy hands reached out and caught him before he tumbled to the bottom of the boat or worse overboard he was getting to like hairy hands what were you doing rapunzel asked frightened i thought you were going to call the monster i was calling the monster grundy snapped as he shook some of the water off his body but you were honking were you blowing your nose thats monstertalk you mean you can talk their language she asked amazed certainly im the golem of communication i can talk to any living thing oh thats impressive she said she was not being sarcastic for there was not a sarcastic bone in her lovely body she was really impressed another wave smashed across the boat but he didnt answer grundy said gruffly and if we dont make contact with him soon maybe if she began hesitantly yes it was better to keep talking so that the hope lessness of their situation would not be too apparent if you can talk to anything again she hesitated i can but maybe if you asked a fish grundy knocked his head gently against the side of the boat of course he could send a fish as a messenger to the monster good idea rapunzel he exclaimed giv ing her a quick squeeze he scrambled back up to the seat and the edge heed less of the waves and yelled at the water hey any good fish about there was no answer he realized that the fish being underwater couldnt hear him he had to get into their medium hey snort tie a line to my foot so i can dangle in the water no rapunzel exclaimed putting her fingers to her mouth in that maidenly way she had got to be done grundy said i have to talk to the fish in their medium snortimer was good at handling cords and ropes golem in the gears golem in the gears because of his several strong hands in moments he had grundy secured by the feet pull me out after a moment so i dont drown grundy told him and jumped over board the water caught him the moment he entered hauling him back he scraped along the outside of the boat before the slack was taken up then he called to the fish in fish tongue hey you poor fish my name is grundy i need a messenger now a fish swam up it was a big bass my name is tard i need a meal it said and opened its big mouth wide grundy scrambled to get away but could not the line held him fast he kicked at the fishs nose then snor timer hauled on the cord and grundy was drawn up and out of the water escaping did you talk to one rapunzel asked anxiously not exactly grundy spluttered i was almost eaten by a big bass tard ive heard theyll eat anything the damsel said dis approvingly got to try again grundy said and jumped back into the water i need a messenger he called alert for the bass a chunk offish floated by in a moment an aggressive masculine fish arrived did you see the rest of the cod i was eating it inquired grundy decided not to aggravate this one the cod piece went that way he said pointing thanks pal the fish said swimming after it i wouldnt want to lose that meat then snortimer hauled him up again not yet grundy reported on his third descent he spied a flying fish just getting ready to take off hey take a message to the monster of the sea he called to it tell him where we are wilico roger the fish replied and accelerated out of the water i think weve got it grundy gasped as snortimer hauled him up again i told a flying fish theyre very fast they retreated under the seat to ride out the storm until the monster came a fair amount of water was now sloshing around in the bottom of the boat making things uncomfortable but they were hopeful that they would soon be rescued then a monstrous green tentacle flung itself over the boat rapunzel screamed whats that thats the tentacle of a kraken weed grundy said with horror then to the kraken what are you doing here a flying fish told me there was food here the mon ster replied in krakentalk grundys hope sank out of sight the fish told the wrong monster he cried another tentacle came over the boat holding it fast a third one came snaking down under the seat looking for prey rapunzel screamed again damsels were very good at screaming in emergencies even those raised in ivory towers snortimer grabbed the tentacle in a big hairy hand and squeezed it ouch the kraken cried and threw in three more tentacles snortimer grabbed two more of them but more came in too many for him to overcome slowly they dragged him from under the seat rapunzels scream ing was continuous then the kraken grunted and let go its tentacles twisted and thrashed about in a moment it was gone oolem in the geon what happened the damsel asked uncertain whether it was all right to cease screaming grundy looked out a huge shape loomed beside the boat our monsters arrived he exclaimed relieved when i saw the weed going somewhere so fast i was suspicious the monster said i thought a damsel might be in distress you were right grundy exclaimed then he trans lated for rapunzel oh im so happy to be rescued she exclaimed she changed to human size leaned over and patted the mon sters nearest flipper the monster blushed pink with plea sure now the storm was abating light returnedbut not moonlight dawn grundy cried appalled and we dont have the bed just tell me where to go the monster said picking the boat up by a flipper and setting it on his back there are a few minutes yet before the sun comes up back to the golden grotto grundy cried the mon ster moved out churning up a violent wave it was the fastest he had ever moved fracto in the sky spied them the cloud darkened then reconsidered catching on to their problem it started to lighten to let more of the light of day past the sky lightened and snortimer whimpered and wedged as far under the seat as he could they zoomed up to the rocky golden shore but here the water was relatively shallow the monster could not go all the way since the tide remained low still the light brightened as the cloud malevolently dissolved its vapors grundy realized that there was no time for finesse throw the boat grundy cried well hang on the monster picked the boat up again with a flipper goiem in the gears then heaved the boat flew through the air and splashed violently in the shallow water just beneath the rock formation where the bed was hidden it was an awful jolt but grundy couldnt afford to worry about that climb out he told snortimer the beds close but it was already too bright snortimer huddled under the bench petrified unable to move out rapunzel had gone to golemsize for the throw get as big as you can grundy told her stand in the water she jumped into the water becoming full humansized now reach in and grab snortimer grundy directed hes not that big just haul him out and toss him into that cave she did as directed the bed monster paralyzed by the brightness around them offered no resistance in a moment he landed in the cave youre there grundy cried at him get under the bed but snortimer was too far gone he just lay there beside the bed stuff him under there grundy cried to rapunzel quickly she obeyed the monster was finally back where he belonged but was it in time rapunzel lifted grundy up to the cave and set him on the bed then she held his hand and joined him there golemsize again is he all right she asked worriedly grundy spread his hands i dont know he had bad exposure well just have to wait and see if he recovers whats the situation the monster of the sea honked hes under the bedbut hurt grundy reported we dont know how bad it is is the damsel all right golem in the gears shes all right grundy reassured him you liberated her then i must be going the monster of the sea honked i can not long remain in this shallow water go and welcome grundy agreed you have done all that could have been asked he had discovered some where in the course of this quest that things tended to work better if he erred on the side of more credit for others rather than less insults had their place of course but so did compliments it was an interesting discovery whose ramifications he had yet to explore properly take the boat with you so the hag cant use it weve got her confined to the ivory tower the monster drew on the trailing rope on the boat and brought the craft to him he set it on his back and pushed out to sea good fortune hero and damsel he honked in parting grundy jumped what did he say rapunzel asked but grundy was too embarrassed to tell her hero him what a joke chapter coming to terms tired from the rigors of the night they lay on the bed and slept there was plenty of room for both of them as rapunzel remained golemsized she slept at one end and grundy at the other at noon grundy woke and got up he peered under the bed snortimer still lay without moving yet he was not dead bed monsters dissolved into dust when their ends came there was still hope grundy went outside the cave to forage for something to eat he found a patch of sugar sand and a puddle of reasonably fresh water those would have to do rapunzel was up when he returned he explained about the sand and water apologetically to his surprise she seemed pleased ive never eaten directly from the real world she said it will be a new experience some experience but he took her to the sand and puddle and she ate and drank and expressed satis faction is he going to get better she asked grundy spread his hands i just dont know how bad it is he confessed im hoping that rest is all he needs they returned to the cave but snortimer was no better they sat on the bed and worried i promised to help him golem in the gears search for romance grundy said dispiritedly what have i brought him romance she asked combing her hair with a little silver comb she had with her as she got her shorn hair in better order it looked nicer she was still the prettiest creature he had seen he was lonely under his bed he wanted to find a female of his kind before hewell you know that bed monsters usually dont survive after the children on their beds grow up and stop believing yes of course i was brought up to be rational so i never had a real monster under my bed i really missed that but wait grundy said realizing youre not a child now how is it that snortimer was able to hide under your bed its not age that decides it she explained its atti tude most children think its grownup not to believe in bed monsters so when they grow up they dont but since i didnt have a bed monster i never had the expe rience of truly believing and so never grew out of it you have to experience something fully before you can leave it behind so im retarded in ways like that im still ready to accept a bed monster and my bed showed it if youre retarded i hope you never grow up grundy exclaimed i mean that i havent had the experience of the real world she explained i know about it but i havent experienced it so i know a lot about bed monsters but snortimer is the first i have actually encountered im so sorry he came all this way for nothing for nothing grundy asked blankly he cant find romance there is no female of his kind what grundy asked appalled gotem in the gear bed monsters dont breed the way other creatures do they dont reproduce they form spontaneously from the dust under a childs bed and they dissolve back into dust when the child stops being a child snortimers the only one i know of who has traveled away from his bed well actually we brought the bed along but but his whole hope is vain she concluded i sup pose well have to tell him if if he pulls through this crisis of light exposure grundy said morosely if i had known about this i would never have of course she agreed quickly you are a nice per son grundy laughed ironically im neither nice nor a per son im a loudmouthed golem you certainly are a person she insisted and a brave one too the way you fought mother sweet ness but this brought her up short oh i wish i hadnt thought of that she really wasnt what you thought grundy said uncomfortably naturally she didnt show her mean side to you i realize that now i see that there were inconsisten cies in the picture of xanth she presented for me if there were no things i didnt know about why wouldnt she allow me to leave the tower everything seemed to make sense from the tower now that im away from it i can see that reality isnt quite the same still mother sweet ness was the only person i knew and it really hurts me to know that she i guess its the same kind of shock for you that it will be for snortimer when he learns that youre very perceptive grundy no im not i just happen to know what its like golem in the gears what its like she asked blankly to have no female of your species but golems can be made in any type she protested but not living golems when i was wood and rag all i wanted was to become real but when i became real i discovered i was alone i never thought of that thats terrible grundy anyway thats not my quest he said uncomforta bly im searching for ivys little dragon friend stanley steamer the good magician told me to ride the bed monster to the ivory tower and now ive done that but i still dont know where stanley is but i know that she cried clapping her hands theres a young sixlegged dragon with the fauns and nymphs a steamer he asked excited yes he arrived there about three years ago in a puff of smoke hes all right so i understand then why didnt he go home to ivy the fauns and nymphs wont let him go then her fair brow furrowed but thats strange i realize now the fauns and nymphs are supposed to be innocent folk who dont hurt any creature how could they hold a dragon captive there must be a side to them that the hag didnt tell you about grundy said grimly i know stanley would have returned to ivy if he possibly could have she shook her head it must be so the fauns and nymphs migrated south when the ogres migrated north now the ogres are up by the ogrefenogre pen and the fauns and nymphs are down below lake ogrechobee golem in the gears its really not a great distance from here as the roc flies im sure stanley could have gone home if permitted well im going to rescue him and bring him home grundy said i have to or ivy will do something dis astrous shes a little sorceress you know yes shes to be queen of xanth one day i suppose when she grows up shell stop corresponding with me adults dont believe in punpals any more than they do in bed monsters she dipped her gaze sadly i wish i could have met her but you can meet her grundy said youre free of the ivory tower now why so i am she agreed surprised but im not sure i could travel all that way alone the fact that i know about the dragons and other creatures of xanth doesnt mean i could handle them if i encountered them in fact im sure i couldnt you can travel with us grundy said were going there just as soon as we rescue stanley why so you are she agreed smiling gladly but im afraid i would only be in your way i dont see why snortimer could carry both of us hes strong enough then he remembered the bed mon sters state only she sighed only hes ill she finished i had for gotten what will you do grundy if he grundy shrugged ill just have to go on alone but then i could go with you on foot i dont think you would like that she pondered maybe you could talk to animals and get a ride for us he nodded yes i could do that but id rather go with snortimer hes been a good steed and a good friend and golem in the gears surely he will get better she said positively surely he will grundy agreed but a big ugly doubt was hovering about him only she began yes what about the bed grundy sighed youre right we have to take that along but i should be able to get an animal to carry it then rapunzel screamed grundy jumped up what where that she cried pointing at the floor grundy looked his heart sank a nickelpede he exclaimed thats rightthey infest these caves they like the gold though they cant eat it some creatures are like that where theres one theres hundreds its searching for meat grundy said can it reach us up here on the bed in time but its not after us its after snortimer she put her hand to her mouth oh she cried with new horror weve got to stop it he decided if it doesnt return to its nest the others wont know snortimers here he moved to the edge of the bed but how can we stop it she asked peering down ill need a weapon he said he looked wildly about i wish id saved that hatpin i have a fairly large pin she said of course its small now because change size and get it for me he said urgently she changed to human size reached into her dress and brought out a large pin she handed this to grundy then changed back to his size golem in the gears the pin made a good sword grundy held the shaft between his teeth and climbed down the leg of the bed the nickelpede was now approaching one of snorti mers limp hands it was a roughly circular creature stand ing about kneehigh to him but its two big claws reached up menacingly they seemed to be goldplated this was one rich little monster grundy stabbed at the thing with his pin the point was sharp but it scraped off the metallic hide and did no harm the nickelpede clicked its claws and advanced forcing grundy to jump back those pincers could gouge diskshaped chunks out of metal they could surely do worse to his flesh he circled around seeking some vulnerable spot sup pose he skewered an eye that would set the thing back there was only one problem he couldnt find any eyes the thing had feelers or antennae and when he stabbed at them they simply swayed aside how about the feet the thing had six or eight little pedal extremities and they couldnt be too heavily armored or they would impede its walking if he took out several feet that might ground it he watched for an opening then stabbed at a foot he missedbut the nickelpede didnt one of its claws whipped around and caught his pin crunch grundy was left holding half a pin dismayed he backed away the nickelpede pursued aware of its advantage grundy tripped over a ridge in the stone floor and fell on his back the nickelpede clacked its mandibles and scuttled toward him something huge came down the nickelpede disap peared startled grundy rubbed his eyes and looked again golem in the gears the huge thing was rapunzel humansized she had stepped on the nickelpede ooo ick she exclaimed stepping away the nickelpede was done for she had squished it but in a moment she was back to golemsize standing on the bed her face in her hands grundy climbed back up you saved me he exclaimed i just couldnt let you get chomped she sobbed ooo i never did anything like that before im glad you did i messed up the way i usually do and if you hadnt you were so brave when i saw you fall im not brave he protested i was terrified well you looked brave he wasnt used to this sort of compliment and didnt know how to handle it so he changed the subject there are bound to be other nickelpedes coming we need some better way to hold them off do you know of anything better than stomping if we could find a nickelodeon she said uncertainly a what they eat nickelpedes there are supposed to be some along the gold coast but i dont know exactly where ill go out and find one he said but what if another nickelpede comes before you get back she wailed stomp it he snapped and scrambled down the leg of the bed and across the floor of the cave she didnt answer he didnt like being gruff with her but knew that if he didnt solve the problem of the nickel pedes soon they would both suffer a lot more grief than hurt feelings the other nickelpedes of the region would golem in the gears soon smell the blood of the first and converge and when they did no amount of stomping would stop them above the grotto he approached the first plant he spied hey leaftophave you seen any nickelodeons here abouts to his surprise the plant responded certainly one prowls this region all the time point in its direction he cried soon he was on his way tracing down the nickelodeon he could hardly believe his fortune before long he reached its lair the thing turned out to be a somewhat dumpy box with a slot in the side it didnt look like much but he had to trust rapunzels information he hoped it was alive so that he could talk to it are you alive he inquired cautiously in human tongue the box shook itself what a note it rumbled that enabled him to identify its language are you hungry he asked the nickelodeon im always hungry it responded but its getting harder to catch my meals if you come with me ive got a place where nickel pedes are coming in on their own if you wait quietly on my way the odd creature agreed rising on a number of little legs and traveling along when they reached the grotto they found rapunzel distraught she had trodden on three more nickelpedes but remained terrified of them and appalled at herself oh i wish i had never left the ivory tower she cried blowing her nose into a dainty hanky already she was missing her captivity how bad would it be if the sea hag got her alone and started in with the mother sweetness business you crawl under the bed next to the bed monster and golem in the gears wait grundy told the nickelodeon take only the ones that actually come under the bed so as not to alert the others can you do that trust me to know my business the creature replied it wedged under the bed grundy clambered back to the top of the bed come on up here he called to rapunzel smallsize in a moment she was with him still sniffly it was horrible she said i dont know which i hate worse those nickelpedes or having to squish them we should be all right now he said reassuringly i found a nickelodeon oh wonderful she exclaimed brightening imme diately if she reacted strongly to negatives she reacted just as strongly to positives grundy was not used to associating with a person whose moods were this mer curial but he found he rather liked it rapunzel had no affectation she was honest in her responses as a child was they waited and watched and soon spied another nickelpede slinking in from a shadow these creatures like bed monsters could not stand much light but of course grundy could not afford to move snortimer into the day even if he had had the size and strength to do it the nickelpede moved under the bed there was a kind of click and slurp then there was a strange sound grundy and rapunzel exchanged a glance thats a song she whispered grundy peered over the edge of the bed whos sing ing he asked in nickelodeon language i am the box replied i always sing when i eat grundy shrugged but didnt object it took all kinds to make xanth actually its rather pretty music rapunzel said golem in the geare just so long as it keeps every nickelpede away from snortimer grundy muttered they waited and the music continued as more nick elpedes arrived what was going on below was horrific but the music made it seem almost nice back on the boat rapunzel said after a while you did something may i ask you why i was only trying to get us safely to land he said oh certainly and an excellent job you did too but this was something else grundy shrugged tell me what i did and ill tell you why youyou squeezed me i did he asked surprised when i suggested you use a fish as a messenger why did you do that now he remembered iin the distraction of the moment i acted without thinking i apologize for but i liked it she said grundy reconsidered it was such a good suggestion i justwell it was just my quick way of saying thank you why didnt you just say thank you grundy shrugged embarrassed i should have i guess it justit just seemed to be a better way at the time mother sweetness never squeezed me she said of course not she didnt really like you oh she considered for a bit then do you really like me grundy i think youre beautiful he said i dont think you answered my question i dont know how to answer it he admitted why well youre a beautiful woman and im a golem golem in the gear golem in the gears does that mean you dont like me it means he said with difficulty that i cant afford to i dont understand he knew she was not being difficult she had had no experience with the folk of the real world beyond the ivory tower she knew of them and about them but not how they interacted she didnt realize how demeaning it was to be a golem this would require some delicacy and that was a thing he wasnt used to he had always simply told off people insulting them making them react he knew he couldnt do that with rapunzel it would be like treading a delicate flower underfoot suppose snortimer met a female bed monster he reallycould like he said then he realized that there are no females of his species and that she was something else that she only looked like his type of monster could he afford toto like her why not she asked still perplexed they would be of different species he repeated but isnt it all right for creatures of different species to like each other dont you like snortimer yes of course i do but she began to cloud up but you dont like me thats not the same snortimer and i are not not what not male and female was there no gentle way out of this im female she said does that mean i cant like snortimer no he said pained thats not it of course you can like him then is it all right if i like you oh certainly but but you cant like me he just wasnt getting through he would have to be blunt though it would shock her and perhaps alienate her youright now you look just like a beautiful female golem and if you were that you would be the girl of my dreams and i would want toto have a relationship with you thatthat might lead to he stalled out it was impossible to be blunt with her but at last she caught on to mating with me she exclaimed ouch i didnt mean she looked disappointed you didnt notprecisely he said unhappily but its aca demic because youre not a golem girl and but anybody can mate with anybody in xanth she said excitedly thats how all the crossbreeds came about my ancestors were human and elven which means you have a future with either human or elven kind he said not with golem kind why not he laughed bitterly why would anyone who had the glorious worlds of human and elven kinds available ever settle for a golem why wouldnt anyone she countered because a golem is nothing he exclaimed nothing but wood and rag but youre not wood and rag anymore youre flesh just as i am the principle remains my body may have changed but im still a golem she pondered so its not really a failing in me but a failing in you now youve got it he agreed grimly golem in the gean thank you for explaining it to me i really didnt understand youre welcome he said halfway wishing he were wood and rag again then perhaps it wouldnt hurt so much but would you do one thing for me please of course i said id get you to castle roogna and squeeze me again what as you did before instead of saying thank you he was somewhat baffled and somewhat dismayed why i like it she said simply oh he stood up on the bed and she stood and he put his arms around her and squeezed diffidently no that doesnt seem the same she said because its not spontaneous that makes a difference of course it does things that are acted out are never as good as things that are natural its the difference between makebelieve and reality all my life has been makebelieve she said her face clouded up and one big tear formed in her right eye dont feel that way grundy exclaimed squeezing her more tightly you have all reality ahead of you but i dont understand reality she protested give it time girl once you get to castle roogna now it feels the same she murmured what the squeeze oh hastily he turned her loose wasnt it supposed to how could he explain he went to the edge of the bed golem in the gears and peered over he saw a nickelpede scuttling under the nickelodeon put down its slot and sucked the creature in more music played the nickelodeon spied him this is an excellent loca tion it said there should be even more nickels when night comes probably true grundy realized they would have to get out of here because when the nickelodeon became sated the nickelpedes would swarm and that would be doom for any normally fleshed creatures rapunzel joined him is he all right she asked she meant snortimer i dont know id better go down and check im sorry if i offended you she said contritely i really dont know how to interact with real people no fault in you he said embarrassed again he went to the leg of the bed and climbed down it may i come too the damsel asked there are nickelpedes down here he reminded her she decided to remain above he reached the floor circled the nickelodeon and went to snortimer the hands remained limp on the floorbut was there a hint of ani mation snortimer didnt breathe or eat the same way other creatures did but the big hairy hands did have nor mal flesh grundy touched a hand and it was warm that confirmed that he was alive snort he asked but there was no response he walked to the entrance of the grotto the shadows were lengthening outside causing the golden hue of the landscape to deepen dusk was comingwhich meant more nickelpedes if snortimer didnt revive soon he turned back rapunzel was sitting on the edge of the bed her pretty legs dangling down what are we going to do she asked golem in the gears golem in the gears legs dangling down grundy thought of something change to human size he told her she started to stand up on the bed no stay sitting there he said just changeas you are perplexed she resumed her position then changed to human size now her legs reached the floor one ofsnortimers big hairy hands quivered bed mon sters existed for no other purpose than to grab the ankles of children sitting on beds rapunzel was at times childlike in her innocence and she had ankles that any creature would like to grab would they be enough to rouse the monster make a little scream grundy told her what as if youre afraid something might grab your ankle she glanced down eeek she said starting to draw her legs out of the way that did it suddenly one of snortimers hands moved out and grabbed her ankle eeek rapunzel screamed wrenching her legs away snortimer chuckled hes back grundy cried she clapped her hands oh how clever of you to figure that out you just had the right ankles to revive him grundy said any creature who could resist them would be dead but you never grabbed them she pointed out im not a bed monster grundy didnt care to admit that he would have dearly liked to grab one other ankles had there been any respectable pretext to do so he turned and went back to the grotto entrance his gaze went out to the ivory tower now a dark spike against the dim horizon then he heard something it was a faint scream from the region of the tower followed by a splash seagulls had been patrolling the region now they veered to circle around the tower then the lighthouse beam went out something strange grundy said returning to the bed ifelt it rapunzel said putting one delicate hand to her heart something awful there was a scream and a splash from the ivory tower then the beam went out oh no she cried horrified what does it mean mother sweetness has died shehow can you know that i felt it just now but i didnt know what it was but i know that there has to be a living person in the tower or the light goes out she must have jumped grundy exclaimed his hor ror joining hers she didnt climb down the hair no point in that once we took the boat she said she cant swim but the tidewhen it recedes it is possible to walk across to land didnt she know that of course she knew that then why didnt she wait for the tide she mustshe must have wanted to die rapunzel said brokenly oh it is all my fault but she doesnt die grundy reminded her she just changes bodies yes then the damsels lovely face twisted with new horror shes ready to take a new body now and the body the sea hag wanted was rapunzels golem in the gears now abruptly her course made sense why wait for the tide while grundy and the damsel went off into the jungle where the hag might never find them when she could act more rapidly and effectively as a temporary ghost chapter siege iweve got to get out of here grundy said no use as a ghost she can move much faster than we can shes not limited to the region of her demise grundy considered how long does she have to take over a new bodydo you know she never told me anything about that the damsel said tearfully of course she wouldnt have but grundy remembered the monster of the sea saying something about twelve hours probably if the hag did not succeed in taking over rapunzels body during this night the threat would be over well when we see her ghost coming you be sure to tell her your body is your own her ghost may not be visible she pointed out most ghosts cant be seen unless they want to be still wed better move he decided we have to get clear of the nickelpede region whatever you say grundy she said frightened he went to the bed snortimer are you all right now golem in the gears all right the bed monster agreed i thought it would be easier to dissolve into dust but then i saw those ankles well have to move out the moment the darkness is complete then grundy saw another problem the bed how will we move the bed i can carry one end the damsel volunteered thats no work for a girl like you grundy protested its a long trek she shrugged maybe you can ask a monster ill go out and see what i can find ill go with you she said anxiously but suppose too many nickelpedes come we may need you to step on them but i dont want to be alone alone i mean with no human company you see im not human company im a golem i meanif shes coming to take my body there was that snortimer might not know the differ ence but probably he grundy would she cant take your body unless you let her do you plan to let her no then you should be safe from that regardless of the company youre with i dont think so if she talks to me and the hag had run the damsels life for two decades rapunzel wasnt very good at saying no to things youre right wed better stay together it was dark now and snortimer was fully operational can you carry one end of the bed grundy asked the monster sure golem in the gears then well haul it to regular ground where i can see what suitable monster i can find to carry it snortimer lifted one end and rapunzel in humansize lifted the other grundy led the way out of the grotto it was a short but difficult climb to the level land and the damsel was panting her bosom heaving in the manner that only that kind of bosom could but they completed the chore in good order on one side was the golden coast and the sea while on the other was sand and the onset of the jungle in the dim moonlight that jungle looked for bidding indeed grundy stood on the bed and called to the nearest tree in tree language are there any goodsized monsters around here theres the gold bug the tree responded whats that like it marches up and down the coast goldplating every thing does it ever go inland to lake ogrechobee never scratch that grundy muttered what did it say the damsel asked theres a gold bug but it stays strictly on the gold coast i knew that she said so do you have a better suggestion since we need to go to lake ogrechobee maybe we should find an ogre not all of them migrated north grundy brightened that was a better suggestion he moved as if to squeeze her but this time thought the better of it for one thing she remained humansized at the moment any ogres around here he asked a different tree golem in the gears that depends on your definition of ogre the tree replied say what kind of a tree are you grundy demanded suspiciously i am a casuistree that figured it was almost impossible to get any useful information from a casuistree because all it would do was argue about fine points and make hairsplitting dis tinctions he returned to the first one any ogres here theres an ogress who prowls by almost every day good enough hey ogress grundy yelled in ogre grunts we have mess she heard him hey great wont be late she bel lowed in reply and began crashing toward them by the sound of it she was proceeding in normal ogre fashion knocking trees out of the way instead of going around them rapunzel was frightened i just thought she said timidly ill make her some kind of deal grundy said reas suringly well be there in no time but supposesuppose mother sweetness takes over the ogress that stopped grundy cold if the ghost of the sea hag took over the ogress they would be in her power that would mean doom for grundy and snortimer and the tower for rapunzel there seemed little doubt the hag could take over the ogress for such monsters were noto riously stupid the crashing came nearer hey old shoe the ogress called where is you but now grundy did not dare answer the risk was too great they waited nervously hoping the ogress would not golem in the goon golem in the gean be able to find them the crashing approached then drifted astray without directions she had lost them me pound head make he dead grundy heard the angry ogress mutter in mild frustration as she moved away so much for enlisting the aid of a monster no monster could be trusted not while the ghost of the sea hag hovered near well just have to tote it ourselves grundy said regretfully this is apt to be a long hard trek i dont mind rapunzel said im not in a hurry to get to castle roogna anyway grundy was surprised but thats where the human beings are yes she agreed you dont want to join them i like being with you she said simply he couldnt answer that might as well start off ill get directions from the local foliage rapunzel in human size picked up her half of the bed and snortimer took his end they carried the bed slowly along while grundy selected the best route with the advice of the plants several hours later they were marginally closer to lake ogrechobee and both bed monster and damsel were tired well have to rest grundy decided this is going to be a very long trek snortimer crawled under the bed and rapunzel flopped atop it not bothering to change to smaller size grundy considered staying awake to stand guard but he was tired too as he had walked the full distance himself and what was slow for the other two was a running pace for him he might have ridden on the bed as his weight would hardly have made a difference to them but he had felt too guilty to do that alert me if any monsters approach he told the sur rounding brush and the brush agreed plants were gen erally accommodating things when asked politely he settled down beside snortimer under the bed as there was no room on top of it he remained uneasy but he slept some time later a hand came down to pick him up oh rapunzel he said sleepily whats on your mind you have caused me a good deal of trouble golem she said frowning as she sat up and held him near her face i regret that he said but there didnt seem to be any better way you could have stayed entirely out of my life she said her even teeth showing in a way that was not com pletely attractive what business did you have at the ivory tower anyway you know that he reminded her it was the only way to complete my quest to rescue stanley steamer a mere dragon she exclaimed derisively a trouble some monster hardly worth the ivory in its tusks stanley has no ivory he protested then it was for nothing at all she said you messed up my schedule something awful now i have to get back to the coast and the tower through all this stupid jungle but you dont want to go back there he protested the sea hag is there the sea hag she sneered then she cackled whom the hell do you think youre talking to wretch now at last he realized what had happened the ghost of the hag had come while they slept and taken over rapunzels body disaster had come upon them he struggled to escape but the grip was tight how would you like me to squeeze you the hag asked through golem in the gears the sweet lips of the damsel already the lovely features were assuming an unlovely cast the slender fingers closed more tightly about him the witch might have the body of a fair young woman but that hand had a lot more power than existed in all of grundys body and the force was terrible he bared his teeth leaned forward as far as he could and bit the uppermost finger his relatively tiny teeth sank into the massive flesh he could not do lethal damage but the bite had to hurt wretch the hag screeched dropping him ill twist your head off grundy scrambled under the bed but the hag hauled the bed out of the way exposing snortimer who whim pered ill destroy both of you the hag cried snatching for grundy again he tried to run away but she caught him and lifted him up ill bite your face off she opened her once sweet mouth where the teeth already resembled fangs grundy flailed desperately though he knew that every thing was lost no no he cried grundy whats the matter she asked he was on the ground again scrambling to avoid her hand no no but i dont know what to do she protested the tears starting slowly it penetrated he had been dreaming it hadnt happened rapunzels body had not been taken over by the witch its nothing he said shaken i just had a night mare indeed now he saw the hoofprint of the mare what a dream she had brought him a nightmare rapunzel asked you havent met them before golem in thegear well i know what they are of course but mother sweetness never allowed them in the ivory tower that figures he straightened himself around shak ing dirt and twigs out let me bring you up to the bed she said anxiously reaching for him again grundy looked at the approaching hand he saw a mark on the index finger no he cried in panic what how did you get that mark he demanded pointing she looked she rubbed her finger dirt smudged off her finger had no injury he relaxed all rightbring me up he agreed then change to my size he knew he couldnt aflford to let a bad dream cause him to distrust her she brought him up and changed grundy described his bad dream and she was sympathetic oh no wonder you shied away from me she said you thought i was i should have known better he said ruefully but some of those nightmares are realistic let me squeeze you she said no then he had to laugh sorry the dream of course she agreed hurt no i really am sorry here he leaned over and kissed her several things occurred at this point he hadnt real ized he was going to do that it was indeed spontaneous she not quite realizing what he was up to turned simul taneously to face him thus instead of kissing her cheek he scored on her lips this changed the effect her lips were the softest sweetest things he had ever touched after an eternal moment they broke i know what that was she exclaimed delighted that was a kiss golem in the gears grundy could only nod privately overwhelmed by the impact of it it was obviously the first such experience for her it was also the first for him and he thought ruefully it had better be the last how did i do what did i kiss well well he felt as if his feet had not yet regained the ground but how could he tell her that the act had not been intended as any test of her prowess but if he told her no she would be hurt uh yes do people usually kiss when theyre sorry she asked brightly not exactly he mumbled good im not sorry let me try it now you dont understand he protested drawing away but im really trying to understand she said i want to know how things are in the real world she leaned toward him lips pursed he drew further away not knowing what to say as a result they both lost their balance and fell on the bed she on top of him like this she asked putting her lips to his grundy was pretty sure he would regret this but for a moment he gave up the fight he wrapped his arms about her and held her tight while they kissed after a much longer eternal moment she lifted her head smiling oh my this is fun she exclaimed i never knew what i was missing in the ivory tower and he grundy had never truly known what he was missing all of his life but he couldnt tell her that she had what he lacked a future with the human or elven kind golem in the gears dawn is coming he said somewhat gruffly we had better get the bed to cover oh my yes she agreed she sat up carefully shifted to humansize and helped snortimer carry the bed to the deep shade of a stout umbrella tree then remaining that size she moved about the area locating and plucking some fruits that she brought back to the bed then she changed back to golemsize and they chewed into the huge fruit now the sun was up and bright i think the ghost is gone now grundy said she must have had to take some other form so we can relax just the same she said stay close by me again he knew he would be sorry for the closer he stayed by her the more he liked her and not just as a friend when she found her own place with her own kind whichever kind that might be he would be twice as lonely as before but at least there was this momentthis moment of the journey now he like she was not in any great hurry to complete it they settled on the bed lying side by side she took and held his hand and he did not protest her little inti micies were so innocent for her and so significant for himbut he didnt want to point that out to her her naivete was part of her appeal they slept again and this time no night mare visited but a pesky fly did it was a fastbuzzing biting kind and it settled on grundys leg and took a chomp to a humansized person it would have been a nuisance to grundy it was a jolt that wrenched him brutally from his repose the fly was clumsy he reached down and grabbed it by the wings it buzzed furiously but he held it tight golem in the gears golem in the gears you bit me he exclaimed in flytalk looking at the welt rising around the fang marks on his leg ill do more than that to you wretched golem it responded yeah he looked about above them was a large spiders web do you want this fly he called out in spidertalk the spider came out certainly if youre not going to eat it yourself grundy stood then heaved the fly into the web catch the spider caught in a moment the fly was tied up in webbing then the spider chomped off the flys head so much for that grundy said slightly nauseated he wiped his hand off on the mattress of the bed what had possessed that fly to attack him like that ooo rapunzel exclaimed grundy looked now a bee was coming at him in a beeline he threw himself out of the way and the bee plunged into the mattress and stung it before realizing that it had missed its target curses the bee buzzed in bee talk foiled again unfortunately for the bee it was one of the type that die after stinging in a moment the bee rolled over dead grundy took hold of it by a wing and hauled it to the edge of the bed and over so that it dropped to the ground why did it do that rapunzel asked amazed i wish i knew grundy said the insects of this region dont seem to like me not only the insects the damsel exclaimed look a hummingbird was approaching the humming became loud as it hurled itself at grundy he leaped out of the way and it missed him and smacked into the trunk of the umbrella tree the shock was so great that it dropped to the grounddead this is most curious grundy said all these crea tures attacking so blindly and dying so quickly there was a commotion in the brush a rat scurried toward them its little red eyes gleaming its needlesharp teeth showing im going to chomp your legs off then your arms then your head it snarled in rattalk then ill get mean you cant fight that rapunzel cried with alarm indeed he could not the rat massed a good deal more than he did and had natural weapons he could not match it charged to the nearest leg of the bed and began to scramble up snortimer grundy cried the leg of the bed was in shadow a big hairy hand came forth to grab the rat it hurled the rodent into the trunk of a tree the rat squeaked as it struck and fell to the ground dead grundy relaxed somewhat something about this doesnt add up he said these creatures dont even know me yet there was another disturbance a mundane hound came into sight now that the border to mundania was open mundane creatures had migrated to xanth in increasing numbers many fell prey to the magic preda tors but some survived nicelyand the hounds were among the latter group this one slavered as it charged directly toward grundy rapunzel screamed and jumped off the bed assuming her human size she scrambled into the brush the hound leaped for the bed grundy threw himself to the side and the hound missed landing on the far side it rolled and turned growling grundy golem you will be dead meat then it leaped again jaws gaping golem in the gears again grundy threw himself to the side and the hound was unable to correct course because it was in midair but again it reoriented grundy knew that he could not avoid it much longer but what could he do he didnt have time to get to a tree so that he could climb out of its reach he had to remain where he was precarious as that might be the hound leaped a third time sailing over the bed and a club crashed down on its head killing it amazed grundy looked up there was rapunzel holding a heavy dead branch oh i never killed a real animal before she cried but i had to it was going to eat you you had to grundy agreed weakly had xanth gone mad all these completely unprovoked attacks what did it growl at you she asked it called me by name grundy said remembering but how could it know your name then the truth dawned the sea hag he exclaimed shes assuming new forms she hates you the damsel agreed there was a roar oh no grundy cried thats a chimaera we cant fight that she said we never thought of what she would do if she didnt get your body grundy said shes more dangerous this way than she was as either hag or ghost the chimaera stalked toward them it had the head of a lion the tail of a serpent and a second head of a mun dane goat growing out of its back it was one of the most ferocious of xanthly creatures so stupid golem you come to your ridiculous end the goathead bleated in caprine talk how could you ever have thought you could oppose one of my ilk golem in the gears whats she saying rapunzel asked shaking with terror ill tell you what im saying the lionhead roared in feline tongue golem im going to consume you and that bed monster piece by bloody piece unless shes making a deal grundy whispered amazed all over again what kind of deal the damsel asked perplexed despite her terror tell her this golem the goathead bleated i will destroy you and the bed monster unless the damsel returns to me suddenly the nature of the campaign came clear the sea hag had not given up on rapunzel she wanted the damsel back under control in the ivory tower that would have only one end i wont tell her that grundy said tell her the lionhead roared or ill destroy her too and that too made sense if the sea hag couldnt have her captive back there would be nothing left for her except revenge certainly she would never let rapunzel go free to live her own life wouldnt it be better at least to let the damsel live i know what she wants rapunzel cried oh id rather die then die you shall the lionhead roared but first you will watch what i do to your foolish friends just in case you should be moved to change your mind the monster stalked forward but now there was a new commotionand grundy knew it couldnt be another incarnation of the hag because the last one hadnt died in a moment it came into view two people a handsome golem in the gears young man and a pretty young woman jordan thren ody grundy cried with enormous relief the chimaera glanced back with one of its heads nobody can save you golem it snarled i will destroy them too grundy wondered what impossible coincidence had brought his friends here at this moment but he didnt stop to ponder im in trouble he called jordan drew his sword not anymore he said con fidently he advanced on the monster he was a fine figure of a barbarian warrior very well fool the lionhead snarled no ordinary man could stand up to a chimaera and the hag knew it jordan however was not an ordinary man he had been a ghost for several hundred years and now was alive again he had been just about fearless in his first life and now he was more so he had a special talent that the hag might not know about the chimaera pounced jordan slashed so quickly and hard with his sword that the monsters lionhead was lopped off surprised the monster landed turned and surveyed the situation another creature might have died on the spot but this one was made of sterner stuff then the goathead opened its mouth and spewed forth a stream of fire jordan tried to duck but wasnt quick enough the fire caught the upper part of his head burning off his hair one ear and an eyeball or two rapunzel screamed now the chimaera stepped up the goathead guiding the lionclaws it raised a foot about to disembowel the still standing man right before you threnody called now r golem in the gears with one mighty heave of his sword jordan cut off the goathead this was too much even for the chimaera it fell down and died but the man rapunzel cried with horror his eyes yes im afraid theyre pretty well cooked threnody said cocking her head as she studied jordan but dont be concerned he heals quickly he his talent grundy explained he cant be perma nently hurt youll see threnody took jordan by the hand and guided him to the bed sit down she told him dangers over grundy wasnt at all sure of that but he hoped there would be a while before the hag found another monster to occupy how did you come to be here he asked we received a message from bink threnody explained he told us that it would probably be a good thing if we traveled through this section of xanth so we did bink but he didnt even know id be here or what trouble id be in it must have been a lucky coincidence then she said a lucky coincidence the kind that happened perpet ually when bink was around now it had been extended to the farthest shore of xanth what was there about the man threnody glanced at rapunzel i dont believe i know you shes rapunzel grundy said im rescuing her from the sea hag the sea hag shes immortal she occupies other folks bodies until golem in the gears they die she was in this chimaera now shell appear in some other form and try to kill us again were under siege threnody pursed her lips i see then i think we had better stay with you for a while she glanced at jordan feeling better dear jordans head was already sprouting new hair his scorchedoff ear was growing back and his eyes seemed to be uncocking it was an amazing thing to watch he nodded affirmatively he was feeling better you may have to fight again soon threnody told him jordan shrugged evidently the prospect didnt bother him if no attack occurs within an hour we should be all right threnody said what sort of form will this hag assume next theres no telling grundy said well have to be suspicious of everything very well ill stand guard the rest of you rest i couldnt rest rapunzel protested this has been so horrible then let the menfolk rest threnody suggested you and i can chat grundy sighed internally now the damsel would find out what real human beings were like he had known it would happen but had hoped he would have a few more days before then still the arrival of jordan and threnody had been most timely and he really couldnt protest his relationship with rapunzel would be over but at least he had his life come on jordan he said to the healing man lie down here for an hour ill snooze on your chest if you golem in the gears dont mind that way ill know if anything approaches you jordan lay down and grundy climbed onto the mans solid chest and lay down he didnt really expect to sleep but he surprised himself by doing so almost immediately chapter everglades they slept a good deal more than an hour it was afternoon when grundy woke jordan was just stirring that was what had alerted him the girls were nearby putting the finishing touches on a pretty repast jordan sat up and grundy simply climbed to his shoul der the mans head was entirely better now his hair had regrown completely and his eyes and ears were whole there werent even any scars it was just as if he had never suffered injury grundy had known about the mans talent but this still impressed him any other man would have been in very sad state after such a battle with a chimsera im hungry jordan exclaimed stretching lets eat they went to join the girls there were fruits and nuts of many descriptions and milk and bread and cookies and assorted other delicacies where did you find all this grundy demanded threnody shrugged oh here and there she said golem in the gears there are always good things to be found in xanth if you know where to look evidently so but the hag never showed rapunzel said brightly she was golemsize and she had done something with her wild shorn hair because now it was pleasantly curly her cloth ing had been ragged and sweatsoaked after the trudge but now it was neat and clean she had been the prettiest young woman he had encountered now she was more so maybe she was tired after getting killed so many times he said uncertainly come sit down eat rapunzel said leading him to a chair fashioned from a fragment of wood and some straw what will you have we really should be under cover in case she comes as a big bird or a dragon rapunzel shook her head see those chips in a big circle around us grundy she asked pointing he looked yes but thats reversewood if she tried to pass that circle it will reverse her magic reversewood he exclaimed i didnt realize that was here threnody found it she said she and jordan have been traveling through the area and they found a cache on the other side of lake ogrechobee near the region of madness so they brought some along she carried it in her purse of course she couldnt stay too close to him when he fought or when he was healing but ill say he agreed reversewood reverses any magic in its vicinity i remember when the good magician was near some and his information became disinformation but its range is very short she reassured him it doesnt golem in the gears affect us as long as we dont go too close to the circle but it kept mother swethe sea hag away she may be watching us now but she doesnt dare come in because even if she flew over the circle we could toss a chip at her thats terrific he cried youre very smart oh no threnody figured it out shes been in the wilderness a long time and is junglewise she told me a lot surely so so now you can see what the human state is like he said glad for her but sad for himself actually threnodys a halfbreed like me shes a humandemon cross while im humanelven she married a straight human man say i had forgotten it in the excitement grundy exclaimed jordan is your she blushed fetchingly yes my ancestor your ancestor he repeated i hope you find him satisfactory she laughed silly how can i pass judgment on him still hes a full human being so you can get a notion what that is like not really hes a barbarian from four hundred years ago he has never been part of todays society because he stays with threnody and she cant go to castle roogna because the curse on her would cause castle roogna to fall the girls had evidently been talking about various things well once we get you to the castle youll be able to see human society for yourself true she agreed not sounding enthusiastic meanwhile threnody had been talking with jordan who of course had not had a chance before to catch up golem in the gears on all the wrinkles of this situation now he looked across at rapunzel say he said you remind me of of her elfin ancestor bluebell threnody said firmly she tweaked his restored ear past history for you bar barian he laughed bluebell she was certainly a fineyow for threnody had converted her tweak into a fierce pinch do you see anything wrong with a man marrying a crossbreed rapunzel asked jordan he hesitated threnody gave his ear another pinch no of course not he said quickly and everyone laughed the meal was wonderful rapunzel insisted on select ing delicacies for him catering to his every whim soon grundy was stuffed he liked all of this very wellthe food and the service but he did not let himself forget that such pleasure would soon pass they rested again in the afternoon preparing for the night this time grundy and rapunzel had the bed and slept holding hands though it was evident that there was no immediate threat no night mare came it was hard for the mares to reach a sleeper by day jordan and threnody took a walk scouting out the vicinity they didnt seem to need as much rest as grundy and rapunzel did perhaps being junglehardened at dusk grundy stirred and found rapunzel still asleep still holding firmly to his hand she was such a beautiful and nice creature whether awake or asleep if only she had been a golem she woke her eyes opened and fastened on him and she smiled come here grundy she said i want to do something spontaneous against his better judgment he leaned down to her she caught him in her arms drew him close and kissed him t golem in the gean you shouldnt be doing this he told her when she let him go why those innocent direct questions how could he answer but he was obliged to try again you dont want to spoil your future with your own kind did jordan spoil his future when he dallied with blue bell she was the descendant of that union of course she saw no wrong in it but did this mean that she saw him as jordan had seen the elven maid someone to be loved and left he broke contact got to his feet and headed for the edge of the bed rapunzel scrambled after him grundy she cried did i say something wrong im sorry no of course she hadnt said anything wrong by her definitions he was the one who was being difficult why couldnt he just accept the way she was enjoy her atten tion while it lasted and be satisfied when it was over she caught his hand again i only want to please you grundy she said her eyes beginning to fill they were shifting colors as was their way at the moment they were going from purple to blue what am i doing wrong nothing he said realizing that part of this was threnodys doing advice on the practicing of wiles an area in which the woman was surely expert but im not bluebell i dont understand she protested her chin trem bling what could he do of course you dont he said gently and squeezed her hand they climbed down off the bed and checked on snor golem in the gears timer he was fine the days rest had done him a lot of good now jordan returned leading a monster it seemed to be a small sphinx a creature with the head of a woman the body of a lion and large birds wings it towered over the man for even a small sphinx was a giant among ani mals the oddest thing was its face for it resembled threnody grundy exclaimed well it is my talent the sphinx replied we thought it would be easier traveling if we had some size grundy remembered her talent was the changing of form this was similar to prince dolphs talent but while he was a magician and could change instantly to any living thing she was a demon crossbreed and could do it only slowly and stage by stage it must have taken her all afternoon to achieve the size mass and form of this monster and it would take her just as long to change back to her natural aspect but she was right some size would be useful now she could carry the bed and the rest of them without difficulty greatly facilitating the trek to lake ogre chobee even the hag would hesitate to attack a monster like this night closed in now they had a problem what about the reversewood some of that ought to be brought along but threnody could no longer carry it for it would seri ously interfere with her magically achieved state anyone who carried it would have to travel apart from the rest of the group and that would be awkward at best and dan gerous at worst the hag might be waiting for just such a division of the party so she could pick off outlying members well have to leave it behind grundy decided with regret its more dangerous to us than to the hag while gotem in the gears we travel because we cant just leave it in a circle it will be a liability to whoever carries it maybe we could drag some along behind us on a long lead jordan suggested that seemed worth trying they got a vine packed some chips in a bag and tied it to the end of the vine the other end of the vine they tied to the tail of the sphinx it was an oddlooking arrangement but it seemed to be the best way jordan loaded the bed on threnodys back and fas tened it there then snortimer climbed up and helped grundy and rapunzel jordan preferred to travel under his own power so he walked alongside the sphinx moved out each step was a giant one and though the pace seemed slow progress was fast the brush and trees moved smartly to the rear snortimer was intrigued it was the first time he had traveled on top of the bed instead of under it he had no eyes or ears that showed but he could evidently see and hear and he made a thumbsup gesture with a couple of hairy hands fortunately for him the moon was dim this night and out of position there was not enough light to hurt him grundy knew that the green cheese that com prised the moon aged rapidly so that it could not glow with full force after the first few days and by the end of the month it would fade all the way to oblivion then phoenixlike it would regenerate for the next month soon they left the jungle and emerged into a broad expanse of swamp or field tall grass ranged as far as the eye could see even from this elevated perch it was punc tuated only by occasional islands of trees have you been here before grundy asked the sphinx no she answered we came down from the north golem in the gears after we crossed xanth ive never seen a field like this before its the everglades rapunzel said we have to cross it to reach lake ogrechobee from this direction theres something funny about it but im not sure what something the hag didnt tell you grundy asked maybe she only told me what she thought i ought to know of course i never expected actually to be here the sphinx plowed on leaving the grass swiftly behind one tree island after another passed but the overall ter rain didnt change the night passed and morning came but still the glades stretched out interminably a bird with a crown flew by suddenly it plunged into a patch of water nabbing a fish oh thats a kingfisher rapunzel exclaimed clapping her hands the king of birds grundy asked not exactly it fishes for kings among the fishes farther along they spied a long green creature basking in the early sun whats that grundy asked thats an allegory rapunzel said they often asso ciate with hypotenuses and relevants and parodies they can be very dangerous if they catch a person offguard grundy had heard about the other creatures the hypot enuse was big and blubbery with a triangularshaped ori fice the relevant was even larger with a nose that dangled to the ground and the parody was a bird that liked crack ers none of them were the sort he cared to encounter casually but the allegory was the worst indeed the allegory was now swimming toward jor i dan climbing out on the muddy bank but the barbarian simply drew his sword and braced himself and the green monster changed its mind it turned on fat little legs and returned to the shallow water it seemed that not too many golem in the gears creatures cared to tangle with a barbarian warrior who was looking for a fight they snacked on the remnants of the prior days feast while the sphinx cruised on threnody was surely getting hungry but she didnt complain she probably wanted to get them all safely across this blank region before chang ing back to human form but the glades went on and on endlessly afternoon came and then evening and nothing seemed to have changed at this velocity we should have been there by now rapunzel said worried now the sphinx paused i just remembered some thing she said sphinxes have excellent memories the glades are magic they go on forever thats why they are called everglades forever grundy asked horrified but then how do we get across them this is the kind of question that can send a person hurtling from a cliff to doom the sphinx said maybe we can use the reversewood rapunzel sug gested how would that work grundy asked it only reverses whats next to it and the glades are every where well maybe one step at a time she said uncertainly worth trying jordan said ill fetch it in he walked back but in a moment he said ohoh cord broke it was true somewhere along the way the cord had frayed and separated and the reversewood had been lost i can change to a bird and look around threnody offered that would take some time however theres no point in trudging on endlessly grundy said t golem in the gear golem in the gears so they made camp where they were there was an island of palm trees close by their palms and fingers spreading out to provide shade and some had cocoanuts filled with warm cocoa it was a satisfactory place to visit though they didnt want to stay there forever as night closed snortimer came out from under the bed he had had to hide when day had come threnody commenced her change to birdform this was fascinating to see first she gradually lost mass without changing size or shape so that after an hour she was a ghostly sphinx that the others could walk through without hurting her then she changed to birdsize with all her diminished mass solidifying that took another hour finally she changed to birdform becoming a swift which of course could fly high and fast shes been working on that jordan said with pride it isnt easy to fly just because you have the birds form you have to learn how she still cant do it as well as a real bird can but shes improving the swift spread her wings and took off she was some what clumsy and lurched a bit but she got straightened out and ascended into the starry night sky if lake ogre chobee were close by she would surely spy it then a larger shape appeared flying after the swift thats a falcon jordan exclaimed get out of there renee it was a nickname he called her dating from the time she had been a ghost the swift turned and dived trying to get back to camp but the falcon followed cutting across to catch her gotcha you interfering wench the falcon squawked in birdtalk thats the sea hag grundy cried appalled jordan brought out his bow and nocked an arrow you cant shoot rapunzel protested its dark and theyre moving if you hit anything its likely to be the wrong one but the barbarian squinted and held his arm and as the hawk dug her claws into the swift and spread her wings to ascend he fired the shaft sailed upand transfixed the body of the hawk both birds fellbut the swift was alive the hawk dead what an amazing shot rapunzel exclaimed im a barbarian jordan said shortly putting away his bow he strode out to recover the swift she was injured the haghawks talons had punctured her body damaging muscles and tissues she was not in critical condition but she would not be flying again this night jordan shook his head pained she cant heal the way i do he said i never meant for her to get hurt the hag was just biding her time waiting her chance grundy said she wanted to get rid of threnody because she was making it too easy for us to travel i should have been alert for that we none of us were thinking jordan said gruffly they stood a kind of vigil while threnody slowly returned to her normal form it took half the night because of her injuries but at last she was lying in human guise with puncturewounds in her arms and body grundy wished they had some healing elixir but that was precious stuff and no one had thought it necessary oh it can be so ugly in real life rapunzel murmured almost i wish thats what the hag wants grundy reminded her to make you so miserable that youll be glad to go back to the ivory tower her chin firmed ill never go back there she exclaimed golem in the gears they rested for the rest of the night as there was no point in trying to travel especially with threnody injured grundy and rapunzel insisted that threnody be given the bed to lie on until she was better and ifsnortimer grabs your ankle dont be concerned rapunzel told her he means no harm and he has good taste in ankles grundy added the two of them settled in a nest of tall grass they fashioned rapunzel had never once changed to her human size since the arrival of jordan and threnody she stayed close to grundy and always held his hand when they settled down he didnt dare confess how much he liked that i wish the falcon hadnt been killed he said morosely i know what you mean now shes loose again and we dont know when or where or in what form shell strike i wish there was some way to make her stop wanting my body rapunzel said i dont really want harm to come to her i just want her to leave me alone well if we get you to castle roogna he said im sure someone there will be able to help you she lay a while in silence then with feminine shift of mood she asked why did you say you arent blue bell he sighed it doesnt matter yes it does i made you unhappy and i didnt want to do that threnody gave me some advice on how to get along with a man but it doesnt seem to be working very well because im not a man he said well you certainly arent a woman its obvious you arent bluebell so why did you have to say it golem in the geare regretfully he explained because she was just a tem porary connection he loved her and left her but that was all it was ever supposed to be she protested elves and men dont stay together true and im descended from them true so why arent you bluebell i mean of course you arent but i dont want to be loved and left but nobodys leaving you you are once we get you to castle roogna so you can join your own kind im not even sure what my own kind is human or elven he said tiredly youll be able to take your choice she considered let me see if i have this straight at last you like me but you know ill leave you when i find out what my true heritage is so you dont want to get too involved grundy was startled thats it exactly and youre a golem a living golem and theres no one else exactly like you male or female so you know you have to be alone it was amazing how completely she understood his situation now yes but if you ever did find someone else you would never change your mind how tellingly and cruelly she put it without under standing how it cut him im glad you finally have it clear you dont sound glad im glad you understand not glad for me he clari fied golem in the gears golm in tho gaora i may have it straight but i dont understand what now youre confused she said satisfied serves you right and she took his hand and settled down to sleep it took him somewhat longer next day while threnody continued to lie on the bed and heal now and then dangling a wellturned ankle down for snortimer to grab at the others tried to find some way out of the everglades since there was no end to the sealike grass they explored the island of palm trees but it was only an island no matter which way they went through it they came out on the opposite side and faced the expanse of grass again the faint hope that the trees would banish the grass was dashed grundy tried questioning the palms do you know any way out of here the hands clapped applauding the question there is no way out of here thats whats so nice about the everglades an allegory swam up checking them over it looked just like the one they had seen before do you know any way out of here he asked it well speaking metaphorically the creature began yes or no the allegory smiled with its long and toothy snoot no then it tried to snap him up grundy jumped back ready for that move naturally such a predator wouldnt tell him of any way out i guess jordan said at last we had better just plow on and hope we get somewhere thats the barbarian way that did not appeal particularly to grundy but he had nothing better to offer if they werent going to get out of the glades they might as well do it with their best effort they decided to move out at nightfall because thren ody pronounced herself well enough to travel but she was obviously not completely healed so the others refused to let her change to sphinxform and carry them she had to remain as herself who would carry the bed rapunzel could change to human size and carry one end but she seemed reluctant to do that she had remained golemsized the whole time they were in the everglades and grundy appreciated that without quite understanding her rationale certainly there were advantages to the human size threnody was too weak to do it and snortimer was likely to have trouble doing it here in the swamp his hands tended to sink into the muck making progress difficult unless he used all five of them cleverly grundy himself couldnt do it he was far too small that left jordan no problem the barbarian said but who will carry the other end grundy asked just tie the bed to my back jordan said but its too heavy to not for an uncivilized warrior he said cheerfully and indeed he was correct they bound the bed to his back and he heaved it up leaned forward somewhat and strode forth the others followed threnody was second and grundy and rapunzel mounted snortimer and brought up the rear the bed monster was able to carry them without diffi culty because they were small and light and because he didnt need to use any hands to hold them in place as he would have had to do for the bed he picked his way across the tufts and hummocks of the swamp and kept the pace handily but it was to no avail they trudged along all night and as dawn threatened they remained exactly where they qolem in the gears had been in the middle of the glades they found another copse of trees exactly like the first and set up the bed under a palm tree just like the first oh rapunzel exclaimed grundy rushed over alarmed what this is the same place she exclaimed see there are the dents of the four bed legs and theres the place where we buried our here she pinkened a trifle refuse sure enough their toilet trench was there grundy alerted the others and quickly they verified that every tree was the same with the same cocoanut shells remain ing they had been here before but we traveled in a straight line jordan said scratching his head i steered by the stars i know i didnt make any circle the others agreed they had not drifted aimlessly but this was the same place they had left let me check this jordan said he stepped out toward the nearest other island of palms take me with you grundy cried okay the barbarian agreed and reached down a hand for him grundy scrambled up to his shoulder they crossed rapidly to the other copse at one point there was a stirring in the water but jordan put his hand on his sword and grundy called out keep your snoot clear allegory oh you again the allegory muttered from the shadow youll never find your way out of here you know it was the same allegory grundy felt a chill for he knew the creature could not have followed them all that way on its fat little legs the other island turned out to be identical to the first golem in the gears cocoanut shards and all andthere were the others of their party what are you doing here grundy demanded what are you doing here rapunzel responded she was now sitting on threnodys shoulder emulating grun dys style we just watched you enter the other copse we did grundy said this is the other copse no this is the original one she insisted we never moved something mighty peculiar here jordan said with that they all agreed but rapunzel was more thoughtful than the others i wonderi wasnt told much about the everglades but there is somethingtheyre not as big as they seem that doesnt make much difference grundy said if we cant get out i think we should experiment she said you see we watched you go northwest but you came up behind us from the southeast maybe if we had watched the other way say yes grundy agreed lets try it again only this time you watch both ways and so they did he and jordan headed northwest toward the other copse while rapunzel dismounted and watched them go and threnody went to the opposite side of the island and watched for what might occur there about halfway across grundys sharp eyes spied something theres someone there he said jordan peered ahead thats renee he said grundy turned to look back because he knew exactly where to look he was able to spot little rapunzel theyre both places he said they proceeded on past the allegory and reached the golem in the gears new copse you never left right jordan asked thren ody correct she agreed i simply crossed and saw you coming from the other island now it was definite it was all the same place no matter how they moved grundy crossed over to the northwest side leaving jordan and threnody where they were joined rapunzel and looked across to the other copse there he was able to spy two figures male and female standing at its southeast edge we are all hereand thereand everywhere grundy said amazed now i think i remember rapunzel said its aa little universe in itself we simply go round and round it never escaping and all our long trekswere simply round and round grundy agreed we should have saved our energy jordan and threnody came up how the blank are we going to get out of here jordan asked bewildered the others shrugged they had no idea it seemed that they really were stuck in the everglades forever chapter fauns nymphs they ate and rested as they were all tired and there seemed to be nothing better to do at the moment grundy and rapunzel slept on the bed while jordan and threnody settled elsewhere in the copse in early afternoon they woke rather grundy woke the damsel was already awake because she was kissing him i suppose this is a silly question he began when she was through but i was just thinking she said addressing his question skewfashion here we are lost in the everglades because we just cant seem to find out how to get any where and here we are too you and i for the same reason the same if i knew how to get anywhere with you id do it but i cant figure out how rapunzel you dont need to get anywhere with me he protested you have two whole futures to choose from because i just cant make you listen and i wish i could but so i kissed you she concluded simply golem in the gears evidently that made sense to her grundy sighed and got up suppose we never do find our way out of here she inquired after a moment would that be so bad i mean i was trapped in the ivory tower for most of my life and i got along all right and so im used to it only now i have company and maybe in time you would accept it too to be sealed away forever with plenty of food and her for company no it wouldnt be bad but he knew he had no right to want that i have a quest he reminded her i promised to rescue stanley steamer yes of course she agreed youre very conscien tious they foraged for another meal i wonder where that hag of yours is jordan said she must be trapped here too grundy conjectured unless she knows some way out i dont think she would have come here if she didnt know a way out rapunzel said im sure she knew the nature of the everglades the allegory nosed up to the island i certainly did it said in reptiletalk grundy jumped you he exclaimed you mean thats the sea hag now threnody asked yes grundy agreed heavily it seems she took over that body after the hawk died ill kill it jordan said grimly no that will only free her for another form grundy warned better to keep her in the form we know but its a dangerous form threnody said nervously any form is dangerous when its the sea hag grundy said yeah i guess so he agreed looking at threnody golem in the gears she continued to heal but the marks remained on her body it was evident that jordan was more upset by the injuries she had received from the hag than the far worse ones he had received considering his own talent this was understandable the allegory was listening to them evidently under standing human speech though it could only talk in rep tilian and i know the way out of here it hissed if you want to escape the glades i can tell you how fat chance grundy hissed back you know what i want golem it said whats she saying rapunzel asked worried you know what shes saying grundy said oh again her hand went to her mouth in that maid enly alarm he found so attractive dont worry he reassured her thats one deal well never make but if she can get you free no yes the reptile hissed not today not this week perhaps but after a month a year of idleness of bore dom however long it takes you will be ready to deal send her back to the ivory tower and i will show you the way out of the glades jordan grundy said sharply ive changed my mind i think this creature should be killed jordan smiled he drew his sword but the allegory moved with surprising swiftness splashing back into the water and zipping away out of reach at least we know there is a way grundy said there is a way rapunzel agreed gazing at him in the later afternoon threnody approached grundy im getting better she said i could change to a form that could go after that allegory and golem in the gears to what point he asked we really shouldnt kill it and it certainly wont tell us what we want to know not without a deal i wont make i was thinking more deviously she said im not the nicest of women down inside ive done some pretty bad things in my time in a cause i believed was right i know i can do what i have to do now he was curious whats that i can catch her and make her hurt until she tells us how to get out of here torture her he asked shocked i told you i wasnt all that nice if i turned into a water dragon and went after her i could chew on her bit by bit one leg at a time and she would grundy felt sick i dont think i like that way any way i think she would rather die than tell us because she cant die she nodded youre probably right but i just thought id mention it were not entirely helpless are all females like you underneath he asked grimly intrigued of course not most are relatively innocent and some are truly nice creatures like rapunzel she is isnt she he agreed with relief but even that kind can go after what she wants i remember when i decided that jordan was the man for me she sighed and shook her head but rapunzel hasnt met any men yet except for jordan i think she has threnody murmured smiling in that obscure way women have oh where she laughed never mind im sure everything will work out in its fashion she moved away golem in the gecns grundy shook his head perplexed then rapunzel rejoined him and he forgot whatever he had been trying to be bothered about next day grundy climbed a tall tree and looked about all around were the little islands of palm trees all of which he knew had golems looking about because all were the same what a hopeless situation then he spied something else he squinted at it trying to make quite sure it wasnt an illusion but soon he was sure centaur ho he cried scrambling down the tree in a moment everyone was looking it was definitely a centaur forging toward them through the marsh in due course grundy was able to recognize him amolde indeed it was arnolde the only nonhuman creature ever to have been the human king of xanth he sloshed to the copse and raised a hand in greeting im glad to find you well he said he was old and his coat was turning gray but he remained reasonably spry he wore mundane spectacles to shore up his declining eyesight but were trapped grundy exclaimed and now you are too not so arnolde said cheerily you dont understand these are the everglades there is no way out and im a magician the centaur reminded him my magic can handle this but your magic only works outside of xanth its an aisle of magic here it makes no difference allow me to explain i have been experimenting with reversewood we had some of that but it reverses the thrust of any magic in its vicinity thus when i carry it it causes me to generate a mundane aisle golem in the gears in xanth now you might not feel this is a useful function however suddenly grundy caught on its magic that holds us here in the glades he cried if that is nullified we can get out of here jordan finished that was my supposition arnolde agreed so if you are ready to travel with me but how did you happen to come here grundy asked still hardly believing this good fortune my friend bink suggested that the everglades might be the ideal place to test out the mundane effect arnolde said and i was constrained to agree with him if i did not get lost there i should not get lost anywhere bink grundy exclaimed i should have known hes been sending people after me im sure he meant no harm the centaur said his talent is very special what is his talent i cant remember arnolde looked thoughtful oh well in that case per haps i shouldnt have mentioned it but you did mention it that guy seems to be crazy careless and crazy lucky does his magic have something to do with it i would say that is a fair assessment the centaur agreed and that was all he would say on that subject instead he deftly turned the dialogue to the groups own situation they explained about gnindys quest and the manner he had rescued rapunzel from the ivory tower and how the sea hag was following them and trying to get rapun zel to return to her power she was giving them some trouble when we arrived jordan said just in the nick of time golem in the gears when bink is involved such coincidences do occur the centaur said knowingly but now were stuck in the everglades grundy concluded or were until you showed up are you sure your mundane aisle can get us out we shall certainly find out arnolde said where are you going from here to lake ogrechobee where the fauns and nymphs are theyre holding stanley steamer very well we shall go there the centaur stretched tomorrow morning if that is all right with you i am not as youthful as i once was and the day is becoming advanced of course they agreed arnolde joined them in a meal of cocoa and nuts and found a comfortable spot to stand and sleep but in the night there was a commotion the allegory was on the island scrambling away from amolde oh my gracious the centaur exclaimed that animal has absconded with the reversewood grundy knew instantly that that was potential disaster without that wood amolde would be trapped with the rest of them he leaped onto snortimer weve got to recover it he cried the bed monster was able to function well in the dark ness he scrambled after the allegory catching it at the edge of the copse now by the dim light of what remained of the moon grundy saw that the creature was hauling the wood along on a string much as the sphinx had with the prior wood but as snortimer pounced on the wood the allegory jumped forward and snatched at it the two arrived at the same time and one of snortimers hands banged into the allegorys long green nose get the wood get the wood grundy cried golem in the geora snortimer tried but as he reached for it the allegory snapped at his hand and he had to whip it back out of the way the reptile reached for it with its snout but snor timer made two big hairy fists and punched a onetwo combination on that snout now jordan arrived back off he called ill take care of that critter that seemed best but as snortimer retreated and jor dan advanced the allegory lunged at the chip of wood and caught it in its mouth before they could act the creature swallowed the wood and started to scramble for the water where grundy knew it would be almost impos sible to catch it but then the reptile stiffened in a moment it collapsed and lay still jordan ready to swing at it with his sword hesitated grundy realized what had happened its dead he said it was magically animated by the hag and when it swallowed the wood it reversed now its magically unanimatedand so it is dead well that solves that problem then jordan said he chopped down with the sword cutting the body in half then he fished out the chip of wood and rinsed it in the nearest water for a moment grundy wondered why the wood didnt hurt the barbarian but then realized that jordan had long since healed and was not using his magic talent now in effect he was an ordinary man and so the wood had no effect on him they had recovered the wood and that was good but now the hag was a ghost again and that was bad had they been able to leave her as the allegory she might not have been able to pursue them for it would have been very difficult for her to kill herself in that form golem in the gears i will hold it right in my hand hereafter arnolde said as they returned the chip to him i had set it beside me because the magic frame really is more comfortable than the mundane but i see in retrospect that that was a miscalculation and he clamped his hand firmly around it they returned to sleep though in grundys case it was not the easiest thing to do but rapunzel whispered to him how brave he had been and held his hand and that was very pleasant he almost regretted that they were about to escape this trap in the morning they ate again and started off threnody had changed to golemsize to grundys surprise sud denly there were two women in his range the three of them got on the bed which jordan had tied to amoldes back and rode along in style snortimer was squeezed under it since this was day and jordan walked along beside do your changes in shape and size bother jordan rapunzel asked threnody as they moved out no the woman said with a laugh im always the right size for him when he wants me to be we all have different talents and each of us can do things the other cant but you can become much larger than he can rapunzel persisted doesnt he get afraid when youre huge never its not the size that counts its the relation ship i love him he could slay me with one sweep of his sword and i could not recover but i know he wouldnt because he loves me the relationship rapunzel agreed that makes everything all right grundy listened without commenting it might be true golem in the geora that the relationship was more important than the size but she had relationships yet to form with her human and or elven kinfolk he knew if she did not that no golem was a part of either society how he wished it could be otherwise here in the mundane aisle in the light of day the scene was strange indeed the nearest palm tree no longer had hands and fingers instead it had funny large green leaves each deeply serrated to resemble hundreds of thick blades of grass it was singularly uninteresting when they passed by a cocoanut tree the big nut was not chocolaty at all but a big crude capsule of fiber that it would have been impossible to eat when they stepped into the sea of grass however it wasa sea of grass with a difference this was not a true swamp but what seemed to be an imitation swamp set up on a barren sur face it was as if someone had dumped some globs of mud and splashed some water and set out some tufts of grass so that from a distance it would look like a real swamp and left it there but a short distance away beyond the aisle the swamp returned in its full force the grass being thick and green it was easy to see where the aisle left off because of the poverty of the scenery that commenced at its edge they proceeded to the next copse of treesand the terrain changed the grass fell behind and ordinary xanth vegetation returned arnolde came to a halt the mundane aisle is not kind to normal things he said i think you will travel more pleasantly if i leave you now i believe the camp of the fauns is immediately ahead grundy knew he was right fauns and nymphs were fundamentally magical creatures and reversewood would not make them comfortable at all amolde had done his golem in the gears job and they were duly grateful all of them told him so emphatically which embarrassed him perhaps the fact that rapunzel and threnody climbed up and kissed his right and left ears respectively had something to do with it he was after all a rather selfeffacing scholar not given to heroism amolde departed his ears still blushing to pursue his further experiments with mundaneaisle effects and the rest of them went on to the faun camp ill carry the bed again jordan said just tie it on my back same as before but its day grundy protested snortimer needs it why hes standing in daylight now okay astonished they all looked at the bed monster there he was in full light suffering no harm how grundy asked amolde gave me a sliver of the reversewood snor timer explained in bedmonster tongue he thought that if it reversed all magic including his it should reverse mine so i tried it thats one smart centaur jordan said we could have done that before grundy exclaimed when we had the other reversewood we never thought of it because were not smart centaurs threnody said so they tied the bed to jordans back now three of them rode on snortimer but their combined weight was so slight it didnt matter grundy realized that this gave threnody the chance to continue resting and healing while traveling you know this is a nice enough size she remarked i should use it more often it certainly seems adequate to me rapunzel agreed grundy said nothing he had no choice this was the only size he had ever known golem in the gears golem in the gear the approach to the faun nymph retreat was a single fairly narrow path that wound about through a gully that soon became a chasm sheer cliffs rose up on either side peaking in a jagged mountain range that hadnt been visible from a distance it was evident that this path was the only way anyone could enter the premises it was pleasant enough however and there were no signs of danger it opened on a truly delightful scene there was a fine blue lake beside a lovely little mountain with a thick green forest filling in around them both the whole was enclosed by the jagged ring of mountains in a moment the residents showed up they appeared to be as harmless as the scenery they were dancing fauns and nymphs the fauns were roughly human in form but with hoofed feet shaggy legs and little horns on their heads the nymphs were naked youthful women each prettier than the others they swung their tresses engag ingly about as they danced oh rapunzel said putting a hand to her shorn hair you are beautiful with or without your hair grundy told her seriously oh she repeated brightening the fauns and nymphs swarmed up from close range they appeared to be of several different types but all were smiling and friendly its so interesting to see them in person rapunzel said dryads and dryfauns oreads and orefauns naiads and naifauns what what and what grundy asked the different species of nymphs and fauns she explained the drys live in the trees the ores in the mountains and the nais in the lake each adapts to its environment but now the residents were crowding around what strange creatures they exclaimed the one wears a bed and the others are little folk on a monster for the fauns and nymphs were far larger than golems though not large by human standards were looking for a little dragon grundy said we understand hes here his name is stanley steamer stanley they exclaimed yes yes now stanley himself appearedand grundy was amazed the dragon was no longer little and cute he had in the intervening years become a formidable middlesized monster he looked perfectly healthy and happy stanley grundy called in dragontalk my how youve grown the dragon whomped up to join them exhaling cheer ful clouds of steam but you havent he replied recog nizing grundy and who are those two golem girls this is threnody grundy said indicating her youve met her before shes usually larger and this is rapunzel ivys punpal i rescued her from the ivory tower on the way to rescuing you me i dont need rescuing stanley protested what is he saying jordan asked he says he doesnt need rescuing grundy said he returned to dragontalk then why didnt you return to ivy now stanley looked sad i would like to but i cant are the fauns and nymphs holding you not exactly then you are free to go arent you no grundy turned to the others he says they arent hold ing him captive but hes not free to go that doesnt make sense jordan said but now the fauns and nymphs were swarming over golem in the gears stanley hugging him and kissing him and teasing him and his attention was distracted there was no point in trying to question him further at the moment threnodys eyes narrowed i think i begin to get a glimmer why he isnt eager to leave she said grundy nodded who would oh you like that sort of treatment rapunzel inquired well i thought maybe you didnt we have to figure out how to get stanley to go home he said gruffly but the more they saw of the faun nymph retreat the less likely their mission seemed to succeed these creatures seemed to spend all day in innocent pleasures swimming playing eating laughing and chatting merrily there was never a cross word never a scowl everything was optimistic they did not exclude the visitors grundy and his party were welcomed into water mountain and trees threnody noted jordan watching half a dozen green haired dryads playing tag in the spreading branches of a great old acom tree the nymphs screamed shrilly with joy as they chased one another about and their arms and legs flashed prettily and their bare bosoms heaved and their tresses flung about with abandon i think id better get back to humansize she muttered darkly meanwhile a party of orefauns was scaling the central mountain linked together by ropes there really wasnt anywhere to go and there wasnt much challenge as it was a very small mountain but they seemed happy in their activity it was as if they had never done this before their hooves were good for this kind of work the naiads and naifauns were playing water polo golem in the gears flinging a ball about splashing and ducking each other and having if possible an even better time than the others then there was a stir back at the entrance to the retreat a party of goblins had showed up armed with spears and clubs round up the juiciest ones the goblin chief cried well feast tonight the nearest nymphs screamed as they were grabbed stanleys ears perked up he had settled down under a tree for a snooze but now he was alert he huffed up a head of steam and whomped toward the goblins dragon the chief cried in terror the goblins dropped the struggling nymphs and fled back down the path stanley whomped after them toast ing their rears with fierce steam in a moment the goblins were gone the nymphs returned to their play seemingly uncon cerned about their near escape grundy shook his head now i think i understand why he cant leave he said these fauns and nymphs are helpless before any predator they dont know how to fight they cant organize they forget any bad thing as soon as it is past if stanley werent here they would soon be decimated by the goblins and anything else that came by and if we take him away rapunzel said it would be at great cost to them but i promised to bring him back to castle roogna grundy said its my quest and i have to fulfill it if i possibly can even at such a cost she asked i dont know indeed he discovered himself at the crossroads of the most difficult choice he had yet faced he couldnt give up his questyet it would be wrong to golem in the gears deprive this community of its only protection from the hazards of the region evening was coming and the fauns brought down fruits from the trees and fresh berries from the mountain and sea biscuits from the waterand formed a feast the visitors were invited of course and the food was very good but grundy remained pensive not seeing any proper course as the shadows lengthened snortimer scrambled away that shadow he cried in monstertongue its reaching for me but youre a creature of shadow grundy reminded him you live in darkness im afraid of the dark afraid of the dark grundy was astonished whats the matter with you i dont know the bed monster confessed but now i love the sunshine and cant stand the dark but its dark under your bed the bed snortimer exclaimed with horror dont let it get me whats the matter rapunzel asked snortimers afraid of the dark and doesnt want to go back under his bed grundy said baffled she laughed silly its the reversewood of course get rid of that sliver of reversewood grundy told the bed monster snortimer tossed aside the sliverand suddenly dived under the bed he had reverted to normal and could no longer stand the light one mystery solved just let me make sure hes all right rapunzel said she went to the bed climbed up on it then changed to humansize she dangled her pretty ankles down toward the ground golem in the gears snortimer grabbed rapunzel screamed and yanked her legs away hes all right she pronounced but the nymphs had noted this action ooo let me try an oread exclaimed she ran to the bed plumped down on it and dangled her legs naturally snortimer grabbed eeeeek the nymph screamed happily yanking her legs away suddenly they were all doing it the evening resounded with their joyous shrieks squeals and giggles one naiad being less agile on land lost her balance when grabbed and tumbled under the bed eeek she screamed hes all hands there followed a sound suspiciously like kiss ing and she rolled out and into the water a broad smile on her face the bed monster it seemed was a success but grundy looked across to where stanley lay supposedly snoozing and saw that the dragon looked a trifle greener than usual for three years he had been the center of attention now there was competition grundy ambled over to the dragon not that this is relevant he said in dragontalk but theres a little girl at castle roogna who only has eyes for one dragon stanley sighed steamily actually id like to see cas tle roogna again but what would happen to these nice fauns and nymphs to that grundy had no answer he returned to the bed where the nymphs were finally tiring of their sport its getting too dark one explained we have to go to sleep and shortly all of the nymphs and fauns were sleep ing in their various habitats the boundless energy of their day becoming the easy repose of their night stanley posi tioned himself across the entrance path so that he could intercept any intruders and slept himself golem in the gears jordan and threnody settled down under an acorn tree she was changing back to humansize at the moment she was in the diffuse ghostlike stage having increased her size but not yet her mass in another hour she would be solid again that left the bed for grundy and rapunzel she had shifted back to golemsize her changes were instant unlike threnodys but she had no other forms there generally did seem to be a tradeoff in magic few people had it all and those were magicians or sorceresses little dolph could change instantly to any form and therefore he was a magician destined to be king of xanth if ivy didnt want it hey grundy snortimer called from under the bed here grundy said you know weve found your dragon but we havent found romance for me that was part of the deal you know grundy looked at rapunzel stricken what could he say is he asking what i think hes asking rapunzel asked yes and i dont know what to tell him why tell him the truth she said he deserves to know you know but rapunzel said it for him snortimer it grieves me to tell you this but there are no females of your species i suspected that the bed monster muttered and grundy translated snortimer could understand human talk as many monsters could though he couldnt speak it but im sure your life can be worthwhile rapunzel said those nymphs seemed to like you very well golem in the gears but i cant stay here snortimer replied glumly its stanleys territory and so there was a dragon who would return to castle roogna but could not and a bed monster who would remain here but could not xanth was full of ironies somehow theres an answer for everything rapun zel said consolingly i just know it she was somewhat nymphlike in her positive attitude grundy wished he could share it but he could not being on a quest was not as simple as he had imagined then rapunzel took his hand again and almost he was able to believe that things were better than they were chapter a bonnet of bees in the morning the fauns and nymphs roused and flocked to see the visitors just as if they didnt remember them stanley whomped over every day is new for them he explained in dragontalk they dont remember overnight thats why the goblins and ogres and things can raid the fauns and nymphs never leam and take no precautions they really need protection grundy agreed per ceiving the larger picture of course it wouldnt be right to deprive the community of its only protection but how could he return to castle roogna with his quest unful filled golem in the gears the nymphs rediscovered the bed monster and shrieked with delight as snortimer grabbed at their attrac tive ankles stanley turned a darker shade of green but made no comment the fauns fetched in the morning feast of fruits and biscuits everyone was happyexcept the visitors who were cursed with memories longer than a day if there is no solution rapunzel murmured maybe this would be a good place to stay no grundy said i have a quest to fulfill and you need to be restored to your own kind whichever that is there has to be a way of course she said somewhat sadly but in midmoming things abruptly changed there was an ominous humming from the entrance trail soon it manifested as a swarm of bs and by the sound of it they meant no good they were huge bs similar to bees but larger and i more magical each was a quarter the size of grundy and they had horrendous stingers they spread out and divebombed the hapless fauns and nymphs the attacked creatures screamedthen acted very strangely one insisted on running out in front of all the others and staying there no matter what another went to the rear of the group and would not be budged a third started peering about looking and looking as if he could not see enough another cried i have seen the light over and over another got down on the ground and tried to tunnel into it all of them were doing such peculiar things that the others could not figure it outuntil getting stung them selves and taking off on their own peculiarities jordan glared about sword in hand but this wasnt much good against the bs what does it mean thren ody asked golem in the gears i think those are bs from a have rapunzel said i have learned about them but never seen them until this moment a bhive grundy asked but all bs live in hives a bhave she said thats a very special kind when they sting the victim behaves in the manner dic tated by the sting it looks to me as if there are several types of bs herea bfore a bhind a blieve a b neath a bhold oh grundy exclaimed the one whos trying to go before everyone and the one going behind and the one who sees the light and the one trying to get down beneath and the one looking all about threnody put in thats the one stung by the bhold and i see a bseech a bside a bstir a breave jordan added and a bsiege a bset a btween grundy added and a number of bwilders and bwails rapunzel concluded but why are they attacking the innocent folk but now one of the insects was making a bline for grundy have you had enough golem it buzzed in b talk the sea hag he cried catching on oh no rapunzel exclaimed in maidenly dismay shes still after me you cant have her hag grundy cried i am not the queen b the b buzzed i am merely her messenger she says the fauns and nymphs will suf fer excruciatingly until the girl is returned to her whats she saying rapunzel asked distraught this is only a messenger with an ultimatum grundy said the hag wants the usual it seems she has taken over the queen b so these bs obey her golem in the gears and theyre going to harass the innocent creatures until she gets her way threnody said i know how she thinks weve got to nullify her this is my job grundy said ill go to the bhave and settle with her once and for all well all go jordan said touching his sword you men are so headstrong and foolish threnody said if everyone goes the bs will simply swarm in and sting us and well spend all our time in weird activity and never get there no this has to be a covert operation accomplished while most of the swarm is away from the have probably grundy could do it alone if he could sneak away no its too dangerous rapunzel cried its too dangerous not to try it grundy said grimly snortimer can you get me out of here without being spotted by the bs snortimer didnt answer it was day and he was hud dled under the bed grundy went and got the loose sliver of reversewood i he tossed it under the bed the bed monster caught it automaticallyand came sailing out suddenly afraid of the shadows i can do it he cried good enough grundy mounted keep them dis tracted he called to the others but youll have to do it by nightfall threnody called back because then theyll return to their have any way by nightfall he agreed then he hung on as snor timer scurried for the ring of mountains they climbed the roughhewn slope snortimers hands readily grasping the crevices because they were off the path the bs did not spot them they circled around until golem in the gears they could intersect the path out of sight of the swarm then proceeded rapidly along it as they left the retreat grundy began calling to the surrounding vegetation where is the bhave south the vegetation agreed they bore south through increasingly rough terrain dodged around a tangle tree and came into sight of it a huge hive in the shape of a ladys bonnet hanging from a big branch they stopped short for a number of guard ian bs buzzed around it ill have trouble getting at the b in that bonnet grundy muttered i could climb up the tree and rip it down snortimer suggested and get hopelessly stung grundy retorted thats no good i need to sneak in seal it off and then go after the queen i can fit inside you cant its dangerous snortimer reminded him set me on the branch grundy said then when i sneak in you leap up and jam something in the entrance then get out of there before the bs catch you you fools another voice said thatll never work grundy looked around there was a tremendous spi der with a circular web that spanned from tree to ground you know these bs grundy asked in spidertalk i feed on them the spider said but theyre getting pretty canny and now they avoid my web no matter how carefully i conceal it then how do you figure you know so well how to handle them grundy demanded i didnt say i knew how to handle them the spider said i just know what wont work thats not much help grundy said sourly why should i help you anyway because i could make it worth your while golem in the gears how i could call some bs here so you would have a sea sons feast the spiders mandibles watered ah maybe i could help you how i could give you some silk to let yourself down to the entrance to the bhave grundy considered not worth it id just get stung when i got there i could give you a webnet to put across the entrance so that you could prevent any bs from passing in and out they cant handle that stuff it tangles up their wings grundy wavered so that once i got in i could seal it off behind me that does sound good but id still have to deal with the ones remaining inside i can give you another webnet that you could sling over a b incapacitating it long enough for you to stab it with your sword done grundy cried and it was done the spider made him a line an entrancecover web and a thrownet in return he posi tioned himself behind the big web and sounded off in b talk help im a succulent flower just bursting with pollen and i havent seen a b in just ages immediately several bs buzzed at himand were caught in the web in a moment the spider had caught them and trussed them up grundy realized that this could be a good thing for him too the more bs the spider caught the fewer would remain to attack him but not all the bs around the bonnet had charged in golem in the gears the ones remaining seemed to be the warriors who didnt fetch nectar from flowers how could he lure them in grundy smiled his usual weapon was his best hey you horses bhinds he yelled you couldnt hurt an intruder if your hides depended on it that aroused several they buzzed angrily at him and were trapped by the spider he tried again i think your stingers are dull youre nothing but useless drones that roused several more but two or three remained too dull or too canny to respond grundy had a flashbulb of an idea help im in trou ble he screamed in the voice of a queen b that got them without pausing to reason why they zoomed to himand were caught that seems to be all that are presently available are you satisfied he asked the spider definitely the spider agreed selecting a succulent b to suck dry grundy turned away he really didnt enjoy watching the way a spider fed now snortimer carried him up the tree and to the branch above the nest if i dont come out before the swarm returns get out of here grundy told the bed monster go back to the others and tell them theyll have to get along without me youre brave snortimer said grundy laughed brave im terrified then he let himself down on the silken line and swung to the entrance to the bonnet after a couple of tries he was able to catch on to the rim and scramble in it was a tight squeeze for he was larger than the average b but that made it easier for him to wedge himself in without falling inside he took out the first net and carefully applied it to the rim of the hole the webbing was light but very golem in the gears strong and sticky at the edge the spider had told him how to use it and though he was clumsy not having as many legs as a spider did the web fastened very firmly no b would readily pass in or out of this now came the bad part he knew there were other bs inside he could hear them humming as they worked he held his pinsword in one hand and his webnet in the other and worked his way upward the bonnet inside was constructed of many thick layers of cardboard arranged in rings several passages opened out to the sides slanting upward he had thought the bonnet would be dark inside but it was not the bs had set small glowing fungi at the intersections that made it easier for him to travel but also made him more visible well they could probably tell he was here by the smell anyway once they were alerted so far the bs seemed to be minding their own bs wax fortunately this was a huge threedimensional labyrinth seeming much larger from the inside than it had from outside perhaps the bs bwitched the bonnet to make its inner dimensions magically greater but there was no inten tional confusion the passages were straightforward and it was easy enough to proceed directly toward the center up to a point when he reached what he presumed to be the central chamber where the queen b should be the passage was blocked by the sturdy gray cardboard building material this was evidently a restricted area he tried to poke a hole in it to push through but it was surprisingly tough stuff his pin could poke into it but only with such difficulty that it wasnt worth the effort he needed a fast way in so he took a side passage this was easier at first because it was level but he had to walk hunched over the diameter of it was too small for his comfort and he golem in the gears didnt know where it was leading he kept his pin and net ready in due course the passage debouched into an impres sive chamber there were hundreds of cells hexagonal in cross section each filled with amber substance and sealed with translucent wax this was evidently the honeycombthe food storage depot of the have grundy liked honey but he wasnt hungry for this right now he just wanted to get his job done and get out of here before the swarm returned he didnt know how much time he had the controlled lighting made this place seem timeless a workerb was at one of the hex chambers it spied grundy heyyoure not supposed to b here it buzzed in btalk alarmed im the honey inspector grundy said hoping to keep things quiet im going to fetch the supe bfore i get in trouble the b buzzed scrambling toward an exit grundy ran after it stabbing with his pin he hated to do it but he couldnt afford to have the supe on his case but the b scrambled out just ahead of him getting away in moments several bs buzzed in one was evidently the supeb thats no inspector thats an intruder it buzzed sting it three bs charged him grundy backed up against the wall of hexchambers pin and net ready but more bs were entering the chamber and he knew he would soon be overwhelmed then he had another lightbulb notion he reversed his pin and stabbed into one of the wax seals behind him the point penetrated and stuck he wrenched it out side ways and the whole wax cap pulled off with a slurpy sucking sound the thick honey oozed out save that honey the supe buzzed horrified golem in the gears golem in the gears the nearest worker batted its faceted eyes i didnt know you cared supe that honey stingerface the supe buzzed angrily pointing two legs at it the worker chastened got to work grundy moved over and wedged out another cap and then a third when a worker charged him he put away his pin for a moment and used his hand to scoop out a glob of honey he hurled it at the b it didnt hurl very well but a good part of it got on the bs wing and got the creature in serious trouble it forgot him in its effort to get the gooey stuff off and back into the leaking cham ber soon grundy was able to leave the honeypot chamber unmolested but he still hadnt found a way in to the central cavity instead he came to a quiet dim chamber lined with cells that did not hold honey he peered closely at oneand discovered that there was a monstrous grub in it a devel oping b this was the nursery a nurseb was approaching grundy didnt have the heart to wreak mayhem here so he hastily exited by the nearest side passage this took him on around the have and upward in due course he came to a new smaller chamber that had cardboard tapestries on the walls a young and astonishingly pretty female b angled her antennae at him as he entered well now a visitor she buzzed dulcetly uh yes grundy said uncertain what was going on here im uh looking for the queen oh really she buzzed i didnt think you were the type you look more like a golem than a drone i am a golem he confessed surprised by the way she accepted him she was much larger than the worker bs and could have caused him some alarm if she had attacked but she seemed quite friendly and you i am princess bnign she buzzed soon i will take my maiden flight and mate with the worthiest drone and then start my own bonnet bnine he asked mishearing her buzz there are eight others of course not she buzzed cheerfully i was one of the first two out of incubation so i fought and killed the other btwelve despite all the vitamins she had taken and then cut off the heads of all the remaining prospects bone through btwenty there are no other princess bs but me now isnt it romantic but you seem like such a nice creature grundy blurted i am a nice creature she buzzed i simply did what had to be done a have cannot support two queens well the queen for this have has been taken over by an evil mind he told her i have come here to capture her and take her away that so she buzzed interested i thought she was acting peculiar recently sending almost the whole swarm out to bother the faunsweve always been at peace with the fauns before but when the queen commands all obey a new notion surfaced suppose i took the queen awaywhat would happen to this have why i would have to take it over of course that wouldnt bother me its always better to start with a wellestablished situation if one can im not truly looking forward to starting my own i understand there are all manner of dangers out there such as birds and insecti vores and pitcher plants there are grundy agreed golem in the gears she wiggled her fair antennae at him do you sup pose if youll just tell me how to get into the queens cham ber ill do my best to take her out i wont kill her you wont she buzzed disappointed if i did that her spirit would simply take over another creature probably you mercy is best she agreed but you wont let her go never he agreed take the third passage to your right she said indi cating a tunnel grundy headed along the tunnel he passed straight through the first intersection and the second and turned right at the third this led directly into the huge central chamber he entered and dropped to the curving floor his pin and net ready there was the queen b she was enormous massing as much as grundy and she had big sturdy claws and a phenomenal stinger so you have come golem she buzzed i had to come he agreed trying to choke back the fear that welled up in him how could he overcome this ferocious creature and now i shall finally be rid of you she buzzed she stood stretched her wings and moved slowly toward him do you know what i shall do to you i dont think i care to grundy said watching her warily trying to figure out her most likely mode of attack i will sting you just hard enough to render you helpless but alive and conscious she said seeming to relish her own words then i will use your flesh to feed my new golem in the gears crop of warriors it will give them a healthy taste for blood grundy quailed that was just as bad as having ones mind taken over by the hag but first you have to score on me he said with whatever poor facade of bravery it was possible to manage and after that ill have all your stupid friends stung into submission too the queen hag continued stalking him until at last rapunzel is ready to do anything to spare them further humiliation and agony anything at all you are the baggiest hag ive ever met he told her trying to judge whether he could catch her in the web net with a single heave she was so big and after i have her young and tender body naturally ill put it through its paces she continued that bar barians a fairly handsome lout maybe before i have him dispatched ill the thought ofrapunzels body being used in that way so upset grundy that he lunged at the b this was what she had wanted she buzzed straight up out of his way so that he stumbled and lost his balance expecting a resistance that he did not encounter before he recovered she divebombed him from behind he heard her coming and threw himself flat so that she zoomed over him it was a close call the blast from her wings struck all about him he rolled over sat upand saw her coming at him again he hurled up the webnet but it missed blown away by that same wingblast he had to roll desperately aside to avoid her aerial charge and the tip of a wing struck him as she passed the wings looked gossamerthin but that was one smart rap he scrambled to his feet before she could reorient he golem in the gears retained the pin but he had lost the net that was half of a disaster for though he might be able to kill her he could not capture her if he killed her to protect himself that would only free her spirit to take another formand he didnt want that the hag gave him no time to consider she looped about and came at him again this time she moved slowly almost hovering in place watching for her opportunity he held the pin ready to stab her knowing that that was no answer she had maneuvered him into a position of kill or be killed which was exactly what he didnt want suddenly she moved automatically he stabbed with the pinand missed for she veered away it had been a feint but she spun about and came back at him before he could recover much more swiftly than she had before and buffeted his sword arm the pin was knocked away as he stumbled forward he turned to face her but she was already on him clutching him with her rough b legs bearing him down under her weight and the thrust other wings he fell back and clunked his head on the floor it wasnt a hard floor but he felt dizzy for a moment unable to resist effectively now ive got you golem she buzzed im going to sting you into submission not enough to kill you just enough to paralyze you and she maneuvered to bring her big sharp stinger into position but youll die if you sting me he protested no i wont golem there are bs and bs and this kind stings with impunity now let me see i want the flesh to be properly tender so i think ill sting you in the stomach brace yourself this will hurt and keep on hurt ing as you swell up like a balloon what joy the terrible stinger was descending toward him and he could neither throw her off nor roll out of the way golem in the gears she held him too firmly braced by her own buzzing wings he reached wildly for the pin but couldnt find it it had probably rolled well clear all his questing hand found was a loose length of line line that was the end of the net the stinger touched his clothing as she maneuvered to sting him just the right amounta more delicate matter than merely stinging to death now or never grundy lifted his arm and flung the net up it lifted spread and settled down over the bs wings it clung to them stickily for this was what it had been crafted to doto be neutral to inanimate substance but to catch wings firmly yeeech the bhag buzzed jumping up and trying to free herself but grundy pulled on the line and the net settled more firmly about her a b with its wings entan gled was a b largely helpless as the spider had shown now he had her it was a struggle for she was very strong and tried to catch him with her stinger but he continued hauling the net about getting her snugly wrapped he recovered his pinsword and tucked it back through his belt then he hauled on his line sliding her along all was secure but the exit from this chamber was above and he was sure he would not be able to haul her body up there she was sure too you havent got me yet golem the moment my swarm returns youll be stingbait surely true what was he to do and i hear them coming now golem she buzzed true again he could hear the muted distant hum then he figured it out princess bnign he called ive got her but i need an exit there was a buzz at the hole why so you do b nign agreed golem in the gear golem in the gears sting this miscreant the queen b buzzed imperi ously i cant do that bnign replied what how dare you why cant you do that because a queen cant take orders she can only give them but i am the queen you were the queen now am the queen and b nign flew down to the bottom of the chamber landed braced herself and used her sharp b claws to cut open the sealed main entrance soon the hole opened up thank you your majesty grundy said and shoved the deposed queen into the hole she fell straight down to the net covering the bottom of the have grundy followed more carefully but as he reached the main entrance the hum of the returning swarm loomed loud it was coming into sight feverishly he yanked away the netsupports so that the hagb could drop to the ground below swarm the bundled queen hag buzzed sting that golem kill the usurper queen bnign appeared at the entrance ignore that trash she buzzed am your queen now grundy hung by the edge of the hole not daring to drop that distance while the swarm approached which queen would they obey snortimer scrambled out below drop ill catch you he cried grundy dropped the bed monster caught him get me and that bundle out of here in a hurry grundy cried snortimer set grundy on his back picked up the bun dle by the line and scrambled away just as the swarm arrived help help the queen hag buzzed but bnign was buzzing louder and after a moments hesitation the swarm oriented on her grundy had won this round the queen buzzed again more stridently bfoul b wilder bdevil here to me my loyal minions three bs summoned by name hesitated then they broke from the swarm and flew toward the queen you go to her bnign buzzed imperiously enraged then you are banished from this have miscreants if you or she ever show your antennae in these parts again you will be executed i have buzzed grundy could tell by the way the three hesitated in flight that the sentence bothered them it was terrible to be banished from the have obviously she could make it stick because the rest of the swarm stayed with her these three and the hag were through here but now they had nothing to lose vengeance the hag buzzed sting this golem free me get out of here snort grundy cried the bed mon ster accelerated scrambling for the path to the retreat in moments they were well away from the bonnet but the three grim minions of the hag pursued them snortimer plunged through the thickest brush to hide from them and confuse them and this was workingbut there was a snag abruptly he veered away from the deep est most shadowed region whats the matter snort grundy cried seeing the three bs hovering overhead looking for them im afraid of the dark the bed monster said oh that of course just give me the reversewood snortimer handed it up to him it was no more than a splinter but its potency remained but this pause gave the hag her chance she buzzed loudly evidently calling again to her three loyal bs one of them heard her and zoomed in to the target golem in the gears golem in the gears snortimer dived under the brush and dodged to the side and the b had to veer off but every time they passed through a clearing the hag buzzed again and the b re oriented as they emerged to the regular path the b could no longer be denied it zoomed in closed its wings and shot at grundy so swiftly that he knew the only way he could avoid getting stung was to jump off snortimers backin which case snortimer would be the one stung and bfoul would have time to free the hag before grundy could catch up so grundy didnt jump he braced himself and took the terrible sting the b caught him on the right arm it hurt but only for a moment then the b was gone its sting expended and grundy shook himselfand discovered he was unharmed in fact the dirt and grime and bits of spider web that adhered to him fell away leaving him amazingly clean what had happened but he had no time to ponder that for the hag buzzed again and a second minion heard her and oriented on them snortimer now on the clear path doubled his effort and charged into the gloom of dusk but fast as he was the b was faster slowly it gained and as they shot through the gap in the ring of mountains it caught up again grundy had to remain and take the sting rather than jump clear again he was tagged on an arm painfully then the b left and grundy took stock of himself again he seemed to be all right in fact he now seemed despite the fatigue of his effort to be marvelously clear headed there was no longer any confusion about his situation rapunzel he exclaimed shes a crossbreed who has been raised alone she can relate properly to neither the human nor the elven culture i am doing her no favor by requiring her to make a choice between them there is only one creature who can truly appreciate her nature as the only creature of her kindthe one who is the only one of his kind the hag buzzed again now the third and final b heard her and responded it zoomed in hurry snort grundy cried were almost there but the bed monster continued as if he hadnt heard grundy and the b gained on them try dodging grundy advised but again his friend ignored him now they burst into the retreat there were the fauns and nymphs and jordan and threnody with little rapun zel perched on her shoulder golemstyle rapunzel smiled and clapped her hands xxxxx she exclaimed what grundy asked yyy yyy yyyyyyy yyyy jordan explained now the final b came down so swiftly that there was no stopping it it was aiming for snortimer evidently thinking that if it took out grundys steed grundy would be helpless grundy leaped toward it at the last moment inter cepting the terrible sting he was caught in the shoulder and spun about and again it hurt he fell to the ground and the sliver of reversewood fell from his hand the b flew unsteadily away rapunzel was down on the ground and running toward him oh grundy she cried are you hurt that was the bravest thing i ever saw she was making sense now and abruptly he realized why he had let go of the reversewood that had been reversing his talent so that instead of speaking and under standing all languages he had spoken and understood none no wonder snortimer hadnt respondedgrundy had been spouting gibberish golem in the gears oh grundy youre an angel rapunzel exclaimed you even have a halo grundy glanced up startled there was a little circlet of light floating just above him then his clear mind provided the answer that last b that had stung him must have been bdevilbut the reversewood had reversed the effect of the sting making him angelic instead of devilish theeffect would only last a few minutes or hours depending on the intensity of the sting and the prior b must have been bwilder whose sting reversed gave him this uncommon clarity of mind and the first sting must have been by bfoul the reverse effect making him uncommonly clean he had been brave perhapsbut he had also been very lucky now while his mind was clear he needed to act rapunzel i love you he said why of course you do she agreed kissing him i thought youd never realize well i he broke off for in their brief distraction the queen hag had finally worked her way out of the webnet now she buzzed up hovering nearby so golem she said in btalk you thought to neu tralize me did you well know that my sting is now set on max instantly fatal to the victim grundy experienced another cold wash of fear instantly fatal he echoed in humantalk and do you know what im going to do wretched golem i know grundy agreed pushing rapunzel aside so that there would be no danger of her getting stung too im going to sting you to death she buzzed anyway golem in the gears then im going to sting your wretched friends when rapunzel sees them all die and knows she is alone for ever she will be too distraught to oppose me any longer then i will take over her body immediately and use it as brutally as i can imagine what do you think of that golem grundy drew his pinsword youll have to kill me hag for i will never let you have rapunzel while i live she buzzed so hard with laughter she wobbled in place you think to oppose me with that golem even if you managed to kill me as i kill you it would make no dif ference because ill simply come back in another form even if you should kill me without getting stung youll still lose in the end i have defeated you golem then she charged in grundy stood to take the assault having no other choice though he knew he had no chance suddenly a huge hand swept between them it caught the b and swept it away it was rapunzel in giantform she held the b in her hand ive got you hag she cried sting me if you dare then youll have nothing the b buzzed angrily in her closed hand but did not stingbecause indeed that would be pointless the one body the hag couldnt afford to kill was rapunzels and i wouldnt need to kill you rapunzel continued even if i could because you have no further power over me hag i know you for what you are and you will never have my body for i will never consent no matter what other mischief you do if you deprive me of my friends ill simply kill myself then she opened her hand and let the b fly out unharmed now why dont you call my bluff she challenged the b hesitated then flew toward the take it dived golem in the geare in and a fish leaped up to swallow it rapunzel had finally faced down the sea hag and was effectively free of her rapunzel changed back to golemsize grundy went up and took her in his arms and you were calling what did brave he told her well she was attacking you she said is she alive or dead now jordan asked probably dead for the moment grundy said but her ghost will take over another body now i think shell leave us alone because she knows there is no way shell take rapunzel alive so all you have left to worry about is your quest threnody said and though i hate to say it i fear that there was a roar from the entrance to the retreat the remaining fauns and nymphs screamed and scattered into the dusk it was a giant tigerheaded man aha the tigerhead growled in tigerheadtongue delicious juicy prey ill massacre them all he strode forward confidently but as he passed the bed a big hairy hand shot out and grabbed his ankle there was a horrendous roar the tigerhead was so startled he leaped high into the air then turned tail and fled the nymphs rushed back to the bed snortimer saved us they cried dangling their fair legs down and laughing as he grabbed hes a hero stanley steamer who had just roused himself ready to fight the intruder made a low growl of disgust unless jordan said grundy jumped at the notion he hurried over to the bed snort how would you like to stay here and protect the fauns and nymphs from molestation he asked with that sliver of reversewood you could operate by golem in the geon day or night and at other times you could just uh grab at pretty legs i think that might be pretty uh romantic romance snortimer agreed blissfully i have found it at last grundy turned to stanley which means that you can finally return to castle roogna and make ivy happy knowing the fauns and nymphs are safe stanley brightened he liked that notion well go together the three of us rapunzel said now i think it wont bother me to meet the human com munity there chapter elf quest they had declared their love but grundys doubts returned as his mind reverted to normal rapunzel thought she loved himbut she still hadnt been exposed to the elven or human cultures was it fair to have her make her decision on the basis of ignorance they were traveling on stanleys back toward castle roogna charting a course between parnassus and lake ogrechobee hoping to avoid the hazards of either region it was not easy to hold on as the dragon whomped along but they were doing it by using vines looped about stan leys body perhaps this jogging about caused some of grundys doubts to fly loose for rapunzel picked them up youre thinking again she accused him golem in the gears golem in the gears well suppose we get married and then you discover its a mistake he asked that you really belong in the elven society for example with an elven male its not a mistake she insisted but you have no direct experience with the elves how can you be sure she pondered well why dont we stop at an elf elm then and see that should satisfy you she assumed that she would not be moved by the elves he was not at all so sure but her suggestion was good if she was going to go to the elves this was the time to find out it was already too late for him for his heart was lost but perhaps not too late for her he loved her and wanted her to be happyin whatever way was best for her yes i will ask about he did so the local trees did not know of any nearby elf elms grundy was halfrelieved suppose there were no elves along their route thenno he could not afford to take rapunzel by default she had to meet the elves and decide for herself and then meet the human com munity and decide again only then would it be all right they camped for the night and foraged for food and drink they had no fear of predators because stanley was now a fairly formidable dragon hardly anyone both ered a dragon those foolish enough to try had been culled out of the realm of the living in the course of many cen turies they made a nest of pillows to sleep on and stan ley formed a circle around them nose to tail gently steaming they were safe enough rapunzel took his hand as she always did i know youre trying to do the right thing grundy she said trying he agreed i understand that men are mostly logical and women are mostly feeling i suppose ive got the feeling this is a mistake but you were the one who suggested that now ive had time to change my mind change your thats easier to do now that my hair is short grundy suspected that would not make an awful lot of sense to him if he reflected on it too long still much of her magic had been tied up in her lovely long hair and perhaps the length of it did contribute to the length of her determination but it just wouldnt be right to to love me without giving me a proper chance to explore my other avenues she said i understand but still i wish i could avoid this process i cant say i like it much myself he said but sup pose iyouweand then suppose we gave ourselves to each other and then discovered it was a mistake she said as usual phrasing his thought better than he could yes and and so we would be sorry and very sad for our fool ishness she sounded so calm and rational yes she turned to him oh grundylets do it what oh dont play the innocent with me she said reprov ingly im the innocent not you lets be foolish and see if were sorry later temptation tore at him that would certainly be a way to settle it his doubt was about to be overwhelmed with no more than a semblance of sincerity he temporized you cant mean that she sighed of course i dont mean it grundy she agreed i knew youd be noble golem in the gears noble his words had mocked his intentbut she had accepted the words and now he was committed to them he was not only insignificant in body he was insignificant in spirit he felt worse than ever it was wrong of me to try to be a temptress she continued im not good at it because i dont have any experience youre not good at it because youre a truly beautiful person he corrected her no just inexperienced youre the beautiful one because you know whats right and wrong and choose the right no im nothing of the kind when you saidi wanted toi only i think you have an inferiority complex grundy you dont even believe in your own good motives and she did believein his good motives she was too good even to recognize the evil in another persons mind inferiority he agreed still she said i have a deep misgiving about this elf matter i fear some nameless evil that is not of our making if you really dont want to oh no im sure you are correct i should meet the elves but ill be very glad and relieved when its over and were back on the way to castle roogna im not as worried about the human community now since i met jordan and threnody they were all right i can get along with their kind then maybe but i dont love their kind she concluded i love you grundy and if this elf business finally satisfies you then it will be worth it golem in the gears then it would be worth it he held her hand and drifted into a somewhat troubled sleep next day they threaded the separation between lake and mountain and ferreted their way through the thick ening jungle tangle trees were more common here and others that seemed equally menacing but when any started inching their foliage toward the travelers stanley jetted steam and they withdrew then grundy picked up news of an elf elm he sighed inwardly how convenient it would have been if there had been none but now they had to go to ita prospect he dreaded though for no intuitive reason he simply feared that rapunzel would like the elves too well and would conclude that her proper home was there but he had to provide her that chance they zeroed in on it but the elven demesnes were extensive and they did not reach the elm by nightfall so they camped and foraged and settled down oh i feel it worse rapunzel lamented the elves wont hurt us he reassured her not when we explain they are sensible folk i know it is not precisely their motives i fear but she didnt know exactly what she did fear so she kissed him and held his hand tightly and slept and in due course he slept too in the morning the elves were there and what be ye doing in these our demesnes their leader inquired sternly in the humantongue he carried a hefty wooden mallet grundy jumped up i can explain yed better we were coming to see you honored elf he said golem in the gears golem in the gears quickly because one of our number is of elven deriva tion that were not lightly claimed the elf said grimacing grundy brought rapunzel forward she was busily brushing out her short hair making herself presentable in the female manner on an emergency basis this is rapun zel who she be not elvensize show them grundy told her rapunzel was abruptly elven size still trying to comb a tangle from her hacked hair the leader squinted at her aye she be fair enough but size change be magic no proof of origin but her magic is in her hair that grundy realized that he could not prove anything by her hair as she had lost her phenomenal tresses my ancestors were jordan the barbarian and bluebell elf of the tribe of flower elves rapunzel said finally getting the tangle out there was a stir you claim good lineage girl the best she agreed and you the elf asked of grundy i am a golem my talent is linguistics and this is stanley steamer formerly the gap dragon stanley puffed a ring of steam a tame dragon the elfs bow arched he is princess ivys companion in the human realm we are returning him to her do ye several folk stand by your statements the elf asked gravely of course we do rapunzel exclaimed indignantly what do you think we are then we shall take ye to our tree for confirmation if ye be confirmed yell have no fear of us and if not grundy wondered but didnt ask we be of the tool tribe the elf said i be mallet and these be chisel here he indicated an elf with a chisel and hoe and wrench and awl he continued around the circle each elf made obvious by his tool but it was evident that those tools could quite readily serve as weapons then the elves escorted the party to the elf elm this was an enormous tree its crown of foliage seeming small because it was so far away they halted a moderate distance away you who claim elven descent mallet said carry that rock startled rapunzel obeyed she remained elvensize so the indicated rock was larger than grundy could have handled but it was no easy thing for her to carry she staggered forward with it toward the tree then oddly the burden seemed to grow lighter and she carried it with less distress as the others paced her she relaxed finally setting the rock on her shoulder so as to free one hand its not as heavy as i thought she confessed enough mallet said your claim is verified but you havent examined your records she pro tested know crossbreed that the strength of elves varies inversely with our distance from the elm he explained your strength be not as great here as ours but the effect be manifest you are of elven descent whatever your other lineage she set down the rock i was not told of this she seemed pleased grundy scowled inwardly naturally the sea hag had not educated her about this aspect of the elven culture it might have made her eager to experience it it also golem in the gears augured unfortunately well for her acceptance here and her possible decision to remain more elves descended from the high foliage on thin lines seeming to have no trouble holding on the first to land on the ground was a handsome male elf whose beard was not yet full what have we here this one demanded we have a girl of elven descent prince gimlet mal let said with her entourage of golem and dragon prince gimlet oriented on rapunzel and a fair crea ture she is indeed may i say he exclaimed taking her hand and kissing it she blushed flattered grundy kept his expression fixed on neutral prince gimlets gaze passed over grundy and stanley feed her companions while i show our visitor our tree he said making an offhand gesture oh but i dont want to be separated from rapun zel began obviously a dragon can not ascend a tree the prince told her he will be here when you return and he put his arm about her slender waist and hauled her up climb ing the line with feet and a single hand it was an amazing feat even allowing for the elven strength near the tree but grundy cried and stanley steamed but the other elves closed in about them their expressions turning grim their hands going to their tools and grundy realized that this was not the best occasion to make an issue after all he wanted rapunzel to experience the elven culture didnt he here be food mallet said indicating the carcass of some kind of beast near the base of the tree stanley went over sniffed and started chewing on it but grundy following saw some dead ants by the car cass whats this he asked in grasstalk golem in the gears poisoned meat the grass replied they use it to get rid of pests stanley grundy cried dont but it was too late the dragon stiffened his eyes assuming a glazed look then he sank to the ground grundy turned on the elves youthis is not princes orders mallet said strange ones i admit we never poisoned a tame creature before but hes the prince grundy started to run but an elf reached down and caught him and hefted him up overhead with one hide ously powerful arm he was helpless he was carried around the tree the elf bent to touch the ground and found a ring set there he hauled on it and a turfcovered slab came up beneath was a ramp going down the elf dropped grundy in and let the heavy slab fall back into place grundy tumbled on down through the darkness fetch ing up against a packedearth wall he was bruised and disoriented but not hurt he realized that he had abruptly been made a prisoner for a while he simply sat in the dank dark sorting things out something was calamitously wrongbut exactly what was it he had had little contact with elves but he was absolutely sure they did not deal treacherously with visitors they were resolute in opposition and loyal in support and always made their orientation clear at the outset to challenge a visiting party then accept it then betray itthis was simply not the elven way yet it had happened grundy knew that he would be able to do noth ing positive until he understood why certainly he could not pound on the exit panel and demand to be released they would not release him without reason and might golem in the geon golem in the gears simply dispatch him as they had the dragon to shut him up the dragon they had poisoned stanley that was the most appalling thing of all without stanley his quest was deadnot to mention the horror of losing a loyal friend he calmed himself stanley was not just another dragon j he was the gap dragon just about the toughest breed i there was accustomed to eating anything he was young and vigorous now if any creature could survive poison stanley could he hadnt eaten very much of the carcass before being affected probably he was merely stunned and would throw off the effect after a while after all in the past as an adult he had consumed zombies and cherry bombs and once a basilisk if he had survived those surely he could survive a little poison perhaps he could check on that grundy ran his hand across the clammy earth until he found a worm hole then he put his mouth to the hole and murmured in wormtalk hey you worm where are you startled the worm replied who calls me from below it is i grundy golem friend to all insignificant crea tures i need your help for a friend to insignificant creatures i will help grundy smiled in the dark he had rather thought that would be the case there was magic of a special nature in language there is a dragon above can you tell me whether he is alive or dead by the time i got there he would surely be dead the worm pointed out but i know a tunnelbug who is very fast he can check this for you that would be much appreciated noble worm in a moment the tunnelbug had gone to the surface and returned the dragon is ill but not dead grundy sagged in relief will you carry a message to him i must give it in dragontalk so he will understand but you might carry it i will try the tunnelbug said bravely thank you so much noble tunnelbug here is the message to be whispered in his ear and grundy then said carefully in dragontalk dragon play possum till fully recoveredgrundy he repeated it several times until the tunnelbug had it straight for dragontalk was difficult for a bug in due course the bug departed now grundy tried for something more ambitious is there a squiggle in the region he called in squiggletongue he was in luck a squiggle answered it showed up in the cell with an explosion of dirt eh what what it asked perplexed oh honored vole grundy said remembering what he had learned in the voletunnels i am trapped here and need an escape will you make me a passage out that exits well away from the tree so the elves will not see me the squigglevole was flattered no one had consid ered it important enough for such a request before cer tainly golem but wouldnt you rather explore the tree itself i wouldbut the elves would treat me badly they have taken my friend up in the foliage and i fear for her safety the reason i asked the squiggle continued is that it is a very short distance to the tree and there is a shaft inside it that only we voles remember if you would like to go there what phenomenal luck yes honored vole that would golem in the gears golem in the gears be perfect exceptis there a way out of it at the top i can not help my friend if i can not get out of the trunk there are crevices you could squeeze through the creature agreed we use them to peer out at the elves they unknowing for we are very curious creatures most curious grundy agreed warmly i would be deeply grateful for such aid glad to help the squiggle said still flattered it pro ceeded to dig in the fashion only its kind could in moments making a short tunnel to the root of the tree sure enough there was a cavity in the wood that grundy found with his hands for there was no light here to make it even better there were the handholds of an old ladder leading up evidently intended for elves the elf ancestors must have crafted this as a secret exit then forgotten it he thanked the squiggle then started to climb because the elves were twice his height the rungs were more widely spaced than was convenient for him but he was able to manage he climbed through the darkness with fair dispatch counting rungs as he went so as to be able to judge the height he figured that four hundred rungs should put him at the level of the foliage it turned out that that was a considerable climb each single rung was an effort and soon he was tiring at fifty rungs he paused panting one eighth of the way up how could he ever make it the answer was he had to make it he knew that a tribe that would betray a welcome poison a friendly dragon and throw a golem in a dank cell could not have anything very wonderful in mind for a young woman rapunzel was in effect confined in another tower he would have to get her out he mounted another fifty rungs and paused again one quarter of the way upand threequarters of his strength had been expended by the feel of it but what was there to do except continue he hauled himself on up the th rung gave way when he drew on it dropping his body while his heart remained at the prior level his hands caught the next one down so that he only dropped a third of his body length but it was an ugly sensation he hung there his fright overriding his fatigue what a jolt then he resumed the climb somewhat more carefully he tested each new rung before trusting his full weight to it naturally the rungs got old and weak with age and their anchorages rotted away he should have expected that but it didnt make him feel better by the time he reached the th rung the lift provided by his fright from the nearfall had faded and his arms and legs were more tired than ever halfwayand now it would be almost as bad to descend as to ascend he was stuckrather fully committed but he still hardly believed he could make it the rest of the way up he ground on one rung at a time each one a worse torment than the one before his hands were blistering from the friction and his feet were hurting from the nar row support then the blisters burst and each new grip was painful he had to hold on more tightly because of the slipperyness caused by his own leaking hands but his strength was ebbing so that this was horrendously diffi cult two hundred and twentyfive rungsor was it two hundred and thirtyfive he was no longer certain of the count did it matter the top was where it was regardless of the count his left hand lost its grip and his right was too fatigued to make a sudden grasp but his feet slipped through the golem in the gears ladder and brought him painfully short he had not fallenbut that was accident as much as luck wouldnt it be easier simply to let go he would be down very quickly his problems over then he remembered stanley steamer waiting below for what if grundy did not return to him would the dragon make it home to ivy on his own grundy resumed his climb heedless of the agony of his hands but now that agony was fading for they were growing numb he had to test his grip on each rung not just to verify the soundness of the rung but to be sure his grip would hold up up eternally he was no longer counting that required too much energy he just went somewhere around he stalled his numbed mus cles simply would no longer respond his last vestige of strength was spent all he could do now was hang there until he dropped off but his mind had not been deadened as far as his body had he thought of rapunzel at the dubious mercy of prince gimlet why had the prince welcomed her while treating her companions in such dastardly fashion the question brought the answer rapunzel was a beautiful and innocent woman the very kind an unscru pulous man could sweep off her feet and use surely the prince cared nothing for her personally it was her naivet he was after so he had literally swept her off her feet and given orders to dispatch her companions this was the way a powerful and cynical person was grundy sim ply had not expected it among the elves whom he sup posed were superior to the human society in this respect live and learn the thought of what prince gimlet might even now be doing to rapunzel spurred grundy to renewed activity golem in the gears his arms were numb but he moved them hooking clawed hands over the rungs and hoisting himself up and up he had to be getting close he was already farther than he had thought possible at fifty rungs above him a crevice of light showed it was really very faint but he had been in darkness so long that his eyes made the illumination seem strong the squiggle had spo ken truly grundy no longer really felt his arms and legs they seemed to have disconnected from his body but his body continued to rise until he was at the crevice he peered through it was the elven kitchen it had a stove and counters and an elf cook was working the crevice was behind the stove perhaps caused by the drying effect of the heat the stove appeared to be made of wood which made grundy marvel what would such a stove bum and how would it remain intact it evidently worked satisfactorily the walls of the chamber were leafy and the workers were careful to step on the solid branches below rather than on the twigs or leaves lest they fall through there was a lot more in an elf elm than outsiders knew he moved on up feeling somewhat restored now that the desolate climb had rewarded him with this access he didnt want the kitchen he wanted the princes chambers what he would do once he found them he didnt know but that was not his immediate problem farther up on the other side he found another crevice this one overlooked the nursery for there were elven babies sleeping in leafy cradles gusts of wind rocked those cradles which were on smaller branches that bent with the light force of it it seemed to be a convenient arrangement at a higher level was the sewing room elven maidens golem in the gears were working at a table sewing garments and chatting merrily grundy paused to listen and the dragon was tame one was saying they rode on it but prince gimlet ordered it put away thats strange another said we never harmed a friendly creature before have you noticed the first said the price has been acting strangely this past day you know how he always puts his hands on us pretending its an accident thats because hes not supposed to fool with com mon girls the third said but until he finds a suitable royal bride from another elm the second rubbed her rear some day im going to accidentally drop a plate of glop on his foot thats what im saying the first said late last night when i replaced the candles in his chamber i thought sure hed try to grab me the way he usually does but he just sort of stared at me seeming confused i asked him if he was all right but he just told me gruffly to get on about my business he sounded strange i thought maybe he had some royal indisposition but i was just glad to get out of there without a struggle now after this dragon business i wonder he grabs but hes nice the third said i never heard of him harming a friendly creature before then an elven matron entered the chamber and the three shut up and concentrated on their sewing grundy moved on up though he was sure no one suspected his presence so the prince was acting strangely but his action with rapunzel was not strange obviously he had found a bet ter woman to pinch grundy burned at the notion and kept climbing the shaft narrowed and finally debouched at what had golem in the gears once been a broken branch a door cunningly grafted to resemble healedover wood opened onto a network of branches clothed with leaves grundy stood there looking about trying to decide what to do next he remained almost dead tired and hadnt located the princely chambers had all this been for noth ing then he heard voices below he was above a chamber he squatted down then lay flat parting the leaves with his hands carefully the voices became clearerand now he recognized them rapunzel and prince gimlet he managed to arrange the leaves so that he could see them without being seen he hated to imagine it but if rapunzel liked the princes attentions then she was not being forced and it would be grundys duty to let her be he could descend quietly rejoin stanley and return to castle roogna to complete his quest the fact that his love would be lost would have no bearing on the matter it wouldnt count at all to anyone but him but he had to be fair he hoped she hated the prince as it happened nothing much was happening they were evidently completing a meal a fairly sumptuous repast rapunzel for all her dainty figure had a good appetite the smell of the food reminded grundy that he had not eaten today how he would like to have some of those leftover scraps my dear i like you the prince said wiping his mouth with a fancy napkin i think ill marry you but i dont love you rapunzel protested amazed what does love have to do with it i am in need of a proper consort who can not be from this tree and i believe you will do but i love another golam in the gears his gaze narrowed oh who grundy golem she confessed but he is not of elven stock you must marry within your culture why she asked with that delightful innocence she had because thats the way it is now ill just declare that you are to be my bride and the elven banns will be pub lished and then in a couple of weeks no she cried you prefer to marry the golem he asked incredu lously yes grundys delight at this assertion was nullified by gim lets next words then know oh damsel that the golem is even now our prisoner and if you do not acquiesce with proper grace to this union i will have him killed oh no she wailed oh yes he said grimly do you agree to marry me now this was too much for grundy no she doesnt he yelled grundy rapunzel cried delighted how did you get up here gimlet demanded furious he drew his weapon which was a steel rod with a handle set across the end like the horizontal stroke of a t and a twisted point that looked wicked indeed he strode across the chamber and rammed the gimlet up trying to spear grundy rapunzel screamed grundy surprised slipped off his branch and fell down through the ceiling but he grabbed the princes raised arm as he dropped and clung to it trying to wrest away the weapon immediately he knew he was in trouble not only was golem in the gears he still very tired but the prince had the elven strength strongest here within the foliage of the elm he held his arm aloft grundy upon it and caught the golem by the scruff of the neck with his other hand he ripped grundy free as if he were a rag dollas perhaps he once had been grundy was helpless the prince readied the gimlet now i shall run you through as i should have done before he said no rapunzel cried no the prince inquired holding the point near grundys stomach and why should i desist damsel rapunzel was stricken knowing what he wanted but if she gave him that she would lose grundy in another sense grundy could not urge her to either course she would lose him either way she had to make her own decision spare him she said brokenly and i willwill m marry you then she sank to the floor sobbing the prince smiled so it seems you are some use to me after all golem i never thought that would be the case when i fought you in the tower but of course i was not using you properly why kill you and have the damsel kill herself when i can have complete control over her merely by threatening you so you shall live but you shall not be free he turned to face the entrance which was a hole in the center of the floor guards tower suddenly grundy suffered a horrendous real ization the sea hag he cried the prince grimaced curses i shouldnt have let that slip well it makes no difference once i marry her ill suicide this body and she will be queen of the elves and i will assume her body shell never agree to that grundy cried wont shewith your life still at stake golem in the gears golem in the gear grundy realized that rapunzel would indeed give in againto save him her love was true and that was her undoing he had been a fool to believe that the hag had given up merely because she had not been willing to sting rapunzel to death when she had been a queen b she had merely sought another avenueand now she had found it the guards arrived confine this wretch in a cage the hag commanded this time watch him see that he does not escape dont do it grundy cried this isnt your prince its the sea hag hes crazy as well as scrawny the hag said as you can see i am unchanged hes changed hes changed grundy cried you know how hes changed in the last daysince the hag took over his body this is an imposter not your prince at all the guards hesitated obviously they had heard the gossip and knew the prince was different but they werent ready to defy him they came toward grundy would your prince ever have poisoned a friendly dragon grundy demanded at this rapunzels head came up what they poisoned stanley grundy told her and threw me in a dank cell oh i must flee this place she cried in her distress changing to humansize in this form she seemed practi cally to fill the chamber and her weight bore the branches of the floor down somewhat you do and he dies prince hag said evenly touch ing grundys belly with the point of the gimlet oh she repeated horrified anew she reverted to elfsize dont yield to the hag grundy yelled at her shell kill me anyway once she has your body go now save yourself go down to stanley and ride back to castle roogna he knows the way but this logic was too cruel for her maidenly heart to bear she sank again to the floor swooning now lock him up the hag told the guards i will see to the damsel but thats not your prince grundy cried desperately ask anybody ask the serving girls you know hes changed no elf acts the way he does threatening inno cent folk with death again the guards hesitated knowing that he had a point they had known the prince a long time and recognized the change in him now grundy was providing an expla nation obey the hag told them or ill run you through that does it one guard said i think the golems right wretch the hag cried aiming the gimlet at him but the guards drew their weapons which were a screwdriver and a trowel metal gleamed they were as strong as the prince here the issue is in doubt the other guard said we must schedule a trial over my dead body the hag screamed and now the princes face did in a way resemble that of the hag of the ivory tower the two guards stood unflinching weapons ready not responding it was evident that the elves were an inde pendent breed who did not tolerate what they knew to be wrong even when it seemed that their prince ordered it they had had time to ponder the business of poisoning a tame dragon and violating a sanctuary after it had been granted and they were not having any more of it golem in the gears the hag saw that she had overstepped her bounds and was only getting herself into trouble she was not a natural elf and could not long fool true elves once their suspicion was aroused she would lose all credibility if this contin ued then let there be a trial she said assuming an aspect of abrupt reasonableness a trial of right by strength the golem and i the survivor gets the girl the guards nodded that seems the best way trowel agreed we will schedule it for tomorrowyou against the golem grundy could not protest because his alternative was to get killed outright here but how could he hope to beat the horrible strength of the hag in elvenform he feared that he had only postponed the reckoning but rapunzel brightened oh grundy i just know you can do it then everything will be all right or all wrong but at least it gave her a night of hope and that was worth something chapter trial in the morning grundy found himself stiff from the prior days exertion and still somewhat tired they had locked him in a leafy chamber for the night alone but the elven maidens had brought him food and a cham ber pot and had rubbed healing salve into his blistered golem in the gears hands he couldnt complain if he seemed like a prisoner still it protected him from the malice of the hag who was similarly isolated he knew that rapunzel was protected from contact with either litigant until the decision was reached the elves were indeed fair in their rigorous fashion a guard called lathe came to conduct him to the site of the trial golem you are not of our culture lathe said touching the instrument that gave him his name it was a kind of wooden framework with wheels mounted on it used to rotate things that were being evenly shaped evidently he liked to be sure that a situation was properly shaped too do you understand the rules of the trial no you have challenged the princes identity and the prince denies your charge as we are unable to judge the merits of the case objectively we are submitting it to trial by combat because you made the charge against the prince he has the choice of type of contest he has chosen lines and boxes lines and boxes grundy demanded incredulously he remembered the game he had played with the ant lion back at the good magicians castle but that was no duel tothedeath wellnot from the game itself the con sequence of losing however was death you swing on the lines to the boxes and cut the lines behind you when you trap your opponent in a box you dump him into the loop evidently this was not the game he had played though it seemed to have some similarities could similar strat egies be followed i dont think i have done that before grundy said cautiously naturally not its an elven specialty that negates dif golem in the gears golem in the gears ferentials in size and strength you do however need to be agile and some cleverness helps this was sounding better what is this loop you men tion it is an ancient artifact we have had in our elm for centuries anything that passes through it never returns unless it is attached to something on this side so that it can be drawn back quickly sounds like the void grundy said shuddering the what it seemed that the elves of this tree did not know about the geography of northern xanth a black hole that never yields what it takes in perhaps so lathe agreed certainly whichever one of you falls through the loop will not return so this was indeed a duel to the death or the equiv alent whoever passed through the loop would be fin ished certainly if he dumped the hag through rapunzel would be forever free of that terrible threat if on the other hand the hag dumped him through lathe conducted him to the site of the trial this was outside the elm in fact right beside it a number of thin lines descended from the foliage dangling down to near the ground a smaller number of platforms were perched on poles rising from the ground the poles were slender and reached about halfway up the trunk of the tree so that the little platforms swayed gently in the breeze grundy saw that there was a framework of slats about each platform so that a person standing on one could have handholds still it looked precarious he would pre fer to trust himself to a line assuming that his abraded hands remained strong enough to hold on the salve had done a marvelous job so that the skin was now intact but scars remained he peered to the ground a dizzying distance below there within the ring of poles was a large funnel that glistened probably it had been greased in the center was a small dark hole the loop lathe handed him a knife it was small suitable for his hand and the blade was honed to a feather edge on either side one slash will sever a line the elf explained sev eral slashes will be required to cut through a pole how ever either action takes time and therefore sacrifices mobility why was he saying that grundy shrugged studying the layout to see whether any strategy suggested itself there were six boxes and four lines dangled near the comers of each the circle of boxes was tight enough so that it looked possible to swing from any one of them to any other but they were still far enough apart so that any attempt to jump between them was bound to be futile his challenge was to isolate the hag in a box and then dump her into that funnel below could he do it he had to now rapunzel appeared surrounded by elven maids she remained elfsized but was still phenomenally beau tiful despite her brief hair she had to remain on a branch separate from the arena where she could watch without interfering oh grundy she cried my premonition has come true i wish we had not come to this place he wished so too his effort to provide her fair expo sure to the elven culture had proven disastrous but now she was apt to become a part of it in the worst way and prince gimlet arrived he was in brief athletic clothes and had exchanged his gimlet for a doubleedged knife like grundys only larger the prince had the advan golem in the gears golem in the gears tage of size and strength but those would not count for much as long as the two contestants did not touch each other and might even be to his disadvantage on the pre carious boxes so this might indeed be a fair trial are the litigants ready one of the elves inquired ready the hag said with confidence uh yes grundy mumbled he hoped he was begin the prince caught hold of the line closest to him and swung in to the nearest platform grundy found a line just within his reach and did the same he felt the stiff ness in his arms anew but had no real trouble the contest was on the prince took another line and launched himself directly across the circle grundy hadnt expected this and stood and stared for a moment then he realized that the princes blade was aimed right at him as the elf swung onehanded he could be dispatched by the knife directly then tossed into the loop what difference did it make how he died he grabbed almost blindly at a line to the side and jumped off his aim was bad and he missed the adjacent platform he swung erratically across to the one beyond but already the elf was pursuing him knife still extended this time grundy got more of his wits about him he hung onto the line he had set his feet against the edge of the box and shoved violently off he sailed across the circle to the opposite platform landed on it then quickly cut the line he had used so that it would not swing back to the elf he was learning but the elf merely took another line and came after him again grundy didnt dare go across the center when the elf was doing it they would meet and grundy would be the one stabbed for the elfs reach was twice his own he had to move off to the side the elf pursued him in this manner all about the circle and as they moved more of the lines were cut until grundy discovered that there had been a pattern in the pursuit he was now trapped on a platform from which all the lines had been lostbut he had let go of his incoming line before realizing that he couldnt get away he turned and braced himself expecting the elf to come at him bladefirst but that wasnt the case that would have meant a suggestion of a fighting chance instead the elf handed himself down the line and swung down below catching at the pole on which grundys box was perched then he sawed at it with the knife that had to be stopped grundy leaped out desperately catching the upper section of the line that was supporting the elf he couldnt swing it anywhere because it was now anchored below but he hoped to jerk it out of the elfs grasp and strand him on the pole it didnt work the elf was far stronger than he was and easily retained control of the line while continuing to saw at the pole if grundy slid down the rope that knife would finish him if he did not his pole would soon fall and he would be stuck right here waiting for the elf to climb up and get him then he had a desperate notion if he could exert a sudden hard shock to the line he reached up and sliced through the line above him suddenly he was falling he hung on to his severed seg ment of the line knowing that his weight would jerk at the elf when the slack was taken up abruptly it happened the elf screamed as he was wrenched off the pole and he fell toward the funnel then the flaw in his plan occurred to grundy he was golem in the gears golem in the gears falling too somehow he had overlooked that when the seemingly brilliant strategy came to him they were both descending to their doom grundys feet struck the funnel first and he flipped involuntarily absorbing the shock and rolled toward the center the elf landed more heavily but there was some give in the runnel and no bones were broken both of them slid down the greased slope to the loop grundy heard rapunzels scream of horror it had probably been issued some time ago and was only just now catching up with him then he plunged through the dark hole of the loop he seemed to be in an opaque tunnel falling yet float ing then he found himself standing on a cavern floor unharmed in a moment the hag landed beside him wretch she screamed look what youve done i took you with me grundy said with a certain sat isfaction now you wont get rapunzels body the hag looked around well see the brain coral sometimes releases its acquisitions if they have some thing to offer in exchange the brain coral didnt you recognize the loop golem its one of the entrances to the realm of the coral nothing returns because the coral keeps what it gets until it decides to release it now grundy remembered long ago he had been in the nether region ofxanth with bink and chester centaur and crombie the soldier and good magician humfrey horrendous things had happened they had encountered the demon x th who was the source of magic and for a time there had been no magic in xanth he didnt care to go through that again he had been a true golem then and when the magic had departed so had his ani mation leaving him as a tangle of cloth and wood only when the magic returned had he revivedwith one awful headache but the residence of the brain coral was under a black lake whose water slowly pickled anything in it and stored creatures in a halfdead state indefinitely there was no water here instead there was a spacious dry chamber whose far wall was ohoh grundy murmured shivering maybe if i give you to the brain coral it will let me go the hag said or i might give it this elfprince body and take yours and return to claim rapunzel she would do anything for you without even questioning it then this isnt the brain corals residence grundy said of course it is i told you i recognized the loop ive never been here before of course but i know about the brain coral from way back its always ready to deal maybe once the loop led to the brain coral grundy said but this time it glitched this is he found him self unable to say the dread words if youre trying to talk your way out of this golem it wont work i will simply haul you in and the princes hand reached out and grabbed grundy by the collar grundy pulled awayand the elfs hand could not retain the grasp you arent near the elf elm any more hag he said that body is no longer enhanced by magic strength also the hag dived for him ill haul you in anyway golem grundy dodged aside and the body of the elf stumbled past him then it stiffened the aristocratic mouth opened and the eyes stared golem in the gears the bodys impetus carried it forward another step and animation returned what you stepped into a thought grundy said a what a thought they exist here in bands invisible and when you step into one a hemale and a shemale wereit was grotesque you should talk hag here you are in a male body and an itmale looking on seeking toto and you thought you were experienced grundy said wryly well go step into another thought vortex and get some real experience but this isnt the cave of the brain coral grundy said its the cave of the demon x th and if we wake him it cant be she took a step toward him youre just saying that golem to get out of dont move about too much hag or youll the elfs face froze again too lateshe was already in another thought vortex grundy backed awayand stepped into one himself it was the demon s ius in anonymale aspect seeking a blood sacrifice for the autumn festival canicula here is the fawncolored doggie for thy grundy emerged from the vortex shaking he didnt want to be the canine sacrifice for that festival the hag had also emerged unspeakable she spat i must get out of here dont charge blindly about grundy warned again he was too late she charged blindly toward the far wall stiffened and stumbled as she tore through a golem in the gears thought righted herself lumbered into another vortex and finally crashed into the wall trouble grundy muttered for that was no ordinary wall it was in the form of a huge stone face and she had just banged into its mon strous nose that did it an enormous eye blinked the demon x th was waking the whole cave shuddered as the face came alive the hag stood there before it amazed she might have existed for centuries but she had had no experience with this ent ity grundy had and knew that no matter how bad his sit uation had been a moment ago it was now infinitely worse the phenomenal orifice of a mouth opened who comes here it demanded the hag didnt answer so grundy had to its an accident demon he quavered then i will destroy that accident that disturbs my repose that was exactly what grundy had been afraid of the demon x th cared nothing for the lives of ordinary creatures and only wanted them to stay clear there was supposed to be a magic shield to prevent anyone from blundering in but apparently the loop had bypassed that now the demon the source of all this lands magic was aroused and angry ready to swat grundy and perhaps the rest of xanth out of existence as someone would an annoying fly what did he have to lose now you wouldnt do that if you had any notion of the problems of real people grundy cried the demon paused it talks back grundy plowed on heedlessly youre omnipotent you dont have any real problems no wonder you dont care golem in the gears golem in the gears about ours but if you were in my place for even one minute youd change your mind the demon considered is this a wager he inquired mildly whatever you want to call it you dont know a thing about real life very well we shall change placesfor one minute suddenly grundys consciousness was in the body and brain of the demon his gaze penetrated the rock of the physical realm as if it were mere haze and reached into the framework of the planets he was in a foul mood because he had been losing significance for several decades and seemed to be unable to reverse the trend while it was true that he was omnipotent in the physical sense he was not in the social sense and the other demons of the system were gaining on him earth now had pro gressed a notch in status having s while x th remained with s that was humiliating for that shemale was basically mundanish in character v us had hoisted herself similarly and was now considered to be a mostfatalefemme even distant pluto wasnt what he once had been in local estimation ju ter was get ting very big and nexptkune had acquired a virtual ocean of selfrespect and satajrn was extreme ly fancy now everyone was progressing except x th if only he had some way to gain significance some strat egy of upsmanship to recover lost status then the timeless minute was done and grundy was a golem again his insignificant little mind was reeling truly the demon did have a problem he would never have understood it had he not been in the demons sit uation for that minute for status was not a thing he had ever approached as a golem now he saw that the demon was suffering in a manner that was in its permutated essence similar to his among omnipotent entities the demon x th was insignificant and he didnt like it yesnow grundy could understand all that differed was the scale meanwhile the huge demon face looked thoughtful i grasp your concern now golem he said your com pass is infinitesmal but your relative challenge is as great unlike me you have a mechanism for solution i do grundy asked surprised all you require is the respect of a good womanand you have that if you emerge from this situation grundy realized that it was true if he survived this it would mean that he was victor in the trialand he could lay claim to rapunzel who was eager to be claimed the rapport with the elves had been hopelessly soured she would never voluntarily join that society now with her respect he needed that of no other person if he survived but that remained unlikely the demon had taken up his challenge to exchange places for a min ute for the demon was a creature of challenge but that did not signify any further commitment unless let me make you another challenge grundy cried you give me my ambition if i show you how to get yours the demon being almost omniscient was not slow to catch on done golem so he had the deal that would solve his problem there was only one flaw he had no idea how to solve the demons problem urn ill need a little time to work it out i thought you might the demon agreed you shall have all the time you need eternity if you wish but one hour from now if the deal has not been consummated i golem in the gears will confine you to the storage of the brain coral and send the sea hag back to the surface ouch that would mean that the elves and rapunzel would believe the hag had won the trial and by the time grundy returned if ever it would be too late rapunzel would be the hag the demon certainly knew how to generate incentive the hag caught on it was obvious that the demon was fully aware of her nature and didnt care maybe i can make a deal too she started better quit while youre ahead the demon advised her she shut up obviously she was ahead all she had to do was wait one hour and gmndys default would send her to her victory now the demons face became still again resembling stone but grundy knew it would click back into ani mation in exactly one hour he had to come up with his solution to the demons problem in that time had to his mind naturally was blank how could he think of anything that the demon had not thought of long before his intellect was the merest fraction of the demons he was really just a prisoner as was the hag with a chance to gain an advantage if he proved useful to the captor if he failed the other prisoner would have the advantage should he not have tried at all so that neither of them returned to the surface prisoners dilemma prisoners dilemma that reminded him of some thing bink had spent a lot of time in mundania and brought back tidbits and one of them was a riddle of two pris oners very like this one one prisoner could get better treatment if he gave evidence against the otherbut if the other did the same both would be treated more harshly golem in the geore than before both knew this what then were they to do but enough of this distraction he had a problem to work out how could he help the demon gain stature in the demon society his mind went blank again then idly it returned to the prisoners dilemma if one prisoner knew the other would not give evidence then he could afford to do it himself and get better treatment without actually hurting the other still if the other reasoned the same way of course in this case the other prisoner was the sea hag and he knew she would always do the most treach erous thing he could safely assume that she would give evidence against him so his choice would be whether to keep quiet and let her have the advantage or to give evidence so as to bring her down with him as he had during the lines and boxes trial the trouble with that was it didnt bring him a victory what he really wanted was to leave her here while he returned to rapunzel so he had to solve the demons problem then it came to him could there be a prisoners dilemma type of solution that would help the demon for the demons situation was in its fashion similar to grundys the demon had to gain an advantage over his rival demons while they were trying to gain advantage over him if there were a solution to the prisoner problem it just might apply also to the demon problem well suppose there were a strategy of play that would prevail no matter what the other party did one that the other party could catch on to and still not beat suppose the moon werent made of green cheese he was dreaming of the impossible yet almost he thought there could be something after golem in the gears all there had been a winning strategy in the original lines and boxes game with the ant lion that had required a i surprise move a sort of sacrifice that changed the com plex of the configuration something that seemed non sensical yet in retrospect made absolute sense look at it this way he told himself if there was such a strategy grundy golem could achieve his hearts desire if not he couldnt sothere had to be such a strategy all he needed to do was work it out he got to it scratching lines and boxes and figures on the cavern floor but no matter how he figured it he couldnt see how he could get ahead of the hag who would never give him the slightest break it simply wasnt there the best he could do was to bring her down with him so that both of them lost except that they wouldnt she would be granted the victory by default but then he realized that the demons situation differed from his in one important respect there were more than two participants was it possible that the dynamics of several differed from the dynamics of two so that what might be a losing strategy when going oneonone could be a winning one when going oneonseveral but each deal the demon x th made grundy remembered from his minute in the demons place was oneonone first he interacted with one other demon then with another sometimes he gained a little against one but then he lost more against another so it reduced to oneonone and the loss continued for it seemed that the other demons were more cynical and rapacious than x th and nice guys finished last if only nice guys could finish first but maybe they could then it burst upon him neither the niceguy nor the nastyguy strategy was best because others took advan golem in the gears tage of the first and were out to get the second what was needed was a toughbutfair strategy that rewarded the nice guys and punished the nasty guysand that the oth ers know it grundy scribbled some more suppose he tried tough butfair against all other types the alwaysnice would wash out quickly and drop out of the game but how about the alwaysnasty could tbf beat the nas ties it seemed to him that it was possible if time the demon announced so soon it had seemed like only a few minutes but grundy knew it really had been an hour not a piece of a second more or less i have you the answer i uh think so but i need to test it certainly i wouldnt want to use an untested strat egy the demon agreed wryly test it now i uh need several people like me and the hag how many of each the demon asked well a minimum of two you see the types abruptly there were four people where there had been two grundy and the hag each had a double that wasnt exactly what grundy had meant but he was afraid that if he protested the demon would conclude he was stall ing and that could finish him uh yes thank you now the rules you presume to dictate rules to me the demon demanded there have to be rules to show how the game works so that the strategy can operate grundy explained proceed i think its easiest if we use a pointscoring system the complexities of demon status are beyond human understanding so golem in the genre true the demon agreed so we can use simplefolkminded numbers but it will illustrate the underlying strategy get on with it uh yes now the object is to score points the one who scores the most points overall is the winner so if my strategy always produces a winner you couldnt win anything golem one of the prince gimlet elves put in everybody knows that shut your puss hag the other grundy snapped if everybody were here theyd see you get your bottom booted grundy discovered that he rather liked his double the golem had a good way of expressing himself but he wasnt certain whose bottom would get booted uh then let everybody see the demon decided suddenly everybody was present it was as if the cave had become a monstrous theater with themselves in the center in the front row sat king dor and queen irene and little ivy and dolph and king emeritus trent and queen emeritus iris and bink and chameleon and ches ter and cherie centaur and amolde centaur and every one else who was anyone in xanth and in the rows behind sat jordan and threnody and stanley steamer and snor timer and everyone else who wasnt anyone and farther back were all the other people and creatures who werent quite classified yet at the very most rear floated the glowering cloud fracto most of them looked a bit star tled but none protested all watched what had become the stage and waited for grundys demonstration it had never occurred to grundy to doubt the awesome power of the demon x th but if it had that doubt would have been obliterated in this instant all the magi cians and sorceresses and creatures and things of xanth golem in the gears summoned here in the blink of an eyeand the demon hadnt even blinked all watching grundy waiting for him to perform suddenly he suffered a siege of stage fright his tongue seemed to swell up and fill his mouth and his jaws crys tallized all xanth was watching hey snap out of it his double whispered nudging him youve got to show the winning strategy but grundy stood frozen overwhelmed by the enor mity of it he has no strategy an elfhag said to the demon dump him in the brain corals pool and send me back to the surface send whom to the surface the other elfprince demanded who asked you to butt in the first replied still grundy was mute conscious only of all those eyes upon him he knew he was about to default his case and cost himself everything but he just couldnt move or speak while he was the cynosure of this immense and important gathering then a new voice cut through his selfimmolation oh grundy rapunzel she was here tooand when he failed she would pay the penalty as much as he his tongue shrank and his body unfroze there was no way he could allow her to suffer like that the object of this demonstration contest is to score points he said the points vary according to the com bination of decisions by the participants lets say that each person gives evidence against the other in that case each will score one point one point one of the hags said suddenly paying golem in the gears golem in the gears close attention she wanted to be sure that he had no case that would satisfy the demon now lets say that each person does not give evidence against the other grundy continued in that case each will score three points they remain even no advantage to either three points the other hag said but suppose one prisoner gives evidence and the other does not grundy concluded then the one who gives it gets five pointsand the other gets no points definitely both hags agreed licking their princely lips it was obvious that both intended to score five points i have been losing points the demon murmured but that is merely the situation not the solution what is your strategy let me show you grundy said each of the four of ustwo golems and two hagswill match off against the others the hags will of course give nothing away to anyone naturally the hags agreed while the other golem will follow my strategy he said he glanced at the other you do know it oh sure im your clone i know everything you do good now lets do this one at a time so the demon can see clearly what happens there will be several rounds to each match to allow the strategy to manifest as some thing other than chance i will start off grundy approached one of the hags he paused oh well need pieces of paper and pencils for again the demon didnt blink little pads of paper appeared in each of their hands and pencils in each of their other hands there was a small stir in the vast audience and grundy saw that each member of it also had a little pad and a pencil except for rapunzel who had a puncil everyone was keeping score grundy was shaken by another doubt he had not had time to work this out thoroughly in his mind suppose his insight was not sound and his strategy did not produce victory not only would he be confined forever in the storage lake of the brain coral and the hag be given access to rapunzels bodyeveryone in xanth would know his humiliation would be complete and eternal the golem in the gears who had the chance to make things right and fouled it up the very notion made him shiver and sweat he had the apprehension of the inevitable knowing that if any thing good were to occur here it could not be by the agency of anything as insignificant as a mere golem with a big mouth why was he even trying then he saw rapunzel watching him she smiled and blew him a kiss she believed in him she believed in him he might fail himself and fail others as he had so often before but how could he fail her now each of us will make a mark on our sheets he told the hag we shall make a smileyface for nice meaning that we do not give evidence against the other prisoner or a scowlface for nasty meaning that we do the selfish thing and give the evidence we each know that we will both be better off if neither is nasty but that one of us can get way ahead if that one is nasty when the other is nice but we dont know how the other will choose we wont know until we show our faces get on with it wretch the hag said i am grundy marked a big smileyface on his top sheet so that the hag couldnt see it meanwhile she marked what was surely a scowlface on hers golem in the gears now we shall show our faces grundy said he turned his around and held it up so that everyone could see it more grudgingly the hag showed hers it was exactly as he had anticipated hers was a scowl now the sea hag has chosen to give evidence he said i did not therefore the hag scores five points and i score none there was a muted sigh in the audience evidently they had wanted the hag to lose but the game had just begun if his strategy was valid now we shall go to the second round he said we shall each mark our sheets again they did so grundy marked a scowlface when they showed their sheets both of them had scowls this time we match grundy said both acted selfishly so each of us receives just one point but im still ahead of you golem the hag said with satisfaction so it would seem he agreed now the third round they marked their sheets again and showed them both were scowls another point for each grundy said seven to two my favor the hag gloated you arent getting anywhere wretch fourth round grundy said again they marked their sheets and showed them i again both were scowls eight to three the hag cack led your stupid strategy is just digging you in deeper golem j fifth round grundy announced grimly they marked and showed again with the same result making the score nine to four sixth and final round grundy said his preliminary calculation had suggested that this was the crucial point he had to trust it golem in the geon they marked and showedtwo scowls ten to five i win the hag chortled you win grundy agreed grimly the audience was deathly quiet the demons lips twitched but the trial is not over yet grundy exclaimed this is only the first match my matches proceed for eternity the demon grum bled precisely grundy agreed one match is nothing it is the totality that counts now he went to the other hag i will now repeat the encounter with the next opponent he announced each of us will mark our faces they paused to do so and show them they did the result was the same as before his smileyface against her scowlface he was behind by five points they played out the remaining five rounds with similar effect the final score was hags favor i like your strategy golem she cackled i have now had two matches grundy announced i have a total of ten points while my opponents have twenty the massed scorekeepers in the audience nodded somberly their calculations agreed only fracto seemed pleased though of course the cloud had no brief for the hag but rapunzel still smiled at him showing her confi dence she perhaps alone retained her faith in him he hoped it was justified he went to his third and final opponent the other golem both marked their sheets and showed them there were two smileyfaces each of us has chosen to be nice grundy announced golem in the gears therefore neither has the advantage each gets three points they proceeded to the second round the result was the same then the remaining rounds in each case each scored three points the result of this match is a draw grundy an nounced eighteen to eighteen i now have twenty eight points total while my opponents have accumulated thirtyeight so you are out of it one of the hags exulted one of us will win perhaps grundy said now they were coming to the next critical point if the others acted true to form lets finish this the other golem said i have still to match the two hags yes grundy agreed but stick to the strategy gotcha the golem went to one hag and went through the matchwith exactly the same result grundy had had losing ten to five the wicked glee of the hags could scarcely be contained and the audience was glum indeed the demon looked bored which was a bad sign now it was time for the final match hag vs hag each had twenty points from her tromping of the two golems now if youll just let me have some points one hag said to the other grundy kept his face straight but inside he was almost unbearably tight his fortune depended on his analysis of the nature of the hag this was the final critical point if he had misjudged like hades you old witch the other snapped im looking out for number one well if you feel that way wartsnoot the other responded see what you get from me golem in the gears grundy relaxed he had judged correctly they marked and showedand naturally each face was a scowl one point for each both angered by the seeming betrayal by the other they went to the second roundand scowl met scowl again one more point for each so it continued when the match was done the hags were tied six to six now note the cumulative scores grundy said each hag has twentysix while each golem has twentyeight the golems are ahead there was a stir of astonishment through the audience as the folk checked their scoresheets many had not been keeping them up to date being certain that the issue was already decided the two hags made shrieks of indig nation and the demons sleepy eyes snapped back to full alertness rapunzel clapped her hands with maidenly delight her faith vindicated note that neither golem ever won a single match grundy said but the final victory must go to a golem the longer this trial continues the more certain this becomes in an eternal trial this strategy must inevitably prevail the demon was definitely interested curls of vapor rose from his countenance what is that strategy i call it tough but fair grundy said i start out positive but after that i do back to my opponent what ever my opponent does to me so when the hag gave evidence against me in the first round i did it back to her in the secondand continued until she changed since she never changed we just kept on getting single points when i matched against the other golem and he was nice to me i was nice to him in the next round golem in the gears and continued that way until he changed since he didnt change but you never won a match the demon protested and the hags never lost a match grundy agreed but the victory does not go to the winner of matches but to the scorer of the most total points which is a different matter i made more points tying with the other golem than i lost losing to the hags their selfish ways gave them shortterm victories but cost them the trial a fluke a hag screamed no fluke grundy said you hags cant cooperate with anyone even your own kind so you inevitably lose out to those of us who can an enlightened coop eration is better in the long run than shortterm self ishness he turned to the demon now i realize this is just a simple game hardly worthy of your notice but the principle is sound you should be able to apply the same strategy to your complex encounters with other demons that are far beyond my understanding you have been going for individual victories and getting some but like the hags you have been losing overall with this strategy you can lose matches and the other demons will think they are cleaning up but inevitably as time passes slowly the demon smiled then the cave was gone grundy was standing alone beside the elf elm in the distance stanley steamer was lifting his head getting wind of him and rapunzel golemsize was swinging down on a lineno it was her own hair restored to its former length and splendor the demon x th eventually to be x th or even xanth had added a bo nus rapunzel landed and her lovely tresses floated down golem in the gears about her like a swirling halo as she did a little dance of joy she was the most beautiful creature he could have imagined and not just in her body she laughed merrily as she ran to embrace him oh grundy she cried and the two of them were lost amid the halo
