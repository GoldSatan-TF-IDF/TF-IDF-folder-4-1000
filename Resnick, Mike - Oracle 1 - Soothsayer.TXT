prologue it was a time of giants there was no room for them to breathe and flex their muscles in mankinds sprawling democracy so they gravitated to the distant barren worlds of the inner frontier drawn ever closer to the bright galactic core like moths to a flame oh they fit into human frames most of them but they were giants nonetheless no one knew what had brought them forth in such quantity at this particular moment in human history perhaps there was a need for them in a galaxy filled to overflowing with little people possessed of even smaller dreams possibly it was the savage splendor of inner frontier itself for it was certainly not a place for ordinary men and women or maybe it was simply time for a race that had been notably short of giants in recent eons to begin producing them once again but whatever the reason they swarmed out beyond the furthest reaches of the explored galaxy spreading the seed of man to hundreds of new worlds and in the process creating a cycle of legends that would never die as long as men could tell tales of heroic deeds there was faraway jones who set foot on more than new worlds never quite certain what he was looking for always sure that he hadnt yet found it there was the whistler who bore no other name than that and who had killed more than one hundred men and aliens there was friday nellie who turned her whorehouse into a hospital during the war against the setts and finally saw it declared a shrine by the very men who once tried to close it down there was jamal who left no fingerprints or footprints but had plundered palaces that to this day do not know they were plundered there was betaworld murphy who at various times owned nine different goldmining worlds and lost every one of them at the gaming tables there was backbreaker ben ami who wrestled aliens for money and killed men for pleasure there was the marquis of queensbury who fought by no rules at all and the white knight albino killer of fifty men and sally the blade and the forever kid who reached the age of nineteen and just stopped growing for the next two centuries and catastrophe baker who made whole planets shake beneath his feet and the exotic pearl of maracaibo and the jade queen whose sins were condemned by every race in the galaxy and father christmas and the onearmed bandit with his deadly prosthetic arm and the earth mother and lizard malloy and the deceptively mildmannered cemetery smith giants all yet there was one giant who was destined to tower over all of the others to juggle the lives of men and worlds as if they were so many toys to rewrite the history of the inner frontier and the outer frontier and the spiral arm and even the allpowerful democracy itself at various times in her short turbulent life she was known as the soothsayer and the oracle and the prophet by the time she had passed from the galactic scene only a handful of survivors knew her true name or her planet of origin or even her early history for such is the way with giants and legends but she had an origin and a history and a name and even a childhood of sorts this is her story part the mouses book blantyre iii was a world of tall towers and stately minarets of twisting streets and pitchdark alleyways of large chimneys and narrow stairways in other words it was a world made to order for the mouse she stood on the makeshift stage at the back of merlins wagon now not quite five feet tall barely eighty pounds wearing a sequined tie and tails over her tights smiling confidently at the assembled crowd as merlin produced bouquets and rabbits out of thin air each of these he handed to her and each she placed in a special container since flowers and rabbits were difficult to come by out on the inner frontier and they planned to make use of them a number of times before moving on to the next world then came the cigarette trick merlin lit a cigarette snuffed it out magically produced four more lit cigarettes threw them away pulled yet another out of his ear and so on simple sleight of hand but immensely pleasing to the spectators who had never seen any kind of magic show before then there was the patter which merlin kept up incessantly he told jokes insulted braggarts called forth the dark gods to aid him even read an occasional mind and finally forty minutes into the act came the piece de resistance merlin had the mouse climb into a large box which he then bound with chains and secured with oversized padlocks the box he explained carefully had a twentyminute supply of oxygen in it not a second more the mouse was already out of the box and hiding in the back of merlins wagon when he had two bystanders help him attach it to a pulley raise it over a large tank of water and submerge it promising his audience that the mouse had only nineteen minutes left in which to escape or die he then pulled out some of his more dazzling tricks those with fires and explosions which held the crowd captivated while the mouse slipped into a black bodysuit wriggled out the hole in the bottom of the wagon and slunk off into the shadows a moment later she was clambering lithely up the side of an ancient building hiding in the shadow of a turret until merlin performed his next trick and then she was inside a window and scampering lightly down a corridor there was artwork to be had in this house lots of it but she decided it would be too hard to smuggle off the planet instead she kept racing from room to room until she finally found a womans dressing room quickly scavenged through the drawers until she came to a jewelry chest and plundered it placing the contents in a leather pouch tied around her waist she checked her watch again eleven minutes time for at least one more house possibly two she raced back to the window through which she had entered clambered out and up to the top of a minaret dove through space to the adjacent building landed catlike on a ledge and forced open the window of a darkened room she realized immediately that she was not alone that someone or something was sleeping in a corner she froze halfexpecting an attack but then she heard a snore and she was across the room and into a corridor within five seconds she could tell by the numerals on the doors that she was in a rooming house rather than a private residence it could be better it could be worse she could plunder four or five different rooms without having to leave the building but residents of boarding houses rarely had anything worth stealing she checked the nearest room it was empty not only of people but of anything remotely valuable the second room was a little better a man and a woman were asleep in a large bed and the air smelled of alcohol and drugs the mouse found their clothing in a crumpled pile on the floor and extracted three onehundred credit notes from the mans wallet a further search failed to turn up the womans purse or money and the mouse decided that she didnt have enough time to keep looking for them she reentered the corridor with eight minutes remaining on her watch but just as she did so an elderly woman turned on the light and wandered out to use the only bathroom on the floor she shot into the stairwell heard voices coming up from the floor below and realized that at least one of the rooms had a door open and crouched in the shadows waiting for the stifflimbed old woman to make her way down the corridor to the bathroom it took the old woman almost two minutes and the mouse decided that it was time to start heading back she found an unlit fire exit in the rear of the building climbed down to the ground kept to the shadows until she was opposite merlins wagon waited for him to captivate the crowd with one final trick that shot fireworks in every direction then slithered under the wagon and entered it from beneath she placed her pouch carefully inside a production box so that even if a policeman opened the top of the box hed have a difficult time finding anything that was hidden in it then with two minutes to go she donned a black hood and insinuated herself onto the stage merlin was toying with the spectators halfconvincing them that the mouse was mere seconds from drowning or suffocating if she couldnt escape and finally he led them in a countdown when they reached the instant when her oxygen was theoretically used up merlin and his blackhooded assistant pulled the box out of the water and hacked away its chains and revealed not a dead mouse but an antarrean bird of many colors which spread its wings hopped out of the box walked over to the mouse and pulled her hood off its one and only trick the crowd applauded wildly merlin passed his hat for donations and finally the audience dispersed leaving them there in the middle of the nowempty street well asked the magician how did you do some credits some jewelry replied the mouse nothing special thats the problem with this world said merlin there is nothing special to it he stared contemptuously at the houses all these stately facades and each boudoir with its own facade of costume jewelry six nights without a major score im for calling it quits the mouse shrugged suits me where to next westerly is the next human world westerly is an alien world she corrected him its got about humans living in a kind of free zone right in the heart of their biggest city said merlin we can refuel there we can refuel right here were going to explained merlin patiently but westerly should make a nice oneday stop along the route who knows maybe we can pick up some fresh fruit thats something we cant get on this particular dirtball she shrugged again all right westerly it is merlin began driving the show wagon back to the spaceport what do the natives call it continued the mouse call what he asked distractedly westerly well the human natives call it westerly thanks a heap you couldnt pronounce what the aliens call it its listed on the star maps as romanus omega ii he paused its an oxygen world of course any idea what the natives are like i imagine they breathe oxygen he said what difference does it make were only going to perform for a human audience you dont crawl down chimneys or through sewers she replied if im going to run into an alien in tight quarters i want to know what my options are same as always run like hell they rode in silence until they reached the spaceport then loaded the wagon into merlins brightlydecorated ship once they had taken off and laid in a course to westerly the mouse relaxed with a beer while merlin began running the gemstones she had stolen through the computers spectrographic sensors when he finished he crosschecked them against his current jewelers reference guides and finally placed tentative values upon them could have been worse he said at last i do wish youd get over your compulsive urge to always grab the biggest stones though so many of them really arent worth the trouble what about the diamond bracelet and the sapphire necklace she asked without looking up they were very nice pieces but those beads that look like pearls absolutely worthless youll find some pretty little girl to give them to once we get back to the frontier said the mouse i shall certainly try my utmost agreed merlin but that in no way alters the fact that they wont bring a credit on the black market she sipped her beer thoughtfully we dont want credits anyway not the way the democracys going these days if i were you id sell this stuff for stalin ruples and maria theresa dollars then were going to have to wait a few weeks as long as were within the democracy people are going to want to pay us with credits then youd better charge more because credits dont spend very well out where were heading i dont tell you how to steal them dont you tell me how to unload them the mouse stared at him for a moment as he practiced making the jewels appear and disappear beneath a colorful silken scarf then went back to concentrating on her beer it had been a long week and she was tired and her left knee was throbbing from where shed banged it against a turret two nights ago in fact her whole body hurt from the chores she kept giving it it really was time for a vacation and as she sought out her bed and drifted off to sleep she found herself hoping that they could make a big enough killing on westerly so that she could afford to take a few months off westerly decided the mouse was like most alien worlds at first glance it seemed to make perfect sense it was only when you looked more closely that it seemed less and less reasonable well what do you think asked merlin as he drove the show wagon down the main street of westerlys human enclave i dont like it replied the mouse whats the problem look at the way the streets all twist and turn back into themselves she said there are some skyscrapers with no windows or doors at all and some little onestory buildings that are all glass and have fifteen doors i dont know if i can figure it out in ten minutes just stick to the human buildings said merlin we dont want any alien objects anyway its not that simple she said which ones are the human buildings if i pick the wrong one i could get lost inside of it for an hour or more i have a horrible feeling that every corridor ends in a blank wall and that every staircase forms a continuous loop youre overreacting said merlin i dont think so she said and its my opinion that counts she paused your information was wrong this planet never saw twenty thousand men at one time id be surprised if theyve got a thousand in residence lets compromise then said merlin bringing the wagon to a halt how he jerked his head at a large steelandglass building just across the street the royal arms hotel he said humanowned humanrun weve got all day to study it lets go in have lunch and walk around a bit if youre comfortable with it by nightfall its the only place youll have to hit she nodded her agreement fair enough she said ill join you as soon as i can find a place to leave the wagon while she was waiting for him she walked entirely around the hotel and located what would be her means of ingress later that night a ventilation shaft attached to a basement laundry there was a grate covering it and room enough to park the wagon right over it she had already entered the lobby when merlin caught up with her well he said learn anything two things she replied first i know how im getting in good and second she continued indicating a robelian and a trio of lodinites theyve got more than just men staying here theyll have their own floors replied merlin with a shrug it just means we have to be selective what about the locks they should be standard keyed into the house computer so they can change combinations on a moments notice he paused if you forget half of what ive already taught you it might take you seconds to crack one of them you dont mind if we check them out before tonight he shrugged whatever you wish has it occurred to you that you could probably loot fifty guest rooms between now and dinnertime she suggested he shook his head weve been through all that before the only reason weve never been arrested is because we do our looting only during the time we have an alibi she made no reply but kept looking surreptitiously into corners down corridors behind room dividers from what she could tell and she couldnt be certain until she examined some of the rooms it appeared that most or all of the human guests used the airlifts to the right of the registration desk which put them on levels four through nine levels two and three were reached by gentlyascending ramps to the left of the registration desk and seemed to be of interest only to canphorites lodinites and robelians well at least theyre all oxygen breathers she muttered i hate it when they change environments she turned to merlin have you spotted the service lifts yet he frowned there dont seem to be any there must be theyd never let the maids go up in the same airlift as the paying customers she paused maybe youd better go tell the management that were here to put on a show for their customers tonight before they think that were casing the premises and what will you be doing while im explaining away our presence asked merlin casing the premises she replied with a smile merlin approached the front desk and the mouse took an elevator to the seventh level made sure that the locks were a type she could pick tried to take the lift down to the basement to inspect the laundry found that it stopped at the lobby and finally rejoined the magician just as he was emerging from the day managers office all set she asked they wont give us any problems and itll justify our hanging around the hotel for the rest of the afternoon good lets start by having some lunch he agreed and a moment later they entered the mainfloor restaurant only two other tables were occupied and merlin nodded toward the farthest one see that alien over there he whispered indicating the lone being at the table the humanoid with the bad complexion she asked merlin nodded the one whos dressed all in silver steer clear of him why waitll he reaches for something and youll see as if on cue the alien signaled for a waiter and she could see that he had once possessed four arms but that one had been amputated what kind of race does he belong to she asked i dont know but unless i miss my guess thats threefisted ollie never heard of him just keep out of his way outlaw bounty hunter they say hes killed more than thirty men and that he never takes contracts on his own race the magician paused thoughtfully i wish i knew why he was on westerly he usually operates on the inner frontier unless hes hunting for us come on said merlin theres not a warrant out on us anywhere in the democracy that you know of she said that anyone knows of he replied confidently anyway if you run into him tonight just apologize and get the hell out of his way quick the mouse nodded and punched her order into the small menu computer a moment later merlin prodded her with his toe what now she asked dont look turn around or pretend to notice him but do you see who just joined the alien she turned her head i said dont look directly hissed merlin all right said the mouse staring directly into merlins eyes its a big bearded human with a small arsenal hanging down from his belt i assume you know him too its cemetery smith another bounty hunter merlin shook his head a hired killer one of the best so why are an alien bounty hunter and a professional assassin sitting fifty feet away from us asked the mouse i dont know said the magician nervously they should both be on the frontier and they sure as hell shouldnt be talking to each other are they after us asked the mouse calmly even as she searched for exits and mentally calculated her chances of reaching them no these guys dont fool around if they wanted us wed already be dead what do you want to do about tonight she asked we can give the hotel a pass and just take off let me think about it said merlin he lowered his head and stared at his interlocked fingers for a long moment then looked up no theres no reason to cancel out theyre not after us and we dont represent any competition to them were thieves theyre killers the mouse shrugged makes no difference to me i wonder who theyre after mused merlin as the human got to his feet said something to the alien and walked out into the hotel lobby whoever it is he must be damned good if it takes the two of them together to hunt him down they ate in silence and then as twilight approached the mouse began passing out holographic flyers announcing the magic show that would shortly be performed on the street outside the hotel by sundown when merlin began producing bouquets and birds and rabbits with professional elan they had attracted a crowd of about sixty all but a handful of them humans merlin continued to bedazzle the crowd the mouse performed her two or three simple illusions to a smattering of applause and then merlin put her into the box and began securing the locks even as she rolled out the false back by the time he had maneuvered it into the water tank she was beneath the surface of the street crawling through the ventilation shaft into the laundry there were two women on duty and it took her a minute longer than she had anticipated to reach the enclosed fire stairs she raced up the stairs to the fourth level then emerged and began checking for unlocked doors she found one quickly looted the room of its few valuable items and then broke into another room this one provided even less booty and she soon emerged into the corridor according to her watch she had time for perhaps two more rooms if she was fast enough one more if she had to hunt for its treasures then suddenly she heard a door open and she shot into the stairwell there was no reason to wait for the resident to traverse the corridor and reach the airlift when all she had to do was climb another floor and loot two rooms on the fifth level but some instinct warned her not to climb any higher perhaps it was the press of time perhaps it was the possibility of running into cemetary smith but whatever the reason she found herself waiting for the fourth level corridor to become empty rather than ascending to the fifth goddamn it bellowed a voice and she peeked into the fourth level corridor evidently whoever had opened the door had managed to lock himself out of his room because now he was cursing at the top of his lungs and pounding on his door other doors cracked open as curious residents sought the reason for the disturbance and the mouse pulled her head back into the stairwell convinced that the fourth level wouldnt be safe for her until long after she had to return to the magic show she took two steps up the stairwell then heard still more noise on the fifth level as the sounds of cursing and pounding rose through the building and she immediately reversed her course racing down to the second level well below the noise she stepped cautiously into the corridor which was a bit wider than the human section and began checking the doors the first two were locked the third had a hideous growling sound emanating from behind it it was as she approached the fourth door that she heard a sound that had no business being in the alien section of the hotel the sobbing of a human child it took her less than twenty seconds to pick the lock and leap into the darkness of the room before the door could slide shut behind her she pulled out a tiny flashlight and began inspecting the premises there was an oddlyshaped couch and chair that no human could ever sit in a table on which were placed six bronze artifacts that were absolutely meaningless to her and another table with the remains of an alien meal on it then her light caught a slight movement in the corner of the room she immediately turned and focused it and found herself staring at a small blonde girl manacled to the heavy wooden leg of an immense chair help me pleaded the girl are you alone whispered the mouse the girl nodded the mouse crossed the room and set to work on the girls manacles whats your name asked the mouse penelope sniffed the girl penelope what just penelope the manacles came apart and dropped to the floor and the mouse stood up and took her first good look at the girl penelopes blonde hair seemed to have been haphazardly cut with a knife rather than a shears and it obviously hadnt been washed in weeks or perhaps months there was a large bruise on her left cheek not terribly miscolored obviously on the mend she was thin not wiry and hard like the mouse but almost malnourished she was dressed in what had once been a white play outfit that was now grimy and shredded from being worn for weeks on end her feet were bare and both her heels were raw dont turn the light on said penelope hell be back soon what race does he belong to penelope shrugged i dont know the mouse pulled a dagger out of her left boot if he comes back before we leave ill have a little surprise for him thats for sure penelope shook her head adamantly you cant kill him please cant we leave the mouse reached out a hand and pulled penelope to her feet where are your parents i dont know dead i think can you walk yes all right said the mouse heading toward the door lets go wait said penelope suddenly i cant leave without jennifer jennifer demanded the mouse whos jennifer penelope raced to a corner of the room and picked up a filthy rag doll this is jennifer she said holding it up in the beam of light now we can go give me your hand said the mouse ordering the door to slide into the wall she stuck her head out into the hall saw no movement and quickly walked to the stairwell practically dragging the weakened little girl behind her once there they walked down to the basement level and made their way to the laundry room now listen carefully whispered the mouse i want you to crawl on your hands and knees just the way im going to do behind this row of laundry carts until we reach that vent can you see it penelope peered into the semidarkness and shook her head ill let you know when were there once we reach the vent im going to boost you up inside it its narrow and its dark but you wont get stuck because thats how i came in and im bigger than you are im not afraid said penelope i know youre not said the mouse reassuringly but you have to be absolutely silent if you make any noise the maids who are running the washing machines on the other side of the room might hear and if they come over to investigate ill have to kill them its wrong to kill then dont make any noise and i wont have to said the mouse are you ready penelope nodded her head and the mouse began crawling toward the vent when she reached it she turned to see how far penelope had gotten and was surprised to find the little girl almost beside her the mouse made sure that the maids were still busily loading and unloading the washers and dryers put a finger to her lips then lifted penelope into the vent the little girl writhed and wriggled and finally made it to the right angle where the vent left the building and went beneath the street the mouse was about to follow her when she heard a plaintive whisper i cant find jennifer keep going hissed the mouse ill find her she waited for a moment until she could hear the child wriggling forward again then climbed into the vent herself she came upon the rag doll wedged into a corner as the vent turned out of the building tucked it into her belt then continued crawling until she caught up with penelope who had reached the grate beneath merlins wagon and didnt know what to do next the mouse quickly removed the grate boosted penelope into the wagon and followed her leaning back down through the false floor to reattach the grate wait here she instructed the child and dont make a sound she donned her black hood and made it to the acts finale with no more than ten seconds to spare when it was over and most of the crowd had dispersed she led merlin back inside the wagon what kept you asked the magician you cut it awfully close i hired an assistant said the mouse with a smile an assistant the mouse pointed at penelope who had buried herself under a bag of props good god muttered merlin lifting the bag where the hell did you find her chained to a bed in an aliens room the magician squatted down next to the little girl and examined the bruise on her cheek youve had a hard time of it havent you she stared at him without answering has she got any family on westerly merlin asked the mouse i dont think so what was she doing here i dont know said the mouse hiding said penelope he doesnt mean now penelope said the mouse he meant when i found you hiding repeated penelope you mean the alien who stole you was in hiding she shook her head he was hiding me the mouse nodded from your parents penelope shook her head again my parents are dead from the authorities then said the mouse no then from who asked the mouse in mild exasperation penelope pointed a thin wavering finger out the wagons only window to the doorway of the hotel where cemetery smith and threefisted ollie were speaking in loud angry voices to the doorman from them penelope was sound asleep clutching her rag doll to her chest as the ship sped through the void to the dry dusty world of cherokee the mouse had fed and bathed her and put a healing ointment on her feet and had finally gone to the ships cluttered galley where she found merlin sitting at the dining table he had a small mirror set up opposite his hands and was studying it intently as he went through his repertoire of card tricks well he asked well what merlin put the deck of cards in his pocket did she say anything of course she did answered the mouse shes not mute you know anything useful he persisted like why anyone would hire two such expensive killers to hunt her down weve gone over this before said the mouse wearily shes very young and very confused she commanded a cabinet to open and withdrew a bottle and a glass its far more likely that they were after her abductor look at it logically the alien kidnapped her the family decided not to pay any ransom and they hired a pair of killers to get her back if youre right weve got to unload her quick said merlin if theres a reward we claim it on cherokee if there isnt we get rid of her before they send smith and ollie after us there arent any authorities on cherokee she pointed out while pouring herself a drink its an inner frontier world thats why we chose it its got a post office covered with wanted posters and its got a powerful subspace radio transmitter responded merlin we can at least find out if a reward has been offered i dont know if there will be a reward in the usual sense said the mouse but someone is offering something or cemetary smith and threefisted ollie wouldnt have been after the kidnapper she paused if shes valuable enough to interest professional assassins and bounty hunters the family must be awfully rich my guess is that theyre trying to keep it quiet maybe shes got brothers and sisters theres no sense advertising that their security is flawed then how will we find out who she is and who she belongs to said merlin we cant just post an advertisement that weve stolen this little blonde girl from an alien kidnapper smith and ollie would be hunting for us five minutes later he stared thoughtfully at his lean white fingers i dont know we may have bitten off more than we can chew what did you want me to do asked the mouse irritably leave her where she was no i suppose not merlin sighed deeply and lit a small cigar but im starting to get a very bad feeling about this i dont see why said the mouse downing her drink because were a couple of smalltimers if cemetary smith and threefisted ollie are involved in this then were in over our heads and i have a feeling that theres more to this than meets the eye for instance i dont know he admitted but i cant help remembering the look on her face when she pointed to those two killers like shed seen them before perhaps she had agreed the mouse so what maybe they took a shot at her captor and missed and in her confused state she thought they were shooting at her thats the problem said merlin what is those guys dont miss he paused and rubbed his chin thoughtfully and theres something else too what bounty hunters arent much for sharing do you know how much money someone had to put up to get them to work together he stared at her a troubled expression on his face if shes worth that much why havent we heard about her before when youre really rich you dont brag about it you hide it i dont know said merlin youve got an answer for everything but i still dont like it ill tell you what she said when we set down on cherokee well make some very discreet inquiries and see if we can find out who she is and who wants her and well keep doing it carefully and discreetly on every world we hit until we get an answer in the meantime she can shill for the act will that satisfy you i suppose so the question is will it satisfy her what do you mean asked the mouse what if she wants to go home right now wherever home is said merlin you told me that the alien kept her chained up what if she tries to get away from us the mouse shook her head she thinks i saved her which in fact i did i can keep her contented i just dont think of you as the motherly type why dont you let me worry about that as long as someones worrying about it said merlin they sat in silence for half an hour the mouse reading a newstape merlin practicing his sleightofhand with a trio of coins then they heard penelope moan and the mouse went to her cabin to check on her whats the matter she asked as she approached the girls bed penelope looked confused i thought i was back where you found me it was just a dream said the mouse soothingly im frightened whimpered penelope theres no need to be youre safe now penelope shook her head but you are continued the mouse tomorrow well be landing on a new world and weve decided to let you start learning the act so you can help us wont that be fun they wont let me who wont let you everybody no one on this world even knows you said the mouse someone will someone always does the mouse frowned how many worlds have you been to penelope held up both hands studied them and then bent two fingers on her right hand eight worlds penelope nodded and somebody always knew you on each of these worlds on most of them who knew you men just men bad men said penelope men with weapons some of them youve had a tough time of it havent you said the mouse try to go to sleep now things will look better when you wake up she gave the little girl a hug and then left the cabin well asked merlin when she had rejoined him bad dream he shrugged i suppose shes entitled to it she is do you know that theyve been chasing her kidnapper across eight worlds she told you that asked merlin yes he frowned thats another thing that doesnt fit why not if this alien was good enough to keep one step ahead of cemetary smith for eight worlds how come you were able to just walk right in and grab her he didnt know i was there nobody did and he didnt take any precautions against an unknown bounty hunter coming in the back door i find that just a little bit hard to believe he obviously didnt have any confederates replied the mouse or else they were killed by bounty hunters at any rate he couldnt watch her every minute of every day i gather hed been doing just that on eight different worlds she looked annoyed why is it that whenever you find yourself in a new situation you suddenly become the most paranoid man ive ever known new i dont mind responded merlin waving his hand in the air and producing a bouquet of flowers i dont even mind strange but this situation feels more than new and strange it feels dangerous and that i dont like well said the mouse after a moments silence i dont know what we can do about it shes here and until we can return her to whoevers paying cemetary smith and threefisted ollie to find her shes staying here well see i mean it merlin she said firmly after what shes been through im not about to abandon her on some frontier dirtball with no friends or family to look after her all right he said resignedly i know that tone of voice she stays until we find out who will pay to get her back you neednt look so unhappy about it she added why not replied merlin ive got the same questions now i had an hour ago none of them have gone away just because youve always got a smooth answer for everything he paused the only thing thats changed since this conversation began is that now weve got another mouth to feed a very little one a very welltraveled very enigmatic little one he corrected her the ship touched down on a barren strip of ground a mile beyond cherokees only tradertown ordinarily merlin and the mouse would have taken a room at the local hotel just to get away from the monotony of their cramped quarters but they didnt want to advertise the fact that a little blonde girl was traveling with them so they decided to sleep in the ship they touched down in the middle of the night and when the harsh yellow sun rose over cherokees bloodred sand dunes and barren rocky hills they left penelope behind and walked into town like most of the inner frontiers tradertowns this one had sprung up around the planets first bar and whorehouse there were a pair of small hotels a couple of restaurants a second whorehouse and three more bars a hangar for private spaceships a post office that functioned not only for cherokee but for every habitable world within five light years a nowdefunct government office for registering mining claims a safari outfitter seven import export companies a small brewery two general stores and perhaps fifty modular domed houses once cherokee had been a mining world but after its limited supply of diamonds and fissionable materials had been exhausted its primary reason for colonization had vanished and it was now used mainly as a trading post and refueling depot for excursions to far hebrides oceana iii and other more interesting planets closer to the galactic core a few thousand people had remained on cherokee but it was as close to being deserted as a planet could become while still inhabited by some sentient life forms the mouse stopped at the post office and checked the various posters hoping to find some mention of a missing blonde girl but saw nothing but the holographs of wanted criminals finally she left and walked into the largest of the taverns and waited for merlin who was trying to get some news concerning penelopes family from the subspace transmitting station the tavern was quite large there was a long hardwood bar running down one side of it a handful of gaming machines in the rear and a number of large round tables clustered in the middle a trio of overhead fans spun lazily recirculating the warm air a holograph of a buxom nude brunette hung over the bar punctured by hundreds of darts the floor was covered with the omnipresent red dust of cherokee and traces of it seemed to hang in the still air of the tavern the clientele was similar to most of the tradertowns that the mouse had visited a mixture of aliens and humans some obviously wealthy others just as obviously poor all chasing the dream of instant riches that life on the inner frontier always promised and rarely delivered two lodinites their red fur rippling despite the lack of air circulation were seated at one table playing jabob a card game that was becoming increasingly popular on the inner frontier there was a tall emaciated canphorite sitting alone in a corner obviously waiting for someone to join him the rest of the customers clustered together in twos and threes were men some were garbed in silks and satins with shining leather boots and sparkling new weapons others those who had not yet struck it rich or more likely has squandered what they had earned wore the dusty working outfits of prospectors a couple of girls from the whorehouse next door were drinking at the bar but by some sort of mutual understanding none of the men approached them or even paid any attention to them while they were on their equivalent of a coffee break the mouse sat down at an empty table spent a few restless minutes waiting for merlin and finally ordered a container of the local beer it tasted bitter but it quenched the thirst she had built up walking through the hot dusty street and she quickly finished it and ordered another a moment later merlin entered and came over to join her any luck he asked sitting down on a straightbacked chair no how about you he shook his head not a damned thing what do we do now we do our act tonight and then leave this worlds only good for one day hell i doubt that ill be able to steal enough to pay for our fuel and the girl continued merlin she cant stay here said the mouse adamantly shell come along until we can collect a reward or find a safe place to leave her it had better be soon said merlin he got up and walked over to the bar to order a drink as he returned and sat down a tall slender man turned away from the bar and approached their table his coalblack outfit was carefully tailored and remarkably free of dust his boots were made from the pelts of some exotic whiteandblue arctic animal and he carried a small handaxe tucked in his belt mind if i join you he said pulling up a chair wiping a trace of red dust from it with a linen handkerchief and sitting down do we know you asked merlin suspiciously i sure as hell doubt it said the tall man but i know you oh the man nodded youre that magician who hits the inner frontier worlds arent you who wants to know my names maclemore said the man hatchet jack maclemore maybe youve heard of me im afraid not said merlin well its a big galaxy said maclemore with an easy shrug no reason why you should have he paused and youre merlin the magician right merlin the magnificent the magician corrected him and this is my assistant he added gesturing toward the mouse im pleased to meet you said the tall man smiling at her where was it that you saw me perform asked merlin oh i never saw you perform said maclemore magic doesnt interest me much i must have misunderstood you replied merlin i thought you said you had seen me i said i knew who you were said maclemore thats not the same thing at all he paused anyway id like to buy you a beer and maybe do a little business with you what are you selling asked the mouse surreptitiously withdrawing her knife from her boot but keeping her hands beneath the table maclemore smiled im not selling anything maam sellings not my business all right she said coldly what are you buying the smile remained in place well truth to tell buyings not my business either just what is your business oh a little of this and a little of that he turned to merlin you were on westerly a couple of days ago werent you what concern is that of yours demanded merlin where you go makes no difference to me said maclemore westerlys as good a world as any and probably better than most suddenly he leaned forward staring intently at the magician but while you were there you took something that didnt belong to you he paused briefly and thats my business i dont know what youre talking about said merlin oh i think you do replied maclemore im talking about something you took from an aliens room im a magician not a thief said merlin he paused and returned maclemores stare but just out of curiosity how much is this missing object worth i think you know or you wouldnt have taken it i didnt take anything i thought we were talking business said maclemore and here you go insulting my intelligence its enough to make a man take offense he smiled again a smile that started and ended with his lips his eyes remained cold and hard i assure you that no offense was intended said merlin as for talking business he continued carefully i havent heard any offers yet youre still alive said maclemore thats not necessarily a permanent condition merlin looked more annoyed than frightened ive been threatened by experts he reached into the air snapped his fingers and suddenly he was holding a small laser pistol that was aimed between the tall mans eyes thats very good admitted maclemore maybe i ought to take more of an interest in magic maybe you ought to take less of an interest in other peoples affairs said merlin you might as well deal with me said maclemore youre going to have to deal with someone before you leave the planet nobody else knows were here maclemore chuckled in amusement how do you think i knew it or do you think i live on this dirtball he turned to the mouse youre going to run into a lot of people who arent as friendly and reasonable as i am maam maybe youd better tell your friend to deal with me while he can i still havent heard any offers said merlin either tell me what youre after and how much youre willing to pay for it or go bother someone else ive already made you a handsome offer you get to live you seem to forget whos holding the gun maclemore shrugged its not the kind of thing im likely to forget he replied easily hell everyone in this tavern knows youre pointing a laser pistol at me suddenly he smiled but you dont know which two of them are my partners mouse said merlin never taking his eyes from maclemore any suggestions he doesnt have any partners said the mouse coldly men like him always work alone my feelings precisely agreed merlin if he doesnt get up and walk away kill him said the mouse there are a lot of witnesses said maclemore suddenly tense they dont give a damn about any of us replied the mouse forgive my saying it but youre a bloodthirsty little lady maam said maclemore his right hand inching down to the handaxe he had tucked in his belt suddenly the mouse stood up and threw her knife at him it caught him in the right shoulder and he shrieked in pain nobody does that to hatchet jack he bellowed awkwardly trying to withdraw his handaxe with his left hand there was a brief buzzing sound as merlin fired his laser pistol and maclemore collapsed across the table his head smoking and sizzling wonderful muttered merlin staring at the humans at the bar who had all turned to see what was happening what now now we get the hell out of here said the mouse retrieving her knife with a hard jerk start walking to the door she nodded and did as he said while he faced the assembled spectators nobody moved the silence was almost palpable broken only by the creaking of the overhead fans as they continued to turn slowly he threatened us said merlin at last starting to back toward the door it was self defense the bartender who had been totally motionless picked up a glass and began wiping it absently no ones prepared to argue that point while youve got a gun trained on us mister he said and no ones going to weep bitter tears over hatchet jacks grave either im delighted youre being so reasonable about it said merlin reaching the door you got the gun just remember that got a bit of advice for you though said the bartender what is it i wouldnt try using that gun on the next fellow who comes to talk to you there wont be enough of you left to bury who else is looking for me youll find out soon enough said the bartender i dont know what youve got mister but some pretty dangerous people dont want you to keep it who youll know em when you see em if you see them first said merlin tell them that im a peaceloving man and that anything ive got is for sale ill do that said the bartender now you can do me a favor and get the hell out of here before they find you i dont want my tavern all shot up merlin waved his laser pistol in the air if anyone follows me hes going to wish he hadnt you made your point said the bartender just leave merlin backed into the street did you hear all that he asked the mouse yes she answered wed better get back to the ship fast if its still there damn muttered merlin i hadnt thought of that if we didnt have the girl with us of course theyd go to the ship they began walking rapidly out of the tradertown keeping to the shadows cast by the buildings wherever they could wary of any possible ambush how did word of what we did get here so fast demanded merlin increasing his pace her family must be even richer than i thought said the mouse right at this moment anyone who wants her can have her as far as im concerned said merlin thats the first time ive ever killed a man i dont care how big the reward is shes not worth the trouble the first time said the mouse surprised yes you handled yourself very well it was like some big game of upmanship until you threw your knife at him replied merlin then i just pulled the trigger without thinking thats the best way said the mouse start thinking about what youre going to do and you start thinking about what might happen to you and then you start hesitating and before you know it youre dead you talk about it like it was a daily occurrence ive just killed a man he was going to kill us said the mouse with a shrug but stop worrying about him we may have to kill a few more before we get off this planet lets just give them the girl first they have to ask for her since theyve probably figured out that shes in the ship they may not bother wonderful muttered merlin they reached the edge of town merlin looked back to make sure no one had emerged from the tavern yet then peered off in the distance where the sun was glinting off the ship its still there said the mouse halfsurprised god he said it looks a lot farther away than it looked this morning one of the reasons i teamed up with you is because youre good in a crisis said the mouse but you approach one about as badly as any man ive ever known merlin made no reply but merely glared at her for a moment and continued walking when they were within yards he stopped again i dont like it he said were sitting ducks theres nowhere to hide and the sand makes it impossible to move quickly if we have to the sooner we get there the sooner you wont have to worry about it said the mouse im not that anxious to get my head blown off has it occurred to you that if someone at the ship was planning to kill us they would have already done it this isnt beyond the range of any longbarreled weapon i know of projectile laser sonic or molecular imploder merlin frowned youre right feel better less like a target anyway whoevers looking for the girl is at least willing to let us get close enough to talk to him and if we can get that close said the mouse merlin increased his pace yes i feel much better somehow i knew you would when they got to within yards the magician slowed down again now what asked the mouse i dont see anyone so if theyre inside the ship theyve already got the girl and they dont need us anymore then why havent they shot us she asked why take a chance of missing at a quarter of a mile when they can wait for us to reach the ship and blow us away from ten yards he retorted what do you propose to do then stand out here until you die of heat stroke i dont know well you can do what you want said the mouse im going to the ship merlin muttering to himself fell into step beside her then when they were yards away from the ship the mouse stopped and shading her eyes with her hands she stared straight ahead what now asked merlin im not sure its so bright but i think i see two bodies at the foot of the ship are they moving she shook her head they look dead thats crazy said merlin we havent got any guardian angels on this planet on any planet for that matter maybe they had a falling out said the mouse well lets find out they approached the ship cautiously but the mouse had been right two men both heavily armed lay dead at the base of the ladder leading to the entry hatch thats very strange said the mouse neither one of them tried to use his weapon what killed them asked merlin the one on the right looks like he broke his neck theres not a mark on the other one that i can see the hatch is unlocked said merlin do you suppose theres another one in there theres only one way to find out said the mouse climbing up the stairs and entering the ship penelope she called are you all right suddenly the little blonde girl her rag doll clutched in one hand raced out of her cabin and threw herself into the mouses arms please dont leave me again she sobbed i was so frightened its all right now said the mouse stroking her hair nobodys going to harm you is there anyone else aboard the ship asked merlin climbing through the hatch penelope shook her head just me the mouse set her down on the deck and knelt down next to her tell me what happened she said two very bad men came to the ship after you left said penelope i know i think they wanted to take me away i think so too said the mouse im glad they died so am i said the mouse but how did they die after you left i got lonely so i took jennifer outside to play but there werent any other little girls around she looked as if she were about to burst into tears again there wasnt anyone she paused do we have to stay on this world well be leaving in just a few minutes said the mouse now what happened to the two men i saw them coming out to the ship and i got scared and ran inside but i left jennifer on the stairs to the door you mean the entry hatch the door repeated penelope pointing to the open hatch one of them started climbing the stairs but he tripped on jennifer and fell down and didnt move and the other man he knelt down next to the first man to see if he was alive and something bit him something what kind of thing i dont know it lives under the sand he screamed and grabbed his hand and then he died too she stared out the hatch they were very bad men merlin said the mouse check him out the magician went back outside while the mouse soothed the little girl then reentered the ship a moment later hes got some kind of bite on his hand all right its swollen up and miscolored he was laying on it or wed have spotted it right away he uttered a low whistle and shook his head in wonderment boy talk about dumb luck im not dumb said penelope heatedly no said merlin but you sure as hell are lucky he turned to the mouse i recognize the one with the broken neck bounty hunter from time to time a killer anyway weve got some serious planning to do said the mouse i agree said merlin the next guy to come along isnt going to trip on a doll or get bitten by some alien snake he locked the hatch entered the control room and activated the ships engines but before we talk the first order of business is to get the hell off the planet before somebody else comes looking for us right said the mouse strapping penelope and herself down as the ship began climbing through the atmosphere once they were safely in space merlin set the controls on automatic and joined the mouse in the galley if they know we landed on cherokee they must know the ships registry number he said and if they know that theyll be able to find us wherever we go we cant afford a new ship and i dont think trying to steal one would be the brightest thing we ever did i agree then what did you have in mind asked the mouse lets go deeper into the inner frontier ill touch down on five or six worlds and drop the two of you off on one of them and what about you ill lead them a merry chase while you try to find out who she belongs to the mouse opened her mouth to protest but merlin held up his hand look he said im happier running away from trouble and youre happier confronting it this makes sense all the way around how will we keep in touch we wont said merlin if theyve got our registry number they can monitor every message the ship sends and receives well chose a place to meet say thirty galactic standard days from now what if they catch you first well its not my favorite scenario he admitted but if they dont blow the ship to hell and gone theyre going to find out that i havent got the girl theyll make you tell them where we are said the mouse youre not very good about pain and even if you were there are drugs thatll make you tell them everything you know i know he said thats why youre going to catch the first ship off the planet i leave you on what i dont know i cant tell them you can tell them where we plan to meet thirty days from now the mouse pointed out merlin frowned i hadnt thought of that he shrugged well i suppose i just cant let them catch me not good enough said the mouse she was silent for a moment i have it yes i wont meet you in thirty days but if youll tell me where youre going to be ill see to it that someone youve never seen before someone you dont know will find you and tell you where to meet us but hell only approach you once hes made sure youre alone and not being observed if hes not satisfied he wont make contact and well wait another thirty days before trying again i like to think of myself as ruggedly masculine and quite distinctive said merlin wryly but the fact of the matter is that i look just like anyone else how will you be sure hell be able to spot me youre a magician put on a show he grinned you know its been so long since i did a legitimate performance i never thought of that well its time we started thinking said the mouse grimly someone is sure as hell putting a lot of thought into hunting us down merlin touched down on binder x one of the more populous worlds of the inner frontier just long enough to drop off the mouse and penelope then headed toward the galactic core within three hours the mouse and penelope were on their way to evergreen a lush jungle world which had been opened up only two decades earlier they spent one night there then boarded the next ship to solomon a mining planet that had yielded the three largest diamonds ever discovered the spaceport was in the small but bustling city of haggard and by nightfall the mouse had obtained a room in a nondescript hotel how much longer do we have to keep running asked penelope wearily as the mouse began unpacking their single piece of luggage until im sure no one is following us im hungry wash your hands and face and ill take you downstairs for dinner the girl walked into the bathroom did as she had been instructed and then emerged holding up her hands for the mouses inspection very good said the mouse good said penelope i want you to like me id like you just as much if your hands were dirty said the mouse after all youre a very likable little girl i just wouldnt shake hands with you do you really like me yes i really do i like you too the little girl paused will you always be my friend of course said the mouse why shouldnt i be i dont know said penelope but lots of people pretend to be my friend and then they arent oh said the mouse who lots of people do you want to talk about it penelope shook her head im hungry so is jennifer me too said the mouse bring jennifer along and lets go get some dinner they left the room took the airlift down to the lobby and entered the restaurant the mouse scanned the faces of the diners not quite knowing what she was looking for but hoping she would be able to spot someone who was after penelope either by the telltale bulge of a weapon or by some surreptitious look but everyone carried weapons on the inner frontier and nobody paid her or the girl the any attention they punched out their orders on a computer the mouse had to help penelope read some of the dishes and then settled back to await their meal if were going to be friends forever said the mouse i should know a lot more about you weve been so busy running for the past few days that weve hardly had a chance to get to know each other and i should get to know more about you too agreed penelope that seems fair enough why are you called the mouse because im so small answered the mouse and because i can go places where most people dont fit like the laundry vent the mouse nodded exactly why where you there asked penelope because thats where merlin put on his magic show i like his tricks said penelope theyre fun she paused is he your husband the mouse chuckled no thank god hes just my business partner do you love him no do you like him yes more than you like me i hardly know you yet penelope said the mouse but im sure that after we get acquainted i wont like anyone better than i like you i hope so said penelope now its my turn to ask you some questions all right whats your home world i dont know i dont mean the world you were born on i mean the one you live on oh solomon thats the world were on now the mouse pointed out then its my home world now let me try it a different way where did you grow up all over the mouse frowned where did your parents live with me a waiter arrived with their dinners and the mouse put off further questions until they had finished eating then while they were waiting for dessert she tried again do you know why the alien kidnapped you what is kidnapped asked penelope why he stole you from your family he didnt he stole me from jimmy sunday she paused considering her answer he saved me from jimmy sunday she amended but he was very mean to me jimmy sunday repeated the mouse he was a bounty hunter i remember hearing that they found his body on glennaris v glennaris iv penelope corrected her no one lives on glennaris v and you say the alien stole you from him and killed him he saved me from him repeated penelope jimmy sunday was going to hurt me she paused thoughtfully i dont know who killed him the mouse looked puzzled why would he want to hurt you penelope shrugged i dont know maybe you just thought he was going to hurt you he was probably a gruff man he was going to kill me said penelope adamantly that doesnt make any sense those two men on cherokee were going to kill me too no they werent said the mouse they were going to take you away from us and return you to your family i dont have any family you must have someone a cousin an uncle something penelope shrugged maybe anyway they werent going to kill you someone has offered a lot of money for anyone who finds you and returns you to them nobody can collect it if youre dead youre not going to return me are you asked penelope fearfully of course not lied the mouse but i have to find out who wants you back so i can tell them that youre safe and that youd rather stay with me she paused who do you think wants you back everybody said penelope especially the number man the number man repeated the mouse whos that i dont know why do you call him the number man because his name is a number it is penelope nodded she said maybe its a code everyone called him that who is everyone everyone in the building what building i dont know where was this building asked the mouse far away said penelope on a big planet with lots of buildings if i named the planet would you know it yes earth no sirius v no deluros viii thats it said penelope youve been to deluros penelope nodded its a big world the biggest agreed the mouse did you live there penelope shook her head the number man took me there why would someone take you to the capital world of the democracy i dont know how long were you there a long time a week a month a year penelope shrugged a long time did you like it there asked the mouse no everybody wore uniforms and they werent nice to me they wouldnt play with me how did you leave somebody stole me jimmy sunday penelope shook his head no before him the mouse was silent for a moment trying to understand what she had been told and to determine how much of it was true its my turn said penelope your turn to ask you more questions all right said the mouse were you always called the mouse no i had a real name once what was it the mouse smiled a bittersweet smile that was a long time ago and i never think about it any more how long ago very how old are you asked penelope thirtyseven standard years youre much older than merlin observed penelope not that much said the mouse defensively six or seven years thats all what did you do before you met him all kinds of things said the mouse were you ever married no did you ever want to be the mouse shrugged i thought i did once i was wrong is that when you became the mouse the mouse smiled not quite how does merlin do his tricks are they really magic no not really theyre just illusions and he never tells me how they work but hes your friend isnt he yes then he should tell you but because im his friend i never ask i dont understand said penelope when you get a little bigger you will suddenly the mouse became aware of a large man staring at them through the doorway that faced the lobby when she met his gaze he looked away penelope said the mouse softly i want you to turn your head very slowly and tell me if you recognize the man standing by the pillar just beyond the door not quickly now just casually as if youre bored and are looking around penelope did as she was instructed then turned back to the mouse have you ever seen him before asked the mouse penelope shook her head no youre sure yes i may be wrong but ive got a feeling that hes staring right at us she reached out and took penelopes hand in her own theres no reason to be afraid he wont make a move while there are so many witnesses were safe for the moment i knew it wouldnt stop said penelope unhappily the mouse let go of penelopes hand and began checking her weaponry beneath the table the knife in her boot the acid spray in her pocket pouch the tiny sonic pistol tucked beneath her belt when she was sure everything was in order she instructed the computer to bill her room and then got to her feet well we might as well find out if im right or wrong she announced stay near me but always keep me between you and that man do you understand yes and dont be afraid no ones going to hurt you i wont be afraid promised penelope the mouse took penelope by the hand and walked out of the restaurant toward the airlift the large man fell into step about forty feet behind them damn muttered the mouse under her breath she pulled penelope onto the invisible cushion of air and let it propel them to the eighth floor the large man took the airlift just to the left about ten seconds behind them they stepped off at the eighth floor and began walking toward their room the large man remained some forty feet behind them the mouse reached her door and began entering the computer lock combination then felt a small hand on her wrist dont whispered penelope the mouse turned to her theres someone inside how do you know asked the mouse i just know said penelope with total conviction the mouse took her at her word grabbed her hand again and began walking down the corridor away from the large man thered better be a stairway she muttered they turned a corner and saw an exit sign above one of the doors faster said penelope breaking into a run and the mouse followed suit they entered the stairwell and the door slammed shut behind them just as the large man reached the corner the mouse pulled her knife out and crouched in the shadows waiting that wont work whispered penelope itd damn well better work said the mouse it wont she repeated follow me she darted down the stairs and the mouse raced after her when she reached the fifth floor they could hear the large man coming down the stairs behind them on the fifth floor penelope stopped and looked into the darkness behind the door for an instant then reached into the shadows and grabbed a broom you go first she said not a chance whispered the mouse tightening her grip on her knife you cant hurt him with a knife hissed penelope she held up the broom this will stop him the mouse stared at her as the little girl placed the broom on the stairs then ran down to the next landing hurry urged penelope as the large man came into view the mouse raced down to the landing then turned and prepared to do battle the man had a sonic pistol in his hand and as he surged down the stairs he was so intent upon his quarry that he didnt see the broom until he tripped over it he careened off a wall grunted in surprise then fell heavily down the stairs bellowing in pain as he rolled onto to the landing the mouse crouched down and expertly slit his throat suddenly penelope began crying and wrapped her arms around the mouse wont they ever stop she whimpered the mouse breathing heavily stroked penelopes blonde hair for a moment then stepped back and held the little girls face between her hands dont ever disobey my orders again she said i told you to keep me between you and him now youre mad at me too wept penelope i thought we were friends we are friends said the mouse thats why im mad at you you might have been killed because you didnt obey me but your knife wouldnt have hurt him protested the little girl hurt him it killed him but you wouldnt have cut his neck you would have stabbed his chest or his belly it would have killed him just as dead penelope shook her head it wouldnt have hurt him she repeated stubbornly why do you keep saying that demanded the mouse look said penelope pointing to the dead man the mouse knelt down and examined him then looked up surprised he was wearing body armor she exclaimed thats what i was trying to tell you but it was hidden under his tunic continued the mouse how did you know it was there i didnt but you said you did penelope shook her head again i said i knew your knife wouldnt hurt him the mouse frowned but you didnt know why no and how did you know there was a broom behind that door penelope shrugged i thought we were friends said the mouse friends dont keep secrets from each other i saw it said penelope youve never been in this stairwell i know then how could you have seen it persisted the mouse i saw it penelope pointed to her head in here let me get this straight said the mouse are you telling me that you can see the future there are lots of futures said penelope i dont see all of them what do you see i see whats going to happen next sometimes but you were wrong said the mouse you saw me stabbing the armored vest and i didnt i try to make the best future happen said penelope she frowned but it doesnt always work people still try to hurt me you mean you could see what would happen if i tried to stab him and also what would happen if i didnt its not like reading a book explained the girl i could see that if you stabbed him hed kill us so i ran and when we came to the fifth floor i saw that if i picked up the broom and placed it a certain way on the staircase hed trip over it and what about our room continued the mouse did you see someone inside it penelope nodded there was a man there if we had gone in hed have shot us how did you ever get captured by jimmy sunday or the alien or this man you call penelope shrugged sometimes i cant get away in any of the futures i can see how long have you been able to do this do what see into the future always i guess how far ahead can you see it changes a minute an hour a week not a week answered penelope usually just a few seconds sometimes maybe a minute she paused and i cant always do it usually just when i have to like when someones going to do something bad to you yes how does it work asked the mouse do you read their minds no i just see whats going to happen and then if i dont like it i try to change it thats quite a gift said the mouse now i know why they want you back so badly i dont want to go back whined penelope i want to stay with you nobodys sending you back said the mouse she suddenly became acutely aware of the dead man at their feet weve got to get out of here she began walking down the stairs what about our clothes asked penelope is the man still in our room i dont know its not worth the risk well buy some new clothes on the next world come on they descended to the lobby walked out the front door and hailed a landcab as it approached the spaceport penelope tugged at the mouses sleeve we shouldnt get out here she said its not safe youre sure penelope nodded but we have to get off the planet can you see how they plan to attack us no i just know its not safe then you dont know if we can elude them what does elude mean it means to keep away from them i dont know answered penelope all right said the mouse well play it safe she leaned forward and instructed the driver to take them to the vehicle rental section once there she paid off the driver and rented a landcar they drove through the streets of haggard found an allnight grocery store bought a dozen sandwiches and a few drink containers and then headed out of town where are we going asked penelope hugging jennifer protectively away from anyone who wants to hurt you answered the mouse good said penelope youre my only friend she leaned against the mouse and was sound asleep a moment later the mouse drove through the night the vegetation became increasingly sparse and by sunrise she found herself on the outskirts of a vast desert she pulled off the road brought the vehicle to a stop and began sorting through maps on the viewscreen where are we asked penelope waking up and rubbing her eyes im not sure said the mouse still going through maps ah here we are where the devils anvil whats that thats the name of the desert she pointed to a tiny dot in the middle of it and this is a village called ophir she hit two buttons on the vehicles computer and the map was replaced by a readout one bar one store one hotel why would anyone build a city in the middle of a desert asked penelope good question said the mouse lets find out she issued another command to the computer hmm we may be in luck why because theres a diamond pipe about five miles from ophir whats a diamond pipe a mine replied the mouse theyre still pulling diamonds out of it or ophir would be a ghost town why does that make us lucky persisted penelope because where theres that kind of money theres usually a ship or two no mine owner is going to drive miles into the devils anvil to check on business hed take a plane not a spaceship maybe said the mouse but if hes from offplanet hell have a ship and between you and me i dont know why anyone would choose to live on this ugly little dirtball if he could afford to live somewhere else and if he owns a diamond mine he can afford to live somewhere else concluded penelope inordinately proud of herself for following the mouses train of thought to its logical conclusion right said the mouse she sighed well theres no sense wasting any more time lets go she pulled back onto the road and headed off across the devils anvil after about kilometers the road vanished and the mouse immediately slowed down you can keep going fast said penelope the ground is hard here i know said the mouse but if i dont slow down were going to leave a cloud of dust and sand and that will make us easier to spot if anyones following us she turned to the girl are they penelope shrugged i dont know well since we dont know that they arent well do it the safe way but its hot the air conditioner can only do so much answered the mouse the ground temperature must be close to degrees celsius just try not to think about it penelope was silent for a moment then she turned to the mouse the more i try not to think about it the more i do she complained then take a nap but i just woke up then lets talk said the mouse maybe that will take your mind off the heat all right agreed penelope tell me about this man called penelope shook her head i dont want to talk about people who were mean to me she said adamantly suits me said the mouse who hasnt been mean to you you and merlin there must have been someone else in your whole life the little girl was silent for a moment lost in thought maybe my mother she said only maybe she let them take me away she may not have had a choice you had a choice penelope pointed out you didnt have to save me but you did youre not saved yet said the mouse first weve got to get off this world and then connect with merlin again and then what the mouse shrugged i dont know you wont make me go back no i wont make you go back said the mouse i already told you that lots of people tell me things penelope paused most of them lied youre too young to be that cynical what does that mean asked penelope the mouse sighed it means too many people have lied to you were talking about me again complained penelope i thought we were going to talk about you i have a better idea said the mouse lets talk about us us you and me what about us asked the girl well were a team now we are said penelope her face brightening the mouse nodded were together arent we yes and the same men who want you are after me right right and if we get away youre going to work with merlin and me arent you i guess so that makes us a team penelope considered the statement for a moment then smiled i like being a team with you i like it too said the mouse and the first rule of being on a team is that you never keep secrets from your teammates i dont know any secrets everyone knows some secrets not me even you said the mouse for example you never told me where jennifer came from penelope looked at the battered doll which was propped up next to her my mother gave her to me where in the living room i think i mean on what world penelope shrugged i dont remember how did she die jennifers not dead shes right here with us i meant your mother i dont know if shes dead answered the girl but you think she is penelope nodded why because she would have saved me if she was alive not if she didnt know where you were you found me i wasnt even looking for you said the mouse it was just a lucky accident she paused if thats the only reason you have then your mother might very well be alive how about your father they took him away they repeated the mouse who the men who came with he didnt want them to take me so they took both of us and you havent seen him since no if your mother is alive she must be looking for you i dont think so why not shes afraid of me of you yes why asked the mouse because im different you mean because you can see the future penelope nodded i used to think everyone could do it so i talked about it my mother didnt believe me so i showed her that i was telling the truth then she was afraid and your father said the mouse was he afraid of you too no what did he do for a living i dont know was he rich i dont know penelope frowned were talking about me again were talking about secrets said the mouse and now im going to tell you one what is it asked penelope eagerly someone very rich is trying to find you you told me that already but you didnt tell me why because you can see the future what good does seeing the future do asked penelope everybody keeps chasing me and no matter how hard i try to get away sooner or later they catch me did you ever make a bet on anything asked the mouse no my parents didnt like betting but you know how it works continued the mouse i say something is going to happen one way you say its going to happen another and whoever turns out to be right wins the bet i know a person who could see the future would know in advance which side to bet on it doesnt work that way said penelope oh when s people were making me do all those things they tried to make me say how a coin would land or what numbers would be on some dice after they rolled them and you couldnt do it sometimes i could even if you just guessed like everyone else youd be right half the time on a coin flip said the mouse i mean sometimes i could see in my mind how the coins or the dice would land but only sometimes only sometimes were you ever wrong asked the mouse i mean on those times when you could see the coins in your mind penelope shook her head thats why this rich person wants you said the mouse you dont have to know the right answer every time you tell him how to bet or invest you just have to be right on those occasions that you do see the future i wish i couldnt do it said penelope frowning then maybe everyone would leave me alone but you saved my life by doing it noted the mouse they wouldnt have been trying to kill you if i couldnt do it said penelope i wish i were just a normal little girl but then wed never have met said the mouse offering her a reassuring smile penelope sighed deeply i forgot about that she admitted but i wish everyone would leave us alone the mouse shrugged well just have to find a place where they will maybe well be safe at ophir suggested the girl nobodys safe in a mining town answered the mouse everyone thinks everyone else is after their goods and nobody ever trusts anybody ill be happy if we just live long enough to borrow or steal a ship she paused god its getting hot in here she slammed her hand against the vehicles air conditioner i wonder if this thing is still working penelope reached a small white hand toward one of the vents it is she paused kind of she added they must be pulling some damned big diamonds out of the ground to be worth living out here in this heat said the mouse she paused well weve each told the other a secret now i think wed better invent one invent a secret repeated penelope uncomprehendingly the mouse nodded we need a secret signal so ill know if someone wants to harm us like a secret code said penelope excitedly like the stories i saw on the video just like them how about if i do this suggested penelope screwing up her face in such a grotesque expression that the mouse laughed out loud it wouldnt be secret for very long i could pretend to sneeze no said the mouse we need something that doesnt draw attention to you try scratching your chin penelope made a claw of her left hand and scratched her chin vigorously the mouse shook her head use one finger and do it very gingerly the little girl did as she was instructed thats it if anyone is going to try to hurt us thats what i want you to do but what if im in another room or you cant see me asked penelope maybe i should whistle a song it will attract too much attention but if someone wants to kill us shouldnt we want to attract attention the mouse grimaced im not big enough to fight off an attacker i just want a little warning so we can sneak out before they pounce she paused besides someone has offered an awful lot of money for you attract enough attention in a town like ophir and four out of every five men who figure out who you are will be more likely to kidnap you than save you penelope fell silent and practiced gently scratching her chin and the mouse increased their speed and tried to ignore the constantly increasing heat within the vehicle two hours later they arrived at the tiny outpost of ophir the mouse walked into the bar penelope at her side and breathed a sigh of gratitude as a wave of cold air swept over her there were twelve large wellworn tables made from a local hardwood all of them empty at midday and she collapsed into a chair at the closest one the walls were covered with holographs of military heroes sports heroes and plump nude women none of which particularly impressed her the bartender a short burly man with a noticeable limp and a sparse mustache that made his upper lip appear dirty rather than hairy nodded a greeting to them i dont know how anyone lives out here said the mouse ive felt cooler ovens the bartender grinned we dont reach the heat of the day for another couple of hours youll get used to it why would anyone want to replied the mouse she peered at his stock behind the bar what have you got to drink you name it weve got it well need a room too its yours gratis you dont charge for your rooms said the mouse puzzled the next room i charge for will be the first said the bartender how do you make a living oh i manage said the bartender by the way my names ryan bannister ryan bannister repeated the mouse thats an unusual name ryan chuckled oh its not my real one they gave it to me the first year i was here why he leaned forward resting his large hands on the polished surface of the bar some drunk was causing a disturbance so i asked him politely to desist he didnt ryan smiled at the memory so i ripped a bannister off the staircase and cracked him over the head with it ive been bannister ryan ever since how long have you been out here asked the mouse ryan paused long enough to do a quick mental computation eighteen years bought the place seven years ago the bar the whole damned town all three buildings worth well bannister thats an interesting story but were still thirsty whatll you have ill have a tall cold beer said the mouse the first ones on the house said ryan youre kidding he shook his head one thing i never kid about is money someday you must tell me how you stay in business someday i will ryan assured her how about you said the mouse to penelope whatll you have a glass of water please said the girl right said ryan thatll be credits what demanded the mouse credits repeated ryan for a glass of water said the mouse incredulously nobodys holding a gun to your head said ryan cheerfully if you think you can get it cheaper somewhere else go right ahead now i see how you make a living said the mouse irritably out here waters worth a hell of a lot more than a bed replied ryan theres none on the surface for miles in any direction and the miners use what little exists below the ground to extract their diamonds cant you recycle it he shook his head radioactive two glasses of it and you wont need a flashlight when you go out at night the mouse pulled out a wad of credits and slapped them down on the table and a moment later ryan came out from behind the bar carrying a beer and a glass of water ive sold water for a lot more than this from time to time he explained pleasantly you wouldnt believe what a man with a pocketful of diamonds will pay to fill his canteen before he sets out for haggard especially if he hasnt told his partners that hes leaving the mouse looked out a dusty window at the vast expanse of sand and rock yes i think i would by the way how long are you and the child going to be staying at credits for a glass of water not as long as i thought if youre short of money theres work to be had said ryan i dont know the first thing about mining ryan shook his head i didnt mean that he paused ive got a little enterprise going on the top floor i can always use a healthy woman and the little girl could earn a bundle not interested said the mouse youd be surprised how generous some of these miners can be forget it ryan shrugged well if you change your mind let me know the mouse simply glared at him and he walked back to his position behind the bar mind if i ask you a question he said as he watched her drain her beer as long as its not on the same subject what are you and your daughter doing out here anyway maybe im married to one of the miners maybe im the sultan of sirius v he shot back with a smile if you belonged to one of the miners youd have asked after him i dont belong to anyone said the mouse objecting to his choice of words thats just what i meant agreed ryan so why are you here i like the desert the police are after you huh continued ryan whatd you do back in haggard nothing no one comes to ophir for the climate and the view if you tell me whos after you maybe i can keep an eye out for them were looking for the man who robbed us piped up penelope someone said he was in ophir i notice he left you enough money to rent a landcar and pay for your water said ryan highly amused nice try kid its true chimed in the mouse my parents rented the car and loaned me the money and they live in haggard thats right whats on the corner of th and quatermaine asked ryan the mayors office the ophir ballroom said ryan thats where we got the name for this place not any more said the mouse without missing a beat they tore it down three years ago i dont believe you the mouse shrugged believe anything you want he stared at her for a minute then matched her shrug with one of his own what the hell its none of my business right im just making conversation lady it gets lonely around here until dark then the miners come thats right how many of them it depends most of them have bubble modules out there but you cant really relax or socialize in one we might get two dozen or so that many you look surprised i didnt see any ships or landcars they wouldnt leave em here and then walk six miles to the mines replied ryan use your head lady he paused if you really are looking for some guy you could be in for a long wait if you expect him to show up here there are more than eighty miners out there youd be better off taking your landcar to the mines and looking for him when they knock off at sunset maybe i will said the mouse what direction are the mines from here northwest just follow the tracks thanks said the mouse im too tired and its too damned hot to go out today but if he doesnt show up well head out there before sunrise and see if we can spot him and then what asked ryan ill go back to haggard and get the police ryan laughed whats so funny asked the mouse they wont come to this hellhole for a thief itd probably take a mass murderer to get them out here then what will i do if i find him asked the mouse playing out her part and wishing that penelope had kept her mouth shut theres a guy upstairs right now who might be able to help you said ryan confidentially i take it hes not a miner answered the mouse sardonically ever hear of threefisted ollie everyone has said the mouse uneasily is he here nope this is the man who killed him a few months back hes not dead blurted penelope isnt he now said ryan with a triumphant grin and howd you come to know that little lady penelope flustered looked helplessly toward the mouse whats this mans name said the mouse cooly ignoring the girls gaffe he claims his name is bundy said ryan but i recognize him from his posters hes the forever kid the forever kid repeated the mouse thats an odd name even for the frontier ryan nodded it fits though hes some kind of sport or mutant grew up normal til he was or and hasnt aged a day in the last couple of centuries what is he a bounty hunter wouldnt do you much good if he was answered ryan unless theres a price on your mans head no the forever kids a killer he hires out to anyone who can afford him whats he doing here some questions it just aint politic to ask but you brought him up i dont mean you asking me said ryan with a grin i mean me asking him when is he due downstairs asked the mouse depends on how much fun hes having answered ryan but hes rooming at the hotel so hell be taking his meals here and hes definitely a killer and not a bounty hunter yep not that it makes any difference to you the child as much as said that you werent robbed dont believe everything you hear said the mouse ryan laughed again if i believed half of what i heard id be dead and buried already were going to need a room said the mouse getting up from the table and signaling penelope to do the same ryan looked at his computer which was behind the bar room he said two beds with a view of the pool youve got a swimming pool out here said the mouse disbelievingly yep aint got no water in it but the pools there breaks up the landscape anyway he paused you got a name you choose one responded the mouse ryan nodded as if this was a daily request then typed a code into his computer okay miz mother and miss daughter the stairways off there to the left behind the curtains and the doors unlocked once youre inside itll flash the lock and unlock codes on a panel over one of the beds dinners half an hour after sunset thanks said the mouse leading penelope to the curtain by the way when did he get here the kid he showed up this morning ryan pointed out the window thats his vehicle a few yards to the left of yours he paused probably hes here on a job didnt seem my place to ask it wasnt said the mouse starting to climb the stairs they reached room a moment later it was small and relatively clean although even the sealed window couldnt keep all of the dust out of the room there were two airbeds a holographic video and a computer neither of which could be operated without inserting a personal credit cube into them a desk two rather stark wooden chairs and a bathroom containing a chemical toilet and a dryshower the mouse sat on the edge of her bed and penelope after propping jennifer up against a pillow seated herself on her own bed im sorry said the girl about threefisted ollie i mean i just blurted it out no matter he knew we were lying anyway will he report us do you think to whom asked the mouse with no show of concern hes as close to being the law as you can get out here besides he doesnt know who we are hell find out you can see that in the future penelope shook her head no but sooner or later they always find out maybe not this time said the mouse i want to have a little chat with the forever kid but hes a killer but not a bounty hunter whats the difference asked penelope theres a difference between capturing you and killing you explained the mouse most of the men and women who are after you want you alive this isnt the kind of man theyd hire to find you his specialty is death maybe he was hired to kill whoever im with its a possibility admitted the mouse thats why i want to talk to him alone if hes available i want to hire him to protect us until we can hook up with merlin again what about me youre going to stay in the room ill bring your dinner back to you but i can help you protested penelope if he wants to kill you ill know even if he wants to kill me he wont do it until he knows where you are the bartender will tell him not unless he tells the bartender who hes looking for and why and killers tend to be pretty closemouthed especially when theres a reward for their victims the mouse paused its a gamble but weve got to take it why because hes got to have a ship she explained patiently if i can hire him to protect us until we can connect up again with merlin it means we wont have to drive out into the desert and try to steal a ship from one of the miners and ive got a feeling they protect their ships as devoutly as they protect their diamonds penelope frowned unhappily i thought we were supposed to be a team she said we are the mouse assured her but different members of a team have different duties i dont perform merlins magic tricks you know whats my duty asked the girl for the next few days its to warn me of danger said the mouse but only if showing yourself doesnt put us in even more danger all right said penelope thoughtfully that seems fair good the mouse lay back on the bed im exhausted that heat seems to have drained me im going to take a nap she reached into her pocket withdrew a credit cube that she had appropriated on westerly and tossed it to penelope why dont you watch the video and wake me at twilight all right said the girl penelope shook the mouse awake a moment later what is it the cube doesnt work said the girl hmm i guess the owner reported that it was missing the mouse dug into her pocket and withdrew three more cubes throw that one away and try these one of them ought to work she lay back again and a moment later heard penelope giggling at something she saw on the holographic screen then she fell into a deep exhausted sleep and didnt move a muscle until penelope tapped her gently on the shoulder didnt any of the cubes work asked the mouse momentarily disoriented its almost dark out responded the girl youve been asleep all afternoon the mouse sat up scratched her closecropped hair vigorously and then stretched her arms and looked out the window ive got time for a dryshower she announced and went off to the bathroom to cleanse the dirt and dried sweat from her small wiry body she wished that she had some fresh clothes but she settled for tossing her outfit into the dryshower for a few minutes it came out wrinkled but clean and a few minutes later she walked out into the hall and down the stairs after warning penelope not to let anyone else into the room a handful of miners were seated at the table nearest the door they were hard grizzled men who quaffed their beer as if it meant the difference between life and death and complained long and loud to each other about everything from the weather to the price of industrial and investmentgrade diamonds then the mouse looked toward the far end of the room and there sitting in the shadows his back to the wall an expression of boredom on his handsome face sat a young man with a shock of unruly blond hair who seemed scarcely old enough to shave his clothes were sporty without being ostentatious and bulky enough to hide half a dozen weapons there was a container of water on the table in front of him the mouse walked around the miners table grateful that they were too absorbed in their conversation and their beer to offer any catcalls or whistles and approached the young man good evening she said pleasantly is it he replied looking up at her and she was suddenly struck by how bored and ancient his blue eyes seemed it might be if youd invite me to sit down he nodded toward a chair opposite him be my guest whatll it be miz mother ryan called out from behind the bar another glass of water the mouse shook her head make it a beer coming right up and a dinner menu she added ryan chuckled you make it sound like theres a choice isnt there out here were lucky to have any food to serve at all ill bring you a plate when its ready be another five minutes or so thanks how about the little girl shes sleeping replied the mouse studying the young man to see if he reacted to the news that she was traveling with a child his face remained expressionless ill bring a plate up to her when im done ryan approached the table handed a glass of beer to the mouse and retreated to his station well thats over with said the young man with the ancient eyes now what can i do for you that all depends answered the mouse on what on who you are my names bundy i dont care what your name is the young man shrugged i dont much care what yours is either why dont you just say whats on your mind i need protection said the mouse i think you can provide it so you can live another years he asked take my word for it its not worth it i want your protection anyway do i look like the protective type asked the young man hell lady im just a kid a yearold kid said the mouse staring into his clear blue eyes years to be exact replied the forever kid displaying neither surprise nor anger that she knew who he was thats a long time to stay alive out here on the frontier said the mouse especially for a man in your line of work longevity is a greatly overrated virtue replied the kid im said the mouse bluntly i stand a good chance of not reaching if i cant find someone to help me get away from here you have my sympathy said the kid his voice as bored as his eyes i need more than your sympathy my sympathy is freely given said the kid everything else costs money how much how far away do you want to go very far then itll cost very much you havent named a price noted the mouse the forever kid smiled for the first time you havent named the opposition i dont know who it is then i hardly see how i can help you but im traveling with someone who will know the little girl you know about her the kid nodded the bartender isnt exactly closemouthed who are they after you or her right now both of us and you want my protection and your ship added the mouse thats going to cost more i dont know how much you cost to begin with i dont come cheap said the kid i couldnt use someone who did he stared at her for a long moment credits a week the mouse took a deep breath thats awfully high how highly do you value your life youll go wherever i tell you to the kid nodded i might have to pay in some other currency new stalin ruples or maria theresa dollars are acceptable i wont take far london pounds deal said the mouse wondering where she could get the money and what the forever kid might do to her if she didnt come up with it ill want a weeks pay in advance thats out of the question how do i know you can pay me youll have to trust me i trusted someone two centuries ago said the forever kid and suddenly his eyes briefly blazed to life she lied to me i havent trusted anyone since but i havent got the money now protested the mouse then youll have to get it before i leave when is that i have a little business to transact later tonight i plan to leave in the morning youre here on a contract the kid almost looked amused nobody comes to ophir for his health a miner why do you care because youve been hired to kill someone not rob him said the mouse let me come along with you if hes got credits worth of diamonds we can still make a deal what makes you think i wont appropriate his diamonds myself asked the kid youre a killer not a thief she said adamantly the kid actually smiled at her what makes you think the two are mutually exclusive because i am a thief and if i was a killer too i wouldnt need you he stared at her for a long moment and she shifted uncomfortably on her chair you amuse me he said at last i assume that means its no deal said the mouse dejectedly i havent met an amusing woman since before you were born continued the forever kid he paused and stared at her again then nodded his head okay weve got a deal the mouse extended her hand shake the kid stared at her outstretched hand i never shake hands have it your way said the mouse with a shrug when do we leave another hour or so i want to give them time to relax them said the mouse the kid nodded just how many miners do you plan to kill tonight eight eight she repeated incredulously dont look so upset said the kid youll have that much more opportunity to raise some capital eight said the mouse again thats awfully high odds i charge awfully high prices if you waited until midnight or so you might be able to sneak up on them suggested the mouse i doubt it why i sent them a message this afternoon that i was coming said the kid you sent them a message why theres always a chance he said almost wistfully a chance theyll kill you she asked not quite understanding he stared off into the distance for a long moment no he said at last no they wont be that lucky he sighed and neither will i ryan arrived just then with the mouses dinner suddenly she found that she no longer had an appetite most deserts are cold at night but this one decided the mouse as she and the forever kid drove across the sand in an open vehicle was merely less hot youve been very quiet since dinner remarked the kid is anything wrong youre kidding right i gave up kidding more than a century ago well to tell you the truth i was wondering if id be able to find my way back to ophir in the dark after they kill you you wont have to replied the kid im not going to lose are you saying that you cant be killed ive been cut up pretty bad on occasion he replied i can be killed all right but not tonight not by these men there are eight of them waiting for you out there she said waving a hand in the general direction they were headed theyll probably have taken up defensive positions all around the area hell for all you know one of them might be just a couple of hundred yards ahead of us waiting to take a shot at you as you drive by the kid shook his head theyll all be in their camp taking comfort from each others presence how do you know that he turned to her ive been doing this for two hundred years i know how hunted men act maybe these men are different i hope so he said earnestly why she asked honestly curious because its been a long time since ive seen anything new thats a hell of an answer you think its easy to be the forever kid he asked to know that when everyone now living in the whole galaxy has been dust for millennia ill still look the same to eat the same meals and fly to the same worlds and do the same thing day in and month out year in and century out he paused everyone wants to be immortal but let me tell you lady its not really a consummation devoutly to be wished why do you think i got into this line of work because sooner or later someone will put me out of my your misery she suggested he shook his head my boredom maybe itll be tonight said the mouse thats why im wondering if i can find my way back it wont be tonight he replied with conviction what makes you so sure i know how good i am maybe you exaggerate how good you are you told the bartender that you killed threefisted ollie but i know hes alive i never said that i killed him answered the kid i said that i could kill him not from what i hear the forever kid shrugged believe what you want they drove another two miles in silence and then they saw the lights of a small camp off in the distance thats it said the kid nodding toward the lights then shouldnt we stop the landcar soon he said starting to decelerate they dont have any weapons that are accurate at more than yards you hope i know he replied finally coming to a stop i thought i saw some movement behind that boulder to the left of the last bubble whispered the mouse you did well what are you going to do about it the kid got out of the vehicle and stretched lazily im going to go to work what about me you stay here until its over a stationery target in a parked vehicle said the mouse getting out her side of the landcar no thank you youd be safer in the car you worry about your safety and ill worry about mine she shot back he shrugged as you wish he began walking off into the shadows let me follow you said the mouse suddenly very uneasy about remaining behind youd just be in the way there must be something i can do there is what go into their camp under a white flag and tell them theyve got five minutes to make their peace with whatever god they worship me repeated the mouse incredulously the forever kid chuckled you see anyone else out here not a chance said the mouse vehemently its up to you ill call to you when its over you know said the mouse theres a very fine line between confidence and madness there was no answer and the mouse realized that she was talking to herself the kid had gone she stood beside the vehicle squinting into the darkness trying to spot the other seven miners in the dim illumination yards ahead after a few minutes she heard a single piercing scream and then a number of rifle shots and the buzzing from laser pistols she ducked down behind the vehicle just in case the kid had been wrong about the accuracy of the miners weapons but after a few moments of total silence she peeked around the side three bodies two of them grotesquely contorted lay in the small pool of light beside the camp and she could see the motionless bare foot of a fourth sticking out of the darkness then came a highpitched shriek unmistakably feminine and an instant later a woman staggered out of one of the survival bubbles clutching her abdomen and collapsed a few yards away from the men enough cried a man i give up this isnt a childs game replied the kid from some distance youre not allowed to quit just because youre going to lose three rifles two projectile and one laser tore into the spot where the kids voice had come from and then all was silent again after a tense moment two women and a men emerged from their bubbles and cautiously approached the spot when the gunfire had converged suddenly one of the women screamed and fell to the ground and the two remaining miners turned and began firing wildly into the darkness come out and face us damn you hollered the man the forever kid stepped out of the shadows whoever paid you for this ill pay you more to go away said the woman im afraid thats not a viable option said the kid there was a sudden movement of his right hand and both miners keeled over the kid spent the next few moments inspecting each of his victims making sure they were dead then satisfied he turned toward the vehicle you can come out now he shouted into the darkness the mouse still stunned by the ease with which he had dispatched his opponents approached the camp gingerly what the hell did you use on them she asked as she reached the first of the corpses something very small and very sharp replied the kid eight somethings actually amazing muttered the mouse stepping around two more bodies go gather your plunder and lets be going said the kid youre not even breathing hard noted the mouse should i be most people would work up a sweat after killing eight innocent miners she replied caustically he stared curiously at her innocent of what whatever they did they didnt deserve to die like this who knows said the forever kid with a shrug you mean you dont even know why you killed them she demanded of course i do answered the kid i killed them because i was paid to kill them but you dont know what they had done he shrugged again thats none of my business dont you even care not really he answered most people deserve killing for one reason or another have you always felt this way suddenly the kid grinned puberty must have made me cynical he nodded toward the selfcontained protective bubbles my business here is done its time you went about yours he headed off toward the vehicle ill get the landcar he said while you pick up the spoils of conquest you wouldnt be planning on leaving me behind would you she said suspiciously he chuckled not while youre here with all the money she began going through the bubbles collecting uncut diamonds and rolls of credits and a few minutes later she emerged from the last of the bubbles he was waiting there for her with the landcar and fifteen minutes later she was shaking penelope awake come on she whispered its time to go go where asked penelope sleepily i dont know admitted the mouse but away from here anyway did you buy a ship even better said the mouse i bought a man who owns a ship what did you pay him with asked penelope sitting up and rubbing her eyes diamonds said the mouse holding out a small bag filled with dull uncut stones penelope peeked into the bag theres a gun there she noted i picked it up the same place where i got the diamonds answered the mouse why just in case you decide that the forever kid wants to hurt us how long will he stay with us until we put down on a safe planet said the mouse or until we run out of money whichever comes first are there any safe planets for us theres one said the mouse reluctantly i hadnt wanted to go there but i dont think we have much of a choice word of our being here has got to leak out this place is going to be crawling with killers by tomorrow night or the next morning at the latest penelope began getting dressed what is the name of this world she asked last chance have you ever been there before the mouse shook her head no i havent then why are you so sure that you dont want to go there persisted penelope it might be very pleasant with lakes and streams and green things because i dont like the man who runs it replied the mouse penelope considered the mouses answer for a moment if you dont like him why do you think well be safe there he owes me an awfully big favor has he agreed to pay you this favor the mouse grimaced i dont think he even knows im alive how long has it been since youve seen him asked penelope picking up jennifer and walking to the door a very long time he might not even remember you suggested penelope hell remember said the mouse grimly part the icemans book they called it last chance and it had been well named it was the last populated planet on the way to the galactic core the last source of nuclear fuel the last place to fill up a ships galleys the last place to see another sentient being last chance except for its location was in all other respects unremarkable it was small but the gravity was within the normal range for human beings it was hot but not so hot that life couldnt exist it was dry but not so dry that water couldnt be coaxed up through the red clay that covered most of the surface its year was very long but its days and nights were within acceptable bounds fourteen galactic standard hours each its seasons were mild but distinguishable its native life primarily avians and marsupials was unique but not plentiful it boasted a single community a rustic tradertown known also appropriately as end of the line end of the line consisted of two hotels a rooming house for more permanent visitors a series of small spaceship hangars a post office a whorehouse three empty buildings whose purposes were long since forgotten an assayers office a general store and the end of the line bar which was also a restaurant a book and tape store a subspace transmitting station a gambling parlor and a weapons shop the end of the line bar was the icemans and he ruled it as completely as he ruled the rest of the planet not a ship landed without his permission not a ship took off without his knowledge not a man or woman entered the tradertown without his consent if for reasons of his own one of those men or women never left there was no one to call him to task for it nor would anyone who lacked a serious death wish have wanted to nobody knew exactly why he was called the iceman his true name was carlos mendoza but he hadnt used it in more than a decade during which time he had had many other names changing them to suit each new world the way some men changed their clothes the iceman wasnt even a name of his own devising though it suited him well enough and he elected to keep it he was physically nondescript he lacked undertaker mcnairs terrifying gaze or the awesome height and bulk of manmountain bates or even the forever kids shock of thick blond hair he was an inch or two below normal height and he had the beginning of a belly and his brown hair was thinning on top and greying at the sides but people tended to remember him anyway especially people he didnt have much use for the icemans past was murky his future not clearly defined his present an intensely private matter he was friendly enough hed talk to anyone who cared to pass the time of day hed tell an occasional joke hed sleep with an occasional woman hed play an occasional game of chance when properly drunk hed even read an occasional poem of his own creation but even those people who thought they knew him or understood what motivated him were wrong only one person had ever gotten that close to him and now she was orbiting last chance asking for permission to land the mouse entered the end of the line tavern spotted a table in the corner and turned to the forever kid would you get a room for penelope and me and one for yourself she asked ill be along in a little while the kid looked around the enormous tavern and over at the gaming tables in the casino theres five bounty hunters here that i know of he replied in low tones ill be all right the mouse assured him youre paying me to protect you i paid you to get me to last chance im here now he shook his head you paid me for a week youve still got four days coming to you just return half the money and well call it square i dont make refunds and youd love to take on all five of them at once said the mouse with a knowing smile i wouldnt be adverse to it he admitted trying to keep the eagerness from his boyish face nobodys going to bother me here said the mouse what makes you so sure penelope would have warned me the forever kid stared down at the little girl yeah the mouse smiled reached out a hand and tousled penelopes hair shes my partner youre just the hired help thats right said the little girl were partners how do you know whos likely to cause trouble the kid asked her just be grateful that she does know said the mouse the kid continued staring at penelope finally he sighed just my luck he muttered what are you talking about asked the mouse the last thing i need is an edge now it looks like ive got one whether i want it or not just for four more days answered the mouse then you can take on killers all at once if thats what you want the kid shrugged took penelope by the hand walked back out into the dusty street and headed over to the nearer of the two hotels the mouse noticed that despite his obvious death wish he nonetheless held penelope with his left hand while his right swung to and fro just inches from his sonic pistol the mouse walked over to the corner table and a moment later a redheaded waitress approached her whatll it be asked the girl a beer said the mouse it seemed foolish to ask for brand names for a world this close to the core to have any beer was accomplishment enough right said the waitress starting to turn away and i want to see carlos mendoza who hes called the iceman these days you will when when hes ready said the waitress he knows youre here your drinks on the house sos your room yes thought the mouse grimly he knows im here all right hell stop by your table when hes ready continued the waitress the waitress walked back to the bar returned with her beer then vanished through a doorway the mouse stared at her glass for a moment then lifted it to her lips and took a long swallow when she put it back down on the table she found the iceman sitting opposite her its been a long time he said yes it has i thought you were dead im glad to learn i was wrong there was a long uncomfortable silence how have you been he asked well and you im getting by when did you leave the service asked the mouse nine years ago replied the iceman i figured fifteen years was enough for anyone yeah i guess so another silence i wouldnt have thought youd want to see me he said at last i thought youd be too bitter i am bitter carlos but i need a favor oh she nodded im in a little bit of trouble judging from the way some people in here are staring at you he said indicating the bounty hunters id say you were in a lot of trouble they say you run this world she continued ignoring his comment that nothing happens here without your permission is that true essentially i need a safe place to stay for a few weeks just a few weeks within a month therell be so many bounty hunters here you couldnt call them off even if you wanted to he smiled a humorless smile youd be surprised what i can do on my world just the same well be gone within a month probably sooner but i need some time to plan my next move without ducking at every shadow i see what makes you think all these bounty hunters wont follow you if you can arrange for us to have a tenhour head start when we leave thats all well need that can be arranged then we have your protection one of you doesnt need it said the iceman and from what i hear he probably doesnt want it so you know the forever kid i know of him he paused why is he traveling with you i hired him but i can only afford him for a few more days who are you paying him to kill i dont know said the mouse anyone who tries to kill me the iceman paused thoughtfully then spoke if that little girl is who i think she is the jobs too big for him who do you think she is penelope bailey the mouse nodded how did you ah acquire her asked the iceman i freed her from an alien who had her back on westerly you should have stolen a negatron bomb from the navy said the iceman wryly youd be in less trouble i didnt know who she was said the mouse i just saw this little girl chained in an aliens room and decided i couldnt leave her there she paused weve been on the run ever since i think there may be as many as thirty or forty men out after us thirty or forty repeated the iceman amused its possible you still dont know what youve done do you she frowned what do you mean there are three governments trying to find that little girl and close to two hundred very motivated men and women are out to claim the reward the mouse looked her surprise three governments she repeated at least she considered what he had said i didnt think there were two hundred bounty hunters on the whole inner frontier there are now the mouse shook her head in bewilderment all because of penelope thats right said the iceman and what about you she asked sharply what about me are you interested in the reward too he shook his head ive got enough money and ive done enough favors for the democracy too she stared at him youre the last man i want to ask for a favor but we need your protection we penelope and me she doesnt need protection said the iceman you do but not her im not going to let anyone take her away and stick her in some laboratory somewhere most of them dont want to a man called does he stared at her intently what do you know about just that he had her once and probably wants her back replied the mouse what do you know about him more than you said the iceman he frowned how did he ever let her get away hes the most careful thorough man i know how do you know him ive dealt with him in the past during your master spy period she asked sardonically a master spy is nothing but an employer of spy labor replied the iceman i know like you hired me precisely did you hire him too the iceman shook his head we worked for different agencies now and then our paths would cross he paused hes the best i ever knew i cant imagine that he could be so careless as to let the girl escape she must be everything they say she is what she mostly is is a lonely frightened little girl who doesnt even know what world she was born on shes also the most potentially powerful weapon in the galaxy said the iceman shes just a little girl little girls grow up and her abilities are very limited abilities can mature too the mouse shook her head all she can do is tell when someone is about to hurt her and you dont think someone with precognition whose abilities may very well be embryonic at the moment poses a danger to who demanded the mouse to bounty hunters who want to harm her to anyone or any world she decides she doesnt like thats ridiculous is it from what i hear youre traveling with a little child who can cause grown men to drop over dead it doesnt work like that said the mouse are you saying she cant make people die it isnt that simple it sounds precisely that simple to me the mouse shook her head she possesses a form of precognition so ive heard she can see a number of possible futures and sometimes by her actions she can affect which potential future becomes a reality as i said you need protection she never did she cant always choose a future in which shes safe sometimes there are no alternatives to being captured has it occurred to you that as she becomes more mature more alternatives will manifest themselves to her i hope so said the mouse shes suffered enough for one lifetime the iceman shook his head impatiently i dont mean that shell see futures in which shes not threatened oh if there are an infinite number of possible futures and she becomes more and more adept at visualizing and manipulating them what makes you think that the day wont come when she can see a future in which she rules the entire galaxy with an iron hand or that she wont be able to manipulate events to make that particular future come to pass my god carlos shes just a frightened little girl you make her sound like some kind of monster im sure that caligula and adolf hitler and conrad bland were once frightened little boys they grew up he paused are you sure you want her to grow up she glared at him furiously you really are a bastard you didnt help me eleven years ago i should have known better than to expect you to help me now you knew the risk you were taking said the iceman when i heard that you had been captured i tried to work out an exchange but they werent interested so you just wrote me off everyone was expendable he stared at her dispassionately thats the nature of the game it doesnt seem much like a game when youre stuck in a cell on an alien world no i suppose it doesnt another silence followed during which the mouse stared at the iceman and tried to reconcile what she saw with her memory of carlos mendoza you chose your new name well she said at last you were never the warmest or most demonstrative man but youve become cold as ice being warm and demonstrative never solved anything he replied in the long run they just bring you pain i find it hard to believe i ever cared for you she said its like it was some other man it was his name was carlos mendoza and he doesnt exist any longer probably just as well said the mouse getting to her feet i guess well have to take our chances elsewhere im sorry i bothered you shut up and sit down said the iceman he didnt raise his voice but his tone carried so much authority that the mouse to her surprise found herself obeying him thats better he continued you and the girl are safe for as long as you remain on last chance i owe you that much he paused my protection doesnt extend to the forever kid now go to the hotel and stay there for half an hour thatll give me time to pass the word what about the kid the iceman shrugged he can stay or leave as he pleases but if hes looking for someone to put a permanent end to his boredom hes as likely to find him here as anywhere you mean you he shook his head hes got no reason to want to kill me and ive got nothing to prove if im still here in three weeks said the mouse someone will be joining me an illusionist named merlin i want him protected too he stared at her and finally nodded his assent she pushed her chair back from the table and got to her feet ill see you around she said i imagine you will the waitress told me that i wasnt being charged for my room or my drink is that right your meals are on the house too theyd damned well better be she said its a small enough price to pay to sooth a guilty conscience i dont feel any guilt he replied but i do feel a certain obligation you may just overwhelm me with the force of your emotion said the mouse sardonically i am glad youre still alive next youll be telling me that you still love me she replied sardonically no i dont or that you never did i did once he paused it was a mistake you cant send someone you love into danger so you stopped sending people into danger the iceman shook his head sadly no i stopped loving them that afternoon the mouse stopped by the assayers office and cashed in her diamonds for the standard of market value she walked out with credits and after she paid the forever kid for his entire week she went to the room she was sharing with penelope and hid the remaining money in the little girls pillow along with the credits in cash she had removed from the miners bodies is the money safe here she asked penelope who was playing with her doll shrugged i suppose so but you dont know for sure nobody wants it right now will they want it tonight when they think were asleep probably not said penelope why probably not asked the mouse why not yes or no or i dont know i cant see all the futures that far ahead in the ones i can see nobody tries to take the money away she paused well all but one anyway and what happens in that one the man you call the iceman kills the woman who tries to sneak up here to rob you hell actually kill her only if she tries to come up here in the other futures i can see she doesnt stop by the assay office or if she does the man who works there doesnt tell her about your money it must be very confusing for you sometimes trying to separate the present from the future or the real future from all the imaginary ones theyre all imaginary until one of them happens answered penelope carefully straightening her dolls dress it used to be more confusing im learning how to sort them out better do you ever see a future in which someone isnt trying to hurt or rob us asked the mouse hardly ever well i suppose theres a certain twisted logic to that admitted the mouse i have a feeling that half the galaxy wants to hurt us and most of the other half would love to rob us she sighed and eased herself onto her bed at least were safe for the time being she chuckled briefly hell with the forever kid and mendoza both protecting us its probably the safest weve been since we met mouse said penelope after a lengthy silence what how long until dinner i thought you just had lunch an hour ago are you hungry again not really admitted penelope but theres nothing to do here and the forever kid told me i couldnt leave the room except to eat and that when i did he had to come along well thats what were paying him for i know but im still bored play with jennifer said the mouse indicating the doll shes bored too then try watching a holo theres only one frequency and ive already seen what theyre showing the mouse sat up okay find us a deck of cards and ill teach you how to play dubai gin the little girl pulled open two dresser drawers with no success then walked over to the nondescript desk by the door rummaged through it and finally withdrew a deck of cards when she took them out of their container she found to her delight that each card sported some artists holographic treatment of humanitys most famous mythic figures there were paul bunyon and billybuck dancer tarzan and santiago bigfoot and geronimo saint nicholas and saint ngani all in heroic poses the mouse briefly explained the rules of dubai gin then shuffled the deck and began dealing dont forget to deal to jennifer too said penelope propping the doll up into a sitting position i wont forget said the mouse dealing nine cards face down in front of the doll these are lovely commented penelope as she began sorting the cards the mouse had dealt her you think so replied the mouse when merlin joins us ill have to have him show you a deck that he picked up on sirius v it has portraits of extinct mammals from earth and hes got a matching deck with extinct raptors whats a raptor a bird that eats meat dont they all hardly any of them do answered the mouse penelope fell silent studying the holographs on the cards and the mouse waited another minute before speaking if youd rather just look at the cards we dont have to play no said penelope i want to play really i do all right said the mouse you have to pick a card from the pile and then discard one over here she indicated where the discard pile would be built penelope did as she was told now its jennifers turn she announced she picked a card without looking at it placed it in front of the doll and discarded a four perhaps it might be better if you looked at jennifers cards before you played them suggested the mouse that wouldnt be fair said penelope i should only look at my own cards then jennifers going to lose said the mouse oh said the little girl looking concerned why she discarded a very low card a four sometimes thats a wise move but in general you always want to rid yourself of the high cards first jennifer knows that evidently she doesnt because she didnt do it she was going to put the ten in the pile next time explained penelope what ten the one she just picked she reached over and held up the ten of hearts which sported a holographic illustration of the goddess pallas athene its so pretty she just wanted to keep it for a few minutes how did you know that it was a ten asked the mouse sharply i was watching you you never looked at it i knew that it had a picture of a pretty lady on it said penelope guiltily i didnt care that it was a ten but you knew what it was persisted the mouse i just wanted jennifer to see the picture said penelope who was close to tears now i wasnt trying to cheat honest i wasnt i know you werent said the mouse soothingly youre not mad at me how could i ever get mad at my partner said the mouse forcing a smile to her lips to mask her eagerness i wonder she said allowing her voice to trail off about what was it just because you wanted to see this picture that you knew what the card would be or could you do it again promise you wont get mad if i tell you cross my heart the next card is a picture of a man dressed in black with a black and red cloak can you see what value the card is value its number and suit its the king of spades the mouse turned over the card it was the king of spades with a rather frightening representation of count dracula staring out at her do you know whats in my hand asked the mouse penelope described the holographs then with far less interest identified the accompanying values and suits very good said the mouse will you still play cards with me now that you know asked penelope i can try to forget what they are when were playing i dont want you to forget a thing said the mouse but if i dont ill win most of the time why not all the time asked the mouse curiously cant you choose a future in which you always get the best cards the little girl shook her head in some of the futures you dont shuffle them right besides that would be cheating the mouse considered this information for a moment then shrugged what the hell we dont want to win every hand anyway it would just frighten people off we repeated penelope i thought i was playing against you the mouse shook her head impatiently were through with that game but you promised said penelope suddenly on the verge of tears again we have a more important game to play said the mouse what game a game in which we can be partners instead of opponents the mouse paused and youll get to give me secret signals too just the way we talked about before really asked penelope her enthusiasm returning really but wont we be cheating someone else if i help you i mean we wont be cheating anyone who doesnt deserve it answered the mouse and were stuck here on last chance until merlin shows up or i can put together enough money to buy a ship why cant we just tell the forever kid to take us with him asked penelope because he doesnt do favors he sells them and i havent got enough money to hire him for a second week youre sure its all right persisted penelope a worried expression on her face im not only sure its all right answered the mouse im sure its the only way were ever going to get off this dirtball she paused then added and its not safe for us to stay on any one planet for more than a few days too many people want to take you away from me i know said penelope glumly i keep trying to choose a future in which they all forget about me but i dont know how just pick one in which we win lots of money at end of the lines card table ill try promised the girl all right said the mouse lets spend the next couple of hours making sure you know the rules first comes a pair then two pair then three of a kind then the end of the line was crowded its lights glowing circular globes floating weightlessly near the ceiling shone down on traders prospectors adventurers bounty hunters whores gamblers all the flotsam and jetsom of the inner frontier as they gathered around the burnished chrome bar and the gaming tables here and there an occasional alien mingled with the mass of humanity testing its luck at the tables imbibing one of the special fluids that the iceman supplied to his nonhuman customers or selling black market commodities that werent obtainable on the worlds of the democracy the mouse walked slowly through the mass of human and alien bodies holding penelope by the hand the little girl drew some curious stares from brilliantlyclad gamblers some disapproving glances from provocativelydressed whores some avaricious looks from the bounty hunters but the icemans word had gone out and nobody said a word or made a motion in their direction the mouse was uncomfortably aware of the lean and hungry faces of the bounty hunters and was almost awed by the power the iceman seemed to wield these were cold hard men men who backed down from no one and yet a single command from the iceman had gone out on the grapevine and none of them seemed willing to cross the line he had drawn you going to be drinking or gambling asked a soft voice behind her and she turned to find herself facing the forever kid gambling she answered you sure there are a lot of pros here tonight ill be all right she assured him and besides if im going to be able to hire you for another week i need to raise some money he shrugged thats up to you once you settle down at a table ill move to where i can keep an eye on you thanks she said the iceman has passed the word that no one is to bother us while were on last chance but theres always a chance that not everyone has heard she felt a sudden surge of bitterness besides i counted on him once before and he failed me she walked past some of the alien games and the dice tables and finally came to a hexagonal table where three men two women and a lodinite were playing poker the dealer stood out even in this crowd of bejeweled gamblers the prismatic cloth of his garments changed colors with every motion he made his fingers were covered with rings of bloodnight and sheerstone his boots were made from the glowing skin of some alien reptile he wore a monocle of plain glass attached to his tunic by a gold chain and on his shoulder perched a tiny alien bird its orange eyes staring intently at his shining rings as if it might leap to his hand and gobble them up at any instant the mouse stood behind the player with the smallest pile of chips a woman dressed in such worn plain leather that she actually stood out more in this crowd of gamblers and gadflys than the dealer did after a few moments the woman rose from her chair gathered up her few remaining chips and walked off is this a private game inquired the mouse no replied the dealer but its an expensive one how much ten thousand to buy in a thousand is the minimum bet fine said the mouse seating herself opposite the dealer and placing thirty thousand credits on the table once her money was on the table the forever kid seated himself at an adjoining table that was not currently in use i see youve come to play said the dealer approvingly banker he called out get the lady some chips the casino banker walked over picked up her money and replaced it with thirty elegant chips carved from the pinkhued bone of some alien animal what about the child asked the dealer as the banker answered a call at another table she doesnt play replied the mouse she also doesnt walk around looking at anyones cards explained the dealer are you accusing me of cheating before ive even played a hand not at all said the dealer im just making sure i wont have to accuse you later the mouse turned to the little girl penelope go sit over there she pointed to the forever kids table which she could see without having to turn her head and wait for me can i have a deck of cards asked the girl so i can play solitaire the dealer withdrew a sealed deck from his pocket and slid it across the table give her these thank you said the mouse picking up the deck and handing it to penelope now go over there and wait for me penelope thanked the dealer for the cards and walked over to the table got a name maam asked the dealer lots of them replied the mouse any particular one i should call you whatever you like the dealer smiled ive always been partial to melisande myself the mouse considered it then frowned my name is mouse the dealer shrugged whats yours she asked as she picked up her cards and studied them well when im passing through customs back in the democracy its valente maam riccardo valente but out here where i make my living by courting the goddess of chance its king tout do i call you king or tout asked the mouse call me anything that suits your fancy maam replied king tout how about if we play some poker while i think about it said the mouse pushing two chips to the center of the table the lodinite and the two men matched her bet the woman dropped out and king tout surveyed his cards again see you and raise you a thousand he said picking up three chips and placing them next to the others at the tables center the mouse held her cards up appeared to be studying them and took a quick peek over the top of them at penelope the little girl rubbed her nose once the sign that the mouse was going to lose the hand then went back to deciding which card to play in her solitaire game the mouse considered tossing in her cards and minimizing her losses but decided against it having opened it would look strange if she folded immediately so she regretfully met king touts bet drew two cards and then refused to match the five thousand dollars he bet after drawing a single card poor luck maam he said with a smile as he reached out and collected the pile of chips he passed the deck to her i believe its your deal same game said the mouse pushing another chip to the center of the table she dealt out the cards then picked up her hand she had three queens a five and a four and when none of the others chose to open she was about to bet five thousand credits but first she glanced at penelope whose hand seemed inadvertently to brush by her nose again as she looked down at the cards that were spread out before her the mouse sighed studied her cards for another moment and then regretfully tossed her hand onto the table she won two small pots dropped out of another one early on and then it was king touts turn to deal again as the mouse picked up her hand she took a quick peek at penelope who seemed to be paying absolutely no attention to her at all the mouse held a deuce a five a six a nine and a queen three of them red two of them black and she opened with a single chip so did the next four players king tout pushed five chips to the center of the table the mouse frowned and pretended to study her cards again glancing surreptitiously at penelope as before the child seemed immersed in her game of solitaire and sat rigid and motionless ill see you said the mouse matching king touts bet and hoping that penelopes lack of a negative sign was purposeful and not merely neglectful im out said the lodinite into its translating mechanism me too chimed in one of the men the remaining man stared at his hand for a long time finally sighed and pushed a little pile of chips next to king touts how many cards maam asked king tout pleasantly three said the mouse tossing in the deuce the five and the six one for me said the man dealer stands pat announced king tout the mouse slowly picked up her cards and found that she had drawn two nines and a queen check she said same said the other woman well announced king tout im afraid its going to cost you five thousand credits to see what ive got the mouse stared at him and resisted the urge to grin ill see you she said at last and raise you five the man dropped out and king tout stared at his cards fanning them so that he could see the edge of each in turn you took three cards right thats right said the mouse he look at his hand once more and sighed deeply as if hed finally made his decision see your five thousand he said pushing a large pile of chips to the center and raise you another five my god thought the mouse when i think of the walls ive climbed and the ventilation shafts ive wriggled through for a twentieth of this amount right back at you she said aloud pushing ten chips of her own up against the rapidlygrowing pile between them deep in his heart king tout had a feeling that he was beaten that no one bluffed a pat hand to the tune of twenty thousand credits but hed invested so much money already that he felt he had to at least pay to see what the mouse was holding and so he did tossing five more chips onto the table but declining to raise her again she laid out her full house three nines and a pair of queens and he folded his flush tossed it face down on the table and with a nod indicated that she had won the hand that was very bold of you matching my opening bet while you were sitting there with just a pair of nines or was it queens remarked king tout the mouse allowed herself the luxury of a smile nice try king tout she said but if you want to know what i bet with itll cost you another twenty thousand he matched her smile with his own grin i think i can live in ignorance she purposely lost five and seven thousand credits on the next two hands then struck again and won a fifty thousand credit pot most of the money coming from king tout that set the pattern for the next ninety minutes within an hour the other players had all quit and it was just her against king tout she never folded a poor hand at the beginning but always lost just enough to encourage him to keep trying her and then when penelope stared at her solitaire game seemingly oblivious to the rest of the world the mouse would invariably win the larger pots finally king tout pushed his chair back youre quitting asked the mouse politely i know when the cards are running against me he said will you be back here again tomorrow night i imagine so she answered deciding that whether she bought a ship or an extension of the forever kids services or both she was going to need more money ill be back he promised getting to his feet offering her a low courtly bow and walking out the door it wont do him much good will it said a low voice at her side she turned and found herself staring at the iceman who had seated himself next to her i dont know what you mean i mean that my protection doesnt extend to people who cheat my customers not even you its hardly my fault if he doesnt know how to bet his cards said the mouse defensively would he have known how to bet them if the little girl had stayed in her room replied the iceman he paused you may not know it but youve made yourself a powerful enemy tonight ive had enemies before your courage does you no credit said the iceman its the result of ignorance he paused if i were you id quit while i was ahead i need the money if im ever going to get off this dirtball if i were you id find some other way to make it i can get what i need in one more night she said will you extend your protection for forty more hours he paused considering her request ill let you know he said getting up and walking away as soon as he left the table penelope got up and approached the mouse did i do good whispered the little girl you did great the mouse assured her do you think you can do it again tomorrow i suppose so said penelope you suppose so repeated the mouse what does that mean just that i cant see that far ahead the mouse relaxed youll be just fine partner she said tousling penelopes blonde hair now let me cash in my chips and then lets go to bed she summoned the banker converted her chips into cash and then taking penelope by the hand she began winding her way in and out of the tables and walking to the door with the forever kid following a few paces behind had a good night i see said the kid when they were out in the street yes i did got enough money to leave now or are we going to stick around i want to play one more night answered the mouse good she stopped and looked at him curiously why should you care one way or the other because that was king tout you beat tonight said the forever kid hell be back with more money i hope she said trying to ignore a growing feeling of uneasiness if youre lucky and if im not asked the mouse the forever kids eyes brightened with anticipation then ive got a feeling ill be lucky he said the mouse slept late the next morning and spent most of the day loafing in her room and watching the holovision with penelope who was willing to watch the umpteenth rerun of anything as long as she didnt have to do it alone she had their meals sent to their room and at sunset she took a long shower dressed in a new outfit she had bought during a brief tour of end of the lines shops and which was still dull in comparison to those she knew she would see at the casino and spent a few minutes brushing penelopes ragged hair and giving her some lastsecond instructions then accompanied by the little girl she descended to the street and walked the short distance to the tavern and casino the iceman was waiting for her as she had suspected he would be he stopped her before she could walk across to the table where king tout dressed even more splendidly that the previous evening his tiny alien bird again perched on his shoulder was dealing cards to a trio of men whose bluetinted skin proclaimed them to be some of the mutated colonists from kakkab kastu iv the mouse spotted the forever kid sitting by himself at a table that was midway between the tavern and casino areas then turned to penelope go and sit with the kid she said penelope nodded stopped by the bar to borrow a deck of cards allowed the bartender to fill an elegant cocktail glass with fruit juice then joined the forever kid at his table the mouse turned to face the iceman whats your decision carlos if you insist on using the little girl im withdrawing my protection ive got to have more money said the mouse ill have to count on my other protector him said the iceman jerking his head in the forever kids direction forget about it he couldnt protect you for five seconds in here hes managed to protect people for more than two centuries said the mouse the iceman shook his head hes been killing people for more than two centuries theres a difference and the only reason hes still alive is because he protects himself first and his clients second the iceman looked around the bar and the casino there are six men and three women here each of whom is pretty damned good as his job any of them would kill you and steal the child the second my protection was lifted even the forever kid cant save you from all of them the mouse surveyed the interior of the building trying to spot the nine people in question two or three she knew from their holographs another from his weapons but she realized that more than half of them were unknown to her its your decision said the iceman you do what you think best he paused but remember what i said if you use the little girl against king tout im just then a man and an alien entered the end of the line and the iceman frowned what is it asked the mouse anxiously nothing said the iceman dont tell me its nothing carlos she admonished him ive seen that expression before he turned to her you know what i told you about not using the girl yes forget it he nodded his head almost imperceptibly toward the two newcomers your friend just evened the odds she turned until she could just see them out of the corner of her eye who are they she asked the man is called the golden duke ever hear of him she shook her head well take a good look at him said the iceman softly and if you ever see him anywhere but on last chance run like hell a killer she asked a little bit of everything replied the iceman staring at the tall almost skeletal human the golden duke obviously possessed some oriental ancestry which was apparent in the shape of his eyes the tint of his skin the prominence of his cheekbones his straight black hair he moved with the smooth grace of an athlete as if he was prepared to change directions and speeds instantly he carried no weapons but his right arm ended in a prosthetic hand made entirely of gold a hand that hid four lethal retractable knives one in each long lean golden finger hes been known to run drugs back in the democracy continued the iceman and hes also done a bit of arson the golden duke and his companion seated themselves at king touts table and suddenly the other players all seemed to remember that they had pressing engagements elsewhere and made a mass exodus to neighboring tables or the long chrome bar a gambler too asked the mouse not much of one replied the iceman then why is he sitting at the card table i imagine that king tout has invited him to play cards with you but you just said i said he wasnt a gambler the iceman paused if he helps king tout cheat you it isnt gambling is it how do you think theyll try to cheat asked the mouse theyll probably whipsaw you replied the iceman whipsaw she repeated puzzled theyll have some way of signaling each other which of them has the best hand the other two will drop out early so if you win its a much smaller pot but if you lose youre going to have to pay just as much to see the winning hand because the one holding it will keep raising like theres no tomorrow i see said the mouse she nodded to the alien whos that one her said the iceman looking at the humanoid alien with wideset orange eyes broad nostrils a reddish wig that barely covered her gaping earholes and a body suit that kept recirculating a clear fluid across her torso and legs they call her september morn she is a gambler and a damned good one shes king touts shill on alien worlds he continued to stare at her she doesnt actually breathe the liquid through gills or anything like that but shes got to keep her body moist if that suit stops running water over her for more than a couple of minutes she curls up and dies or at least goes into some kind of catatonic state thats just about the same as being dead how do you know ive seen the suit malfunction on a member of her race answered the iceman not a pretty sight he paused not a pretty smell for that matter they were both silent for a moment and then the mouse turned to him what would happen if king tout tried to kill me at the table youre not even carrying a weapon this is my world i dont need one and he wont try anything but if he did then hed have eleven holes in him before he could aim his pistol you have eleven men watching him twelve answered the iceman i assume one will miss where are they around theyre very wellhidden said the mouse scanning the tavern and casino theyre supposed to be how many are behind that mirror she continued nodding her head toward the huge mirror behind the bar a few its a oneway mirror isnt it the iceman almost smiled they wouldnt be much use to me there if it wasnt would they no i suppose not she answered well she added looking across the room i suppose id better go over to the table and let king tout and his friends do their worst just remember theyre not stupid she smiled with more confidence than she suddenly felt its only money you have something more valuable than money and youre taking a chance on losing it said the iceman glancing across the room at penelope king tout and his friends dont know who or what she is yet but if either of you screw up hell figure it out pretty damned quick were still under your protection she reminded him i thought you were playing to raise money for a ship he replied once you take off from last chance youre on your own she stared at him for a moment looking for some sign of emotion annoyance jealousy anything but finding none then she turned and walked rapidly across the tavern into the casino approached king touts table and seated herself where she could watch penelope without making it too obvious good evening maam said king tout i trust youre ready to give me a chance to win some of my money back if you can said the mouse it looks like a small game tonight said king tout just the four of us suits me said the mouse fine this gentleman on my left is called the duke she smiled politely at the golden duke who stared impassively at her and this charming lady is september the alien called september morn inclined her head slightly and briefly contorted her face into a smile same game as last night asked the mouse thatll be just fine maam said king tout the mouse signaled to the banker who opened the safe and brought a number of thousandcredit chips to the table placing them down in three neat stacks directly in front of her shall we raise the ante to two thousand tonight suggested king tout it sounds like youre in a hurry to get your money back said the mouse he shrugged if youd rather not she stared at him no two thousand is fine if youll get an unopened deck from the bar thats shows a serious lack of trust maam said king tout though he looked unsurprised were playing for a serious amount of money she answered he shrugged then called for a fresh deck he had the mouse open it then shoved two chips to the center of the table and shuffled the cards with an easy precision while the other three players placed their chips atop his the mouse won the first hand then lost three small pots in a row the golden duke seemed totally uninterested in the game dropping out of each hand early and never taking his dark piercing eyes from her september morn played her hands with more skill and more subtlety and won two of the pots then the mouse hit big winning sixty thousand credits when her four jacks beat king touts full house after that the whipsawing began with the golden duke king tout and september morn began taking turns riding out each hand the one with the poorer cards always folded early leaving the other to bet against the mouse the mouse couldnt quite tell how they were signaling each other nor did she particularly care the game went on for another hour the mouse gradually accumulating more money until at last as the deal came around to king tout once more he stopped shuffling and stared at her for a long moment youre a very lucky card player maam he said at last maybe im just talented she replied he shook his head no id have to say that youre lucky she shrugged have it your way im lucky very lucky are you accusing me of cheating asked the mouse i would never accuse you of cheating without knowing how you did it you know it doesnt sound any better that way how could you be cheating asked king tout with an expression that belied his words why if my friend the duke thought for even a moment that you were cheating hed cut your heart out right here at the table if theres one thing the duke hates its a cheater yeah well your friend the duke could use some lessons in poker said the mouse pokers not really his specialty said king tout meaningfully the mouse looked briefly at the golden duke i can believe that she pushed her chair back this is becoming rather unpleasant she announced i think ive had enough for tonight how much have you got in your pile there asked king tout i dont know said the mouse king tout stared at her chips looks to be about two hundred thousand if you say so ill tell you what maam said king tout ill cut you for it for the whole pot he nodded the mouse took a quick glance in penelopes direction but the little girl was seemingly involved in her solitaire game which makes sense decided the mouse she cant tell me if ill win or lose until i decide whether or not ill even agree to play what if i declined asked the mouse respectfully of course i think my friend the duke would take it as a personal insult answered king tout the mouse returned his smile my friend the iceman might not like that then lets leave our friends out of it said king tout lets make it just you and me well cut for the whole pot he pulled an unopened deck out of his pocket and well use a fresh deck i kind of liked the one we were playing with for this kind of money we should use a brand new deck the mouse considered asking him to get a deck from the bar but decided to look at penelope first she saw no negative signal and she finally nodded her agreement okay she said you match what ive got here and well cut just once for it she paused if you lose you lose we dont go double or nothing you could keep that up all night until you finally won agreed said king tout he broke open the deck and shuffled the cards then placed them on the table be my guest he said you go first she replied id really prefer that you cut first she shook her head its my money if you want a chance at it you cut first as you wish he said his hand reached out caressed the deck swiftly and then cut to a king the mouse looked at penelope who seemed oblivious to anything but her solitaire game finally mouse cleared her throat reached out paused hesitantly for a moment and placed her fingers carefully on the sides of the deck and then penelope spilled her glass of fruit juice and made a distracting clatter as she jumped back from the table to avoid getting it on her clothes are you all right asked the mouse her hand once more poised above the deck im sorry said penelope starting to wipe her table with a napkin i was just clumsy are you mad at me no of course not said the mouse maam said king tout impatiently were waiting on you the mouse stared at the deck then took a deep breath and cut the cards and came away with an ace my congratulations maam said king tout getting to his feet and bowing deeply i guess tonight just wasnt my night september morn also arose but the golden duke remained seated still staring impassively at her finally when king tout and the alien reached the door he stood up and walked silently after them as she had the previous evening penelope walked over and joined the mouse while the forever kid remained at his table well we did it whispered the mouse trying to control her excitement and elation what was that business with the spilled glass i saw that if you cut the cards youd draw a three so i tried to see how to change it explained penelope if i shrieked and you looked up youd draw a jack and if i did other things youd draw other cards but i saw that if i spilled the juice youd draw an ace it all depended on how startled you were and how much you moved your hand remarkable said the mouse just remarkable she summoned the banker changed her chips into credits and carried the cash over to the forever kid here she said handing him the money you can probably protect this better than i can the kid placed the wad of bills inside his tunic why the long face asked the mouse i won i can afford you for another week or two they just walked out said the kid unhappily what did you expect them to do i know what i wanted them to do he replied ive heard about the golden duke i never thought hed walk away from a fight he shook his head in abject disappointment look im sorry you didnt get to die on this godforsaken planet said the mouse with false sympathy but look at the bright side youll have two more weeks of opportunities to toss your life away in the meantime do you mind taking penelope back to the hotel im supposed to be keeping an eye on both of you noted the forever kid ill be all right said the mouse besides everyone just saw me give you the money dont get your hopes up too high but if anyones going to be in danger itll be you that seemed to raise the kids spirits but penelope suddenly looked unhappy cant i stay with you she asked the mouse shook her head i have to talk to the iceman im not afraid of him i know said the mouse with a smile but i have a feeling that hes afraid of you him said penelope unbelievingly him repeated the mouse now go on over to the hotel ill join you in a few minutes the kid got to his feet took penelope by the hand and walked unhappily into the cool night air the mouse saw the iceman staring at her as he leaned against the long bar she beckoned him to join her with a motion of her head and he carried his drink past half a dozen gaudilydressed miners and traders giving a wide birth to the huge alien torqual who seemed to have no interest in drinking either whiskey or any of the exotic alien concoctions but insisted on standing at the bar anyway a striking redheaded woman stopped the iceman to whisper something to him he looked across the tavern seemed to consider whatever it was he had heard then nodded his head and without another look at the woman walked the rest of the way to the mouses table you won a lot of money tonight he noted seating himself and placing his drink in front of him would you like me to keep it for you until you need it the forever kid wont let anyone take it away from him she replied and im going to need it tomorrow morning oh she nodded i need to buy a ship i thought the forever kid had a ship he does but i cant keep paying him credits a week sooner or later im going to need my own probably sooner how big big enough for three people said the mouse no make that four in case the kids still with us when we join up with merlin the iceman arched an eyebrow at the mention of merlins name but didnt ask any questions about him well said the mouse well what can i get a ship tomorrow go over to the hangar they usually have a few for sale or if not theyll know where you can get one the iceman paused youre definitely leaving tomorrow she nodded too many people know shes here already the longer i wait the more of them well have chasing us when we finally leave now that i have the money theres no reason to stay shes in no danger said the iceman are you kidding she demanded look around you not everyone is here just to drink your booze and play at your tables youre in plenty of danger replied the iceman gazing casually at a pair of bounty hunters who were pretending that they had no interest in the mouse but you still dont seem to know what youre traveling with im traveling with the best damned gambling partner anyone ever dreamed of the iceman shrugged and took a sip of his drink do what you want its none of my business i dont know why you persist in thinking of her as dangerous continued the mouse i keep telling you shes just a very tired very frightened little girl a little girl who has had professionals looking for her for the better part of a year and whos still free said the iceman doesnt that suggest something to you the house banker caught the icemans eye made some brief signal with his hand and the iceman shook his head a moment later the banker was explaining to an annoyed customer that new kenya shillings were not acceptable currency on last chance she was an aliens prisoner when i found her answered the mouse i told you that is she an aliens prisoner now no shes just damned lucky that i found her do you make a practice of entering the alien sections when youre looting a hotel asked the iceman no how many rooms were there in that hotel he continued i dont know a few hundred probably havent you wondered how you wound up in the one alien room where she happened to be i told you how it happened said the mouse irritably i know how it happened you havent changed at all carlos you never trusted anyone or anything maybe thats why im still alive he paused but let me give you one piece of advice what dont ever get her mad at you im the only friend shes got she didnt do that badly when she had no friends at all he noted what would you have me do demanded the mouse desert her return her to your friend the iceman stared at her for a long moment if it was me he said at last i think id kill her while i had the chance she stared at him for a long moment no she said distastefully you havent changed she got up and walked out the door then crossed the street and entered her hotel she got on the airlift ordered it to elevate her to her floor then rode the corridor to her door just as she turned the corner leading to her room she found herself face to face with the golden duke he held a sonic weapon in his hand and silently directed her into a darkened room three doors down from her own lights commanded a low voice and suddenly the room was bathed in illumination good evening maam said king tout as the golden duke stationed himself in front of the door she looked around desperately silently cursing her stupidity for not keeping penelope with her and saw september morn smiling at her from her position by the rooms only window what do you want demanded the mouse if its money i dont have it with me oh well get around to talking money in a while maam said king tout right now i think id like to talk about luck luck repeated the mouse luck he stepped forward and pointed to a small scar above his temple do you see this maam the mouse nodded but said nothing do you know what it is no its a surgical scar somebody you tried to whipsaw shot you in the head he chuckled no maam im afraid not suddenly his smile vanished its where i had a silicon bubble implanted a steinmetz harding bubble should that mean something to me its the most powerful mathematics bubble ever invented explained king tout i can do eleven million calculations before the card you see registers on your retina he paused do you see my left eye maam it looks just like the right one answered the mouse its supposed to but its artificial maam it can see into the infrared spectrum just as this artificial digit he raised the index finger of his left hand can produce a mark that can only be seen by this eye he paused again thats why i know you were lucky these last two nights maam do you know how lucky why dont you tell me said the mouse well in the beginning i had a ninetoone chance of winning just because of the bubble but when i started losing i started cheating by the end of the evening youd beaten odds of more than six thousand to one that was impressive enough but tonight he continued tonight i was dealing seconds and we were whipsawing you and i knew i was going to cut to a king because i marked it when i opened the deck the precise odds of your coming out ahead tonight maam were to one he paused again thats so lucky its almost unbelievable so youll have to forgive me if i dont believe it the mouse made no reply and king tout continued speaking you know maam for almost two nights i couldnt figure out how you were doing it i know you couldnt read the cards because you dont have an eye that can see into the infrared spectrum and even if you did you couldnt have broken my code i knew you didnt have a collaborator because there was no one else at the table and i knew there was no way you could know what was in my hand because on two occasions i didnt even look myself get to the point said the mouse the point repeated king tout the point is that i couldnt figure out how you were cheating me so i decided to make you cut the deck with me and i decided to pick a king and then i watched to see what happened next what happened was that i drew an ace in case its slipped your memory oh i knew youd draw the ace maam said king tout it never crossed my mind that you might not no i was looking to see what happened before you drew it nothing happened not quite nothing he corrected her the little girl happened he paused at first i thought she must be a telepath but then i got to thinking and i realized that a telepath couldnt know where the ace was or read my hand when i myself hadnt looked at it and didnt know what was in it and then i remembered hearing stories about a little girl that everyone seems to want he stared at the mouse shes the bailey girl isnt she dont be ridiculous said the mouse shes my daughter duke said king tout and four thin blades slid out of the fingers of the golden dukes prosthetic right hand now maam im going to ask you one more time and if you lie to me my friend is going to gut you like a fish do you understand you go to hell said the mouse im sure thats where were all going maam said king tout now is she the bailey girl or not dont yelled a small voice on the other side of the door king tout and the golden duke froze for a moment then the gambler motioned the golden duke to pull the mouse into a corner took a small laser pistol out of his pocket and ordered the door to open dont hurt her said penelope shes my best friend do come in young lady said king tout stepping aside and allowing the girl to run to the mouses side you shouldnt have done that said the mouse he was bluffing penelope shook her head in every future i could see you didnt tell him and the golden duke killed you so thats how it works said king tout with a smile just as easy as that you see a million futures and choose the one you like best its not that easy answered penelope if it worked like that youd never have surprised me here said the mouse ah but she was in her room far away from you maam or ive no doubt youd be back at the tavern begging the iceman for help hes watching you right this minute said the mouse oh i very much doubt it said king tout my friend september managed to find all of his holo feedlines its one of her talents shes attracted to power any kind of power electrical conductive nuclear and my friend the duke cut the lines then hell know that somethings going on here that you dont want him to see just how clumsy do you think i am maam asked king tout right now his security people are watching holos of an empty room which my friend september rigged before the duke went to work hell find out oh im sure he will agreed king tout but not before were all long gone i wouldnt be too sure of that if i were you said a youthful voice from the stillopen doorway and they all turned to see the forever kid standing there his fingertips poised lightly on the holster of his sonic pistol i know who you are said king tout i know who you are too said the forever kid this doesnt concern you just be on your way and no one will get hurt just follow your two friends out into the hall or a lot of people are going to get hurt responded the kid his eyes alive with excitement for the first time since the mouse had known him were not looking for a fight said king tout sometimes you cant always have what you want replied the kid let me take him said the golden duke his face absolutely expressionless as he stared at his antagonist you can try said the kid his hand tensing no screamed penelope suddenly all the participants froze for an instant what is it asked the mouse i dont want you to die sobbed penelope im not going to die if the forever kid draws his gun no matter what happens youll die and i cant change it wept the girl well said king tout still looking at the kid kid youd better leave said the mouse at last but i can take these three he protested nobody said you couldnt answered the mouse trying to steady her voice but even if you do im going to catch a laser beam or a sonic blast she stared at him please kid the kid stared at the golden duke for another moment then slowly backed out of the room and rode the corridor to the end of the hall where he disappeared around a corner very wise of you maam said king tout im not ready to die yet said the mouse nobodys ever really ready to die he agreed then release us and the iceman wont kill you said the mouse hes not like the forever kid i cant call him off why dont you let me worry about the iceman said king tout he hasnt left the planet in five years hes not about to start now he paused however you and the girl are youll never live to collect the reward for her said the mouse i know this may come as a shock to you said king tout but i have absolutely no interest in any reward sure you dont really the reward is a single finite amount whereas the possibilities involved in using this little girl are infinite do you know how much i can win at some of the democracys larger casinos with her help ill never help you said penelope of course you will my dear said king tout pleasantly you cant make me no matter what you do to me youre a rare treasure my dear said king tout i would never dream of hurting you he suddenly put an arm around the mouse but i have absolutely no objection to hurting her no said penelope shes my only friend leave her alone and ill go with you oh i couldnt to that my dear now that i understand what you are i would never dream of taking you without some means of controlling you sooner or later youd find some way to escape or perhaps even kill me but if you know that ill have the duke kill your friend the first time you disobey me then i think we can have a long and happy relationship he smiled youre very young my child when youre older im sure youll be able to appreciate my point of view lets go said the golden duke holding his claws to the mouses throat and preparing to step out into the hall not just yet said king tout what now demanded the golden duke blindfold and gag the little girl why shes no problem king tout sighed im glad at least one of us is using his head in this endeavor he signaled september morn to begin binding penelopes eyes you may have forgotten it already but there happens to be a very disgruntled killer out there in the corridors waiting for us as long as the mouse thinks she will be killed she wont order him to attack now what do you suppose will happen if the little girl can see a future in which only we three will be killed a light of dawning comprehension spread across the golden dukes features right continued king tout so if she cant tell them they wont take the chance he checked penelopes blindfold good now the gag the alien placed a crumpled handkerchief into the girls mouth then bound it shut all right said king tout surveying his captives i do believe were ready to go he turned to the mouse maam if youd be so kind tell your friend not to molest us kid yelled the mouse if youre still out there let us pass she paused remember youre still working for me thats an order there was no answer kid said the mouse i mean it then the little party entered the corridor the golden dukes blades resting gently on the mouses throat she halfexpected to run into the forever kid at every turn of the corridor or perhaps in the lobby or even at the hangar but within ten minutes they were aboard the gamblers ship and in another five last chance was so far behind them that it didnt even register on the viewscreen the end of the line tavern was closed for the night when the forever kid arrived he pounded on the door and a moment later the interior of the building was bathed in light and the iceman spoke the sevendigit code that unlocked the ornate door ive been looking for you said the forever kid ominously you found me why cant i get clearance to take off from last chance demanded the kid walking into the tavern i wanted to talk to you first said the iceman care for a drink im in a hurry theyll keep said the iceman if king tout had wanted his money back hed have sent the golden duke after you he wanted the little girl he paused she and the mouse are safe for the time being you know theyre gone the iceman almost smiled not much happens on my world that i dont know about why didnt you stop them asked the kid i seem to remember that they were under your protection and i seemed to remember that you were being paid to protect them responded the iceman it looks like neither of us did a very good job he walked across the empty room to the bar where he pulled out an oddlyshaped bottle and two glasses you sure i cant offer you a drink the kid shook his head just give me clearance to leave im still working for them this time the iceman actually smiled you couldnt care less about them he said bluntly the kid made no answer and he continued you just want to take on the golden duke the kid considered the icemans statement for a moment then shrugged what difference does it make he replied not bothering to deny it the result will be the same ill kill him and free them i have no objection to that said the iceman filling his glass with a blue liquid then why havent i been cleared to leave because i thought you might like to come with me you thought wrong the iceman downed his drink my ships faster and more comfortable than yours i work alone i know where king tout will be going the kid was unimpressed ill find him a man like that doesnt stay hidden for long youre only on salary for a day or two more continued the iceman he paused come to work for me and ill double whatever the mouse was paying you the forever kid returned his stare and paused before speaking whats your interest in this he finally asked you dont exactly strike me as the philanthropic type i own this world answered the iceman i rule it as surely as any king ever ruled his domain back on earth i passed the word that they were to be left alone and king tout disobeyed me he poured another drink and downed it in a single swallow if i let him get away with it i wont even rule this barroom next year and thats it asked the kid most of it replied the iceman you look amused thats because you dont care any more about them than i do said the kid youre going to protect your reputation and im going because i want to take on the golden duke he paused i find that amusing ah well heroes are hard to come by these days said the iceman with fine irony out here you take what you can get and what theyve got is us how many of your men are you taking along none the forever kid arched an eyebrow but said nothing ill hire anyone i need once we get to where were going added the iceman they say you used to be quite a killer yourself said the kid they say a lot of things replied the iceman not all of them are true not all of them are lies either the iceman stared out the door into the night for a moment it was true once he said at last then i found that it was easier to hire people who were more eager than i was eager to kill the iceman shook his head eager to die he placed the bottle back behind the bar ready to go what about my ship asked the kid leave it here if you come back in one piece ill wave the storage charges if you dont you wont need it anyway and the mouses money continued the kid patting the wad of bills beneath his shirt take it along she wont be coming back here whatever happens to you or the girl it took the kid less than five minutes to gather his belongings and stuff them into a single small bag that he slung over his shoulder and five minutes after that he and the iceman were aboard the latters ship breaking out of orbit and heading toward the more populated worlds of the inner frontier on the outskirts of mankinds sprawling democracy they slept as the ships computer kept them on course then awoke some time later and ate breakfast in total silence as the iceman poured himself a cup of coffee he looked at the youthful figure sitting across the galley from him youre not the most talkative man ive ever met he said dryly you live for a couple of centuries and youll find out that youve said just about everything you want to say answered the kid i suppose so said the iceman nodding thoughtfully i do have a question or two for you said the forever kid but they can wait ask away might be better not to were going to be stuck on this ship for a few days no sense getting mad at each other i dont get mad anymore said the iceman you aint chasing king tout just for the fun of it observed the kid im chasing him to teach him an object lesson that no one can disobey me on last chance but im not angry this is simply business and of course you wouldnt mind too much if he kills the little girl would you what makes you think so i got eyes and ears i use em the iceman paused he wont kill her he said at last ignoring the forever kids question when he wins enough or someone figures out what hes doing he might not a chance you think not said the kid he and the golden duke never struck me as compassionate its got nothing to do with compassion answered the iceman then why do you think he wont kill her the iceman paused because she wont let him he said at last the kid paused thoughtfully shes really got you worried doesnt she no replied the iceman just concerned well dont get too concerned said the kid im still being paid to defend her im paying you now said the iceman youll do what i tell you to not for two more days said the kid and i wouldnt give too many orders if i were you i dont kill children hired killers kill whoever theyre paid to kill said the iceman however he added no one is going to kill this child not king tout not the golden duke not you not anyone he paused again penelope bailey doesnt need your help im paying you to help me free the mouse and to make sure everyone understands what happens when someone disobeys my orders on my world mind if i ask another question said the kid after a momentary silence go ahead why are you so hot to rescue the mouse according to her the last time she needed help you left her to rot in a jail on msalli iv the situations different this time when i sent her to msalli iv we were both working for the government on a secret mission she could have turned the assignment down she knew the odds and she knew that if she was caught the political and military situation there meant there could be no rescue attempt he paused once they caught her that was that i was under orders not to mount a rescue mission i got the impression you two were pretty close back then we were but not close enough to disobey orders i guess we were nearing a political solution to our problems if id have tried to break her out id have lost a lot of good men and women and probably precipitated a war you got your war anyway said the forever kid i showed up just a little too late to hire out as a mercenary yeah we got our war anyway acknowledged the iceman with a sigh but at least i wasnt the cause of it the kid refilled his coffee cup and stirred it idly why did she agree to take the assignment if the odds were stacked against her he asked for the same reason shes king touts prisoner right now the kid frowned i dont think i follow you the mouse was the best thief i ever knew said the iceman there was no building she couldnt scale no room she couldnt break into no situation she couldnt bluff her way out of cool head quick mind nerves of steel thats why i recruited her he paused but she had a flaw she still has it for that matter the kid seemed to consider this then finally shrugged what is it to borrow a line from shakespeare she loves not wisely but too well she didnt go to msalli iv because she thought she could do the job she went because she loved me and i asked her to and now shes decided to be a mother to the bailey girl and shes in the throes of another kind of love and shes in trouble again he shook his head sadly she lets her emotions cloud her judgment its going to get her killed one of these days well get her out of this in one piece said the forever kid confidently we may not be in the hero business but were sure as hell in the rescue business first things first replied the iceman were in the punishing business but you dont mind if we rescue her somewhere along the way asked the kid amused im not even sure who she most needs rescuing from said the iceman grimly they fell silent then the iceman immersed in his own thoughts and memories the forever kid simply tired of talking as the ship continued to speed through the inner frontier suddenly penelope sat up in her bunk hes coming she whispered frightened whos coming asked the mouse apprehensively staring at the locked door to their quarters the iceman hes here on this ship penelope shook her head but hes coming you must be mistaken said the mouse he never leaves last chance hes coming to kill king tout and the golden duke said penelope with absolute conviction and maybe me you think the iceman will kill you he thinks im a bad person said penelope she turned to the mouse why does he hate me the mouse climbed down from the upper bunk sat down next to the little girl and put a reassuring arm around around her he doesnt love or hate anyone she explained hes too detached to feel anything for anybody the forever kid is with him said penelope maybe hell save us from the iceman youve got it all wrong penelope said the mouse if theyre together theyre coming to save us from king tout and his friends penelope saw the icemans cold remote face in her minds eye and shuddered id rather stay with king tout the iceman wont hurt you said the mouse soothingly i promise you youre wrong said the little girl of all the man who are hunting me hes the one who can hurt me how do you know i just know suddenly a tear rolled down her face i miss jennifer i wish we hadnt left her behind we didnt have any choice said the mouse but shes all alone there back at the hotel if she was with us shed be a prisoner the mouse pointed out shes better off where she is but she was my first friend and now ill never see her again shell never really be gone as long as you remember her said the mouse i want her to be with me though said penelope sometimes you have to say goodbye to someone you love answered the mouse its part of growing up does everybody leave someone they love behind when they grow up asked the little girl almost everybody she paused sometimes they get left behind themselves i suppose it comes to the same thing in the end but jennifer likes to be talked to persisted penelope what if the maids just put her in a closet im sure theyll give jennifer to some lonely little girl who needs a first friend said the mouse really asked penelope brightening somewhat im sure of it i hope so suddenly the mouse smiled how would you like to sleep in the upper bunk do you mean it asked penelope sure id like it very much the mouse hugged the little girl then lifted her to the higher bunk and began examining her surroundings for the hundredth time the walls ceiling and floor of their small cabin were composed of a titanium alloy and were a dull battleship gray the two bunks were bolted to the bulkhead the cabins computer lock had been disabled and the door was now bolted from the outside the tiny lavatory consisted of a dryshower a chemical toilet and a drysink the ventilation shafts were far too small for any human even the mouse to crawl through there was no viewport no vidscreen no intercom the mouse paced the floor for a few moments looking for a weak spot but to no avail if there was a means of escape even a remote possibility of escape she was sure shed have spotted it by now still she went over every inch of the cabin methodically pretending she hadnt already done so two dozen times already and finally she returned to the lower bunk a few minutes later she heard the bolt move and then september morn entered their cabin with two trays dinner said the alien handing a tray to each of her prisoners how much longer before we arrive asked the mouse the aliens face contorted in its grotesque parody of a human smile if i tell you that you might guess where were going what difference does it make said the mouse who do you think were going to tell you no one she glanced at penelope her who knows shes not a telepath you say she reads the future i say she reads our minds whats the difference the difference is that she cant communicate telepathically with anyone so you might as well tell us where were going september morn smiled again if i dont tell you theres no difference if i do tell you and she is a telepath there might be a very big difference but i cant read minds or send messages protested penelope you would say that regardless replied september morn and with that she walked out of the room and bolted the door again as it slid shut behind her i dont like the sound of that said the mouse of what asked penelope if they think youre a telepath they might demand that you read a mind or send a thought for them and if you explain that you cant do it and they dont believe you we could be in for a lot of trouble were already in a lot of trouble said penelope picking unenthusiastically at her food as jails go ive seen worse said the mouse inspecting her own tray and starting to eat an exotic salad made of vegetables from half a dozen different alien worlds what was the alien one like asked penelope the one where the iceman deserted you not very pleasant was it cold and dark and damp asked penelope with a childs innocent enthusiasm the mouse paused as if remembering it was dark she said but not cold actually it felt more like an oven msalli iv is a very warm world did they torture you the mouse shook her head not so youd notice it they just threw me in a cell and left me there sometimes they remembered to feed me sometimes they didnt how long were you sentenced for the mouse smiled wryly the klai thats the race that lives there dont operate like that when youre found guilty of something they toss you into jail and when you die they bury you she paused i almost died from their water a couple of times diseases arent supposed to be crossspecies but i guess enough filth will make anyone sick and that was the filthiest water i ever saw did they give you a doctor to make you well eventually that was how i escaped tell me about it said penelope eagerly did you kill the doctor with one of his surgical instruments the mouse smiled youve never seen a klai have you theyre about eight feet tall and perhaps pounds with skin like armor stabbing or shooting one of them would just make him angry then what did you do persisted the girl i pretended to be sicker and weaker than i was and after a couple of days when i felt strong enough and they werent watching as closely as they should have i sneaked out of my room and found an air shaft leading to the subbasement i spent three days hiding there following various passages until i found a sewage tunnel the led to a drainage ditch almost half a mile beyond the prison how did you get off the planet two days after i escaped the democracy invaded it and i just presented myself to one of our military units they transferred me to the flagship questioned me until they were convinced that i was who i said i was and then transported me to the nearest human world penelope shifted her position on her bunk so that she could see the mouse better why didnt the iceman try to rescue you i used to wonder a lot about that admitted the mouse i couldnt figure out why he cared more about his orders than he cared about me she shrugged then one day i realized that he would never send someone he cared for into that situation and finally it made sense penelopes eyes narrowed i dont like him well there are people im more fond of myself agreed the mouse dryly why is he coming after us asked penelope deciding she didnt like her meal and pushing her tray aside he doesnt like you and he hates me he has a reason for everything he does answered the mouse my guess is that hes going to let the forever kid kill king tout and his friends just to prove that no one can get away with disobeying his orders on last chance she paused can the kid beat all three of them penelope shrugged i dont know he was about to try at our hotel what did you see then in some futures he won in some he didnt but in all of them you were killed the golden duke must be pretty good at his trade oh he always killed the golden duke said penelope but in some futures september morn killed him i didnt even notice her carrying a weapon said the mouse what does she use and where does she hide it there were so many futures and everything happened so fast said penelope helplessly i cant remember but shes the dangerous one i dont know maybe it was because the forever kid was concentrating on the golden duke oh well sighed the mouse well just have to hope that the kid is up to it what if he isnt then carlos will find another way to kill them can he he was one of the best in his day but thats not the way he operates any more still she concluded once he sets his mind on something he usually gets what he wants what if he wants me dead asked penelope then hell have to kill me first promised the mouse and he wont do that why not if he doesnt care about you because i know how his mind works he hates waste and killing me would serve no purpose it would if you were protecting me hed try to find a way around me said the mouse take my word for it how would he do that i dont know the mouse noted the genuine fear on penelopes face and reached up to hold the childs hand dont worry its a moot point hes coming to rescue us not harm us i hope youre right dont you know penelope shook her head not yet its too far off well believe me im not going to let anyone harm you penelope suddenly climbed down from her own bunk to the mouses and threw her arms around her youre my best friend my only friend she amended i want us to be together always youre my best friend too said the mouse suddenly penelope straightened up what is it asked the mouse we just changed course i didnt feel anything how can you tell i just know do you know where were heading penelope squinted and peered into space as if trying to read a sign within her mind the starboat she said at last the starboat repeated the mouse what is it its a huge ship thats orbiting a red world how huge its got lots of cabins and big rooms like the one the iceman owned you mean taverns those too casinos penelope nodded rooms where they play cards and games like that do you know the name of the red world no suddenly penelope smiled but i know something else what i know that theres a man on the starboat who can help us who i dont know his name but hes dressed in very bright colors and hes very tall and he had a beard is he a killer asked the mouse a bounty hunter i dont think so how will he help us i dont know yet said penelope but once were at the starboat ill know how if he figures out youre helping to cheat him he might kill us all penelope shook her head firmly no i dont know what hell do but i know he wont hurt us hell help both of us not just you yes youre absolutely sure i would never leave without you penelope assured her can carlos catch up with us before we reach the starboat no then weve got a decision to make said the mouse this man will help us insisted penelope will he kill king tout or the others i dont know can you see if king tout will come after us again no no he wont or no you cant see i cant see that far the mouse sighed deeply i just dont know she said at least if carlos and the kid catch up with us we know they wont leave until king tout and his friends are dead i dont want the iceman to catch up with us said penelope her fear reflected on her face once again the mouse studied the little girls face intently and youre sure this man will help us she asked at last not just try but succeed i think so but youre not sure i will be before i let him know that we need his help once he knows hed better act fast said the mouse or youre going to be minus a best friend king tout will only hurt you if i disobey him said penelope with absolute conviction once i find someone to help me hell be much more worried about his own skin you can see that too penelope smiled not in the future i know it because king tout is so simple to understand he is the little girl nodded hes no smarter than jennifer was she said and the mouse noted a certain contempt in her voice that had never been there previously he was smart enough to capture us replied the mouse watching penelope closely for a reaction i couldnt see far enough ahead next week or next month ill be able to she hugged the mouse again they think they can hurt you but i wont let them she paused thoughtfully then added theyre very foolish men king tout and the golden duke suddenly a look of childish fury crossed her face and theyll be sorry they made me leave jennifer behind the mouse looked at her for a moment startled and then just as quickly as it had appeared the almost alien expression of rage vanished from penelopes face i love you mouse she said the mouse embraced her and i love you too penelope and if they try to hurt you she continued something bad will happen to them like what asked the mouse oh i dont know said penelope with a shrug just something the starboat was the most impressive and elegant space station on the inner frontier hundreds of ships some small some incredibly large were docked along its sleek shining hull in fact the hull itself was the first thing to capture a visitors attention for it proclaimed the stations name in foothigh letters that blazed like a million tiny suns and it was visible to approaching ships that were still thousands of miles away the interior lived up to the hulls glittering promise there were restaurants bars nightclubs and a dozen immense public gambling rooms as well as some very private rooms for highstakes games games that even king tout couldnt afford men in formal dress women in very little dress at all aliens in exotic attire all moved discreetly from table to table from game to game offering drinks drugs an assortment of alien tobaccos and gaming chips the tables themselves were divided almost evenly between human and alien games and not surprisingly the jaded human customers clustered around of the more popular alien games losing tens of thousands of credits at a time at games such as jabob so complex that it took years to learn while the score or more of alien races canphorites domarians lodinites even a pair of methanebreathing atrians in their frigid protective suits lost just as heavily at poker blackjack and roulette there was no form of wager one couldnt make aboard the starboat one huge room housing hundreds of computer and video screens offered uptotheminute news and odds on sporting events all across the democracy while another posted odds and results of the tens of thousands of elections that occurred daily for major and minor political offices on the democracys fifty thousand worlds a third room was devoted to an endless series of trivia games which were making their hundredth or so reappearance in a galaxy where man had grown out of touch with his origins and constantly sought to relearn them the golden duke had been left behind to keep an eye on the mouse or more specifically to punish her if penelope refused to make her talents available to her captors and king tout had taken september morn and the little girl with him aboard the starboat they were scanned very briefly and very thoroughly at the entrance then king tout walked up to one of the many cashiers windows established a line of credit and took a quick tour of the gaming rooms finally he found a table no different than any other that seemed to appeal to him and he gestured september morn to take one of the empty seats at it then he leaned over and whispered to penelope you remember the signals we talked about she nodded i touch my left ear when youre going to win and my right ear when september has the best hand thats right my child he said and do you remember what will happen to your friend if you give me the wrong signal even once i remember said penelope she looked around the room where do you want me to sit come with me said king tout leading her to a long bar that lined the back wall he lifted her up onto an exoticlooking stool and summoned the bartender an orangeskinned belonian do you have something nonalcoholic for the young lady to drink he asked pleasantly we have a wide selection said the belonian into its translating device king tout slipped a wad of new stalin ruples out of his pocket and laid them on the bar give her whatever she wants and make sure that nobody bothers her the belonian flashed its purple teeth in its version of a happy smile and picked up the money it will be my pleasure sir it replied king tout turned to penelope i dont want you moving away from here do you understand i understand said the girl i hope so my child or it will go very hard on your friend penelope stared at him but said nothing and a moment later he walked back to the table and seated himself where he had a clear view of the girl the belonian brought penelope a selection of three fruitflavored drinks and she chose the one in the most elaborate container a sparkling crystal that was shaped like the horn of some ancient animal a moment later the first hand was dealt and she casually raised her hand to her right ear king tout smiled his opponents thought he was smiling at some remark one of them had made and kept betting and raising until everyone except september morn had dropped out then tossed his cards in without showing them when she displayed a full house of aces and jacks her captors lost the next two hands and then penelope touched her left ear signaling a win by king tout this time it was september morn who kept betting and raising until all but one player was driven out and then she folded and allowed king tout to continue betting on his own they continued in this manner for another half hour they didnt always raise each other when king tout knew they were holding winning hands and they didnt always drop out early when he knew they were destined to lose but they gradually accumulated most of the money at the table a couple of the players a canphorite and a human decided that theyd had enough and were replaced by two others both human this time and as king tout and september morn accumulated their winnings penelope sat almost motionless at the bar her blue eyes scanning the room her mind sorting out different possibilities different futures different means to the end she desired finally she found what she had been looking for it was a tall stunninglydressed man his glowing garments changing colors constantly his hair and beard a rainbow of hues his boots made from the phosphorescent blue fur of the nowextinct icedemon of belloq iv he seemed to be wandering aimlessly through the room pausing now at one table for a moment now at another his dark eyes missing no detail finally he stopped in front of a huge roulette wheel summoned one of the many waiter cashiers and ordered a handful of chips penelope didnt know his name or why he was aboard the starboat but she knew that this was the man she sought penelope observed the man for a few moments as he wagered on four successive turns of the wheel and lost each time so intent was she on studying him that she almost forgot to signal king tout that he had another winning hand and tried to ignore his glare as she informed him only after the initial series of bets then the opportunity she had known would occur came to pass a thin young man walked up to the the bar and she managed to spill her drink splashing some of it on him im so sorry she said apologetically no problem said the man signaling for a bartowel and wiping his sleeve off but you should really be a little more careful young lady penelope waited until the alien bartender was out of earshot i spilled it on purpose she said very softly the man stared at her and said nothing i need help she continued if you go around spilling drinks on strangers just to amuse yourself you need more than help he said you need some manners young lady he turned and started to walk away if you go away she whispered intently i wont tell you what number will win next at the roulette wheel and if i stay here youll give me the winner and ill win a million credits he asked highly amused how much you win depends on how much you bet the young man glanced over at the roulette table the wheels spinning now he said why dont you tell me the winning number just as a show of good faith said penelope without hesitation youre sure yes he grinned at her what do i get if youre wrong nothing she replied freezing suddenly as king tout who had just been dealt a losing hand looked across the room at her but because you didnt believe me you wont get anything anyway didnt anyone ever teach you how to speak to adults said the man because on the black announced the croupier penelope resisted the urge to smile smugly at the young man luck he said if you believe that i wont give you the next number why are you giving me any numbers at all she waited until two men who were passing the bar momentarily obscured her from king touts line of vision i told you i need help he frowned you want me to bet for you no i want you to rescue my friend and me and dont look at me when we talk she added what friend he asked gazing around the crowded room shes not here shes on a ship thats docked outside im not in the rescuing business little lady said the man the next number will be she said suddenly the man waited until the ball had come to rest and the croupier confirmed that the winning number was indeed an now do you believe i can tell you the winning numbers whispered penelope glancing at king tout out of the corner of her eye and finding that the gambler was too involved in the play of his hand to pay much attention to her very interesting he said the grin gone from his face i would have sworn that was an honest wheel it is i dont believe it what difference does it make said penelope whether its honest or not i can tell you the winning numbers he stared at her every time yes she glanced again at king touts table and stop looking at me why i dont want anyone to know were talking to each other why are you talking to me he asked quickly averting his gaze i told you i need help why did you choose me i dont want you said penelope i want the man you work for what makes you think i work for anyone i havent got time to explain said penelope but if i walked over and talked to him theyd hurt my friend nobody knows who you are so im talking to you instead you seem to know an awful lot about things that are none of your business young lady said the man frowning he paused briefly who do you think i work for the man with the fur boots and if you were right why do you think hed want to help you he doesnt want to now but he will when you give him my message why should i give him a message from a little girl who knows too many things because if you dont ill find someone else to do it and then hell be mad at you the young man looked over at the roulette table then back at penelope what kind of message do you want me to give him after the fat woman with the white hair leaves the table the next three winners will be then then and yes then what then come back to the bar and ill tell you where my friend is i cant let them see me talking to him them who is them penelope touched her right ear as september morn picked up a winning hand and king tout stared across the room at her go away now she whispered ive talked to you too long already the young man looked around the room once more trying to spot whoever it was that the little girl was afraid of then walked casually to the roulette table a moment later an overweight whitehaired woman got up and left and he watched in silence as the wheel spun and the ball landed on finally he edged his way closer to the colorfullydressed man and whispered something to him the larger man stared at him curiously for a moment then shrugged and placed a large bet on number he collected his winnings then put another pile on chips on number when the ball landed there he whispered something to the young man who made his way back to the bar pausing to briefly observe a couple of poker games and a jabob table along the way he stopped about eight feet away from penelope leaned against the bar and spoke softly while staring at the store of liquor bottle directly in front of him okay little lady he said softly youve got yourself a deal he paused one condition though penelope knew what the condition was but asked anyway he wants two more winners after he rescues my friend uhuh said the man we blast our way into a ship we may have to leave in one hell of a hurry he wants the numbers now theres a man with a gold tooth sitting at the table after he wins the next two numbers will be and ill be right back the young man relayed the information to his employer then returned to his position at the bar all right he said if theyre winners were in business he paused tell me about your friend her name is mouse said penelope mouse repeated the young man i hate to think of what she looks like shes very pretty said penelope defensively where is she on king touts ship king tout who is he hes playing cards in the middle of the room before i turn to look tell me how i can recognize him its a damned crowded room september morns with him that doesnt help shes an alien theres water in her suit a waterbreather i didnt see one when i walked through the room she doesnt breathe it but she has to run it all over her body okay that should do it the young man turned slowly his eyes scanning the room then went back to his original position staring at the back of the bar all right is there anyone else in on this besides king tout and the alien theres a man on the ship and thats it just the three of them and my friend has the ship got a name asked the man as the first of the two numbers penelope had given him came up i dont know its name registration number i dont know i hope you dont expect us to force our way into every damned ship thats docked out there i can describe it to you and tell you where its docked said penelope why dont you just come along and point it out to me because if i leave with you the golden duke will kill my friend before we get there the golden duke repeated the man ive heard of him the second number won all right said the man tell me how to find the ship penelope described its shape size and location next time you see me walk out of here through that doorway down by the dice tables said the man dont take too long said penelope were rescuing you and your friend answered the man irritably isnt that enough theres someone else after us said penelope theyll be here before long what the hell did you two do rob the treasury on deluros viii we didnt do anything said penelope heatedly the colorfullyclad man picked up his winnings from the roulette table stopped at a cashiers window and walked out of the room without glancing in their direction time to go to work said the man ill be back in a few minutes please be careful said penelope the man smiled sardonically its thoughtful of you to worry about me be careful that the golden duke doesnt hurt my friend he may be a killer but hes not crazy said the man when he knows what hes up against hell release her without a fight sometimes he will sometimes he wont said penelope what are you talking about were only going to rescue her once just make sure that my friend doesnt get hurt well do our best youd better he chuckled or what or youll be very sorry said penelope with such conviction that the mans smile vanished he stared at her for another moment wondering uneasily what he was getting into then shrugged and left the casino king touts ship was still docked at the starboat when the communications system was activated request permission to come aboard said the icemans dispassionate voice you said king tout surprised you came this far after them thats right said the iceman go away said king tout into his speaker i dont even have them any more demand permission to come aboard permission denied there was a tenminute silence then the icemans voice echoed through the ship again ive just placed a small explosive device in one of your ships exhaust vents im holding the triggering mechanism in my hand now one way or another im coming onto that ship whether anyones alive when i get there is a matter of complete indifference to me i dont believe you said king tout thats your privilege youve got seconds to open your hatch the gambler took seconds then reluctantly ordered his ships computer to open the hatch and a moment later the iceman and the forever kid stepped into the small ship the interior had been modified so that there were no walls between the cockpit the galley and one of the cabins and the iceman found himself facing king tout in an area perhaps fifteen feet on a side september morn no longer in her special protective suit sat nude in a narrow vat of tinted liquid and stared at them through alien eyes the golden duke a laser pistol at his side paid no attention to the iceman at all but stared tense and unblinking at the forever kid is there a bomb asked king tout quite possibly said the iceman thats hardly a definitive answer said the gambler wryly you noticed king tout shrugged it makes no difference anyway the people you want are gone the people i want are right here said the iceman the gambler shook his head theyre gone he repeated that little girl made fools of us how have you ever heard of the yankee clipper no he calls himself a trader but hes nothing but a pirate hes got a quite a fleet and he works the area around the quinellus cluster no cargo comes or goes that he doesnt get a piece of no ship of any kind moves in or out unless they pay a tribute hes the worst kind of thief the worst kind of thief steals people not money said the iceman i resent that remark resent it all you like said the iceman now what about the yankee clipper he was on the starboat tonight at the roulette wheel somehow and i still dont know how the bailey girl got him to take her away with him i didnt even know it until after they were gone and the mouse said the iceman where is she they took her too said king tout thats when i found out when the duke told me she was gone the forever kid looked amused you let them steal the mouse from you there were of them growled the golden duke defensively what would you have done stopped them said the kid i dont blame my associate continued king tout it was the childs doing i didnt realize it at the time but if she can see the future she can change it and thats just what she did even though i was watching her every minute he shrugged im well rid of the little monster i won a tidy little sum tonight and if she could manipulate events the way she did then sooner or later she could have managed to kill my friends and me sooner i should think remarked the iceman shes a positive menace said king tout its a distinct possibility king tout stared curiously at the iceman you never had any intention of rescuing her he said at last what i intend to do about her is my own business you came after us to kill her continued the gambler i havent said that but i can tell i can see it written all over your face said the gambler look we no longer have her lets call a truce and well throw in with you i owe her something for the way she made fools of us tonight you still dont understand do you said the iceman understand what i didnt come after her at all the mouse then the iceman shook his head i gave an order back on last chance you disobeyed it now its time to face the consequences of your actions king touts eyes went wide with surprise then you were never after them at all this isnt a rescue mission said the forever kid smiling at the golden duke its a punishment party but this is ridiculous protested king tout were not the enemy the enemy is out there its the bailey girl you broke the law said the iceman what law for gods sake my law he turned to the forever kid lets see if youre as good as you fear you are better said the kid reaching for his sonic weapon the golden dukes fingers closed around his laser pistol but he was dead before he could pull it out and aim it then slowly almost casually the kid turned his weapon on king tout and dispatched the gambler damn muttered the forever kid dont feel badly said the iceman it was execution not murder i dont feel bad about killing them replied the kid i was just hoping that the golden duke would be more of a challenge he shrugged i dont know where the hell he built his reputation his gaze fell on september morn who had watched the entire proceeding motionless and silent what about this one kill her the kid looked at the naked alien crouched down and defenseless in her tub of lifegiving solution now that seems like murder he said i have a projectile pistol tucked in my belt replied the iceman either you put her out of her misery fast or ill blow a couple of holes in her tub and you can watch her die slowly as the liquid drains out you are a relentless bastard arent you said the kid suddenly he smiled i admire your professionalism what i am is your employer said the iceman kill her he turned away and set off to explore the rest of the ship hoping to find some hint of where the pirate had taken penelope and the mouse when he returned september morn was dead what now asked the forever kid im going after the yankee clipper said the iceman you take these three back to last chance whats the sense in that said the kid theyre already dead i want everybody on last chance to know it send them a holograph a makeup artist can work a lot of magic with a holograph replied the iceman when you get back to last chance string them up where everyone can see them the kid paused in thought for a long moment i dont think so he said at last youre working for me remember the kid shook his head im holding more than credits worth of the mouses money he replied the way i see it it wont do her any good while shes a prisoner so she and the little girl just bought me for two more weeks the little girl doesnt need your help said the iceman that ought to be apparent by now thats your opinion thats a fact theres another reason too oh the kids face came alive with excitement id like to face men at once the iceman paused for a moment then shrugged well if you really want to die in glorious battle you might as well come along he said just let me make arrangements for someone to take these three back to last chance and well be on our way just a minute said the kid what is it i know why im going he said why are you what difference does it make none until we get there said the kid and then im going there to save the little girl not kill her he paused if you want to kill her youve got to get past me to do it would you really shoot your employer asked the iceman the forever kid couldnt tell if he was angry or curious or merely amused no i wouldnt answered the kid that settles that not quite said the kid i quit im not working for you any more the iceman smiled i admire your professionalism he paused of course i could just be interested in rescuing the mouse i havent said otherwise i doubt it why because i know you better now than i did before i havent said that i plan to kill anyone either noted the iceman what you say doesnt matter replied the kid adamantly just remember if you try to kill the little girl before the mouses money runs out youre going to have to get past me first you do what you think you have to do said the iceman totally unperturbed i plan to said the kid suddenly a boyish smile crossed his face it could prove very interesting it could at that conceded the iceman they stared at each other in silence for an uneasy moment then the iceman turned to the hatch door come on he said at last lets hire someone to cart these bodies back to last chance he walked through the hatch and a moment later the kid fell into step behind him the iceman made his arrangements for the corpses and twenty minutes later he and the forever kid had formed an uneasy truce and were racing toward the distant quinellis cluster in pursuit of the yankee clipper and his human cargo part the yankee clippers book actually i dislike the word pirate and its connotations said the yankee clipper leaning back in his chair and sipping an altairian brandy i consider myself to be a simple hardworking businessman the mouse and penelope were sitting in a luxurious lounge aboard the pirate ship there were tables chairs couches picture frames all of shining polished chrome the carpeting the first the mouse had ever seen on a ship was formal and muted in color the bulkheads were covered with paintings and holographs both naturalistic and abstract from a hundred worlds and all about the lounge were objets dart each plundered from a different planet simple businessmen dont own spacecraft like this answered the mouse this room alone is larger than most ships ive been on ive been very fortunate replied the yankee clipper and of course ive been quite aggressive in my pursuit of financial security he uttered a brief command to his computer and suddenly the room was filled with the sound of beethovens ninth symphony well ill give you this much said the mouse youre not at all like any other pirate ive known he smiled i take that as a compliment the yankee clipper withdrew a large cigar from a pocket held it lovingly in his hand for a moment and finally lit it excellent he said anyone who doubts the wisdom of subjugating alien races need only smoke a single antarrean cigar and hell become an instant convert to the somewhat hazy principles upon which our beloved democracy was founded a democracy that you loot and plunder noted the mouse well i do have my disagreements with them he replied easily but im glad to say that we do see eyetoeye on the subject of fine tobaccos he paused would you believe that i used to work for them them repeated the mouse you mean the antarrean tobacco farms he chuckled no the democracy i spent more than a decade as a part of its bureaucracy in the navy why should you think so well you do command a ship answered the mouse anyone can command this ship he replied you just activate the captains computer and say go here or go there or destroy suchandsuch a vessel one hardly needs any training to be a ships captain he paused and smiled again i prefer to own the entire fleet and let my subordinates worry about how to get it from one point to another what kind of job prepared you for that asked the mouse none answered the yankee clipper noticing that his cigar had gone out and relighting it actually i was a tax collector i worked my way up through the ranks until i was in charge of the entire taxation bureau on nilander iv then i decided that id much rather be an entrepreneur than a wage slave so i appropriated a few million credits and began contemplating various new enterprises he took a sip of his brandy then turned to penelope who had been sitting perfectly still im sure we must be boring you youre at liberty to inspect the entire ship as long as you ask permission before touching anything ill stay with my friend said penelope reaching out and holding the mouses hand the yankee clipper shrugged as you wish he turned back to the mouse it took them almost two years to discover what i had done during which time i had ample opportunity to consider my options they took that long to find out you had robbed the treasury asked the mouse im surprised they found out so quickly he replied i was quite good at fixing the records and they were trying to administer some worlds from deluros viii which was half a galaxy away he put his cigar down in a crystal ashtray and picked up his brandy glass at first i simply planned to rob the planetary treasury on a regular basis but nilander iv is a poor planet when all is said and done and i decided that i could never satisfy my financial ambitions in such a situation so i purchased a ship not this one to be sure and took my leave of the nilander system he paused smiling pleasantly at the recollection i was in a totally liquid financial position so i began to look around to see where i might receive the best return on my investment my ah shall we say questionable status seemed to dictate a profession beyond the physical limits of the democracy ive never liked the outer frontier the rim was always such a desolate place and the spiral arm is too sparsely populated so i decided upon the inner frontier i spent some time in the binder system reviewing my options and i finally decided to become what you refer to as a pirate after careful consideration i even acquired a piratical name as seemed to be the custom out here he paused i took it right after that regretable incident near new botswana you were the one who destroyed the navy convoy most regretable he said with obvious insincerity but they had posted a reward for me i viewed it as an object lesson an object lesson during which more than men lost their lives she said oh i very much doubt that the total came to much more than he said dismissing it with a wave of his hand still he added thoughtfully that was the day i officially became a pirate in the eyes of the democracy prior to that i was merely a thief you must admit they had some justification for the term said the mouse i suppose so sighed the yankee clipper but theres such an unsavory connotation to it most pirates are such low vulgar types i decided from the start to run my enterprise like a business to assess each risk coldly and rationally to never allow pride or emotion to influence me he paused and took another puff of his cigar and i must admit that im wealthier than even i had anticipated i thought all pirates were rich remarked the mouse or dead the yankee clipper shook his head most of them are destitute on any given day a note of contempt came into his voice they waste what they plunder and then have to go out and do it all over again i decided that there had to be a better way so i assembled my crew hiring exnavy men whenever i could men who understood discipline and could execute orders without arguing and paid them exorbitantly half of the profits from our little ventures are divided among my crew and myself and the other half goes into what i think i shall term capital expansion more ships suggested the mouse and more men it sounds very businesslike it is i run it more efficiently than the democracy runs its government or navy and we have an exceptionally high return on investment all things considered he paused as an officer entered the room presented him with a pair of papers requiring his signature and then saluted and departed i realize that this does not fit your preconceptions about piracy but its the wave of the future even my competitors those who are still alive and at large are borrowing my methods when you describe it like that it makes it very hard for me to remember that your business is killing and looting said the mouse only when absolutely necessary said the clipper we much prefer to sell our protection to isolated worlds on the frontier after all he added once youve killed a man you can never make a profit from him again but if you enter into a longterm business relationship he smiled and let his voice trail off and just what kind of business relationship do you think youve entered into with us asked the mouse as an intercom light began pulsating on the pirates wrist radio and he deactivated it without paying it any apparent attention the very best kind answered the yankee clipper a profitable one you freed me from that ship and you helped penelope and me get away from king tout and his friends and were very grateful said the mouse but as i see it you were paid in advance have i asked for more money said the yankee clipper no said the mouse she paused and stared at him thats what puzzles me well put your mind at ease said the yankee clipper you are my guests not my prisoners and you have free run of the ship your quarters are spacious and luxurious and contain all the amenities we possess a galley equal to that of any cruise ship and there is even a small fitness room filled with the very finest equipment and thats it said the mouse suspiciously now were even certainly you are free agents and you will not be charged a single credit during your stay here as my personal guests he paused we have a small commissary on the fourth level select anything you like from it gratis gratis repeated the mouse suspiciously i repeat you are my guests where are we bound for asked the mouse the quinellus cluster said penelope the yankee clipper looked down at the little girl and smiled youre absolutely right my dear he turned his attention back to the mouse the quinellus cluster is my base of operations and well all be much safer back there ive made some discreet inqueries since we left the starboat and it seems that quite a lot of people have an interest in your lovely little traveling companion he smiled at penelope you havent a thing to worry about my dear youre perfectly safe as long as you remain with me we appreciate your hospitality said the mouse but i think wed like to be let off on the first colony planet we come to as soon as you reach the cluster we have arrangements to make and a friend to contact i wont hear of it said the yankee clipper my subspace radio is at your disposal contact your friend right from the ship i think as long as all our accounts are even wed rather not trouble you any further its no trouble at all insisted the pirate just the same wed rather be let off as soon as you reach the cluster well of course if you insist said the yankee clipper with an eloquent shrug lets say that we strongly request it answered the mouse your wish is my command said the yankee clipper he paused five million five million what five million credits of course all right said the mouse what about five million credits thats my fee for letting you off the ship you said we didnt owe you anything you dont and that we were your guests indeed you are he replied finally draining his brandy glass and setting it down on a polished chrome surface but of course once you decline my hospitality and leave the comfort and safety of my ship youre no longer my guests are you he smiled you know and i know that young penelope here is worth millions to various interested parties im perfectly willing to play host to you so long as her value continues to appreciate but if im to part with that potential profit then ill have to charge you a minimum fee of five million credits the mouse stared at him without speaking suddenly she felt penelopes hand squeezing her own its all right said the little girl the mouse looked down at her you knew he was going to do this didnt you we needed him said penelope ignoring the question but were virtually prisoners on his ship its all right repeated penelope at least the iceman didnt catch us the iceman interrupted the yankee clipper whos the iceman a very bad man said penelope he wants to hurt me then youve made a very wise choice my dear said the pirate i wouldnt dream of hurting you or indeed of letting any harm come to you from any source whatsoever i know i am after all not without compassion for a child in your situation continued the yankee clipper he paused thoughtfully also i suspect your value would decrease if you were harmed the mouse glared at him so were just going to fly around the quinellus cluster with you until you decide that shes worth enough to part with she demanded essentially answered the yankee clipper ive already sent discreet messages to various interested parties theyll blow your ship apart said the mouse the pirate smiled not while shes aboard it they wont he paused but before i deny myself the pleasure of your company it seems only reasonable that we establish a fair market value for the little girl i could hardly do that without informing everyone that shes ah available for the right price unless we come up with five million credits first said the mouse certainly agreed the yankee clipper im not an unreasonable man and a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush this lovely child could contract a fatal disease or attempt to kill herself or simply lose her remarkable ability he paused and smiled of course i dont see how you can possibly produce such a sum given your present situation but im always willing to admit im wrong if youd play cards or roulette i could help you win five million credits said penelope i hardly think so my dear answered the yankee clipper easily everyone knows who and what you are he sighed and that does make it difficult to find volunteers for a game of chance while youre aboard the ship penelope frowned youre no better than king tout was on the contrary im much better he corrected her for one thing im providing you with every comfort at my disposal for another ive already given you my word that no physical harm will come to you but mostly im better than king tout because i learn from other peoples mistakes what are you talking about demanded the mouse i should think that would be obvious the reason youre here instead of back at the starboat is because lovely little penelope here somehow manipulated events so that i would rescue you he stared at the little girl and though his voice remained cordial and conversational there was a sudden hardness about his eyes i must warn you my dear child that if i notice any irregularity aboard my ship any irregularity at all if i should trip and break a leg or flinch while shaving or if this mysterious iceman should approach too closely then i will take you to the deepsleep chamber and freeze you cryogenically until such time as i have completed my transaction with whoever wants you the most desperately deepsleep is absolutely painless we use it for extended voyages in deep space but i rather suspect that when your brain is sound asleep and your metabolism is slowed to a crawl you will be in no position to influence events as you did with king tout suddenly the yankee clipper got to his feet but enough about business you are my honored guests and i look forward to your company at dinner this evening in the meantime he shot them a final smile as he walked to the door which slid into a bulkhead please do make yourselves comfortable i expect youll be staying with me for quite some time then he was gone and penelope and the mouse were left alone in the huge empty lounge did you see this coming back at the starboat asked the mouse not exactly answered penelope i knew he would rescue us and i knew that he wouldnt hurt us but you didnt know that hed sell you to the highest bidder she continued it doesnt matter said the little girl hes taking us in the right direction thats all that matters the right direction repeated the mouse penelope nodded the right direction for what i dont know yet replied penelope but i know its the right direction she tightened her grip on the mouses hand dont worry i wont let anyone hurt you the mouse suddenly realized that she believed her and that realization made her more uneasy than the thought of being at the yankee clippers mercy the mouse led penelope through the small commissary past the meager supply of clothing and toiletries and the even smaller stock of books and tapes until she came to the area that had it borne a label would have been marked miscellaneous but what are we looking for asked the little girl youll see said the mouse with a smile she began rummaging through what were obviously the unwanted spoils of conquest and finally she found what she had been looking for oh theyre beautiful exclaimed penelope as the mouse stepped aside and revealed four exquisite dolls each dressed in colorful robes and bright jewelry i think theyre from new kenya said the mouse but i could be wrong im sure someone can tell us theyre very large said penelope much bigger than jennifer was well they were made to be displayed not played with replied the mouse thats why theyre so stiff my guess is that they were part of a collection perhaps the others were destroyed or maybe they had real jewelry and theyre in some crewmans quarters i love their necklaces said penelope gingerly fingering a beaded necklace on one of the dolls i would imagine each of them represents some nation or religion said the mouse and their robes are so pretty continued the little girl then her gaze fell on something else that lay halfburied beneath a neatlyfolded length of silk well said the mouse take your choice you can have any of them you want or all four if your like i want this one said penelope reaching beneath the silk and withdrawing a small rag doll that had a tiny scrap of red cloth wrapped around it i didnt even see that one said the mouse i did its not as pretty as the others i know why dont you take them all suggested the mouse this is the one i want said penelope firmly the others are for grownups this one is for little girls and it reminds you of jennifer asked the mouse with a smile penelope nodded all right its yours she looked around i wonder where we pay for it we dont said penelope remember what the yankee clipper said we can have anything we want for free i know but id still like to find a shopkeeper or a cashier or something and explain it to him so we dont get shot for robbing the store we wont said penelope the mouse shrugged oh well you havent been wrong yet she paused what are you going to call her jennifer penelope shook her head jennifers gone i need a new name for this one she frowned concentrating on the doll then looked up at the mouse whats your name mouse i mean your real name oh its not a very special name at all replied the mouse i got rid of it the day i arrived on the inner frontier id still like to know the mouse shrugged maryanne she said distastefully maryanne repeated penelope thoughtfully maryanne she nodded her head approvingly thats what ill call her youre sure yes that way even when youre not with me maryanne will remind me of you whats this talk of not being with you said the mouse were a team remember but you told me about how sometimes you have to leave someone you love behind the way i had to leave jennifer the little girl paused you left merlin someday maybe youll leave me behind too not a chance said the mouse reassuringly she put her arms around penelope i didnt love merlin and besides well be rejoining him soon i dont think so said penelope hes not in any of the futures i can see but you can only see a little way ahead noted the mouse sometimes i can see longer oh not always but sometimes more often than you used to be able to asked the mouse yes penelope paused i wonder why its just a sign that youre growing up i suppose said the mouse you can run faster and eat more food and say bigger words that you used to so why shouldnt you be able to see farther ahead too penelope shrugged i dont know that was a rhetorical question said the mouse with a smile i dont know what that means it means you dont have to answer it she looked at the other four dolls again youre sure you dont want anything else all i want is maryanne answered penelope cradling the doll in her arms the mouse winced god i hate that name its a pretty name and since you dont want it it should go to a pretty doll youre the boss said the mouse with a sigh of defeat am i really asked penelope well youre the boss about which doll you get to keep and what you want to name it said the mouse she paused and if carlos were here hed probably try to convince me that you could become the boss of the whole galaxy if you wanted to thats silly said penelope i agree the mouse looked around the commissary one last time all right lets go back to our cabin you go ahead said penelope i want to show maryanne around the ship ill come with you volunteered the mouse its not necessary said penelope i wont get lost and the yankee clipper has told everyone that were his guests i dont mind coming with you said the mouse its no trouble its really not necessary repeated penelope firmly youre sure youll be all right asked the mouse in concerned tones ill be all right the mouse stared at the little girl for a moment and then shrugged well i suppose everyone deserves a little time to themselves she said at last maybe ill go back to our room and take a little nap the mouse hugged penelope and headed off in the direction of their cabin while the little girl still holding the doll as if it were made of crystal and might be expected to shatter at any moment began going the opposite direction she passed the infirmary then rode an airlift to the top deck and turned to her left there was much more activity here for this was the operations level and crewmen were continuously moving purposefully from one area to another paying no attention to her at all penelope moving with equal purpose walked down the corridor that led to the observation deck a relatively large room filled with some fifteen viewscreens each displaying a section of space that an external holocamera transmitted all of them together showing the ships surroundings for more than a parsec in every direction standing alone in the middle of the room was the slender man that she had approached aboard the starboat good afternoon he said when he noticed that she had joined him good afternoon she replied formally that looks like a new doll her names maryanne said penelope holding up the doll for the man to see you know ive never asked you what your name was penelope welcome to the ship penelope said the man my names potemkin mischa potemkin that sounds like a real name she said surprised it is i thought hardly anyone out here used their real name except for me and maryanne anyway thats precisely why i choose to said potemkin with a smile i think it makes me very distinctive it does agreed penelope well penelope what are you doing here all by yourself im not by myself answered the girl maryannes with me i apologize said potemkin where are you and maryanne doing here im talking to you and maryanne is looking at all the viewscreens potemkin chuckled that isnt what i meant penelope stared at him politely waiting for him to explain himself i mean he said at last why are you on the observation deck at all i saw you here and everyone else seems so busy so i thought id talk to you what do you want to talk about asked potemkin oh i dont know said penelope looking around the room her gaze fell on a viewscreen how does this work she asked pointing to the screen i mean it cant be a window because were in the middle of the ship its just like a holograph projection screen in your home explained potemkin we have cameras outside the ship and they transmit what they see to the various screens but you cant change the channels he smiled thats why we have so many screens how do you fix a camera when it breaks we dont said potemkin we just cast it off and attach a new one do you attach it potemkin looked amused thats not my job what is your job asked penelope everyone else seems to be working very hard and youre just standing around looking at the screens are you the man who warns the captain when were approaching a meteor swarm no the ship does that automatically then what do you do nothing for the moment are you a passenger then she persisted no said potemkin im the war chief war chief he smiled back in the democracy i suppose theyd call me a military advisor i dont work until were attacking someone or under attack ourselves but when that happens i work very hard indeed so if you tell the yankee clipper to attack someone he does it and if you say not to he doesnt usually that makes you very important she said admiringly from time to time she paused staring at him what happens if you give him the wrong advice then we lose lose she repeated die and do you make lots of money i hardly see that thats any of your business young lady said potemkin not yet agreed penelope what is that supposed to mean demanded potemkin penelope looked down solicitously at her doll i think shes hungry she announced she can wait said potemkin what did you mean not yet you know what i meant said penelope still looking at her doll suppose you tell me anyway sometimes you could give him the wrong advice its possible admitted potemkin nobodys right all the time i am said penelope with no trace of smugness bunk i feel very sorry for you mr potemkin she said sincerely oh why because one day soon maybe tomorrow maybe even tonight the yankee clipper will remember what i did in the casino and hell realize that i would be a better war chief than you potemkin laughed harshly you dont know the first thing about military tactics but i know all about the future she pointed out if he can win a battle ill know how and if he cant ill know that too potemkin stared at her through narrowed eyes for a long moment you didnt just find me here by accident did you he said at last no i didnt admitted the little girl i knew youd be here and you knew wed have this conversation sort of answered penelope i didnt know what the words would be but i knew wed talk if i wanted us to do you know that ive killed people who have threatened my position no she replied but i believe it you have good manners but youre not a very nice man if i decide youre right continued potemkin what makes you think that i wont kill you too youre not nice repeated penelope but youre smart if you kill me you know that the yankee clipper will figure out why you did it and then hell kill you because youll have killed someone who could have made sure he never lost a battle i might take my chances on that said potemkin ominously its better than going back to being a common crewman you dont have to kill me or be a crewman said penelope oh all you have to do is let me and my friends off on a planet friends mouse and maryanne she replied indicating the doll potemkin shook his head i dont think im inclined to do that he said youre worth a couple of million credits maybe more for all i know the clipper had already contacted some of the people who are looking for you is money that important to you asked penelope its one of my favorite things she stared into his eyes in one of the futures i can see you put us down on a planet along with the yankee clipper and you become the captain of the ship and take over all his money do you see if i live out the day after i do that he asked sardonically she shook her head i cant see your future once i leave you she paused but i can see lots of futures in which i become the war chief and lots more in which the yankee clipper kills you because you hurt me do you see any in which we just stay the way we are and finally sell you to the highest bidder no why not because im not looking for them well youd better start looking said potemkin because thats the way its going to be i dont think so said penelope seriously very soon now the yankee clipper will decide i would be a better war chief than you she paused long before you have a chance to sell me she looked at the doll again i really have to go and feed her she said apologetically and began walking toward the doorway through which she had entered potemkin watched her walk away then just before she stepped into the corridor he called out not that i believe any of this for an instant but if i did which planet do you think id let you off on she reentered the room and walked to the viewscreen at which she had originally been staring she peered intently at it for a moment then pointed to a yellow star there are eleven planets circling this star she said we want the fourth one have you been there before he asked no then why did you pick it out from all the rest she smiled at him it looks very pretty it looks like every other class g star in the cluster he stared at her are you sure you dont have any friends there im sure but youll find some he continued one maybe just one he said disbelievingly sometimes one is enough said penelope she cuddled the doll again i really have to go now or maryanne is going to be mad at me she left the room as potemkin stared silently after her and a few minutes later she was back in her own spacious quarters the mouse who had been napping on her bed sat up abruptly at the sound of the door sliding into the wall im sorry said penelope i didnt mean to wake you its just as well replied the mouse throwing back her tufted satin comforter if you hadnt id never have been able to get to sleep tonight its always night in space penelope pointed out this is a military ship it runs on galactic standard time the mouse rubbed her eyes how are you and maryanne getting along she needs some new clothes said penelope she cant go around just wearing part of a blanket then well make some for her could we asked the little girl eagerly i dont know why not said the mouse looking around the room you know if we could find some of the fabric they used for our furniture shed be better dressed than anyone else on the ship that would be nice agreed penelope how did maryanne enjoy her tour of the ship i dont think she likes it here very much said penelope im sorry to hear that because ive got a feeling shes stuck here for a while maybe not said the little girl the mouse stared at her oh theres a very pretty planet not far away continued penelope i think that maryanne would be much happier there who do you think is going to let maryanne off on this very pretty planet asked the mouse cautiously oh i dont know answered the little girl someone someone like the yankee clipper persisted the mouse penelope shook her head no i dont think so i know he seems pleasant penelope but hes a very dangerous man he wont hurt you said penelope youre my only friend she suddenly remembered maryanne well my best friend anyway id never let anyone hurt you the mouse smiled ruefully thats what im supposed to say to you im sorry said penelope flustered i didnt mean to be bossy not with you the mouse got up walked across the wide expanse of floor separating them and hugged her warmly youre not being bossy penelope youre being caring and thats a good thing to be i just dont want you endangering yourself you have a marvelous gift but youre still a little girl and you dont know what some of these people can be like when you make them mad yes i do said penelope i can see what theyre like she placed a finger to her temple in here then you know better than to cross them but we have to get to the planet whats so important about this planet penelope shrugged i dont know yet but youre sure we should go there persisted the mouse the girl nodded her head yes when do you think youll know why soon said penelope with total conviction very soon then she remembered maryanne and as the mouse watched her with a puzzled expression on her face she spent the next few minutes cleaning the doll and readjusting its tiny robe to all outward appearances a little blonde girl without a care in the world rather than a valuable prisoner aboard the most powerful pirate ship in the quinellus cluster penelope was sound asleep when a hand reached out and shook her gently by the shoulder she moaned and turned away but the hand continued shaking her go away she muttered wake up kid whispered a masculine voice leave me alone weve got to talk the mouse awoke sat up looked across the relatively spacious cabin and saw the slender man sitting on the edge of penelopes bed what do you want she demanded this doesnt concern you answered potemkin anything to do with her concerns me im not going to hurt her lady said potemkin but ive got to talk to her go away said penelope again kid you can wake up peacefully or i can turn the lights on and throw a bucket of cold water over you said potemkin its up to you penelope slowly sat up in her bed rubbing her eyes oh she said upon recognizing potemkin its you penelope if you dont want to talk to him i can call for help said the mouse he is help said penelope leaving the mouse totally confused maybe i am maybe im not said potemkin first ive got a couple of questions to ask you expected him asked the mouse not this soon but yes said penelope does this have something to do with that walk around the ship you took this afternoon persisted the mouse ask your questions later lady said potemkin im in a hurry its all right mouse said penelope reassuringly really it is he wont hurt us dont be too sure of that said potemkin if you were going to hurt us id know said penelope with no trace of fear or apprehension youre here to talk i could change my mind youre a smart man and that would be a stupid thing to do said the little girl staring at him unblinking he met her gaze for a moment then lowered his eyes briefly all right he said i need some answers and i need them fast ill answer anything i can said penelope dont answer anything yet said the mouse she turned to potemkin ive already found three spy devices and ive probably missed some no problem said potemkin my own man will monitoring us during this watch he turned to penelope im not ready to take on the clipper yet hes got too many people loyal to him i dont think i can pull it off are you sure said the girl damn it were talking about mutiny against the most successful pirate in the cluster its not worth the risk unless you can guarantee that ill succeed i told you i cant see what will happen after im not with you any longer i know but i came up with another way to get you to your planet whose planet interjected the mouse shut up lady im talking to the girl potemkin turned back to penelope what if i arrange for the auction to take place on the planet he paused the clipper would have to take you there to deliver you he wouldnt take us alone said penelope hed have lots of guards potemkin laughed mirthlessly are you trying to convince me at this late date that you cant get away from a bunch of guards if you want to hell youve gotten away from bounty hunters all across the democracy and the inner frontier i just said that hed have a lot of guards with him what will happen to him on the planet penelope shrugged i dont know i dont believe that for a second said potemkin will he live or die in some futures he lives in some he dies in some i cant tell in how many of these futures does he figure out that hes on the planet because i dont want you on the ship very few said penelope and in those very few what kind of action does he take against me once he leaves me i cant see what hell do if he dies how will you kill him demanded potemkin is there any way it can be connected to me i wont kill him at all said penelope im just a little girl he jerked a thumb in the mouses direction does she do it no youre sure im sure so if he dies on the planet it cant be blamed on me continued potemkin if he dies on the planet it cant be blamed on you agreed penelope and if he doesnt die and you get away it still wont be blamed on me i dont know but if he doesnt know that you chose the planet if he thinks the others did okay said potemkin thats what i needed to know will you arrange to set us down there asked penelope ill have to think about it you really dont want us to stay on the ship i know and you dont want to hurt us i said id think about it said potemkin irritably he got to his feet and walked to the door youll know when ive made up my mind then he was out in the corridor and the door slid shut behind him and the mouse was staring at penelope a puzzled expression on her face do you want to tell me about that she asked at last we have to get to the planet i told you about answered penelope potemkin will see to it that we do potemkin is that his name penelope nodded mischa potemkin isnt that a funny name youre sure hell set us down on this planet that youre so anxious to reach pretty sure said penelope with a shrug as she picked up maryanne and began straightening her tiny red blanket the mouse frowned again youre the yankee clippers prisoner and potemkin works for the clipper they stand to make millions of credits by selling you to any of the people who are trying to find you why should he suddenly be willing to put you off on a planet and never see you again i explained to him why it would be a smart thing to do said penelope smoothing maryannes hair when can we get maryanne some new outfits i dont know said the mouse distractedly we can look around the ship tomorrow and see if theres any material we can use will it hurt her if i wash her in the dryshower no i dont suppose so can we go back to talking about potemkin for a minute penelope sighed if you want she held maryanne up and stared at her but i want to wash her soon she needs a bath every day or she might get sick try to pay attention penelope said the mouse keeping her voice calm and soothing with some effort a very dangerous man is willing to cost his even more dangerous boss millions of credits and set us down on a strange planet she paused briefly can you tell me why he would do such a thing if i told you youd laugh said penelope not even if i thought it was funny the mouse assured her you promise i promise hes afraid of me said penelope she giggled isnt that funny a pirate being afraid of a little girl why is he afraid of you asked the mouse sharply what did you two talk about this afternoon oh lots of things penelope seemed to lose interest i really have to wash maryanne now mouse she walked to the bathroom compartment and paused at the door do you want to come into the dryshower with us the mouse shook her head no you go ahead youll still be here when i get out where would i go asked the mouse ironically i dont know said the little girl but sometimes i think youre upset with me and im afraid youll leave me and ill be alone again ill never leave you penelope said the mouse sincerely if you can see the future you know that i can hardly ever see the good things explained penelope just the bad ones well if leaving you is a bad thing you should be able to see it if i was going to do it penelopes face brightened suddenly thats right she exclaimed happily she ran over to the mouse and threw her arms around her i love you mouse i love you penelope said the mouse returning her hug now go take your dryshower and then maybe well talk some more penelope emerged from the dryshower a few minutes later dressed in a fresh outfit wheres maryanne asked the mouse i left her there there where in the bathroom why because if youre going to talk about potemkin and the yankee clipper i dont want her to hear what you say it might frighten her it doesnt frighten you though does it asked the mouse no why not because theyre not going to hurt us the mouse frowned trying to find the best way to keep penelopes interest from flagging well it frightens me she said at last maybe you can explain to me why i shouldnt be frightened the yankee clipper wont hurt us because were worth so much money said the girl he can hurt us without killing us he wont though said penelope then she added thoughtfully at least not while were on the ship i cant see much farther ahead what about potemkin hed like to hurt us but hes afraid to why why does he want to hurt us or why is he afraid to asked penelope both he wants to hurt us because i explained to him that i would be a better war chief than he is i see said the mouse she paused for a moment did he believe you why shouldnt he replied penelope its the truth then why is he afraid to hurt you because the yankee clipper knows that i can see the future he hasnt figured out yet that id be a good war chief but if potemkin hurts me hell try to think of why and then pretty soon hell know that must have been some conversation you had with potemkin this afternoon said the mouse he was very upset said penelope smiling at the memory suddenly she giggled again you should have seen his face it got all red ill just bet it did said the mouse with a smile so you convinced him the best way to get rid of you was to put you on a planet to put us on one penelope corrected her i wouldnt ever leave you behind mouse i appreciate that said the mouse did you suggest that he take over the ship and put the yankee clipper down with us as well penelope shook her head that was his idea but it wasnt a very good one it makes more sense to let the yankee clipper take us there to deliver us to whoever wants to buy me youre not worried about that asked the mouse no answered the little girl why not persisted the mouse hell probably take twenty or thirty of his men down with him to guard us thats all right said penelope with no show of concern why is it all right because ill find a friend there but you dont know who no then how do you know this friend will be able to help us penelope shrugged i just know youre putting an awfully big burden on a friend youve never met said the mouse oh hes not the only one who can help us said penelope with a shrug he isnt said the mouse surprised who else is there theres the forever kid hes on this planet he will be once his ship tells him weve landed you didnt mention carlos mendoza noted the mouse isnt he still with the kid penelope frowned yes he is but he doesnt want to help me ive told you before i wont let him hurt you you cant stop him said the girl she sighed maybe my new friend will be able to dont worry about carlos said the mouse firmly trust me he does a lot of things i disapprove of but killing children isnt one of them he frightens me i cant figure out why said the mouse youve seen threefisted ollie and cemetary smith and the golden duke and all these other killers why does a small middleaged man frighten you worse than they do because none of the others wanted to kill me explained penelope they were just doing their jobs the golden duke would have killed you if king tout had ordered him to thats different said penelope how he didnt hate me neither did any of the others not even she paused but the iceman doesnt want to kill me for money or because someone tells him to a tear trickled down her cheek he doesnt even know me and he wants me dead two more tears followed the first one i dont know why ive never done anything to him youre wrong said the mouse soothingly he really doesnt want to hurt you im not wrong insisted penelope then hes destined to be disappointed said the mouse earnestly why did you ever like him mouse asked penelope i was lonely said the mouse with a sigh and sometimes lonely people make poor choices were you lonely when you found me no said the mouse hugging her you were the best choice i ever made really asked penelope brightening somewhat really and well always be together always promised the mouse then penelope remembered maryanne and brought her out of the bathroom and began playing with her the mouse watched her for almost an hour as the little girl lavished her love and attention upon the rag doll then the mouse fell asleep and a few moments later penelope followed suit it was early morning when the door slid into the wall and the yankee clipper entered their compartment doesnt anyone ever knock demanded the mouse irritably wake up and pay attention announced the pirate walking over he announced walking over to a chair and seating himself theres been a change of plans it seems that some of the parties who are interested in the girl have decided that they wouldnt feel comfortable transacting their business aboard what they consider to be the flagship of a pirate fleet he smiled wryly i suppose id feel much the same way if i were in their place he paused so well be transferring the two of you to a nearby planet and well complete our business there could you identify these parties asked the mouse why bother yourselves with details he replied youll know who makes the high bid for her and the rest dont really matter so its to be an auction the yankee clipper laughed she wont be placed on a block with an auctioneer showing off her teeth if thats what you mean ill allow the various interested parties to ascertain that shes in my possession and then ill determine which reward i choose to accept the highest one no doubt said the mouse dryly not necessarily said the yankee clipper seriously the democracy wants her as does the canphorite confederation ive had certain shall we say disagreements with both governments a blanket pardon from either one in addition to money might weigh heavily in my consideration of the various rewards why asked the mouse curious do you plan to stop being a pirate certainly not he answered but at the moment i cannot invest my money within the democracy or the confederation without putting it at risk furthermore he added i would like to think that if worst came to worst there would be a government somewhere that would allow me sanctuary seems like a defeatist attitude to me said the mouse does it asked the yankee clipper it seems like a fiscally and politically sound attitude to me after all who knows what tomorrow may bring suddenly he grinned other than a certain little girl that is when do we leave asked penelope hours ships time answered the pirate this ship is too large to land so well transfer to a shuttlecraft we repeated the mouse absolutely said the yankee clipper im coming with you he smiled i know its irregular for a captain to leave his vessel in unsecured territory but i think unusual situations call for unusual responses he turned to penelope i have no idea what you can do to me if i stay aboard the ship probably i have nothing to worry about but i try never to deal in probabilities when i can deal in certainties and its certain that you wont cause the shuttlecraft to crash if youre in it so i plan to be in it too he paused were going to become great friends penelope my child i dont plan to let you out of my sight until the transaction is complete and ill always have at least half a dozen armed men surrounding us he smiled at her again if i choke on a meal if i have a stroke if anything at all untoward befalls me they will have orders to kill you instantly do you understand i understand said penelope good said the yankee clipper then we might as well make the best of the circumstances he paused at least we shouldnt be bored well be transacting our business on one of the most interesting planets in the cluster oh said the mouse he nodded its a world ive always meant to visit but i simply havent found the time until now whats its name asked the mouse calliope replied the yankee clipper calliope was known throughout the quinellus cluster as a pleasure planet and to be sure it had more than its share of whorehouses and drug dens and perverse amusements but that is a very narrow definition of the word pleasure and calliope was after all not just a small section of a jaded city but an entire planet in the western hemisphere it boasted a dinosaur park a squaremile reserve housing some gargantuan warmblooded reptiles from the primeval planet of quantos viii an inland ocean was filled with imported predators and prey from pinnipes ii and each of the hundreds of hotels lining the beaches supplied not only a fleet of fishing boats but also a number of small but comfortable submarines for their clienteles viewing pleasure there were enormous ranches on which the customers could participate in real cattle drives huge rings where the matadors would face the brave bulls and whatever other brave but doomed animals were released in them a dazzling array of safari excursions and golf courses by the thousands just beyond the hectare amusement park near the eastern hemispheres spaceport was a racetrack that could accomodate any of the seventeen species of animals from as many oxygen worlds upon which parimutual betting was permitted there were even clones of the nowextinct horse of earth and man o war citation secretariat and seattle slew met one another and their most famous competitors on a regular basis fully onethird of the great eastern continent was set aside as a hunting reserve for safari enthusiasts and so wellknown was it among the afficionados of blood sports that far from bragging about the trophies that had been taken the government actually boasted about the number of hunters who had been killed by the animals they were stalking mount ramsey boasted the secondlongest continuous ski slope in the galaxy and it was said that an enthusiast could begin his descent before dawn and still be racing downhill when nightfall occurred there were daily vehicle races on the salt flats daily boat races down the river jordan daily sporting championships of a thousand different types in the dozen huge stadiums that had been erected across the planet there were nine cities of which xanadu was the largest each city supplied an endless array of roundtheclock entertainment restaurants and shopping two of the nine catered almost exclusively to aliens while a third which bore the name of new gomorrah possessed seven different multienvironment hotels as well as an enclosed amusement park for chlorinebreathers though it was within the quinellus cluster and hence officially a part of the inner frontier calliope was actually run by a number of cartels from the spiral arm and the galactic rim and was patronized in increasing numbers by vacationers and sightseers from within the democracy itself the yankee clippers party consisting of himself the mouse penelope bailey and eighteen armed guards landed at the space port near xanadu and soon checked into a very exclusive very private hotel on the outskirts of the city not too far from one of the smaller amusement parks the mouse and penelope shared the pirates palatial suite but the doors and windows were under constant surveillance by his men who worked their jobs in sixman shifts food drink and even new clothing for maryanne was brought to the suite but neither penelope nor the mouse was allowed to leave it and whenever the yankee clipper found it necessary to leave one of his men entered and kept his weapon trained on the mouse until the pirate returned on the morning of their second day there the yankee clipper his beard newly trimmed his clothes even more brilliant than usual entered the parlor of their suite and seated himself on a large leather sofa well another day or two and youll be on your way young lady he said to penelope whos bidding for her asked the mouse the pirate chuckled you might better ask who isnt this is a very popular little girl weve got here the democracy wants her the confederation wants her two scientific institutions want her a religious foundation wants her and nine private parties want her he paused lit a cigar and balanced it on the edge of an equisite crystal ashtray potemkin tells me that they should all have arrived here by tomorrow night well have a nice dinner exchange a few pleasantries and transact our business and then he added i can finally stop worrying about what you might do to me i cant do anything to you said penelope standing before a huge window that overlooked the city center im your prisoner youve been other peoples prisoner in the past said the pirate most of them arent around to tell what happened to them but ill wager that it wasnt pleasant they were bad men said penelope with a shrug i hope youll remember just how well im treating you said the yankee clipper youre the worst of them all nonsense i saved you from king tout didnt i that doesnt make you a good man replied the girl just a greedy one im also a very untrusting one shot back the yankee clipper picking up his cigar and taking a puff of it if anything happens to me while im on the planet my men have orders to kill your friend here if anything happens to you mouse will have nothing to do with it said penelope unable to hide a worried expression from her face oh theyll try to kill you too said the pirate but i dont know if it can be done on the other hand im sure they can kill the mouse and shell be the one they shoot first he smiled at her i hope youll remember that youre a bad man said penelope youre going to be very sorry you treated us like this nonsense scoffed the yankee clipper ive treated you like visiting royalty he gestured vaguely with a hand look at this parlor elegant furniture beautiful views original oil paintings on the walls room service to cater to your every whim i even had the bar stocked with fruit juice and soft drinks just for you you know what i mean said penelope seriously i may just be a little girl but i have a good memory someday youll be sorry someday ill be dead of old age too said the pirate with a shrug in the meantime though i suggest you think about what will happen to your friend if any harm befalls me he walked out of the parlor and the door closed behind him youve got one standard day to find your unknown friend remarked the mouse or more to the point he has one standard day to find us since it doesnt seem very likely that were going to get out of this suite unless someone kills all of the clippers guards well get out said penelope with certainty how the little girl shrugged im not sure yet there are a lot of futures there always were said the mouse the question is can you influence some of them enough to get us out of here penelope made no reply and since she seemed to be concentrating on something that only she could see or fathom the mouse slipped a disk into the holo player and watched a selection of threedimensional advertisements of the local entertainments she learned that she had just missed a wild west pageant recreated from earths ancient past as well as a muchballyhooed match for the freehand middleweight championship of the inner frontier upcoming attractions included a visit from the clusters most famous circus the conclusion of a foot race around calliopes equator that had begun days previously and a recreation of the decisive battle of the sett war which would take place on the sprawling savannah some miles to the west of xanadu damn muttered the mouse it just isnt fair what isnt asked penelope all my life ive dreamed of a world like this teeming with fat men and fatter wallets said the mouse and now that im finally here im locked away in a hotel so close to all that money i can almost taste it a wistful expression came over her face do you know what merlin and i could do here how much money we could make i thought i was your partner said penelope in hurt tones you are the mouse assured her then why are you talking about merlin because merlin is my partner too and he had the deftest fingers i ever saw answered the mouse you and i are good at other things but merlin could have started at one side of this hotels lobby walked to the other side and picked up wallets by the time he got there she smiled and oh what he could have done circulating in the crowd at the racetrack i can make you more money than he could said penelope i dont doubt it we dont need him we need all the help we can get from anyone who will give it to us said the mouse not from merlin why are you suddenly so concerned with merlin asked the mouse you havent mentioned him in weeks we were happy without him said penelope the mouse sighed you have to understand that you dont stop liking a friend or being loyal to him just because youve found someone you like better penelope stared at her do you really like me better yes said the mouse but dont forget merlin has been leading threefisted ollie and cemetary smith and some other bounty hunters away from us for weeks now she paused what kind of friends would we be if we didnt want him back after he risked his life for us youre right said penelope after some consideration im sorry its all right said the mouse soothingly you dont have to apologize i just worry about being alone again i worry about how were going to get out of here responded the mouse she started making another round of the parlor her fourteenth since arriving testing the walls the windows the floors the ventillation system looking for weak points and finding none there are lots of ways said penelope as the mouse continued walking around the parlor probing for possible means of escape i just dont know which one i can make happen yet do they concern your friend penelope shook her head he doesnt even know who we are then how can he be your friend the little girl shrugged helplessly i dont know are you certain youre right i think so said penelope picking the right future isnt as easy as it used to be i see more things now things i dont always understand what kind of things asked the mouse finally completing her latest inspection of the premises and turning back to the little girl i dont know said penelope just things pictures images whole scenes i cant explain it answered the girl its just much more complicated than it was she paused frowning youd think it would get easier now that im getting bigger maybe youre getting more powerful suggested the mouse maybe you see more things and can influence more things do you really think so its possible then why cant i always understand what i see asked penelope because youre still a little girl and you dont have enough experience to know all the things that youre seeing all the permutations of each choice you make i dont know what you mean the mouse smiled when you do then perhaps youll also know what youre seeing i hope so said penelope earnestly its very confusing i used to see everything so very clearly now there are some things that i dont see at all that i just seem to know and other things that i dont understand im sure someday it will all make sense said the mouse im glad you cant see what i see mouse said penelope sometimes it can be very confusing and scary scary penelope nodded i can see the iceman and the forever kid finding us and i can see the yankee clipper killing you when he finds out oh said the mouse apprehensively i wont let it happen said penelope there are lots of other futures i certainly hope so but i dont understand all of them just pick one in which i dont get killed and ill settle for it said the mouse you wont get killed penelope assured her are carlos and the kid on calliope already asked the mouse i dont know said the girl but i know theyll find this room by tonight so if theyre not here theyre very close suddenly she tensed what is it in some of the futures they die and in some they dont lets hope for one in which they dont said the mouse thats what im seeing now said penelope then why do you look so upset because if they both come into this room theyre going to try to kill each other why asked the mouse puzzled because of me youre absolutely sure penelope frowned no the iceman hasnt made up his mind yet about what about whether to kill me or not well if he tries the kid wont let him penelope closed her eyes and seemed to concentrate finally she opened them visibly shaken i dont know i cant see who wins carlos is a middleaged man who probably hasnt fought anyone in years said the mouse the kid is a professional killer ive seen him in action theres no way that carlos can beat him i still cant see repeated penelope suddenly she started trembling we have to get away from here mouse thats what i keep saying you dont understand said the girl urgently i dont want to be here when the iceman gets here if he wants me dead and he can kill the forever kid im not strong enough to stop him yet yet repeated the mouse someday i may be but not yet penelopes face was ashen white dont let him kill me mouse i wont said the mouse putting her arms around the frightened little girl and wondering how strong penelope planned to become if she lived long enough the door slid open and the yankee clipper stepped into the parlor im sorry to trouble you lovely ladies he said well be just a minute he was followed by a pair of bounty hunters mouse recognized from westerly one of them took a couple of steps toward penelope who stared at him curiously but without any trace of fear then nodded to the pirate a moment later both bounty hunters left the interested parties are beginning to arrive explained the yankee clipper each of course wants to make sure that i can really deliver penelope bailey so im afraid well be intruding upon your privacy from time to time i can tell how it upsets you said the mouse sardonically believe it or not i take no pleasure in selling human beings said the pirate but were talking about a great deal of money here and frankly ill feel much safer once shes halfway across the galaxy he paused and of course shes not being sold into slavery given the price that she commands im sure shell be treated with the utmost consideration and kept in luxury he smiled again at least it comforts me to think so he left the parlor and one of his guards entered a moment later penelope busied herself dressing maryanne with the new clothes she had ordered earlier in the day while the mouse activated the holovision and tried to concentrate on the results of the days seemingly endless procession of sporting events twice more the yankee clipper brought people up to the suite once it was a member of the democracys military once a nondescript woman who might have been anything from a bureaucrat to a bounty hunter and finally the mouse ordered lunch for herself and penelope a waiter from room service arrived about ten minutes later guiding a small aircart that held their meals he waited patiently while the guard searched him then walked across the room to the polished hardwood table where the mouse was sitting your lunch madam said the waiter the moment she heard his voice the mouse turned from the holoscreen to look at his face the waiter his back to the guard winked at her and smiled and suddenly the mouse felt an enormous sense of relief where will the young lady be taking her lunch asked the waiter right here answered the mouse hoping that her voice didnt reflect her excitement as you wish said the waiter arranging a place setting for penelope who was still playing with maryanne and seemed oblivious to his presence excuse me said the waiter turning to the guard but there seems to be an extra dessert here would you care for it he smiled ingratiatingly there will of course be no additional charge the guard shrugged why not the waiter placed a covered dish at the far end of the table bring it over said the guard certainly said the waiter he picked up the dish and walked across the room stopping in front of the guard what is it asked the guard one moment sir said the waiter removing the lid from the dish and handing it to the guard the guard leaned forward to take the dish and suddenly found himself staring down the barrel of a small laser pistol where the hell did you get that he demanded the hand is quicker than the eye replied the waiter he reached over his head with his free hand and suddenly pulled a bouquet of flowers out of the air take a sniff he said holding them up to the guards nose i know theyre not roses but this is less painful and less permanent than forcing me to use the gun what are you began the guard who collapsed before he could complete his question the waiter looked at the unconscious body for a moment then tossed the bouquet on top of it and turned to face the mouse and penelope hi merlin said penelope am i ever glad to see you said the mouse getting to her feet what are you doing here save your questions for later said merlin were got to move fast i shorted out the monitoring device just before i entered the suite but itll only take them a couple of minutes to figure out that its not an electronic failure are the other guards still outside in the corridor asked the mouse merlin nodded meanlooking bunch theres no way we can get out past them he walked to the window and examined it is it rigged he asked the mouse of course not she answered were seventeen floors up who is going to break in youve got a point admitted merlin as they were speaking merlin examined the huge picture window then made a fist and pressed his ring up against the glass very near the bottom i just love magicians props he said with a grin the mouse could hear the whirring of a tiny motor inside the ring and it cut through the glass with no difficulty merlin completed about degrees of a large circle perhaps inches in diameter then reached into his pocket for a small suction device which he attached to the glass he then cut the remainder of the circle and used the device to pull the glass into the room even if the building has enough handholds someones bound to see me before i climb down to the ground said the mouse and even if no one saw me theres no way the two of you could follow me down the side of a building youre not going down youre going up said merlin up she repeated he nodded this is the penthouse the roofs about eight feet above the window and what about you and penelope merlin took off his timepiece and pressed a hidden release here he said withdrawing a thin incredibly strong wire from the band and attaching it to the mouses waist its a titanium alloy with a tight molecular bonding itll hold more than a ton before it snaps once you get to the roof tie your end to something secure and then penelope and i will climb up you cant climb handoverhand on that thing said the mouse itll cut right through your fingers merlin smiled i wont have to theres a little pulley mechanism in there thatll reel the wire in itll dislocate your arm he smiled im wearing a harness beneath my waiters jacket ill be fine the mouse looked unconvinced have you ever tried this stunt before no but i got the wristband from a friend who does it every night in the circus why did he part with it he was in hospital getting a pair of prosthetic legs answered merlin he hadnt any use for it he saw her worried expression he was there because of a different trick not this one i dont know said the mouse please mouse said penelope we have to hurry all right said the mouse instantly she ducked her head stepped through the hole in the window onto the ledge quickly and expertly found some handholds and footholds and began making her way up the outer wall of the building careful whispered merlin more to himself than to the mouse who was now halfway to the roof careful its all right said penelope picking up maryanne from the floor where she had been playing with her before merlin arrived shes not going to fall i wish i was as sure as you said merlin craning his neck to watch the mouse penelope walked over to the table and calmly ate one of the sandwiches that merlin had delivered in his guise as a hotel waiter dont you give a damn what happens to her he demanded irritably when he saw what she was doing i told you shes not going to fall youd better be right he said because if youre not im not only going to lose a partner but you and i are still stuck in this room penelope held a final bite of the sandwich up to maryannes mouth then placed it on the table and carefully dabbed at the dolls lips with a linen napkin then she tucked the doll under her arm and walked to the window she should be there now she announced she is said merlin with a sigh of relief he turned to penelope lets figure out the logistics here we cant both fit through the hole together and if we break the glass and it crashes down to the street well give ourselves away he examined the window again grab a couple of napkins from the table penelope smiled and held up the napkins she had brought with her so you figured it out too he said smart kid he attached the wire to his harness be very careful going through the hole here then once youre on the ledge wrap your hands in the napkins and hold onto the edge of the glass while i climb through his gaze went from the girl to the ledge to the roof and back again i dont suppose youre strong enough to hold on to my back i dont think so answered penelope all right he continued after a moments thought once i get out on the ledge too ill lift you up until you can wrap your arms around my neck and your legs around my waist that way ill be able to keep an arm around you as well he paused try not to worry it wont take us very long once the pulley mechanism starts working im not worried at all said penelope i wish i could say the same muttered merlin everything should work but this is the mouses specialty ive never done anything like this well be fine he felt the cord jerk against his harness the mouse was signaling him that she had secured her end on the roof i hope so he said put the doll down and ill lift you through the hole maryanne goes where i go said penelope its just a doll said merlin ill buy you another i dont want another i want her he stared at her for a moment then shrugged and sighed okay give her to me and ill put her in a pocket no you wont said penelope youll leave her behind all right carry her yourself said merlin irritably see if i give a damn he guided penelope through the hole in the window while she clutched maryanne to her chest then he maneuvered her until she was balanced on the narrow window ledge she grasped the edge of the glass with a napkinwrapped hand while the other held the doll a moment later merlin was standing on the ledge beside her and then with the mouse guiding them they began their ascent for a instant they got caught at the edge of the roof and merlin was absolutely certain the titanium cord would break or the pulley mechanism would fail but eventually with the mouses help they reached the temporary safety of the roof follow me said the mouse as merlin stood hands on knees gasping for breath and penelope inspected maryanne for abrasions merlin nodded and forced himself to follow the mouse and penelope across the rooftop when they reached the edge they looked down some feet at the rooftop of an adjacent building we cant chance taking the firestairs here explained the mouse because we might run into the yankee clippers men in the lobby i think our best bet is to get to the building next door and leave through its lobby how long is that cord of yours merlin long enough to reach that rooftop anyway the mouse smiled dont look so worried going down is much easier than going up faster at least he muttered they were both right it was easier and it was faster and five minutes later the three of them walked down the firestairs to the ground floor the stairwell let them out in the bustling lobby of an office building most of the shopping arcade seemed to consist of local travel agencies but there was also a small branch bank and a clothing store that specialized in safari outfits how did you find us asked the mouse as they walked to the main exit in fact how did you even know we were on calliope later said merlin looking around lets put a little distance between us and your pirate friend first he summoned a groundcab asked the driver to recommend an inexpensive family hotel near one of the smaller entertainment complexes at the south end of town and they rode in silence until they reached the hotel some fifteen minutes later merlin walked up to the desk explained that there had been a mixup at the spaceport and that their luggage would be arriving that evening or the next morning and booked two adjoining bedrooms no comment was made misplaced luggage was a common occurrence given the quantity of luggage that had to move through the spaceport and certainly the three of them appeared to be a typical family operating on a budget but still determined to enjoy those features of calliope that they could afford when they reached their rooms and opened the connecting door between them penelope approached the mouse i saw some little girls outside on the play equipment she said can i go play with them the mouse shook her head im afraid not why not because those little girls dont have pirates and half the bounty hunters in the cluster looking for them and you do we cant take a chance that someone might identify you no one will said penelope not today youre sure said the mouse yes youre taking her word for it demanded merlin of course said the mouse if shes spotted were all in trouble continued the magician and suddenly the mouse remembered that he was unaware of her extraordinary power that they had parted before penelope had demonstrated it for the first time she wont be spotted said the mouse if you wont trust her then trust me merlin placed a hand on penelopes shoulder and waited until she turned to face him you be very careful now he said and if you see anyone staring at you you come right back here and let me know nobody will stare at me replied penelope im sure they wont said the mouse before merlin could protest go on out and play will you watch maryanne for me asked the little girl i dont want her new clothes to get dirty id be happy to answered the mouse taking the doll from her thank you said penelope i guess ill go now have a good time said the mouse penelope paused at the door a worried expression on her face whats the matter asked the mouse i dont know any games said penelope i havent seen another little girl since i was five years old then theyll teach you what if they dont like me nonsense said the mouse youre a very likeable little girl but if they dont they will the mouse assured her penelope stared at the doll maybe i should bring maryanne after all if they dont like me maybe theyll like her dont worry so said the mouse soothingly who wouldnt like a sweet little girl like you lots of people said penelope seriously like the iceman youll be fine the mouse assured her just introduce yourself and im sure theyll be happy to meet you i hope so said penelope uncertainly then she ordered the door to open stepped out into the corridor waved a very nervous goodbye to the mouse and merlin and began walking away as the door closed behind her whos the iceman asked merlin finally inspecting the inexpensivelyfurnished room with an expression of distaste kind of a personal boogeyman not exactly said the mouse seating herself on a large chair and tucking her feet beneath her i used to work for him a long time ago i never heard you mention him he had a different name then said the mouse enough about the iceman how did you ever find us its a long story he stared at a holographic print of an alien landscape that hung above the bed god thats ugly maybe you should begin at the beginning said the mouse how did you get away from all those bounty hunters after you dropped us off on binder x i didnt the mouse frowned what are you talking about i didnt get away from them all repeated merlin i thought i had lost them but threefisted ollie caught up with me on a little hellhole called feathergill he sighed six billion birds fifty billion fish and one ugly little tradertown with two rundown hotels ill swear every other person on the planet was an ornithologist or an ichthyologist if there was one place in the whole galaxy i could have sworn no one would look for me it was feathergill obviously you were wrong i spent almost a month there replied the magician threefisted ollie found me a few days ago obviously he didnt kill you merlin chuckled obviously so what happened he wanted the little girl he and cemetary smith had gotten word that the yankee clipper was putting her up for auction to the highest bidder and their employer wanted her pretty badly but they had a problem neither of them had ever seen penelope close up ollie knew i had and he wanted to make sure no one was selling a ringer so he and smith offered me a deal half a million credits if i could make a positive identification whether their employer is the high bidder or not so thats how you knew where the yankee clipper was keeping us of course thats how i knew replied merlin with a smile im an illusionist not a magician he walked across the faded carpet to a plain wooden chair and sat down on it grimacing in discomfort all interested parties were allowed to make sure the girl was as advertised in fact i almost bumped into a pair of meanlooking bounty hunters coming out before i got into my waiters outfit the mouse looked amused youre a man of many talents no question about it she said today you were a waiter and tomorrow you can go back to being an illusionist but for tonight youre a hero for rescuing penelope and me i rescued you merlin corrected her i just borrowed penelope what do you mean asked the mouse warily if shes worth half a million credits just to identify think of how much the yankee clipper will pay to get her back he paused or if we can find a safe enough place to hide her maybe well even conduct the auction ourselves what are you talking about youre being awfully dense mouse said merlin were sitting on a gold mine we could make a big enough killing so both of us could retire ive heard that the bidding is going to start at ten million credits the mouse stared at him for a long moment youre a fool she said at last i thought i was a hero he said i thought so too i was wrong i dont supposed youd care to tell me why first im very fond of that little girl and im not about to let you or anyone else sell her as if she was some kind of animal second hasnt anyone told you that theres a reason why shes worth so much who cares why said merlin with a shrug shes worth a bundle and weve got her thats all i need to know no thats not all you need to know said the mouse looking out the grubby window at penelope who was standing by herself watching a trio of girls at play all right said merlin shifting uncomfortably on the straightbacked wooden chair suppose you tell me why shes so valuable shes valuable because she has a gift an ability that a lot of people and even governments want to control what gift precognition bunk said merlin if shes got precognition she must know i plan to hold her for ransom why did she agree to come with us the mouse looked at merlin and smiled try not to let it hurt your sensitive feelings she said but you are the least menacing alternative that was presented to her compared to the iceman and the yankee clipper and some of the others youre so low on the scale that she hasnt even bothered getting rid of you what do you mean getting rid of me scoffed merlin shes just a kid with a talent you make her sound like threefisted ollie dont you understand what precognition means of course i do it means she can predict the future it may be a pretty handy talent to have at the racetrack and i can see why all these high rollers want her around but i sure as hell dont see why you find it so frightening then ill spell it out for you said the mouse there isnt just one future there are an infinity of them she has the ability to see huge numbers of them i still dont follow you she can help to bring about the one she most wants to happen everybody tries to do that he said still not comprehending everybody tries she succeeds the mouse paused let me give you an example in maybe half the futures she saw something went wrong with our escape the cord broke the guard woke up too early she lost her grip on you when you were going up to the roof she has the ability to see each of those futures and to figure out what she has to do to stop them from coming to pass youre crazy he scoffed remember those two dead bodies we found next to our ship back on cherokee are you trying to tell me she killed them she chose a future in which they died thats not the same thing said the mouse shes not a killer shes just a little girl who protects herself the best way she can merlin considered what the mouse had said if youre right and thats a big if its one hell of an effective way to protect herself yes it is agreed the mouse so you see if she thought you were anything more than a minor irritant youd probably have had a stroke or a heart attack on the way over here at the very least youd have tripped on the way to our room and broken a leg i dont know whether to be insulted or grateful he said wryly he paused and stared at her and you like this kid yes why shes got the whole galaxy against her said the mouse im the only friend she has thats no reason half the people we know have prices on their heads and you dont like them shes very sweet and very lonely merlin looked out the window where penelope was now playing with the other girls id hardly call that a lonely little girl he said sardonically i dont have to justify my reasons to you said the mouse suddenly annoyed all you have to know if that shes staying with us all right said merlin if thats the way it is thats the way it is she joins the team and we get the hell out of here first thing in the morning wed better said the mouse wondering if merlin had given in too quickly youve probably got every bounty hunter on the planet looking for us to say nothing of the yankee clipper and his men right he said thats a lot of manpower out there the sooner we get off the planet the better do you have your own ship asked the mouse no i came with threefisted ollie then were going to have to find some way to catch a commercial space flight without being spotted it wont be easy said merlin theyll be watching the spaceport he grimaced and while they want penelope alive i dont think the same applies to you and me no it doesnt she agreed merlin got to his feet there must be a bar around here and i do my best thinking in bars care to join me for a drink the mouse shook her head id better stay here in case penelope come back merlin stared at her and finally smiled funny he commented i never thought of you as the maternal type neither did i said the mouse the magician walked to the door ill be back in half an hour or so maybe sooner if i can figure a way out of this mess ill be here he left the room and the mouse began walking around checking the holovision and the octaphonic sound system examining the cabinets in the bathroom and the closets in the bedrooms more from habit than any particular need penelope entered the room a few minutes later youre back early noted the mouse werent you getting along well with the girls they were very nice said penelope well then we have to leave mouse leave you mean leave the hotel penelope nodded soon somebody knows were here yes how much time have we got asked the mouse maybe ten minutes maybe a little less all right said the mouse merlins in the bar well pick up him and get the hell out of here no said penelope he just risked his life to rescue us said the mouse we dont want him mouse we dont desert our friends penelope replied the mouse i thought i explained that to you before she paused i wonder how they found us so quickly i thought wed be safe here for a few days merlin is telling them right now theyre here no hes talking to them on a vidphone but theyll be here very soon you actually saw him calling them penelope placed a finger to her temple in here the mouse stared long and hard at the little girl youre sure yes that doublecrossing bastard come on mouse said penelope tugging at her arm we have to hurry where is this friend of yours who we were going to meet on calliope asked the mouse we sure as hell could use a friend right now i dont know the mouse entered the corridor looked around to make sure merlin wasnt on his way back to the room and nodded this way she said heading off to her left the other way takes us by the bar and i dont want him to see us leaving penelope her doll clutched against her body reached out for the mouse with her free hand come on said the mouse increasing her pace if were lucky we can catch a groundcab and be out of here before merlin knows were gone they walked past a small holo theater a coffee shop and a large indoor pool then carefully approached the lobby have merlins friends arrived yet whispered the mouse not yet said the girl all right lets go they walked rapidly through the lobby then stood in front of the hotel as the mouse tried to hail a groundcab isnt it ever going to end said penelope wearily if xanadu showed off calliopes scrubbed wholesome face to hundreds of thousands of eager tourists then new gomorrah displayed its less affluent side the city rose up out of the grasslands a carbunkle on the smooth surface of the western savannah it possessed seven multienvironmental hotels and almost all of the aliens who landed on calliope immediately made their way to new gomorrah there were tourist attractions to be sure and the streets were not unsafe and many a safari started off from the veranda of the norfolk ii but perhaps because the aliens had less money to spend or perhaps simply because they were aliens the attractions new gomorrah offered were seemed less enticing that those of its eastern sister where xanadu offered circuses with fabulous acrobats and exotic animals new gomorrah offered carnivals with sideshows and crooked games where xanadu offered theater new gomorrah offered holo shows where xanadus hotels were palatial new gomorrahs were plain functional structures where xanadu offered fine restaurants with elegantlyprepared dishes new gomorrah offered a plethora of alien restaurants with foodstuffs most humans had never seen and could not metabolize moreover there was something about new gomorrah that seemed to bring out the bloodlust in its clientele it was here that one came for hunting rather than holographic safaris it was here that animals and occasionally men and aliens fought to the death before crowds both large and very small it was here that truly huge fortunes were won and lost in the back rooms of gaming parlors and it was here that almost every perversion known to man or alien could be experienced if enough money changed hands the mouse and penelope had avoided the spaceport knowing that it would be under surveillance with the rest of the planet to choose from penelope had looked at a map and immediately selected new gomorrah it had taken them three full days to get there via the most obscure and circuitious routes by which time both their energy and their bankroll were equally depleted the mouse who hadnt seen a bed in three days had wanted to spend their last hundred credits on a hotel but penelope insisted that they go directly to the carnivals the were clustered on the outskirts of the city why asked the mouse wearily because well meet my friend at one of them youre sure this friend actually exists said the mouse i mean its not as if he showed up when we needed him before we need him even more now said penelope if hes here now hell be here in the morning replied the mouse lets get a room and catch up on our sleep first i dont want to miss him insisted penelope you make him sound like a traveling salesman i dont know what he is i just know hes here and you think hes at one of these carnivals asked the mouse i dont know i just have a feeling we should go there well your feelings have been pretty accurate so far said the mouse with an exhausted sigh lets go they caught a courtesy vehicle to the nearest carnival a relatively small establishment that catered to families with small children they could hear screams of delight from within the tents and a number of clowns both human and alien mingled with the crowd passing out free tickets to minor attractions well asked the mouse penelope shook her head this isnt the place thank god for that said the mouse all those wellscrubbed vacantfaced families would drive me crazy dont you like families mouse asked penelope the mouse shrugged i dont know i never had one she smiled down at the girl youre family enough for me youre my family too said penelope earnestly you and maryanne where to now asked the mouse lets just keep going said penelope ill know when weve arrived whatever you say said the mouse flagging down another courtesy vehicle they passed an openair zoo that specialized in alien animals a huge stadium that seemed not to have any events scheduled that day and a farm that bred gigantic reptiles from antarres and then they came to a sprawling carnival this is it whispered penelope and the mouse signaled the driver to let them off this thing must cover acres or more said the mouse standing before the entrance with penelope do you have any idea what he looks like i dont even know if it is a he answered penelope but i know well find him here or hell find us will you know him when you see him penelope shrugged i suppose so the mouse paid their entrance fee and they spent the next few hours shouldering their way through the crowds of tourists walking up and down the rows of games and exhibits past the hustlers and grifters the strip shows and the freak shows the alien exhibits the pleasurepain palaces the cheap rides the display of cattle and hogs from earth itself im about ready to give up for the day said the mouse as the midafternoon heat became more intense she sat down at an empty table near a row of food stands and gestured penelope to join her there must be ten thousand people here she continued as the little girl sat next to her we could have walked right past him and never known it hell be here penelope said firmly soon i dont know today tomorrow next week continued the mouse i dont mean to worry you but were almost broke the forever kid has most of my money and ive just about run through the rest of it whether we keep looking for your mysterious friend or book passage off the planet were going to have to find a way to make some more money ive got enough to keep us going for maybe three more days four if we find a cheap enough place to stay she paused do you know if your friend will show up by then penelope shrugged i dont know youre sure were at the right place asked the mouse there are a lot of other carnivals around new gomorrah were in the right place the mouse sighed deeply then we might as well stay right here at the carnival the less we move around new gomorrah the less likely we are to be spotted will they let us stay here asked penelope not as tourists but i saw a few empty booths and tents all we have to do is come up with some kind of scam and convince the manager to let us go to work for him what can we do thats a problem admitted the mouse i suppose i could hire on as a stripper but im so scrawny and ugly that people would pay me to put my clothes back on thats not true said penelope heatedly youre very pretty mouse thats a matter of some debate replied the mouse wryly anyway take my word for it no one would hire me then what can we do the mouse lowered her head in thought for a moment then looked up and smiled you know what i didnt see when we walked up and down the aisles what a fortune tellers booth whats that asked penelope a fortune teller its someone who pretends to do what you really can do foresee the future she paused briefly do you remember how you saw my cards back at the casino on last chance yes do you think you could see whos going to win a particular race or fight i think so said penelope im much better at it now than i used to be when you cant will you know that you cant yes then i think we may be in business good said penelope happily then after we make some money telling fortunes i can tell you who is going to win a race or a fight and you can bet on it and no interrupted the mouse if i win too much money ill call attention to myself much better to make it in bits and pieces she stared at penelope and frowned weve got another problem too if word gets out that a little girl is picking winners were going to have some very unwanted company maybe we could do what we did on last chance suggested penelope i just told you i cant risk being a big winner no said the girl i meant the way we worked the card game you were the player and i signaled you maybe you could read the fortunes and i could signal you what to read the mouse considered her suggestion its a possibility she admitted at last and when no better possibility presented itself they spent the remainder of the afternoon going over an intricate set of signals by which penelope could give the mouse certain basic information about each client who visited her then at dusk the mouse hunted up the manager of the sideshow exhibits gave him a brief demonstration of her skills offered him a split for the carnival in exchange for the use of a booth plus their food and lodging and they were in business ten minutes later they spent the evening decorating their booth and creating a suitable costume for the mouse then ate a late dinner in the crews mess tent and collapsed on the cots that had been provided in the back of their booth they awoke early ate breakfast and then waited for the carnival to open penelope was so excited she could hardly stand still relax said the mouse they wont open the gates for another half hour yet i know said penelope but isnt it wonderful were working together again and look at all the colorful people and all the aliens a grifter by any other name said the mouse what the mouse smiled nothing im glad youre happy oh i am can we always work together mouse id much rather retire in luxury together said the mouse wryly but until that happy day were still a team the other carnival workers began gathering on the midway setting up their tents and booths about twothirds of them were gaudilydressed humans but there were canphorites lodinites mollutei domarians and just across from them running a game that seemed to make no sense was an alien of a race the mouse had never seen before it was bipedal covered with light green scales and seemed to have a gray shelllike hump that extended from the back of its neck to just above its buttocks it stood no taller than five feet but its thick body and heavy limbs gave an unmistakable impression of great strength the mouse nodded a greeting to it and it opened its horned beak in what she hoped was an answering smile then the gates opened and a new days throng of tourists invaded the carnival it took the mouse almost three hours to get her first client and two hours more for her second but when a to shot came in at the local racetrack and word went out that a fortune teller on the carnival grounds had predicted the victory they were soon lining up to speak to her she read the future for unhappy husbands and unfaithful wives hopeful gamblers and hopeless addicts the rich and the poor humans and aliens good beings and bad penelope was never more than ten yards away acting the part of her shill collecting her money urging bypassers to seek her services and then on the third morning right after she had given a lodinite the anticipated result of a heavyweight freehand match that would be held later in the day she looked up and saw a familiar bearded face staring at her you gave us a good run for our money ill grant you that said the yankee clipper without any animosity he held penelope firmly by the arm and obviously was pressing a hand weapon against her how did you find us said the mouse he chuckled just how many winners did you think you could give away before the press started suggesting there was some kind of racket going on here the mouse looked around for the pirates subordinates but couldnt spot them where are your men theyre hunting for you all over new gomorrah replied the yankee clipper some are at the track some are at the arena some are in the casinos but i thought id try the carnival and what better place for you to hide than right here as a fortune teller he smiled in amusement its like a deserter hiding out in the middle of a battlefield and now what demanded the mouse now youre free to go the mouse frowned i dont understand youre a bad influence on the child said the pirate im taking her back alone no cried penelope yes my dear said the yankee clipper i know that having the mouse around was supposed to make you more tractable but the fact of the matter is that she helped you to escape and thereby caused me considerable embarrassment to say nothing of the cost of hunting you down and he concluded since i plan to be rid of you within a day i really dont care whether your new ah host has the means to control you or not you cant separate us pleaded penelope i can and i will replied the pirate he turned to the mouse if you attempt to follow me please know that i will not hesitate to kill you the mouse stared at him helplessly her mind considering and rejecting various alternatives each more unlikely than the last finally her shoulders slumped and she emitted a soft sigh of defeat then as we have nothing further to say ill be taking my leave of you announced the yankee clipper tightening his grip on penelopes arm suddenly the broad scaled alien from across the aisle approached them i beg your pardon it said in heavilyaccented terran but i must speak to the soothsayer well i wont keep you from your work said the pirate with a grin he pulled penelope by the arm come along young lady no said the alien blocking their way i must speak to the soothsayer there she is said the yankee clipper gesturing toward the mouse now step aside i have been observing them for days continued the alien calmly i know which is the soothsayer and which is the imposter what you know doesnt interest me said the yankee clipper irritably it should said the alien for among the things i know is that you have made a serious mistake oh what mistake you may not lay hands on the soothsayer without her permission do you know who youre talking to demanded the yankee clipper yes replied the alien tranquilly a man who should have known better and just as calmly just as tranquilly the alien suddenly produced a weapon of a type that was totally unfamiliar to the mouse it aimed it at the pirate there was an almost inaudible humming sound and the yankee clipper collapsed dead on the ground the alien held out a hand to penelope come with me soothsayer it said gently i have been waiting for you penelope looked into the aliens hideous face with a happy smile my friend she said part the mock turtles book it seemed reptilian but in truth it was neither a reptile nor in any other way analogous to any life form with which the mouse was acquainted its powerful limbs and thick torso seemed masculine but it did not possess a gender or at least not in a way that any human could comprehend it had killed the yankee clipper in an act of coldblooded murder but its behavior was polite and wellmannered and almost deferential where penelope was concerned its name was unpronounceable so the mouse looked at its green scales and grayish hump and soft beak and doublelidded eyes and decided to call it the mock turtle it neither approved nor disapproved but it answered to the name and that was really all that mattered since its weapon had made no noise and attracted no attention it simply summoned a doctor when the pirate fell to the ground and during the ensuing confusion the mock turtle waited patiently for penelope to retrieve maryanne from the booth then took her by the hand and calmly led her out the carnivals gate the mouse quickly took their money from the cash box and followed them to the gate from there they took a courtesy vehicle to the spaceport and walked directly to the mock turtles ship the mouse was certain they would be spotted by one of the yankee clippers men but penelope showed no sign of fear or tension and a short time later they had left calliope far behind them and were heading deeper into the inner frontier we will have to put down on a human colony soon announced the mock turtle after they had cleared calliopes star system the three of them were sitting in the ships cockpit which had not been designed with humans in mind the ceiling was much too low and the chairs were built for beings with the mock turtles hump the colors even on the control panels and computer keys were so washed out that the mouse decided that the race that designed the ship saw colors very differently from the way that human beings saw them i have no foodstuffs that would be suitable for men continued the alien then you werent expecting us asked the mouse no then why did you help us she is the soothsayer said the mock turtle the mouse frowned what does that have to do with anything does your religion anticipate some soothsayer my religion is a private matter answered the alien calmly but in tones that implied the subject was closed then i must repeat my question said the mouse trying to make herself comfortable on the alien chair why did you help us the mock turtle turned to the little girl you are penelope bailey are you not yes said penelope propping up maryanne next to her on the broad seat that is why you sound like just another bounty hunter said the mouse but that cant be first you didnt know we were going to show up on calliope and second penelope trusts you that is true agreed the mock turtle tranquilly i did not anticipate your arrival on calliope and i am very trustworthy then perhaps youd like to tell me what your interest in us is i am not interested in you at all you are a very difficult person to talk to said the mouse in frustrated tones i am not a person at all replied the alien i am a it uttered a word the mouse had never heard and could not pronounce but you may call me the mock turtle all right mock turtle said the mouse lets try again why are you interested in penelope she is the soothsayer you keep saying that snapped the mouse it is the truth penelope giggled as the mouse tried to control her temper why do you care whether or not shes the soothsayer continued the mouse because if she is not i have killed a man for no reason answered the mock turtle why did you kill the man and dont say its because she is the soothsayer the mock turtle remained silent well demanded the mouse you instructed me not to answer you explained the alien patiently you are driving me crazy said the mouse she started to stamp her foot in anger but quickly stopped when she realized that the act would upset her balance and cause her to slide back into the hollow that had been made to accomodate the aliens shell cant you just explain in nice simple terms why you felt it incumbent upon you to rescue her certainly you had not asked that before the mouse resisted the urge to argue the point and waited for the alien to continue speaking my world is not a member of the democracy said the mock turtle nor is it a member of the confederation we have been nonaligned for many centuries even before there was a confederation and even longer before the democracy replaced the republic what has this got to do with penelope you have asked said the mock turtle with no show of annoyance allow me to answer sorry said the mouse go ahead my world wishes only to remain neutral we desire no commerce or treaty with any other world or any other race the alien paused as if translating its thoughts into terran concepts we would resist any effort to assimilate us it paused again men have always hungered for new worlds the day is not far off that they will hunger for mine thus far we have been able to maintain our neutrality by balancing one force against the other but if the men who rule the democracy obtain the services of the soothsayer they will eventually destroy the confederation and then the day will come when they no longer request us to join them but instead demand it shes just a child protested the mouse she can barely keep one jump ahead of the people who are chasing her how can you possibly believe that she could alter the outcome of galactic power struggles children grow up the mouse stared at the mock turtle for a long moment trying without success to discern a facial expression it doesnt sound to me like you have any intention of allowing her to grow up she said slowly the only way you can be sure she doesnt fall into your enemies hands is to kill her that is because you are a fool said the alien calmly its all right mouse said penelope laying a hand on the mouses arm the mock turtle is my friend he sure as hell doesnt sound like a friend answered the mouse you are mistaken said the mock turtle then suppose you tell me what you plan to do with us insisted the mouse i will take you to my home world where you will be safe will we be guests or prisoners or do you consider the two terms synonymous you will be guests said the mock turtle she is the soothsayer we could not keep her prisoner even if we wanted to and well be free to leave whenever we want persisted the mouse you will be free to leave whenever you want then why not set us down on a human world now you will not be safe on any nearby world answered the mock turtle the mouse turned to the girl penelope its true she said the yankee clippers men are looking for us already all right said the mouse facing the mock turtle once again so we land on your planet then what then i hope to convince the soothsayer that we are a peaceful race that means no harm so that when she returns to her own people she will instruct them not to force us to join their democracy shes eight years old for gods sake said the mouse nobody will listen to her no matter what she says the alien stared at her but made no comment well continued the mouse do you disagree i have already told you that you are a fool said the mock turtle gently repeating it can only serve to anger you the mouse turned to penelope again are you absolutely sure this creature is our friend i am her friend said the mock turtle while i wish you no ill i care no more for you than you care for me he saved us didnt he said penelope i am not a he soothsayer interjected the alien but you may refer to me as a male if it pleases you i dont care said penelope youre my friend thats all that matters what were you doing on calliope in the first place if you werent waiting for penelope asked the mouse i was waiting for penelope answered the mock turtle i thought you said you didnt know we were going to be on calliope said the mouse sharply that is true then how could you be waiting for us my ship developed engine trouble near the calliope system and i was forced to land there to seek repairs since my planets currency is not accepted on calliope i was forced to obtain work so that i could pay for the repairs its working fine now and no one tried to stop us so obviously you had paid for the repairs before we met that is true answered the alien but i also had to pay for my food and lodging and i would not have had enough currency for that until tomorrow so what does that have to do with waiting for penelope it is obvious to me that the soothsayer arranged for me to land on calliope and to remain there until i could be of service to her thats ridiculous said the mouse she didnt even know who you were or where youd be ask her said the mock turtle penelope said the mouse turning to the little girl and staring at her questioningly is he telling the truth penelope shifted uncomfortably on her chair sort of she said at last the mouse stared intently at penelope what do you mean sort of she asked at last i knew there was a good person on the planet one who would be our friend said penelope i wanted him to stay until we could meet him she paused trying to order her thoughts i didnt know it was the mock turtle or what he looked like but i thought it wasnt a human and somehow i thought hed be in new gomorrah and once we got there i knew hed be at the carnival but he was working right across the midway from us for two days and you didnt recognize him we didnt need him until the yankee clipper came but you had nothing to do with his landing on calliope in the first place i dont think so said penelope dont you know the little girl shook her head i have all these strange pictures in my mind i still dont understand most of them as the soothsayer grows so will her powers said the mock turtle she will grow in peace and tranquility on my world the alien turned to penelope if she so desires and if she doesnt desire it asked the mouse then she will be free to leave it would be nice not to be hunted any more replied penelope lets see what his world is like before we start making any longterm plans said the mouse skeptically it is an oxygen world with very low levels of pollution and a gravity minimally greater than your own said the mock turtle the seas are green the grass a rich golden hue the mountains tall and majestic and snowcapped most of our fauna is extinct but we have set aside vast reserves for those remaining specimens so that we may someday repopulate the planet with their descendants what do you call your world asked the mouse the mock turtle mouthed an unpronounceable alien word in your language it continued it would translate as summergold it paused thoughtfully it is quite the most beautiful place in the galaxy if its so beautiful what were you doing flying a spaceship light years away from it searching for the soothsayer answer the mock turtle placidly how did you even know there was a soothsayer to search for demanded the mouse word had reached us that a human child had the power of precognition and that she and a companion were at large on the inner frontier further investigation revealed to us that her name was penelope bailey and that she had last been seen in the company of a notorious gambler known as king tout the alien paused we knew that governments and powerful individuals would be seeking her for their own purposes and we determined to find her first its a big galaxy said the mouse how did you expect to find her with no more information than that to go on i didnt i dont think i understand i expected her to find me said the mock turtle why asked the mouse surprised because i alone of all those who searched for her meant her no harm and based on your goodwill and nothing else you expected her to seek you out replied the mouse thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard she did in fact seek me out did she not replied the alien gently the mouse had no answer for that and so fell silent are there any children i can play with on summergold asked penelope after a moment had passed it shall be arranged soothsayer said the alien good said penelope enthusiastically i finally got to play with some girls on calliope and suddenly she froze and a look of fear crossed her face what is it penelope asked the mouse its him she said him the iceman hes after us already who is the iceman asked the mock turtle a bad man said penelope all the others want to capture me but he wants to kill me he will not be successful soothsayer then why does he frighten me so asked penelope tears welling up in her eyes because you are a child and do not yet realize what it means to be the soothsayer answered the mock turtle we shall protect you on summergold while you grow tall and strong and confront your destiny whatever it may be in the meantime what kind of armaments does this ship carry asked the mouse none said the alien this is not a military ship how far are we from summergold the mock turtle pressed a button then read the symbols that instantly appeared on the glowing screen of its computer perhaps two galactic standard days and if we dont stop for food on a colony planet the soothsayer is only a child noted the alien she must have sustenance dont you have a deepsleep chamber asked the mouse you can freeze us until we arrive this is but a small private ship i have no deepsleep facilities the mouse turned to penelope how close are they i dont know answered the girl forget the food said the mouse its not worth the risk were only a few hours out from calliope if their ship is even marginally faster theyll catch us if we stop there is no need for guesswork said the mock turtle calmly it turned to penelope is it safe to stop soothsayer no said penelope can you survive without food for two days continued the alien yes does your race drink water asked the mouse yes i will have my ships galley modify it to human tastes the mock turtle instructed its navigational computer to lay in a direct course for summergold then went to the cramped galley to supervise the filtration of the waters trace minerals hell never stop said penelope plaintively why cant he leave me alone mouse are you sure hes coming after you to kill you asked the mouse maybe he thinks the mock turtle has stolen you and he and the forever kid want to rescue us i dont know said penelope he doesnt know youre not thinking clearly penelope either he wants to kill you or rescue you he wouldnt be chasing us if he didnt know which he still doesnt know if hell kill me said penelope but he thinks i should die she turned and faced the mouse why she sobbed what did i ever do to him nothing said the mouse she frowned once again furious at herself for ever having cared for him you know maybe its time we considered doing something to him i dont want to hurt anyone i just want to be left alone sometimes you cant always have what you want said the mouse or at least sometimes you cant have it right away its not fair said penelope cuddling maryanne to her no its not said the mouse grimly still maybe our lucks about to change youve found another friend and maybe well be safe once we get to summergold i get so tired mouse said penelope the mouse put an arm around her i know will you always be with me always penelope leaned her head against the mouses small bosom and a moment later had fallen into a fitful disturbed sleep the soothsayer trusts you said the mock turtle returning to the cockpit with two containers of water yes she does then perhaps you are not a fool after all thanks said the mouse sardonically i hope you will urge her to remain on our planet said the mock turtle ill have to see what its like first she needs time to grow free from all external pressures continued the alien the mouse looked down at the sleeping child and stroked her blonde hair shes had a rough time of it thats for sure summergold will offer her peace and sanctuary no one ever offers anything for free said the mouse i told you what our interest in her is i know you did replied the mouse now ill have to decide whether i believe you or not she will know if i should ever lie to you said the mock turtle you might consider that while you are making your decision ill take it under advisement they spent the next hour in silence for neither had anything further to say to the other then penelope awoke and the mock turtle gave her the container of water and then the little girl and the mouse played a number of very simple word games to fill the time and take her mind off the iceman they slept again and awoke again and drank again and then when the ship had approached to within nine hours of summergold the mock turtle activated its subspace radio and reported its position and its cargo concluding with its estimated time of arrival there was a momentary silence as the message was transmitted and then a reply came back over the speaker system the alien spoke again waited for another reply and deactivated the radio finally it turned to penelope i am sorry soothsayer it said but we cannot land on summergold why not asked the mouse we have been denied permission why because even now several ships are approaching my planet each filled with bounty hunters or members of the democracys military we are not powerful enough to deny them access to summergold nor can we risk disobeying the democracys official representatives and hence we cannot protect the soothsayers safety what are we supposed to do then demanded the mouse we must alter our course and go deeper into the inner frontier it wont help said the mouse every one of those ships left calliope after we did if some of them are already approaching summergold theyre obviously faster than we are theres no way we can outrun them my ship possesses a summergold registry and doubtless someone at the carnival was able to identify my race the alien paused it was much easier for them to anticipate that i would attempt to return to summergold than it will be for them to predict my next action for the simple reason that i do not know where we are going didnt your people give you any instructions except to run away demanded the mouse most certainly they did replied the mock turtle calmly they gave me the best possible instruction indeed the only possible instruction i dont suppose youd like to share it with us she said sarcastically it is essential that i share it with you answered the mock turtle they told me to ask the soothsayer where to go and to follow her orders it turned to penelope and awaited her decision penelope stared at the computer simulation of the inner frontier this one she said pointing to a whitegold star that is alpha tremino also known as mccallister after the human member of the pioneer corps who terraformed the second planet circling it said the mock turtle translating the alien script that appeared on the screen when he entered the coordinates of the star that planet is now known as mccallister ii the system possesses six other planets the inner planet is highly radioactive and the other five are gas giants none of them are capable of sustaining life it squinted at the readout mccallister ii possesses one tradertown which is located in the southern temperate zone it was mined for uranium until two centuries ago and is now used primarily as a refueling station for ships bound deeper into the inner frontier how long will it take to reach it asked the mouse the alien queried its navigational computer approximately six standard hours and how about our pursuers she continued how long will it take them we will gain three or four hours on most of them as they are closer to summergold than we are then lay in a course for mccallister ii i did that the moment the soothsayer selected it replied the alien the mouse turned to penelope do you know anything about mccallister no maybe i worded that wrong said the mouse she paused can you see what will happen to us there no repeated penelope then why did you choose it penelope shrugged i just have a feeling about it well your feelings have been good enough so far said the mouse with a sigh the alien went to the galley and brought them two more containers of water thank you said penelope accepting the container mccallister ii is a human colony said the mock turtle you will be able to obtain food there soothsayer i hope its good said penelope im very hungry i am sorry soothsayer i would give you my own if you could metabolize it i know you would the girl stared thoughtfully at the alien perhaps youd better pack some of your own food why soothsayer asked the mock turtle you might need it i shall do so soothsayer said the alien heading off to the galley once more what was that all about asked the mouse i just think the mock turtle will need some food before long said penelope hes got a whole galley full of food penelope didnt answer her and when the mouse looked to see if she had heard her she saw a look of intense concentration on the little girls face she is reading the future said the mock turtle returning from the galley sorting it out anyway agreed the mouse penelope remained motionless for almost five minutes and finally the mouse reached out a hand and shook her shoulder what is it asked the girl you looked like you were in a trance said the mouse ive never seen you like that and i got worried im fine penelope assured her what were you doing trying to look ahead youve never gone catatonic before whats catatonic rigid and motionless as if you didnt know where you were or who you were with i was looking farther than usual so i had to concentrate real hard explained penelope did you see anything yes well said the mouse i saw us land on mccallister ii said penelope and the man at the spaceport is going to be very nice to us hes going to give me a sandwich and some fruit and a cup of tea does anyone else land while were there that depends on how long we stay answered penelope most of them know weve changed our course how many ships are following us now lots including carlos and the kid yes said penelope but they wont catch us before we reach mccallister how long will we stay on mccallister ii asked the mouse penelope frowned i dont know an hour a day a week it depends on what i tell the mock turtle said penelope and i have to decide if its right or wrong to tell him to tell him what i have to decide repeated penelope falling silent a moment later she was cuddling maryanne as if for comfort five hours later the mock turtle began braking its ship to sublight speed and twenty minutes after that it set the ship down at the small spaceport just beyond the tradertown i shall add fuel to the ships reservoirs while you seek nourishment announced the mock turtle as the three of them climbed through the hatch dont said penelope who had taken maryanne out of the ship with her the mouse was startled but the alien merely inclined its head it shall be as you wish soothsayer it said i will wait for you here please come with us said penelope we shouldnt be separated now the mock turtle fell into step behind them without another word they entered the spaceports small restaurant and the waiter was as pleasant as penelope had predicted while they were waiting for their food the mouse turned to the girl all right she said are you ready to tell me whats going on yes said penelope unhappily she paused we have to do a bad thing what thing we have to steal a spaceship i thought that was what you had in mind said the mouse i dont want to said penelope its wrong to steal but if we dont change ships theyll catch us very soon the waiter returned with their order and the mouse remained silent until he had once more moved out of earshot will changing ships fool all of them she asked most of them replied penelope theyll all find out what we did but by then well be so far away that they wont be able to follow us they have subspace radios said the mouse why wont they stay in contact with each other because each of them wants the reward for me answered penelope none of them will help any of the others to catch me which ship must we appropriate soothsayer asked the mock turtle that one said penelope pointing to a sleek blue ship that was standing poised for takeoff on the field beyond the hangars the blue one asked the mouse yes its right out in the open she said dubiously maybe wed be better off taking a different one you must not dispute the soothsayer said the mock turtle calmly she has foreseen that we need this particular ship that is all we have to know im not disputing her answered the mouse defensively id just like to know why she chose that one most of the others have people aboard them said penelope or else they arent fast enough or they need fuel penelope finished her sandwich and started picking pieces of fruit out of her fruit cup this is very good she said but i dont like my tea very much can i have some milk instead yes soothsayer said the mock turtle getting to its feet and walking off to find the waiter i wish hed call me penelope the little girl confided to the mouse i feel funny when he calls me soothsayer well thats what you are you know said the mouse a soothsayer is someone who can see the future it doesnt work that way said penelope you see lots of futures and then you try to make the one you want happen she looked at the mouses plate you only ate half your sandwich arent you hungry ill take the other half along with me answered the mouse what i mostly am is anxious to get moving again weve still got thirty ships closing in on us they wont catch us mouse said penelope as the mock turtle returned carrying a glass of milk not on mccallister anyway just the same ill feel a lot more secure once were back in space said the mouse were not ready to leave yet said penelope she smiled at the mock turtle thank you for the milk when will we be ready to leave asked the mouse in a few minutes she drained the glass of milk that was very good i like milk youre not being very communicative said the mouse trying to keep the irritation from her voice i dont know what that means i mean youre not telling me what youre thinking im sorry mouse apologized penelope i was just thinking that id like to get maryanne a lace dress the ones that we had sent up to our suite on calliope were nice but she needs something really pretty the mouse sighed deeply all right have it your way you look mad mouse said penelope with a worried expression on her face did i do something wrong the soothsayer cannot by definition do anything wrong said the mock turtle its voice as placid as ever im not mad just frustrated said the mouse what did i say asked penelope its what you didnt say explained the mouse i know you have a reason for not going to the ship right now just as you had a reason for landing on mccallister ii and for wanting to steal that particular ship but i cant see the future and since the only thing i know for sure is that all those bounty hunters are getting closer to us with each passing minute id like to know why were sitting here and exactly what were waiting for oh is that all said penelope relieved that she had not done something more serious to offend the mouse do you see the fat man in the leather tunic whos sitting at the far end of the restaurant the mouse glanced quickly across the restaurant yes its his ship that were stealing said penelope in about five or six minutes hes going to get up from his table and walk into the bathroom hell be there a long time and we can just walk out across the field and get into the ship and leave wont he report us to spaceport security penelope shook her head hes got something on the ship he doesnt want anyone to know about hell buy another ship and try to find us himself but he wont report us whats he smuggling asked the mouse drugs money i dont know and security wont stop us hes already given them money not to pay any attention to the ship theyll think were working for him she looked at the mouse with a worried expression on her face do you like me again now of course i like you the mouse assured her i just get a little upset when i cant see what you can see i wish i couldnt see it said penelope earnestly then maybe everyone would leave me alone you have been blessed with a great gift soothsayer said the mock turtle in time you will learn to appreciate it penelope seemed about to argue with the alien then shrugged and went back to picking pieces of fruit out of the cup a few minutes later the heavyset man got to his feet and walked to the restroom as soon as he was out of sight the mouse penelope and the mock turtle rose from their seats and casually walked out to the ship its not locked said penelope as they approached the hatch the hatch door slid back as they came within range of the ships sensor and one by one they climbed into the interior of the ship it was considerably larger than the mock turtles vessel and was designed for human occupants there was a cockpit of course and a wellequipped galley two sleeping cabins and a locked storage compartment the controls are unfamiliar to me said the mock turtle after examining the instrumentation and while i can speak terran i have great difficulty reading it no problem said the mouse moving past him into the cockpit and seating herself on the pilots chair its computer has a gorshen blomberg module we just tell it what we want and it takes care of the rest she turned to her companions strap yourselves in they took off less than a minute later and ten minutes after that the computer announced that it was ready to break out of orbit and attain light speeds time for a decision said the mouse ive got to give the navigational computer a destination soothsayer said the mock turtle turning to penelope and awaiting her decision i dont know the name of the world said penelope the mouse ordered the computer to create a holographic map of the inner frontier all right she announced this is summergold this is mccallister and thats last chance way over there the little girl studied the simulation for a long moment finally she extended an index finger and pointed to a distant star that had no near neighbors this one she said the mouse instructed the navigational computer to lay in a course for the indicated star then asked for a readout where are we bound asked the mock turtle the star is called bowman replied the mouse a curious name the mouse squinted at the readout it was the th star system mapped by pioneer milton bowman almost years ago the third of its five planets was colonized in ge and was initially named van der gelt iii after the man who financed the colonization initially asked the mock turtle then its name has been changed she nodded the entire colony was slaughtered by a madman named conrad bland in ge which was when it received the name its now known by killhaven does anyone reside there now lets see said the mouse looking at the readout again yes it was deserted for almost three millennia but now its got a couple of hundred farmers and a small religious group trying to create their own utopia based on an agricultural community from the days when we were still earthbound i gather than the planet itself is very scenic and most of the dwellings were designed to look like victorian farmhouses from old earth theres nothing in the readout about a tradertown but i suppose there must be one killhavens so far off the beaten track that i imagine the cartographers are a few years behind the times the mock turtle had no more questions and the mouse ordered the holographic map to dissolve then she left the cockpit and made her way back to the storage compartment now lets see exactly what kind of contraband were carrying she said the alien showed no interest in helping her but penelope with a childs curiosity joined her at the door to the compartment the mouse ordered the computer to unlock the door it replied that it could not do so without the proper code damn she muttered i guess well have to do it the hard way she looked around for a tool kit found one and spent the next two hours tinkering with the lock mechanism all the while wishing that merlin to whom no lock was a mystery had not joined the opposition finally when she was all but ready to admit defeat she heard a faint beeping sound and the door slid back into a bulkhead she crouched over and entered the lowceilinged compartment well how about this she exclaimed a moment later four bags of alphanella seeds what are alphanella seeds asked penelope a hallucinogenic drug theyre outlawed everywhere in the democracy and on most of the frontier worlds as well a what kind of drug hallucinogenic repeated the mouse when you chew on the seed you go into a trace and see all kinds of strange things as often as not the experience kills you but if you survive the first time youre an addict the rest of your life you forget to eat you dont sleep all you do it chase after the seeds why would anyone want to chew the seeds then the mouse shrugged the ultimate thrill she said without much conviction dont ask me i never did understand seed chewers she patted the bags fondly then walked back out of the storage compartment alphanella seeds whod have thought it what difference does it make said the mock turtle none of us will partake of them in case its escaped your attention she pointed out were not exactly swimming in money ive got about credits left from calliope and i suspect you have even less that is true admitted the alien well then these bags must be worth a few hundred thousand credits apiece what do you say i say leave them aboard the ship replied the mock turtle they will destroy anyone who uses them the way i look at it anyone stupid enough to become a seed chewer deserves whatever happens to him said the mouse with a shrug let us ask the soothsayer thats not fair said the mouse heatedly if she says no well be stuck on a strange world with no money and half a dozen bounty hunters chasing us and if she says yes youll have made her an active participant in drug dealing no child should have to make such a decision she is the soothsayer replied the mock turtle she will choose correctly he turned expectantly toward the little girl we should leave the alphanella seeds where we found them said penelope without hesitation but weve barely got enough money to get by for a few days on killhaven said the mouse we wont need it what about when we leave insisted the mouse well have to have money then were not leaving killhaven said penelope but were still being followed i know then why began the mouse because its time to stop running away said penelope it wasnt a tradertown not as the mouse understood tradertowns it was just a little cluster of buildings a restaurant a general store a farm implement shop a seed warehouse a church and a twostory frame rooming house there wasnt even a street just a dirt track that passed in front of the buildings and it was so filled with ruts that the few vehicles they saw drove about ten feet to the right of it this is a hell of a place to make a stand against a couple of dozen bounty hunters muttered the mouse as they walked the mile from their spaceship to the town you must have faith in the soothsayers judgment said the mock turtle placidly let the first five ships crash and ill have a lot more faith remarked the mouse caustically as they passed a pasture of mutated beef cattle each weighing close to pounds grazing contently on the native grasses penelope walked up to the wire fence to stare at them theyre lovely said the little girl theyre just cows said the mouse a little bigger than most but no smarter ill wager can i pet one mouse asked penelope i dont know why not replied the mouse youll know better than me if its safe or not thank you penelope leaned up against the fence and called to the cattle most of them ignored her but a calf almost as large as a fullgrown earth cow stared at her with large curious eyes and finally came over to the fence hes very nice said penelope rubbing the calfs broad forehead between its eyes i think he likes me im sure he does said the mouse penelope petted the calf for another minute then rejoined the mouse and the mock turtle as they began walking toward the buildings again the calf followed them on its side of the fence until it could go no further then began bleating plaintively and finally returned to its gargantuan mother i wonder if all the animals are that big said penelope i doubt it answered the mouse probably just the meat animals penelope frowned i hope nobody wants to eat him when he grows up perhaps they wont said the mouse reassuringly im sure they keep some for breeding wouldnt it be nice it we could come back here someday and see him all grown up and pet one of his children said the little girl ill settle for just getting off the planet in one piece said the mouse they walked past fields of corn and sugar berries and finally came to what passed for the town what shall we do now soothsayer asked the mock turtle oblivious to the curious stares it elicited from within the various shops now we wait answered penelope right here asked the mouse surprised no said penelope they wont be here for awhile good said the mouse then lets rent some rooms i could do with a shower me too said penelope she examined her doll thoughtfully and maryannes all covered with dust the mouse headed for the rooming house and entered it a moment later it seemed much like the farmhouses of ancient earth it was made of wood and the floor was covered with an inexpensive rug rather than carpeted the furniture was sturdy and functional but far from elegant and despite the displays of fresh flowers there was a scent and feeling of mustiness about the place a floorboard creaked as she walked up to the registration desk which in this case was simply a wooden table with a thin weatherworn elderly man sitting behind it how much are your rooms asked the mouse eighty credits a night one hundred if you want the one with its own bathroom wed like three rooms please she said as penelope and the mock turtle entered the house including the one with its own bath only got two said the man your green friend will have to make other arrangements well take two then said the mouse with a shrug the little girl and i can double up only got one in that case if you dont accept aliens why dont you post a sign to that effect demanded the mouse thats the first alien ive seen in almost thirty years answered the man only been renting out rooms for the last seventeen since theres no sign to the contrary well take two rooms said the mouse firmly i only got one to rent said the man look said the mouse weve come a long way and were tired and hungry we want two rooms i know what you want said he man you keep it up and you might find yourself sleeping out in a cornfield you keep it up and you might start wondering what your ugly little world looked like when your head was still attached to your shoulders the mouse felt a hand tug at the sleeve of her tunic offer him more money said penelope why should i said the mouse he hasnt posted any restrictions mouse just do it said penelope wearily the mouse shrugged and turned back to the old man five hundred credits a night for two rooms a thousand replied the man the mouse was about to protest but penelope squeezed her hand and nodded her approval all right a thousand in advance the mouse dug into the pouch where she kept her valuables pulled out a thousand credits and slapped them down on the table up the stairs said the old man indicating a wooden staircase first two rooms on the left where are our keys demanded the mouse wheres your luggage thats none of your business the old man seemed to consider her answer then opened a drawer and pulled out two keys thanks said the mouse sardonically if you dont like our service you can always go to our competitors said the old man you could use a little competition snapped the mouse we got some he replied with a broad grin another boarding house halfway around the planet just a good stretch of the legs the mouse picked up the keys and led the way upstairs when she reached the landing she handed one of the keys to the mock turtle why didnt you say anything she demanded still furious what was there to say responded the alien placidly ive seen you shoot the yankee clipper down in cold blood so dont tell me that youve been taught to turn the other cheek why didnt you stand up for your rights the soothsayer did not instruct me to argue and if the soothsayer tells you to jump off the edge of a cliff will you do so most certainly replied the mock turtle the mouse muttered an obscenity and entered her room followed by penelope the mock turtle watched her for a moment then entered its own room the mouses room contained two narrow beds a dresser with a large mirror a rocking chair a pair of small throw rugs one between the beds the other just outside the door to the bathroom and each wall was covered with twodimensional photographs of the old man at the desk an equally aged woman and number of middleaged men and women and children of various ages from infancy to young adulthood which the mouse assumed were their children and grandchildren theres no holo set noted penelope im surprised theres a window said the mouse she sighed deeply well lets see what the facilities are like she walked to the bathroom door and waited impatiently open she commanded the door remained shut try the handle said penelope the mouse reached for the doors hand and twisted it ill be damned she said do you know how long its been since ive seen one of these she entered the bathroom grimaced when she discovered that there was no dryshower walked to the tub said hot waited for a moment then shook her head in disbelief and turned the faucet how do people live like this she muttered she bathed dried herself and got back into her clothes then rejoined penelope in the bedroom i dont think id better wash maryanne in real water said penelope sitting crosslegged on her bed and looking thoughtfully at the doll i was hoping the bathroom would have a dryshower the mouse sat down on her own bed we have more important things to worry about she said i know answered penelope seriously when will they start arriving soon today i think so how many of them today just one ship can you tell whos aboard it yet not yet carlos and the kid perhaps penelope frowned i hope not if youre still afraid of him why are we sitting here waiting for him asked the mouse puzzled i told you were all through running away why here why werent we all through running away on calliope or mccallister penelope shrugged it just feels right here well said the mouse with a sigh i suppose it makes sense after all most of the ships that were chasing us got left behind at mccallister she paused i wonder what would happen if we went back to the ship right now and took off again how many more of them would we lose theyd catch us before we reached the next world and kill us said penelope no they wouldnt youre much too valuable to kill they wouldnt mean to said the little girl theyd try to disable the ship but its not very sturdy the first time it was hit all three of us would die so thats why were through running penelope nodded her head shit said the mouse i was hoping it was because you saw some way to make them finally stop chasing us i didnt realize it was because wed die if we kept running away penelope sighed deeply whatever happens here at least it will finally be over she said im so tired i know said the mouse sympathetically there was a momentary silence as penelope continued brushing dust from the doll finally she turned to the mouse can we eat now sure said the mouse i dont know if the restaurant has any food the mock turtle can eat though it will hurt his feelings if we dont ask him to come said penelope if he has any feelings said the mouse remembering the little scene at the desk everyone has feelings mouse said penelope the mouse sighed and tousled the girls blonde hair i know she said i guess im just tired too they left their room and knocked on the mock turtles door the alien emerged a moment later have they arrived it asked were hungry said penelope were going across the street to eat at the restaurant would you like to come with us if you so wish it soothsayer said the mock turtle i think we should stay together said penelope they walked down the stairs and past the desk which was now deserted the mouse opened the door almost stepped on a small catlike marsupial that had been sunning itself and headed off toward the restaurant followed closely by penelope and the alien mouse said penelope when they had covered half the distance what is it whatever they charge us for the food pay it but the turtle cant even eat human food said the mouse she turned to the alien can you no answered the mock turtle so why should i let them overcharge us continued the mouse if they object to his presence he can wait outside pay it said penelope its not polite to make him wait outside at this rate well be out of money by tomorrow night said the mouse im sure the turtle will understand we wont need the money by tomorrow night said penelope why not because whatevers going to happen will be over by then lets be optimistic and assume were all going to live through it said the mouse if we do well need money if we do then youll take if off the bodies of the people who dont live answered penelope dismissing the subject she climbed the steps of the restaurants broad veranda then paused to look at a wooden porch swing thats very nice she said can i sit on it when were through eating i dont know why not said the mouse still preoccupied with what the girl had just said about the impending events they entered the restaurant which consisted of eight tables all empty each covered with an inexpensive faded tablecloth a pudgy middleaged woman walked out from another room and approached them can i help you she said coldly regarding the mock turtle with open contempt wed like to have lunch said penelope too late for lunch said the woman dinner then said the mouse too early for dinner the mouse walked to a table and seated herself well wait she announced signaling penelope and the mock turtle to join her the woman disappeared into the room from which she had emerged then came out again a moment later all weve got is stew she said what kind of salad do you have asked the mouse i said all weve got is stew whats it made of beef and vegetables said the woman can you make more if you have to i suppose so do you plan to eat twelve pounds of it no but i want you to take some of those vegetables you would use to make more stew and make me a salad said the mouse you ever have a salad made of potatoes before asked the woman with a harsh laugh no and i dont plan to have one now however long it takes to make a simple salad ill wait she paused well all wait id like some stew please added penelope the woman jerked a thumb in the mock turtles direction what does it eat nothing thank you said the alien the woman turned on her heel and left the room ive never seen a place like this said the mouse youd think theyd never met an alien before probably most of them havent said the mock turtle killhaven is an insular isolated world then they ought to be curious it is my experience that your race manifests its curiosity in unusual ways said the alien with no show of emotion this experience is not unfamiliar to me then why are you risking your life to save one of us asked the mouse suddenly feeling defensive because she is the soothsayer said the mock turtle as if explaining the obvious to a small child the pudgy woman suddenly reappeared placed a garden salad before the mouse and a plate of stew in front of penelope without uttering a word then turned to leave wed like some water too said the mouse she glared at the mouse then left and returned with two glasses of water a moment later thank you said penelope as she left again the mouse began eating her salad made a face and searched through it for a sign of dressing she couldnt find any and finally she shrugged and continued eating you know she remarked i get the distinct feeling that theyre not very happy to see any of us they lead very rigid insular lives said the mock turtle we have disrupted them but we cant be the only visitors theyve ever seen said the mouse after all they do have a hotel and a restaurant they are probably patronized by farmers who come to town to shop for seeds and supplies and by offplanet agents who come here to buy the crops perhaps said the mouse we make an unlikely party continued the mock turtle furthermore you and i are both heavily armed nor did we announce our arrival in advance well i hope theyre no more hospitable to the others when they show up said the mouse suddenly she grinned maybe theyll all starve to death trying to get service here as if on cue the pudgy woman returned to the dining room thatll be five hundred credits cash she announced five hundred credits for one bowl of salad and one plate of stew demanded the mouse if you dont like the price you shouldnt have eaten the food said the woman mouse said penelope softly the mouse looked at the little girl then pulled some bills out of her money pouch how much of a tip do you think we should leave she asked caustically i dont want any tip from you said the woman just pay up and leave the mouse handed over the money well leave when were ready to she said the woman glared at her when the shooting starts just see to it that youre not in my restaurant what shooting asked the mouse dont play dumb with me said the woman we heard on the subspace radio that theres a bunch of bounty hunters bound for killhaven since no one here has broken any laws it stands to reason that youre the ones theyre after she paused i want you out of my restaurant if we had any police here id turn you in myself i told you said the mouse coldly well leave when were ready penelope reached across the table and laid a hand on the mouses wrist its all right mouse im through eating all right said the mouse getting to her feet lets go try out that swing i dont want to any more said penelope dont let her frighten you said the mouse still angry im not afraid of her mouse youre sure you dont want to sit on the swing im sure answered the girl the mouse shrugged all right she said lets go back to our room they left the dining room walked out the door and started climbing down the steps of the veranda well maybe it wasnt xenophobia after all said the mouse maybe it wasnt only xenophobia the mock turtle corrected her they began walking back to the rooming house when they were in the middle of the dirt street separating the two buildings penelope suddenly froze in her tracks what is it asked the mouse solicitously hes here already he penelope stared fixedly at a point just beyond the mouses left shoulder him she whispered the mouse turned and saw two men standing at the door of the hotel one was the forever kid hello mouse said the other you led us one hell of a chase hello carlos said the mouse come no closer said the mock turtle and who are you demanded the iceman i am a friend of the soothsayer replied the alien that is enough for you to know so shes the soothsayer now and i am in her service if she was anyone else in the galaxy i would say that she needed all the friends she could get said the iceman i suppose you know that half a dozen ships are due to land before nightfall yes but you are the only one she fears said the mock turtle keep your distance hes not going to touch the little girl said the forever kid he turned to the mouse im still on your payroll i figure that includes protecting the girl he paused unless you want the rest of your money back that is keep the money said the mouse as an enormous surge of relief swept over her youre still working for me well iceman said the kid we havent settled what we were going to do when we caught up with them it seems to me that its about time we found out where you stand we have time yet said the iceman anything we decide right now is going to be disputed by a dozen or more bounty hunters if we start shooting each other there will be that many less of us to stand against them why should we believe you carlos demanded the mouse the iceman stared into the little girls eyes tell them he said hes not going to do anything to me at least until were safe from the others said penelope what about later asked the mouse i dont know the mouse turned to face the iceman once again carlos she doesnt know because i dont know he replied im still wondering if i can trust you said the mouse it is impossible for the soothsayer to err said the mock turtle tranquilly it began walking toward the rooming house come let us go inside and make our plans we are very visible targets here on the street the iceman nodded his agreement and the five of them entered the rooming house the old man was back at the desk no rooms left he said sullenly were all sold out we dont want a room replied the iceman we dont allow visitors the iceman stared at the old man for a long moment leave he said at last this is my rooming house dont make me say it again said the iceman he didnt raise his voice if anything he spoke even more softly but there was something in his tone that convinced the old man to get up and walk out the door without saying another word at the same time the mouse became aware of penelope pressing very hard against her hip and leg as if she were trying to keep the mouse between herself and the iceman weve got a little time said the iceman about an hour or so where can we talk theres a lounge over there said the mouse pointing to an adjacent room that was dominated by a large brick fireplace they entered it with the forever kid leaning against the doorjamb where he had a view of the empty street penelope waited until the iceman had seated himself on a chair then sat as far away from him as possible the mouse joined her a moment later and the mock turtle finding no furniture that would accommodate the huge horny hump on its back stood in a corner from which it could observe all of them well said the mouse what do we do now now we wait said the iceman then we kill em all added the forever kid happily dont ask him what to do said the iceman wryly he cant wait to take them all on singlehanded why arent we trying to get away before they arrive asked the mouse i know why we cant use our ship but why cant we all leave in yours because the democracys got a couple of battle cruisers on the way here answered the iceman they wont arrive for a couple of days but we cant outgun them and while our ships are a little faster they can carry a lot more fuel theyd catch us the first time we put into a port with a fuel depot he paused the only way to get away cleanly is to do to them what you tried to do to us change ships and hope they dont figure it out as quickly as we did and the only ships worth taking belong to the bounty hunters added the forever kid so theres no alternative said the mouse we stay and fight theres an alternative said the iceman what is it asked the mouse leave the girl here and get out now theyre not interested in any of the rest of us no shouted penelope never said the mock turtle that was a foolish suggestion carlos said the mouse trying to control her anger probably he replied but you did ask for alternatives he stared at penelope again youd never let us get away with it would you why do you hate me so asked penelope edging closer to the mouse and holding her hand as if for comfort i dont hate you at all replied the iceman but you want me dead probably then you do hate me no more than i hate a cancer that has to be removed or a scavenger that has to be shot you cant help what you are but youre too dangerous to be allowed to live if you lay a finger on her itll be over my dead body said the mouse and mine chimed in the mock turtle your money doesnt run out for four more days mouse said the forever kid easily im sure well have this all sorted out by then and what happens when the money runs out asked the iceman the kid smiled at him then i might go up against you just for the hell of it maybe youd better worry about who you have to face today said the iceman emotionlessly theyre due to arrive within the hour im looking forward to it the forever kid assured him ill just bet you are replied the iceman soothsayer interjected the mock turtle how may we help in your defense you dont listen very well do you said the iceman she doesnt need any help you dont listen too well yourself shot back the mouse theyre not coming to kill her but to capture her how long will she stay captured replied the iceman he turned to the girl again how many people have captured you so far and where are they all now penelopes grip on the mouses hand tightened make him leave me alone mouse you heard her said the mouse the iceman shrugged that being the case i think ill go across the street and get a drink while theres time thats a restaurant not a bar said the mouse theyll find some liquor said the iceman confidently he got to his feet walked across the room and a moment later he had left the rooming house and crossed the empty street the mouse turned to penelope will you be all right if i leave you for a few minutes where are you going to have a talk with carlos she answered ive got to know whether we can count on him or even turn our backs on him once the shooting starts hes a very bad man said penelope im starting to agree with you then dont go pleaded penelope clutching at the mouses arm with both of her hands the mouse hugged her reassuringly then gently disengaged herself and got to her feet ill just be a few minutes she said and youll be safe here with the kid and the mock turtle hell just say terrible things about me said penelope promise me you wont listen to them of course i wont the mouse smiled were still a team remember she hugged the girl again then left the rooming house and walked across the street to the restaurant you again said the pudgy woman as the mouse walked up the stairs of the veranda and into the building let her in said the iceman who was sitting alone in the dining room as with the old man the woman detected something in his voice that made her decide not to argue with him a beer for her and another cygnian cognac for me said the iceman the woman left the room and the mouse sat down opposite the iceman i had a feeling youd come over here he said i suppose its just as well weve got to talk yes we do agreed the mouse the woman returned with the drinks thanks said the iceman placing a couple of bills on the table now leave us alone how will i know if you want more she demanded we wont the pudgy woman turned and left the room without another word the mouse leaned forward and stared at the iceman why did you come here carlos because i was thirsty you know what i mean she said irritably youre not here for the reward and youre certainly not here to save me so why are you here you still dont believe it do you said the iceman youre sitting on a time bomb and you still havent realized it you make her sound like evil incarnate said the mouse theres not a malicious bone in her body shes just a little girl and i love her i never said she was malicious well then the iceman sipped his drink put it back down on the table and met the mouses gaze wherever she goes people die only people who mean her harm shes just a child mouse said the iceman as she grows older and stronger her definition of harm is going to change right now its people who want to take her away from you but one day soon itll be anyone who opposes anything she wants nonsense you think only bounty hunters can trip on ladders and break their necks continued the iceman you think a planetary governor cant choke on his food or that the secretary of the democracy cant slip in the rain she would never do that why not shes a decent sensitive child you dont know her like i do nobody knows her like you do agreed the iceman but shell even kill you if you stand in her way stand in her way repeated the mouse in her way to what he shrugged i dont know but the first duty of power is to protect itself and the first instinct of the strong is to eat the weak youre a fool carlos perhaps shes never harmed anyone who didnt try to harm her first shes never had the opportunity to she has the opportunity right now said the mouse if shes what you think she is why havent you choked to death on your drink or keeled over with a heart attack obviously she needs me probably to face the bounty hunters said the iceman still with no display of emotion thats why we have to talk he stared at her intently if one of the bounty hunters manages to get his hands on her then shes the democracys problem and good luck to them he paused but if youre the only one who survives this mess youd better start giving some thought to how youre going to kill her youre describing a monster not a little girl a potential monster anyway agreed the iceman the longer you wait the harder shell be to take on did it ever occur to you that she could be a force for good demanded the mouse whats good for her wont be whats good for us shes a human being shes more than a human being replied the iceman and the more she grows the less like a human being shes going to become then why didnt you try to kill her the minute you saw her out on the street he stared at his drink for a moment then looked across the table at her theres a possibility that im wrong thats the first rational thing youve said everything ive said is rational he replied i could be mistaken about how much harm she could do it wouldnt be the first time i was wrong he paused but i doubt it then i repeat why are you here at all why dont you just stand back and let the bounty hunters take her away i plan to stand back i dont understand if she can arrange for the forever kid to kill them all then shes as dangerous as i thought if she cant then ill take a hand that wont prove a thing said the mouse ive seen him kill eight miners all by himself those were miners said the iceman these are bounty hunters theres threefisted ollie and jimmy the spike and cemetery smith and half a dozen others just as formidable the forever kids good but hes not that good then youre telling me that you plan to sit back and watch him die defending penelope first nothing would make him happier than dying and second i dont expect him to die what do you expect i expect him to kill them all and then i expect ill try to kill her whether he tries to stop me or not the iceman paused and if i fail i expect you to remember this conversation and put your emotions aside and do what has to be done not a chance said the mouse in level tones then i feel very sorry for you he paused you always seem to love the wrong people once it cost you a year in an alien prison this time it may cost you your life you never cared for me said the mouse penelope loves me she loves you because she needs a mother and thats what youve been to her said the iceman what happens when she stops needing a mother sooner or later all little girls grow up and stop needing their mothers said the mouse that doesnt mean they stop loving them but youre not her mother he pointed out by the time shes mature shell have no more in common with you than you have with an insect you dont know her or you wouldnt say that i freely admit i dont know her said the iceman my point is that you dont either she looks and acts like a normal little girl but she isnt one he paused i asked you a question back on last chance let me ask it again how many men and women and aliens has this normal little girl killed i told you said the mouse anytime shes hurt or killed somebody its been in selfdefense you still havent answered me how many i dont know more than the forever kid i doubt it but thats not the point shes not a paid killer shes just trying to stay alive i know but let me ask another question now has she ever expressed any remorse or regret over having taken so many lives no said the mouse then she added defensively would you feel remorse over killing someone who was trying to kill you no i wouldnt replied the iceman then why is she any different from you because when i was eight years old i couldnt kill ten or twenty or however many bounty hunters shes killed said the iceman shes still a little girl and her needs are simple she wants to stay alive and she wants to stay free but what will her needs be when she grows up i dont know and neither do you nobody knows he admitted probably not even penelope but i do know this if her power keeps growing and theres no reason to assume it wont she can have anything she wants when she grows up a planet a star system a trillion credits hers for the asking or for the wanting and the manipulating thats no different than a politician or a businessman theres a difference said the iceman they can be stopped she cant hell shes already killed more men than most of the bounty hunters who are after her cant you see what lies up the road youre guessing she halfshouted you want me to kill her because you think she might grow up to be some kind of monster well she isnt and she never will be you dont know her like i do no he said but i know something else i know that weve had monsters before caligula hitler conrad bland and that they all had mothers who loved them what is that supposed to mean think of how many lives could have been saved if just one of those mothers had seen her child for the potential monster it really was he paused and stared at her you might consider that while theres still time then he rose and walked out of the dining room leaving her with her beer and her thoughts part the soothsayers book an hour had passed the mock turtle the mouse and penelope were sitting quietly in the lounge of the boarding house the iceman was leaning against a wall looking out at the street through a window and the forever kid stood in the open front door totally relaxed while idly fingering the handle of his sonic pistol the iceman lit a cigar took a deep puff of it and turned to stare expressionlessly at the little girl dont do that said penelope dont do what he asked dont look at me like that she said it frightens me he took another puff of his cigar then walked out into the foyer and sat down on the corner of the desk where the hell are they said the mouse getting to her feet and crossing the room to stand by the doorway theyll be here never fear said the iceman i just wish we had some plan she said nervously the soothsayer will tell us what to do when the time comes said the mock turtle placidly why are you so goddamned calm said the mouse turning to glare at the alien dont you ever get excited about anything why are you so excited responded the mock turtle its voice calm and steady have you no faith in the soothsayer the mouse was about to reply to the alien then thought better of it and continued her pacing penelope held maryanne to her chest rocking back and forth on the ancient sofa and halfsinging halfwhispering a lullaby to the doll she stopped every now and then to see if the iceman was still in the next room then lovingly smoothed the dolls dress and began crooning to it again the forever kid pulled his sonic pistol out of its holster and checked its charge you keep fiddling with that thing and youre going to inadvertently deactivate it commented the iceman if youre nervous go across street and have a drink bored not nervous corrected the kid he paused ive never seen the spike or cemetery smith before i want to see what they can do they can kill you thats what they can do said the iceman you really think theyve got a chance asked the kid with an almost hopeful note in his voice everyones always got a chance said the iceman noncommittally out here if you carry a weapon youre undefeated so far the kid smiled one of his rare smiles i never thought of it like that youre young yet said the iceman sardonically youll learn the kid actually chuckled at the remark then replaced his pistol in its holster hes crazy said the mouse finally sitting down next to penelope who is asked the girl the kid hes about to take on some of the best bounty hunters on the inner frontier and hes actually laughing i havent seen him laugh since i met him she got up and paced across the room once more then seated herself uneasily on a wooden chair tried to hold still and immediately began fidgiting suddenly penelope looked up from her doll theyre here she announced where demanded the mouse on killhaven said penelope two ships and a third is about to land i know said the kid from his position in the doorway i just saw them come down theyre at least three miles away maybe five he paused here comes another one well weve probably got half an hour or more until they get here said the iceman remaining seated on the desk if they get here at all that is what do you mean asked the mock turtle theres a huge reward for the girl and these guys probably arent planning to divide it ten or twelve ways they might kill each other off before they even come to town i hope not said the forever kid devoutly how many more ships will be arriving asked the mouse two that i know of said the iceman there were five of them on our tail three more corrected penelope the iceman shrugged we must have missed one or else somebody radioed for reenforcements they better get here soon noted the kid itll be dark in less than an hour maybe theyll wait until morning said the mouse hopefully not very likely said the iceman by morning the other three ships will be here theyll want to grab the girl and get out of here as quick as they can well lets not make it too easy for them said the mouse she turned to penelope i want you to go upstairs and keep out of sight i want to stay with you mouse protested the girl the mouse turned to the mock turtle go with her and protect the door if they get that far the alien stared at her politely but made no reply and didnt move from where it was standing didnt you hear me snapped the mouse take her upstairs i obey only the soothsayer replied the mock turtle when she tells me to go upstairs then i will go listen you began the mouse when i say to dont shouted penelope and suddenly all eyes turned to her youre my friends continued the girl i dont want you to fight youre what theyve come for said the mouse youve got to let us try to protect you the mock turtle held up its hand for silence then stared intently at penelope what do you see soothsayer it asked who will live and who will die i cant tell answered the girl there are still too many futures and ill wager a castle to a credit that you live in all of them dont you said the iceman no said the girl i dont if you live in even one thats enough said the mouse just tell us how to make that future come to pass i dont know yet said penelope obviously agitated but i know i want to be with you mouse please dont make me go upstairs the mouse looked at the girl for a long moment then sighed and shrugged how can i give an order to a soothsayer she said with a wry smile penelope run over to the mouse and hugged her thank you mouse she said i love you i know said the mouse returning her embrace and i love you too thats why i worry so much about you i think i see another one said the forever kid drifting out to the porch could be a bird though he paused no its a ship all right there was another pause longer this time looks like its landing to the north that means theyll be approaching from both ends of town maybe well just lock the doors and let them fight it out for the privilege of facing you suggested the iceman he got up and walked to the door where he shaded his eyes and scanned the sky from what i hear that means id wind up facing jimmy the spike replied the kid considering the possibility he spat on the dirt damn i want to face more than one of them he paused thoughtfully maybe theyll come in teams if id known it meant so much to you id have radioed our position to one of the democracys battle cruisers said the iceman with dry irony i wonder how many of them i could take out before they killed me mused the kid not enough said the iceman suddenly the mock turtle walked through the foyer and joined the forever kid on the porch what are you doing here asked the kid in the absence of instructions from the soothsayer replied the alien displaying its odd silent weapon i have elected to make my stand here with you i dont know about that said the forever kid i planned to face whoever shows up alone what about the iceman the kid snorted contemptuously he doesnt like to get his hands dirty hell probably watch the whole thing from inside the house and then take credit for all the men i kill sounds good to me said the iceman dryly besides continued the forever kid you ought to stay with the little girl in case anyone gets past me she will summon me if she needs me said the mock turtle and if she doesnt summon you then she never needed me answered the alien im glad someone besides me understands what were dealing with here said the iceman i have always understood what we are dealing with said the mock turtle serenely that is why i am here then youre the biggest fool of all said the iceman why should you think so asked the alien curiously the mouse still doesnt understand what she is and the forever kid couldnt care less but you you know and youre still trying to help her and why are you here the iceman shrugged i wish i knew then who is the bigger fool continued the mock turtle i who understand my motivations or you who do not begin to understand you own the iceman considered its statement maybe you have a point at that he admitted wryly the forever kid stepped off the porch and into the street are you two through arguing about whos a bigger fool he asked yes said the iceman i think well call it a draw good said the kid then get inside no said the alien calmly the forever kid turned to the alien im working for the mouse and im being paid to protect the girl he said but i never saw you before today and the way i see it i dont owe you a damned thing ive been waiting a long time for a chance like this and if i have to kill you first to make sure i get it then i will the mouse walked to the doorway leave him alone kid ill tell you who to kill right agreed the kid but nobody tells me who not to kill not even you well somebody better remind you who the bad guys are said the mouse she pointed to the cornfields beyond the small cluster of buildings the enemys out there right now the enemy is anyone who tries to stop me from what i want to do answered the kid penelope appeared beside the mouse in the doorway still holding maryanne come inside turtle she said if you dont hell kill you if it is your desire soothsayer replied the alien immediately turning and walking back into the interior of the rooming house ive had pets before remarked the iceman but i never had one that welltrained thats enough sniping carlos said the mouse we can sort out our differences later ill tell you what i told the kid the enemys out there not any longer he isnt said the forever kid as six men came into view half a mile down the dirt road iceman get off my street your wish is my command said the iceman ironically stepping back into the doorway he glanced quickly toward the north by the way i dont want to intrude on your idyll but it looks like youve got two more friends coming from the other end of town the kids fingers dropped to the handles of his pistols the more the merrier he said the iceman suddenly noticed that the mouse was still standing next to him youd better get inside he told her youre not even carrying a weapon youre really going to let him face all eight of them alone she demanded i told you before that i was besides its what he wants the iceman looked at the progress the approaching men were making theyll be here in about two minutes he said to the kid i hope youre ready ive been ready for two hundred years replied the forever kid a smile of anticipation on his handsome unlined face the eight bounty hunters five men and three women reached the cluster of frame buildings that formed the tiny town within a minute of each other one hung back some hundred yards or so behind the others the remaining seven stopped opposite the boarding house and stared at the forever kid who stood before them hands on hips completely relaxed i know who you are said one of the men then you must know why im here answered the kid youre no bounty hunter said a woman youve got no interest in the girl my interest in her is the same as yours financial said the kid weve got no fight with you continued the woman why dont you walk away now while you can got no place to go said the kid surely you dont think you can take all eight of us demanded the woman i only count seven replied the kid calmly one of your friends is showing rare good judgment hes no friend of mine said the man who had spoken first and hell be along never fear are you planning to split the reward seven ways asked the kid if not i have no serious objection to your going over to one of the cornfields and sorting things out he paused ill still be waiting here to face the winner as a matter of fact we spoke by subspace radio and thats exactly what we plan to do said the man theres more than enough money to split seven ways or eight ways if youd like to throw in with us added another man what about your friend down the street asked the kid curiously or the two ships that havent landed yet we made them the offer they turned it down its their loss yours too if you plan to stand against us all im losing is money said the forever kid if you dont walk back to your ships right now youre going to lose your lives youre crazy said the woman as three of them started fanning out in a semicircle do you really think you can take seven armed bounty hunters the kid smiled confidently do you really think i cant as he spoke he drew both of his handweapons panning the area with his laser pistol and firing short bursts of almostsolid sound with the sonic gun two women and two men dropped to the ground almost instantly while the third woman clutched her belly and doubled over in agony the two remaining men had their weapons out one a sonic gun one an oldfashioned projectile pistol and began firing while running for cover the forever kid neither ducked nor crouched nor sought out shelter he stood his ground oblivious to the bullets and sonic blasts flying about him aimed his laser pistol carefully and brought both men down then almost casually he turned back to the wounded woman aimed his laser pistol between her eyes as she desperately sought to reach her own weapon and fired she collapsed without a sound and now the eighth bounty hunter the man who had lagged behind began approaching the forever kid not bad he said not bad at all damned good if you ask me responded the kid oh i dont know about that continued the man easily four of them were dead and one was as good as dead before they even knew the fight had begun when youre outnumbered seventoone you dont wait for a referee to drop a flag said the kid if they werent ready that was their problem i fully agree said the man in fact i suppose i should be grateful to you after all you saved me the trouble of killing them myself i take it youre not much for sharing said the kid with a smile i work alone maybe youd better consider whether you want to die alone too suggested the kid i might say the same thing to you you might agreed the kid but i probably wouldnt listen no i suppose not said the man were a lot alike you and i you think so the man nodded i dont give a damn about the money or the girl and neither do you men like us we live only for the competition or die for it answered the kid or die for it agreed the man youre the forever kid arent you the kid nodded ive heard of you i dont know if ive heard of you or not replied the kid the man grinned im fresh out of business cards but my name is jimmy the spike you know i was wondering if you were in that batch said the kid indicating the dead bounty hunters as the sun glinted off their weapons but from what i knew of you i didnt figure you could be my reputation precedes me how very gratifying ive been looking forward to meeting you said the kid id kind of hoped we might get together over a drink someday and maybe swap stories answered the spike he sighed but i suppose this way is better much agreed the kid as a number of avians began circling lazily overhead i notice you havent told me to go back to my ship said the bounty hunter with an amused smile thats because i dont want you to you are a man after my own heart chuckled the spike in another life we could have been great friends well youre going to get to that other life first said the kid maybe when i finally join you well be friends after all i hope so said the spike where were bound i have a feeling a man needs all the friends he can get he glanced at the boarding house the little girls in there the kid nodded his head is she alone it doesnt make any difference said the kid youve got to get past me first and youre not going to that remains to be seen said the spike taking a step forward the forever kid reached for his sonic pistol as he did so jimmy the spike made a quick backhanded motion with his forearm and a trio of long ugly darts buried themselves in the kids chest he stood motionless for a moment then stared in disbelief at the blood running down the front of his tunic well ill be damned he whispered the trace of a smile on his face it finally happened then he fell to the ground jimmy the spike walked over to the forever kids body rolled him over on his back and looked down at him he stared at the boyish face for a long moment then sighed and turned to the boarding house he had taken only two steps toward it when the mock turtle stepped up to a window and aimed his weapon there was a faint humming noise and then the spike collapsed almost falling on top of the kids lifeless body the iceman stepped through the doorway and surveyed the carnage followed a moment later by the mouse penelope and the mock turtle what a waste muttered the iceman he sacrificed himself for us intoned the mock turtle he was a noble man youre wrong on both counts said the iceman i dont understand said the alien first there was nothing noble about it hes been trying to get himself killed for the better part of a century he finally succeeded he paused and second he didnt sacrifice himself for us certainly he did the iceman shook his head someone else sacrificed him for us he turned and stared at penelope or am i wrong leave her alone carlos snapped the mouse he looked from the girl to the mouse back to the girl once more shrugged and walked off to see if he could identify the various corpses i think i know two of them he announced this ones buzzard stone and that woman he indicated the woman who had done most of the talking is nina pallone he wasnt much but she was supposed to be one of the best he paused i never saw the other five before what shall we do with the bodies asked the mock turtle after ive had a drink ill bury the kid out behind the rooming house answered the iceman you can help and the others lets leave em right where they are said the iceman there are two more ships due to land maybe this will give them something to think about he turned and walked off to the restaurant the mouse turned to the mock turtle thank you for avenging the kids death he meant no more to me than i meant to him replied the alien i was protecting the soothsayer well whatever your reason thanks said the mouse maybe youd better start digging his grave out back im sure carlos will be by to join you in a few minutes have i your permission to leave you soothsayer asked the mock turtle yes said penelope the alien stepped down off the porch i have no digging instruments it announced theres a shed behind the building said the mouse im sure youll find a spade or a pick inside it the mock turtle walked around the rooming house without another word come inside penelope said the mouse why asked the girl we have to talk and id just as soon not do it where we can be overheard even by the turtle the mouse walked into the house and walked across the foyer to the lounge followed by penelope sit down said the mouse penelope sat on a couch and the mouse sat down next to her whats the matter asked the girl you act like youre mad at me im not mad but theres something i have to know what the mouse looked into penelopes eyes was carlos telling the truth i dont know what you mean said the girl did the forever kid have to die he wanted to die answered penelope you dont have to feel sad about it you didnt answer my question said the mouse did he have to die jimmy the spike was faster but jimmy the spike was our enemy and the forever kid was our friend but he died the way he wanted to look at me said the mouse did you interfere with the fight penelope met her gaze no youre sure dont you believe me mouse the mouse stared at her for a moment then put her arms around the little girl yes i believe you shes telling the truth said a voice from the doorway the mouse jumped up startled i thought you were having a drink they locked up the building when the shooting started said the iceman suddenly the mouse frowned if you agree that shes telling the truth what were you talking about before she demanded you asked her the wrong question what do you think i should have asked the iceman stared at penelope ask her if the kid would have lived if she had interfered go away and leave me alone shouted penelope halfhysterical please carlos said the mouse he nodded ive got a body to bury he turned to leave besides i already know the answer then the mouse was alone with penelope again well she said penelope her body still tense continued to stare at the spot where the iceman had been standing penelope said the mouse is it true could you have saved him he wanted to die he was prepared to die said the mouse thats not the same thing it is no said the mouse if he had wanted to die he wouldnt have drawn his guns against the first seven bounty hunters hed have just stood there and let them shoot him down penelopes gradually relaxed but made no answer could you have saved him asked the mouse again maybe said penelope grudgingly thats not an answer said the mouse could you have saved him yes or no yes how by breaking the window just when the kid tried to draw his gun jimmy the spike would have been startled not for long but long enough for the kid to kill him then why didnt you do it he didnt care whether he lived or died but we care said the mouse first because he was our friend and second because we needed him to face the last two men the two who havent landed yet they would probably have killed him said penelope probably repeated the mouse it depends where they stood you could have told him where to stand what difference does it make asked penelope he wasnt important anyway youre the one i love she threw her arms around the mouse and buried her head against her small bosom you and maryanne and maybe the mock turtle he didnt matter she started crying say youre not mad at me mouse the mouse stroked her blonde hair absently and stared out the window at the bodies on the street no im not mad at you penelope she said her voice troubled and do you still love me ill always love you and were still partners and well always be together the mouse sighed deeply and continued stroking penelopes hair you didnt answer me said the little girl the mouse hugged her tightly but remained silent a troubled frown on her face night had fallen the iceman had pulled a rocking chair out to the porch so he could watch for the final two ships against the darkened sky penelope was sleeping in the lounge where the mock turtle sat watch over her the mouse who had been walking restlessly through and around the rooming house finally approached the iceman ive been thinking about what you said she began softly and shes been on the run all her life shes never stopped long enough for anyone to teach her right from wrong i know shes not malicious added the mouse quickly she doesnt mean to hurt anyone she just doesnt know any better she paused she thought she was doing the kid a favor by letting him die im sure she did said the iceman but the end result is that hes dead she needs guidance thats all said the mouse and youre going to give it to her im going to try and what happens when she doesnt agree with what you say ill just have to be patient and explain it until she understands answered the mouse children arent notorious for being patient he pointed out most of them just cry and a few break things this one could destroy whole worlds i cant kill her carlos she loves me the iceman stared into the darkness for a long time before answering then youd better never leave her side for an instant he said youd better never give her a reason to doubt that you love her or that shes the most important thing in your life he paused the only important thing in your life shed never harm me carlos shes just a child and an untrained one at that replied the iceman shell have doubts and fears and jealousies just like any other child only she wont recognize them for what they are he turned to her other children wish terrible fates on their parents and siblings every day its a normal part of growing up the difference is that what she wishes will come true the mouse made no reply and youd better watch out for the mock turtle too continued the iceman why he worships her you call it a he and you give it a name like the mock turtle and that makes you forget its an alien with alien perceptions and alien motivations its got a polite almost servile manner but it killed the yankee clipper in cold blood and it showed no hesitation in shooting down jimmy the spike he was protecting her i know but its going be giving penelope as much input as you are and for all you know it kills someone every day before breakfast he seems very gentle and very caring to me replied the mouse youve only seen it in the presence of a little girl that it worships you know nothing about its beliefs and its ethics except that its willing to kill humans for what it considers valid reasons what do you want me to do demanded the mouse kill both of them kill the little girl and the alien doesnt matter said the iceman but if you let her live then youd better get rid of the alien and the sooner the better she stared at him youre a hard man carlos he was about to answer her when the sky was lit up by the retroburn of an incoming spaceship how far away would you say it is asked the iceman when the ship had finally vanished from their sight and presumably landed on the planets surface four or five miles just like the others whoevers flying it must have picked up the others with his sensor and decided that was the spaceport he paused well weve probably got until sunrise why wont he come after us right now asked the mouse because for all he knows weve got the whole route mined and boobytrapped answered the iceman no hell wait until he can see where hes going he looked up at the sky besides his partner isnt here yet how do you know who it is or that he has a partner asked the mouse because i saw who the kid killed and threefisted ollie wasnt among them explained the iceman ollie is too good at his work to have lost our trail and hell have kept in contact with cemetery smith the iceman smiled grimly thats who were waiting for maybe we ought to mine the road suggested the mouse we have enough time it wont be daylight for another four or five hours i dont have the equipment said the iceman besides it doesnt make any difference why not because these are two of the best in the business theyre not going to make a second foolish mistake a second one said the mouse what was their first the same as yours he replied leaning back on the rocking chair to wait for cemetery smiths ship to streak through the atmosphere they thought penelope bailey was a helpless little girl dawn broke with surprising suddenness on killhaven one moment it was dark the next moment it wasnt and a moment after that a score of avian raptors swooped down and recommenced feeding on the dead bodies that littered the street theyre coming announced penelope from inside the house ill tell carlos said the mouses voice not necessary said the iceman still sitting on his rocking chair im awake the mouse appeared in the doorway and looked up the long dirt road i cant see them yet theyre probably still a couple of miles away said the iceman what do you plan to do asked the mouse ill play it by ear answered the iceman you mean youre just going to sit here thats what i mean thats stupid carlos said the mouse we still have time to take defensive positions you could get on the roof the turtle can hide behind the restaurant i can im too old to climb on top of buildings interrupted the iceman but you cant just do nothing why not replied the iceman calmly its usually best whats going on carlos she demanded suddenly she stared intently at him youre going to join them arent you i doubt that theyd have me then what are you going to do she insisted i dont know well youve got about ten minutes to come up with an idea i dont want one she frowned what the hell are you talking about carlos he turned to her if i dont know what im going to do then she doesnt know what im going to do it doesnt work that way carlos said the mouse she sees lots of futures and then tries to manipulate things so that the one she wants will come to pass not knowing what im going to do will make it harder for her to manipulate anything answered the iceman maybe shell want me to sneeze when im going for my gun and maybe she wont but if even i dont know if or when im going for it its got to hamper her if i were you id be more worried about threefisted ollie and cemetery smith said the mouse the iceman shrugged theyre just killers the mouse stared at him again then disappeared back inside the house the iceman pulled a thin castorian cigar from his pocket lit it and continued rocking on his chair the sun peeked up over the restaurant and he squinted up the road wishing that he had remembered to bring a hat to shade his eyes and then two figures one human one definitely inhuman came into view as they came closer he saw that the alien wore a silver outfit and had either one arm too many or one too few and he knew that it was threefisted ollie the other wore the dull browns and greens of a man used to blending in with his surroundings but there was no doubt in the icemans mind that it was cemetery smith i am standing in the window of the lounge said the mock turtles voice i will keep my weapon trained on the human dont shoot until i tell you to said the iceman we tried this the kids way yesterday and all we have to show for it is a batch of dead bodies and fat birds two more dead bodies and we can leave in safety responded the mock turtle these guys arent that stupid said the iceman and theyve worked as a team before one of them will approach me but the other will stay out of range and if anything happens to his partner hell blow the whole rooming house straight to hell and almost as if they had heard them cemetery smith came to a halt some yards away while threefisted ollie continued approaching with his powerful lumbering walk thats close enough said the iceman getting off the rocking chair and stepping down from the porch when the alien was about fifty yards away i know you said threefisted ollie stopping and peering at the iceman through his manyfaceted eyes youre mendoza i know you too i havent seen you in many years continued the alien ive been around are you working for the girl now the iceman shook his head just working we have come for her i know do you plan to stand against us asked threefisted ollie not if i can help it then step aside i thought we might talk first said the iceman briefly you know that the clippers dead of course we were on calliope when he was killed then who are you working for threefisted ollie smiled a very alien smile i cannot tell you that mendoza you might think of delivering her there yourself and claiming the reward the thought never crossed my mind said the iceman returning his smile you have not changed mendoza sure i have said the iceman i dont work for the democracy any more who do you work for now asked the alien me what has this to do with the girl ill buy her from you threefisted ollie frowned that makes no sense mendoza you already possess her you were never the brightest bounty hunter on the frontier said the iceman think it through ollie the alien was silent for a moment you are offering to pay us to leave thats right why because i dont want to kill you and because shell help me recoup whatever i pay you you wont kill me mendoza the alien assured him you are not a young man any more but i have friends threefisted ollie suddenly tensed oh the iceman nodded nine of them theyre in every building in town and each of them has a weapon trained on you i dont believe you mendoza the iceman gestured to the eight bodies that lay on the street do you think i could have done that all by myself you were accompanied here by the forever kid said threefisted ollie he could have done that the iceman walked over to jimmy the spikes body and turned it over with his foot could he have have taken all eight of them at once including the spike he asked no answered threefisted ollie not including the spike then maybe youd better accept my offer where is the forever kid now the iceman pointed to the seed store in there with a gun pointed at your head the alien grinned again i almost believed you mendoza but i know the forever kid and if he was alive nothing could keep him from facing me therefore he is dead and you are alone youre half right admitted the iceman hes dead but im not alone we have spoken enough said threefisted ollie now it is time for me to get the girl two million credits said the iceman the alien stared at him that was a fair price a year ago now she is worth much more but if you accept two million youll walk away with it in your pocket if you dont youll be buried along with the rest of them he said indicating the dead bounty hunters i do not fear you mendoza no one ever said you did the question is whether you believe me i do not think so im offering you two million credits to say you do said the iceman thats a hell of a profit for avoiding a fight threefisted ollie stared at him for a long moment and two million more for my partner he said just take the money and tell him the girl isnt here he knows that she is here said the alien thats pretty dangerous knowledge said the iceman what do you mean i mean that every bounty hunter who knew she was here died for his trouble said the iceman all the ones who believe shes somewhere else are still alive youre suggesting i kill him said threefisted ollie with another inscrutable grin you dont need a partner if shes not here answered the iceman and you wont have anyone to split the money with i have always said that you were the most interesting human i ever met mendoza said threefisted ollie ill accept that as a compliment tell me continued the alien when you were a young man would you have made me this offer probably said the iceman thats how i lived to be a middleaged man its a very interesting proposition mendoza said threefisted ollie after some consideration i think i shall have to discuss it with my partner ill wait here said the iceman i wouldnt want to intrude on your deliberations one thing first said the alien i must see the money how do i know you wont kill me and take it and still go after the girl how do i know you have the money at all well have to trust each other said the iceman maybe ill just kill you now you can try said the iceman but there really is a weapon pointed right at you now its only one now its only one agreed the iceman but one is enough if i were you id think very carefully before i did anything i might not live long enough to regret the alien stood silent and motionless for a moment three million for the pair of us it said at last deal said the iceman signal him to join us ill take the money to him the iceman shook his head ive got to know he agrees to leave without the girl before i pay either of you threefisted ollie seemed to consider it for a moment then waved to cemetery smith who began approaching the cluster of buildings the iceman watched the human walk down the dirt road and tried to keep his mind absolutely blank to avoid even the hint of a decision about what he might do next whats going on here demanded cemetery smith when he was still about two hundred yards away this is mendoza said threefisted ollie do you remember him thought he was dead said smith continuing to approach them he squinted in the bright sunlight youve changed mendoza hes made us an interesting proposition said the alien yeah yes he has offered us three million credits to as smith turned his attention to the alien the iceman pulled out his hand weapon and shot the bounty hunter through the chest then hurled himself to the ground rolled over once and fired at threefisted ollie the alien clutched his belly and fell onto his side all right said the iceman getting painfully to his feet and facing the rooming house you can come out now the mouse was the first one out the door i didnt think you could pull it off she exclaimed neither did somebody else ill wager said the iceman meaningfully brushing the dust from himself and panting heavily penelope and the mock turtle come out of the house and climbed down off the porch to join the mouse well we can finally leave said the mouse it cant be that simple said the iceman he looked at the little girl can it penelope glared at him and suddenly the fear was gone from her face no she said suddenly the iceman felt a searing pain in his hip and on the back on his left leg as a laser beam burnt through cloth and flesh right down to the bone he fell to the ground and clutched his leg with his hands turning his head to see what had happened threefisted ollie had propped himself up on his side and held a laser pistol in his free hand you lied to me mendoza he whispered hoarsely he aimed the pistol at penelope and tried to steady his hand we had a deal if i cant have her nobody can shoot him screamed penelope running toward the mouse the mouse instinctively threw her arms around the little girl as threefisted ollies laser pistol and the mock turtles silent weapon both came to life and meted out death threefisted ollie grunted once rolled over and died the mouse fell to her knees a smoking burn mark on her torso penelope she said trying to focus her eyes i love you mouse said penelope sadly but with neither tears nor hysteria the girl stepped back and the mouse fell to the ground i am sorry said the mock turtle she died to save you it paused i should have fired sooner it was my fault the iceman still clutching his leg turned back to the girl and the mock turtle youre as big a fool as she was he grated tell him whose fault it was penelope i loved her said penelope then why didnt you tell the turtle to shoot sooner you knew what he was going to do its your fault shouted penelope her face filled with childish fury you made her stop loving me you killed her as surely as if you had fired the gun yourself said the iceman trying to ignore the burning pain in his leg she wasnt going to be my friend anymore said penelope petulantly she was going to leave me the iceman looked at the alien well he demanded arent you going to finish the job the mock turtle turned to penelope what is your desire soothsayer penelope looked at the iceman sprawled in the dirt his leg bloodsoaked and useless hes just an old man she said contemptuously he cant harm us anymore youd better kill me now said the iceman if you dont ill come back and hunt you down you cant hurt me said penelope confidently no one can hurt me you were lucky he answered his face contorted with pain next time you wont be she approached the wounded man and stared down at him do you really think its just luck that my friend and i are the only two who lived do you really think that come soothsayer said the mock turtle placidly it is time to leave the iceman tried to reach his pistol but it had fallen too far away and he couldnt drag his body over to it ill find you he promised no you wont said penelope the mock turtle and i are going to go away now not to summergold but to some place where no one can find me and im going to grow up and im going to learn more about being the soothsayer and someday when im ready ill come back she turned to look at the mouses body and ill never love anyone ever again ill be waiting said the iceman his vision becoming blurred you said penelope youll be an old man with one leg she smiled if they dont come out to help you you wont even live through the day she turned to the mock turtle and reached for its hand its time to go yes soothsayer it replied taking her hand and walking down the long dirt road to its ship the iceman watched them until he lost consciousness when he awoke he was in a hospital on mccallister ii and he spent the next few weeks getting used to his prosthetic leg after he had completely recovered he went back to killhaven the twelve bodies had been buried out behind the boarding house since nobody had known who they were there were no identifying markers on the tombstones he arbitrarily decided that the one on the left belonged to the mouse and laid a handful of wildflowers on it then he went to the restaurant before returning to his ship the pudgy woman wasnt there and nobody recognized him and he had a quiet meal finally the waiter a young man with dark brown hair and the start of a sparse mustache approached him with his bill i couldnt help noticing you looking at the graves over there he said were you related to any of them no said the iceman it was a hell of a battle said the young man his face flushed with dreams of heroism i wish id been there he paused then added confidentially they say the forever kid was one of them you dont say the young man nodded as near as anyone can tell the whole thing was about some little girl there were ten bounty hunters after her and the girl was hiding right in the rooming house across street isnt that exciting sounds exciting to me agreed the iceman waiting patiently for his check we ought to hang a plaque or something continued the waiter after all ten people died because of her twelve the iceman corrected him thats right said the waiter enthusiastically id almost forgotten there was a man and a woman who gave their lives to protect her he smiled at least they died heroes deaths if you say so replied the iceman he paid his bill and walked out into the dry dusty street
