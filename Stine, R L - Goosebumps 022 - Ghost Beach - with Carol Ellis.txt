i dont remember how we got to the graveyard i remember the sky grew dark and we were there my sister terri and i walked past rows of crooked old tombstones cracked and covered with moss even though it was summer a damp gray fog had settled on everything sending a chill through the air i shivered and pulled my jacket closer wait up terri i called as usual she had plowed ahead graveyards get her all excited where are you i yelled i squinted into the gray fog i could see her shadowy figure up ahead stopping every few seconds to examine a tombstone i read the words on the tombstone tilted at my feet in memory of john son of daniel and sarah knapp who died march aged years and days weird i thought that kid was about my age when he died i turned twelve in february the same month terri turned eleven i hurried on a sharp wind swept in i searched the rows of old graves for my sister she had disappeared into the thick fog terri where did you go i called her voice floated back to me im over here jerry where i pushed forward through the mist and the leaves the wind swirled around me from nearby came a long low howl must be a dog i murmured aloud the trees rattled their leaves at me i shivered jerry terris voice sounded a million miles away i walked a little further then steadied myself against a tall tombstone terri wait up stop moving around so much i heard another long howl youre going the wrong way terri called im over here great thanks a lot i muttered why couldnt i have a sister who liked baseball instead of exploring old cemeteries the wind made a deep sucking noise a column of leaves dust and dirt swirled up in my face i pinched my eyes shut when i opened them i saw terri crouched over a small grave dont move i called im coming i zigzagged my way around the tombstones until i reached her side its getting dark i said lets get out of here i turned and took a step and something grabbed my ankle i screamed and tried to pull away but its grasp tightened a hand reaching up through the dirt beside the grave i let out a shrill scream terri screamed too i kicked hard and broke free run terri shrieked but i was already running as terri and i stumbled over the wet grass green hands popped up everywhere thwack thwack thwack pop pop the hands rose up reached for us grabbed at our ankles i darted to the left thwack i dodged to the right pop run terri run i called to my sister lift your knees i could hear her sneakers pounding the ground behind me then i heard her terrified cry jerry theyve got me with a loud gasp i spun around two big hands had wrapped themselves around her ankles i froze watching my sister struggle jerry help me it wont let go taking a deep breath i dove toward her grab on to me i instructed holding out my arms i kicked at the two hands that held her kicked as hard as i could but they didnt move didnt let go i i cant move terri wailed the dirt seemed to shake at my feet i peered down to see more hands sprouting up from the ground i tugged at terris waist move i yelled frantically i cant yes you can youve got to keep trying ohhh i let out a low cry as two hands grabbed my ankles now i was caught we were both trapped jerry whats your problem terri asked i blinked terri stood beside me on a rocky strip of beach i stared out at the calm ocean water beyond us and shook my head wow that was weird i murmured i was remembering a bad dream i had a few months ago terri frowned at me why now it was about a cemetery i explained i turned back to glance at the tiny old cemetery wed just discovered at the edge of the pine woods behind us in my dream green hands were popping out of the ground and grabbing our ankles gross terri replied she brushed her dark brown bangs off her face except for the fact that she is one inch taller than me we look like a perfect brothersister combination same short brown hair same freckles across our nose same hazel eyes one difference terri has deep dimples in her cheeks when she smiles and i dont thank goodness we walked along the ocean shore for a few minutes tall gray boulders and scraggly pines stretched all the way to the water maybe you remembered that dream because youre nervous terri said thoughtfully you know about being away from home for a whole month well maybe i agreed weve never been away this long but what could happen here brad and agatha are really great brad sadler is our distant cousin ancient distant cousin is more like it dad said brad and his wife agatha were old when he was a kid but theyre both fun and really energetic despite their age so when they invited us to come up to new england and spend the last month of summer with them in their old cottage near the beach terri and i eagerly said yes it sounded great especially since our only other choice was the cramped hot apartment where we live in new jersey we had arrived by train that morning brad and agatha met us at the platform and drove us along the pine woods to the cottage after we had a chance to unpack and have some lunch big bowls of creamy clam chowder agatha said now why dont you kids have a look around theres lots to explore so here we were checking things out terri grabbed my arm hey lets go back and check out that little cemetery she suggested eagerly i dont know my frightening dream was still fresh in my mind oh come on there wont be any green hands i promise and i bet i can find some really cool gravestones for rubbings terri loves exploring old graveyards she loves all kinds of scary things she reads scary mysteries by the dozen and the weird thing is she always reads the last chapter first terri has to solve the mystery she cant stand not knowing the answer my sister has a million interests but gravestone rubbings is one of her stranger hobbies she tapes a piece of rice paper over the gravestone inscription and then rubs the design onto the paper using the side of a special wax crayon hey wait up i called to her but terri was already jogging up the beach toward the cemetery come on jerry she called dont be a chicken i followed her off the beach and into the small forest it smelled fresh and piney the cemetery was just inside surrounded by a crumbly stone wall we squeezed through the narrow opening in the wall that led inside terri began inspecting the tombstones wow some of these markers are really old she announced check out this one she pointed at a small gravestone engraved on the front was a skull with wings sprouting on either side of its head its a deathshead my sister explained very old puritan symbol creepy huh she read the inscription here lies the body of mr john sadler who departed this life march in the th year of his age sadler like us i said wow i wonder if were related i did some quick calculations if we are john sadler is our greatgreatgreatgreatgrandsomething he died over years ago terri had already moved on to another group of markers heres one from and another from i dont think ive ever gotten rubbings this old before she disappeared behind a tall tombstone i knew where wed be spending the month id had enough of cemeteries for today though come on lets explore the beach okay i checked around for terri terri whered you go i stepped over to the tall tombstone not there terri the ocean breeze rustled the pine branches above us terri cut it out okay i took a couple of steps you know i dont like this i warned terris head popped up from behind a tombstone about ten feet away why you scared i didnt like the grin on her face who me i said never terri stood up okay chicken but im coming back here tomorrow she followed me out of the cemetery and onto the rocky beach i wonder whats down here i said heading along the shoreline oh look at this terri stooped to pluck a tiny yellowandwhite wildflower that had sprouted up between two large rocks butterandeggs she announced weird name for a wildflower huh very i agreed terri sadler hobby number two wildflowers she likes to collect them and press them in a huge cardboard contraption called a plant press terri frowned now whats your problem we keep stopping i want to go exploring agatha said theres a small beach down here where we can go swimming if we want okay okay she replied rolling her hazel eyes we trudged on until we reached a small sandy beach it was really more rock than sand staring out to the water i saw a long rock jetty stretching out into the ocean wonder what thats for terri said it helps hold the beach together i explained i was just about to launch into my explanation of beach erosion when terri gasped jerry look up there she cried she pointed to a tall mound of rocks just past the jetty along the shoreline nestled high into the rocks on top of a wide ledge sat a large dark cave lets climb up and explore it terri cried eagerly no wait i remembered what mom and dad had said to me that morning as we boarded the train keep an eye on terri and dont let her get too carried away with things it might be dangerous i said i am the older brother after all and im the sensible one she made a face give me a break she muttered terri made her way across the beach and toward the cave at least lets get a closer look we can ask brad and agatha later whether or not its safe i followed behind her yeah right like ninetyyearolds ever go cave exploring as we came nearer i had to admit it was an awesome cave id never seen one that large except in an old boy scout magazine i wonder if someone lives in it terri said excitedly you know like a beach hermit she cupped her hands around her mouth and called whooooo sometimes terri can be such a dork i mean if you were living inside a cave and you heard someone go whoooo would you answer back whoooo my sister did it again lets go i urged then from inside the cave a long low whistle pierced the air we stared at each other whoa what was that terri whispered an owl i swallowed i dont think so owls are only awake at night we heard it again a long whistle floating out from deep inside the cave we exchanged glances what could it be a wolf a coyote i bet brad and agatha are wondering where we are terri said softly maybe we should go yeah okay i turned to leave but stopped when i heard a fluttering sound from behind the cave growing louder i shielded my eyes with my hand and squinted up at the sky no i grabbed terris arm as a shadow swept over us and an enormous bat swooped down at us red eyes flashing its pointed teeth glistening hissing as it attacked the bat swooped low so low i could feel the air from its fluttering wings terri and i dropped to the hard ground i covered my head with both hands my heart was pounding so loudly i couldnt hear the fluttering wings hey whered it go i heard terri cry i peeped out i could see the bat spiralling up into the sky i watched it swoosh and dip beyond us then suddenly it went into a wild spin it crashed onto the rocks nearby i could see one black wing flapping weakly in the breeze slowly i climbed to my feet my heart still thudding what made it drop like that i asked in a shaky voice i started toward it terri held me back stay away bats can carry rabies you know im not going to get that close i told her i just want to take a look ive never seen a real bat close up i guess you could say that my hobby is science too i love studying about all kinds of animals here check it out i announced scrambling over the smooth gray boulders careful jerry warned terri if you get rabies youll get me in trouble thanks for your concern i muttered sarcastically i stopped about four feet from the bat whoa i dont believe it i cried i heard terri burst out laughing it wasnt a bat it was a kite i stared in disbelief the two red eyes that had seemed so menacing were painted on paper one of the wings had been ripped to shreds when it crashed on the rocks we both bent over to examine the wreckage look out it bites a boys voice called from behind us startled terri and i leaped back i turned and saw a boy about our age standing on a tall rock he had a ball of string in his hand haha great joke terri said sarcastically the boy grinned at us but didnt reply he stepped closer i could see that he had freckles across his nose just like me and brown hair the same shade as mine he turned back toward the rocks and called you can come out now two kids a girl about our age and a little boy about five clambered over the rocks the little boy had light blond hair and blue eyes and his ears poked out the girls hair was auburn and she wore it in braids all three of them had the same freckles across their noses are you all in the same family terri asked them the tallest boy the one who had come out first nodded his head yeah were all sadlers im sam thats louisa thats nat wow i said were sadlers too i introduced terri and myself sam didnt seem impressed therere lots of sadlers around here he muttered we stared at each other for a long moment they didnt seem very friendly but then sam surprised me by asking if i wanted to skip rocks in the water we followed sam to the waters edge do you live around here terri asked louisa nodded what are you doing here she asked she sounded suspicious were visiting our cousins for the month terri told her theyre sadlers too they live in the little cottage just past the lighthouse do you know them sure said louisa without smiling this is a small place everyone knows everyone else i found a smooth flat stone and skipped it across the water three skips not bad what do you do for fun around here i asked louisa replied staring out at the water we go blueberry picking we play games we come down to the water she turned to me why what did you do today nothing yet we just got here i told her i grinned except we were attacked by a bat kite they laughed im going to do gravestone rubbings and collect wildflowers terri said there are some beautiful flower patches back in the woods louisa told her i watched sam skip a stone across the water seven skips he turned to me and grinned practice makes perfect its hard to practice in an apartment building i muttered huh sam said we live in hoboken i explained in new jersey there arent any ponds in our building terri pointed back at the cave do you ever go exploring in there she asked nat gasped sam and louisas faces twisted in surprise are you kidding louisa cried we never go near there sam said softly eyeing his sister never terri asked all three of them shook their heads why not terri asked whats the big deal yeah i demanded why wont you go near the cave louisas eyes grew wide do you believe in ghosts she asked believe in ghosts no way terri told her i kept my mouth shut i knew that ghosts werent supposed to be real but what if all the scientists were wrong there are so many ghost stories from all around the world how can ghosts not be real maybe thats why i sometimes get scared when i am in strange places i think i do believe in ghosts of course i would never admit this to terri she is always so scientific shed laugh at me forever the three sadler kids had clustered together come on do you guys really believe in ghosts terri asked louisa took a step forward sam tried to pull her back but she brushed him off if you go near that cave you might change your mind she said narrowing her eyes you mean there are ghosts in there i asked what do they do come out at night or something louisa started to reply but sam interrupted weve got to go now he said scooting his brother and sister past us hey wait i called we want to hear about the ghosts they hurried on i could see sam yelling angrily at louisa i guess he was upset because she mentioned the ghosts they disappeared down the beach then from inside the cave we heard that long low whistle again terri stared at me its the wind i said i really didnt believe that terri didnt believe it either why dont we ask brad and agatha about the cave i suggested good idea terri said even she looked a little scared now brad and agathas cottage was a short walk from the cave it perched by itself on the edge of the pine forest looking out toward the lighthouse i ran up to the heavy wooden front door and pushed it open i peered around the tiny front parlor the old house creaked and groaned as i walked over the sagging floorboards the ceiling hung so low i could touch it when i stood on tiptoe terri came up beside me are they here i dont think so i answered looking around we stepped past the old sofa and wide stone fireplace and into the cramped kitchen off the kitchen stood an old storeroom where i was to sleep upstairs was brad and agathas room with a crawlthrough passage into the space above the storeroom which would be terris room a tiny back staircase led from terris room down to the yard terri turned to the window there they are she said in the garden i could see brad bent over a tomato stalk agatha was hanging some clothes to dry on the clothesline we raced out the kitchen door where have you two been agatha demanded she and brad both had white white hair and their eyes seemed faded and tired they were so frail and light between them i dont think they weighed more than a hundred pounds we explored the beach i told them i knelt down beside brad he was missing the top part of two of his fingers on his left hand he told us they got caught in a wolf trap when he was young we found an old cave in some huge rocks have you ever seen it i asked he gave a little grunt and kept searching for ripe tomatoes its right by the beach and the big rock jetty terri added you cant miss it agathas sheets fluttered on the line its nearly suppertime she said ignoring our questions about the cave why dont you come inside and give me a hand terri terri glanced at me and shrugged i turned back to brad i was about to ask him about the cave again when he handed me the basket of ripe tomatoes take these to agatha okay sure i answered following terri inside i set the basket on the small counter the kitchen was small and narrow counter and sink on one side stove and refrigerator on the other agatha had already put terri to work in the corner of the living room setting the table now terri dear agatha called from the kitchen if its asters youre after the best place to find those is in the big meadow down past the lighthouse of course theyre just coming out about now so you can take your pick there i believe thats where you can find plenty of goldenrod too great terri called back with her usual enthusiasm i dont know how she could get so pumped about flowers agatha noticed the basket of tomatoes on the counter oh gracious all those tomatoes she opened a rattley old drawer and pulled out a small knife why dont you cut these up for a big green salad i must have made a face dont you like salad agatha asked not really i said i mean im not a rabbit agatha laughed youre absolutely right she said why ruin a homegrown tomato with lettuce well have them plain with maybe a little dressing sounds good i grinned picking up the knife i listened to agatha and terri discuss wildflowers for a few minutes to see if the subject of the cave would come up again it didnt i wondered why my two old cousins didnt want to talk about it after dinner brad pulled out an old deck of playing cards and taught terri and me how to play whist its an oldfashioned card game that id never heard of before brad got a kick out of teaching us the rules he and i played against terri and agatha every time i got mixed up which was most of the time hed wag his finger back and forth at me i guess it saved him from having to say anything we went to bed after the card game it was early but i didnt care it had been a long day and i was glad to get some rest the bed was hard but i fell asleep as soon as my head hit the scratchy feather pillow the next morning terri and i made our way to the woods to collect plants and wildflowers what is it were looking for again i asked terri as i kicked aside piles of dead leaves indian pipe terri replied it looks like small pinkishwhite bones popping out of the ground its also called corpse plant because it lives on the remains of dead plants yuck i suddenly remembered the popping hands in my cemetery dream terri laughed you should like these plants she said theyre a scientific puzzle theyre white because they dont have any chlorophyll you know the stuff that makes plants turn green how interesting i said sarcastically rolling my eyes terri continued her lecture anyway agatha said indian pipe only grows in very dark places they look more like a fungus than a plant she dug around for a few minutes the weirdest thing about them she continued is if they dry out they turn black thats why i want to try pressing a few i poked around in the leaves some more i have to admit she had me hooked i love freaks of nature i peered up at the heavy leaf canopy above us were definitely as deep into the woods as we can be are you sure this is where agatha said you can find them terri nodded she pointed to a huge fallen oak tree thats our landmark dont lose it i started toward the big tree maybe ill take a closer look over there i said there might be indian pipe on that dead tree i knelt down by the snakelike tree roots and began carefully pushing dead leaves aside no wildflowers just bugs and worms it was really gross i glanced back at terri she didnt seem to be having any luck either then out of the corner of my eye i noticed something white sticking out of the ground i scurried over to examine it a short plant stem stuck up from the soft ground the stem was covered with rolledup leaves i tugged at the stem it didnt come up i pulled harder the stem rose up a little bringing a clump of soft dirt with it it isnt a stem i realized its some kind of root a root with leaves weird i pulled more of it up from the ground it was very long i discovered a hard tug then another another hard tug of the strange root brought up a huge mound of dirt i glanced down into the large hole i had made and uttered a sharp cry terri come here i managed to choke out i found a skeleton huh terri raced to my side we both stood and stared down at it in silence the skeleton i had uncovered lay curled on its side every bone neatly in place the empty eye socket in its gray skull gaped up at us is it a hhuman terri stammered in a low whisper not unless the human has four legs genius i replied terri stared down at it her mouth open in an o of surprise well then what is it some kind of large animal i told her maybe a deer i stooped to take a closer look no not a deer it has toe bones not hooves i studied the skull which was fairly large and had sharp incisors or teeth when i was nine i had a thing about skeletons i must have read every book ever written about skeletons my guess is a dog i announced a dog said terri oh poor little doggy she stared at the skeleton how do you think it died maybe an animal attacked it terri knelt down beside me why would anyone want to eat a dog theyre high in protein i joked she shoved me hard jerry im serious what animal around here eats dogs a wolf maybe or a fox i replied thoughtfully wouldnt a wolf or fox have crunched a few of the bones and left more of a mess terri asked this skeleton is in perfect shape maybe it died of old age i suggested or maybe someone buried it here beneath that weird root plant yeah maybe it wasnt attacked by anything terri said i could see the color returning to her face we sat silently over the skeleton for a minute thinking about the dog a shrill animal howl made us both jump to our feet the frightening sound filled the forest echoing through the trees we held our ears as the howling grew louder whwhat is it whats making that horrible cry terri shrieked i stared back at her i didnt know i only knew it was moving closer the howls stopped as suddenly as they started when i turned around to make sure we were safe i saw them sam nat and louisa were huddled behind a nearby tree laughing i glared at them i realized instantly that they had been making the howls who did they think they were it took them a long time to stop laughing i couldnt believe how much they were enjoying their little joke i glanced at terri she was blushing my face felt hot i guess i was blushing too when they finally stopped laughing i invited them over to see the skeleton now it was their turn to be startled sams eyes grew wide louisa let out a short cry nat the little one grabbed on to his sisters sleeve and started to whimper terri dug into her jeans pockets for a tissue dont worry she told nat she dabbed at his cheeks with her tissue its not a person skeleton its only a dog skeleton those words made nat burst into tears louisa put her arms around nats trembling shoulders shush she said its all right but nat couldnt calm himself down i know what happened to this dog he sobbed a ghost killed it dogs can tell if someones a ghost dogs always bark to warn about ghosts nat terri said softly theres no such thing as ghosts theyre pretend sam stepped forward shaking his head youre wrong he told terri narrowing his eyes at her there are lots of skeletons in these woods all because of the ghost he picks the bones clean and leaves them lying here give me a break sam terri muttered are you trying to tell us that theres a ghost around here sam stared back but didnt reply well are you terri demanded suddenly sams expression changed his eyes grew wide with terror there it is he cried pointing right behind you i let out a shriek and grabbed terris arm but i knew immediately that id been fooled again when was i going to stop falling for sams dumb jokes you two are too easy to scare sam said grinning terri put her hands on her hips and glared at sam how about a truce guys these jokes are getting pretty lame all eyes were on sam yeah okay a truce he murmured but he had a grin on his face i couldnt tell if he meant it or not sam tell jerry and me more about the ghost terri demanded were you serious about a ghost killing the dog or was that one of your fabulous jokes sam kicked at a clump of dirt maybe some other time he muttered some other time why not now i asked louisa started to say something but sam tugged her away lets go he said sharply now terris expression changed to confusion but i thought sam stalked off through the trees dragging louisa with him nat hurried to catch up to them bye louisa called see you later did you see that terri cried they really do believe theres a ghost in these woods they didnt want to talk about it so they left i stared down at the animal skeleton lying so clean and perfect on the ground picked clean picked clean by a ghost the words rolled through my mind i stared hard at the jagged teeth in the pale skull then i turned away lets go back to the cottage i murmured we found brad and agatha sitting in rocking chairs under a shady tree agatha was slicing peaches into a large wooden bowl and brad watched her do you two like peach pie agatha asked terri and i replied that it was one of our favorites agatha smiled well have it tonight i dont know if your dad mentioned it but peach pie is one of my specialties so did you find the indian pipe not exactly i replied we found a dog skeleton instead agatha began slicing more quickly the knife blade slipping over her thumb as the soft peach slices slid into the bowl oh my she muttered what kind of an animal would go after a dog asked terri are there wolves or coyotes around here never seen any brad answered quickly then how do you explain that skeleton i demanded it was perfectly arranged and the bones were picked clean agatha and brad exchanged a worried glance cant say as i know said agatha slice slice slice brad do you have any ideas brad rocked back and forth for a minute nope very helpful brad i thought we also met three kids i said i told them about sam nat and louisa they said they know you yep brad replied neighbors they told us a ghost must have killed the dog agatha set down her paring knife and leaned her head back against the chair laughing softly to herself is that what they said oh my those kids were teasing you they love to make up ghost stories especially that oldest boy sam thats what i thought terri said glancing at me agatha nodded theyre nice kids you should invite them to do something with you some time maybe you can all go blueberry picking brad cleared his throat his pale eyes studied me youre too smart to fall for ghost stories arent you yeah i guess i replied uncertainly we spent the rest of the afternoon helping brad weed the garden weeding isnt exactly my idea of a thrill but after brad showed us which were the good plants and which werent terri and i had fun spearing the bad guys with the special weeding tools he lent us we ate the peach pie for dessert that night and it was delicious agatha and brad wanted to hear all about our school and our friends after dinner brad challenged us to another game of whist this time i did much better brad only had to wiggle his finger at me a couple of times later i had a tough time falling asleep the window of my little room off the kitchen had long flimsy white cotton curtains that allowed the light of the full moon to shine onto my face it felt like staring into a flashlight i tried covering my face with the pillow but i couldnt breathe then i tried resting my arm over my eyes but my arm quickly fell asleep i pulled the sheet up over my head better i closed my eyes the crickets were making a real racket then i heard something thump against the wall outside probably a tree branch i told myself another thump i slid a little further down in my bed the third time i heard the sound i took a deep breath sat up and tossed off the sheet i took a careful look around the room nothing nada zip i lay back down near the doorway the floorboards creaked i turned to the window behind the curtains something moved something pale ghostly the floorboards creaked again as the pale figure moved toward me i opened my mouth in a low terrified scream then i pulled the sheet back over my head the room grew silent i was trembling all over where was the ghost i peeked out from the sheet terri stepped out from behind the curtain gotcha she whispered you creep i choked out how could you do that to me easy she replied grinning all this ghost talk has you freaked out hasnt it i let out an angry growl but didnt reply my heart was still thudding in my chest terri sat down on the edge of the bed she pulled her robe around her more tightly i just couldnt resist she said still grinning i came down to talk to you and i saw you lying there with the sheet over your head it was too tempting i glared at her next time pick on someone your own size i said angrily i had the sheet pulled up because i was having trouble falling asleep me too terri said my mattress is really lumpy she stared out the window and besides i was thinking about that ghost hey youre the one who doesnt believe in them remember i insisted i know i really dont believe in ghosts but sam louisa and nat obviously do so so i want to find out why dont you not really i dont care if i ever see those kids again i said terri yawned louisa seems nice much more friendly than sam i think we can get louisa to tell us more about the ghost if we ask her she almost told us today terri i dont believe you i replied pulling the sheet up to my chin you heard what agatha said sam likes to make up stories i dont think this is a story terri said i know im supposed to be the scientific one in the family but i think something strange is going on here jerry i didnt answer i was picturing the animal skeleton im going to ask them about the ghost again tomorrow terri announced how do you know theyll show up terri grinned they always do dont they havent you noticed no matter where we are they always seem to be there she paused do you think theyre following us i hope not i said terri laughed youre such a wimp i threw off the covers am not terri started tickling me wimp wimp wimp i grabbed her arm and twisted it behind her then i started tickling her back take it back i said okay okay she cried i didnt mean it and youll never call me a wimp again never as soon as i let go of her arm she ran to the doorway see you in the morning wimp she called she disappeared through the kitchen at breakfast the next morning agatha asked what do you kids have planned for today a swim i guess i replied glancing at terri down at the beach be careful of the tide down there brad warned it can sweep a fullgrown man off his feet terri and i glanced at each other i dont think wed ever heard brad put two full sentences together before we will terri promised well probably do more wading than swimming agatha handed me a bangedup metal pail might want to pick up some sea urchins or sea stars a few minutes later i took the pail and a couple of old beach towels and terri and i headed down the twisty path along the shoreline we scrambled up and down the rocks until we came to a spot not far from the sandy beach and the cave we slid down the giant rock underneath us and then climbed on all fours across a few smaller rocks until we reached a wide mossy tide pool about three feet from the waters edge the tide pool was about the size of a kiddie pool wow jerry terri exclaimed staring into the water i see tons of stuff in here she reached into the green slimy water and pulled out a sea star its so tiny not even the size of my palm maybe its a baby she turned it over its legs wiggled hello cute little sea star she sang yuck ill go get the pail okay i said i climbed back over the rocks to where we left our things guess who was bent over our stuff snooping find anything good i called sharply sam glanced up slowly i was wondering whose towels these were he said casually nat and louisa came bounding over the rocks wheres terri louisa asked i motioned toward the water down by the tide pool i grabbed the pail they followed me back down terri smiled when she saw us i could tell she was happy to see louisa and her brothers look at all the cool stuff i found in here terri declared along the smooth surface of a large flat rock she lined up the baby sea star two sea urchins and a hermit crab we crowded together to see terri held out the sea star arent its feet cute she asked nat he giggled we spent a few minutes examining everything nat started rattling off everything hed ever learned about crabs louisa finally had to cut him off i want to hear more about the ghost terri told louisa nothing more to tell louisa replied softly she glanced nervously at sam had he warned her not to talk about it anymore terri refused to give up where does the ghost live she demanded louisa and sam exchanged glances again come on guys it has to live somewhere terri teased nat gazed toward the beach and the cave a breeze fluttered his fine blond hair he slapped a green fly on his skinny bare arm does the ghost live on the beach terri asked nat shook his head in the cave i guessed nat pinched his lips together i thought so terri said in the cave she flashed me a triumphant grin what else nats face turned red he hid behind louisa i didnt mean to tell he whispered its okay louisa told him petting his hair she turned to terri and me the ghost is very old no one has ever seen him come out louisa sam said sharply i really dont think we should talk about this why not louisa shot back they have a right to know but they dont even believe in ghosts sam insisted well maybe you can change my mind terri replied are you guys sure theres a ghost have you really seen it weve seen the skeletons louisa said solemnly nat peeked his head out from behind louisas leg the ghost comes out during the full moon he announced we dont know that for sure louisa corrected hes been in the cave up there forever some people say for three hundred years but if you havent seen him i said how do you know hes in the cave you can see a light flickering sam replied a light i hooted give me a break that could be anything it could be a guy in there with a flashlight louisa shook her head its not that kind of light she insisted its different from that well a flickering light and a dog skeleton arent enough to convince me i said i think youre just trying to scare us again this time im not falling for it sam scowled no problem he muttered you dont have to believe it really well i dont i insisted sam shrugged have fun he said softly he led his brother and sister back toward the woods as soon as they were out of sight terri punched me in the side jerry why did you do that i was just starting to weasel some good stuff out of them i shook my head cant you see theyre trying to scare us theres no ghost its another dumb joke terri stared hard at me im not so sure she murmured i gazed up at the enormous black hole of the cave despite the morning heat a chill ran down my back was there an ancient ghost in there did i really want to find out agatha made a really great oldfashioned chicken potpie for dinner i ate all of mine except for the peas and carrots im not into vegetables terri and i were helping agatha with the dishes after dinner when she said jerry i seem to be missing one of the beach towels didnt you take two with you this morning i guess we did i replied did we leave one at the beach terri asked i tried to remember i dont think so i can go take a look dont bother agatha said its getting dark out you can look tomorrow i dont mind i told her i threw down my dish towel and bolted out the back door before she could say anything else i was glad for an excuse to escape that tiny kitchen was suffocating me there was hardly any room to turn around in there i walked along the path to the waters edge happy to be alone for a change terri is okay especially for a kid sister we get along amazingly well but sometimes i like to be by myself i found the big rock where wed left our towels that morning no sign of the missing towel maybe sam took it i thought maybe he planned to drape it over his head and jump out at us i gazed up at the big cave dark against the blueblack sky huh i blinked and took a step closer was that a light flickering in the cave i took another step it had to be the reflection of the moon just rising over the pine trees no not the moon i realized i took another few steps i couldnt take my eyes off the flickering light so pale so ghostly pale in the black cave opening sam i told myself yes its sam hes up there right now lighting matches hoping ill fall for his trick should i climb up there my sneakers sank into the sand as i took a few more steps toward the cave the light glimmered in the cave opening it hovered so near the entrance floating flickering dancing slowly should i go up there i asked myself should i yes i had to climb up there the light glimmered brighter as if calling to me i took a deep breath then jumped across a tide pool and over some mossy rocks then i started up the cave stood high above me embedded in the boulders i leaped and scrambled over slippery small rocks until i reached the next big boulder a halo of yellow moonlight shone down on the rocks making it easy to see what was it nat said about the moon something about the ghost coming out when it was full i scaled the next rock and kept climbing i could see the ghostly light floating above me in the cave entrance up up i climbed over the scraggly rocks slippery from the evening dew oh i cried out as i felt my legs give way a minilandslide had started under my feet small rocks and sand tumbled down the hill behind me desperately i grabbed at a fat root growing out between the rocks i held on long enough to get my footing whew i took a moment to catch my breath then i pulled myself up onto a sturdy boulder and gazed up to the cave now it was right above my head only another ten feet or so to go i stood up and gasped whoa what was that noise behind me i stood frozen waiting listening was someone else there was the ghost there i didnt have long to wonder a cold clammy hand grabbed my neck i uttered a choking sound and struggled to turn around the cold fingers relaxed their grip ssssh terri whispered its me i let out an angry growl what do you think youre doing never mind that she shot back what do you think youre doing i im looking for that beach towel i stammered terri laughed youre looking for a ghost jerry admit it we both raised our eyes to the cave do you see the light i whispered huh what light terri demanded the light flickering in the cave i replied impatiently whats wrong with you do you need glasses im sorry i dont see any light terri insisted its completely dark i stared up at the cave opening stared up into total darkness she was right the flickering light in the cave had vanished as i lay in bed later that night i tried to use what mr hendrickson my science teacher calls my critical thinking skills thats when you have to put together whatever facts you have and those you dont and then draw a logical conclusion so i asked myself what do i know i know i saw a light then the light went out so what was the explanation an optical illusion my imagination sam outside the window a dog began to bark thats weird i thought i hadnt seen any dogs around here before i stuffed my pillow over my ears the barking grew louder more emotional it sounded as if it were right outside my window i sat up listening and remembered what nat had told us dogs recognize ghosts was that why the dog was barking so excitedly had the dog spotted the ghost with a shiver i climbed out of bed and crept to the window i peered down to the ground no dog i listened the barking had stopped crickets chirped the trees whispered here doggy i called softly no reply i shivered again silence now whats going on here i wondered sssshhh youll scare them terri whispered the morning sun was still a red ball low in the sky as we approached the seagull nest terri had spotted the day before birdwatching was terri sadler hobby number three unlike gravestone rubbings and wildflower collecting she could do this one back at home right from our apartment window we crouched down to watch about fifteen feet away the mother seagull was trying to herd her three babies back into the nest she squawked noisily and chased them first in one direction then another arent the babies cute whispered terri they look like fuzzy gray stuffed animals dont they actually they remind me of rats i replied terri poked me with her elbow dont be a creep we watched them in silence for a few minutes so tell me again about the dog barking last night terri asked i cant believe i didnt hear it theres nothing more to tell i replied edgily when i went to the window it stopped down the beach i saw the three sadler kids in shorts and sleeveless tshirts walking barefoot along the shore i jumped up and started jogging toward them whats your hurry terri called after me i want to tell them about the flickering light i called back wait up terri shouted scrambling after me we stumbled along the rocky beach toward the three kids i saw that sam was carrying a couple of old fishing poles and louisa had a bucket filled with water hi louisa said warmly setting down the bucket catch anything i asked nope nat replied we didnt go fishing yet whats in the bucket then i asked nat reached in and pulled out a small silver fish bunker we use em for bait i leaned down and peered into the pail dozens of little silvergray fish swarmed around inside wow want to come louisa asked terri and i traded glances fishing sounded like fun and maybe it would give us a chance to ask casually about the light in the cave sure i said why not we followed them down the sandy path to a shady spot on the water we usually have good luck here sam announced he grabbed a bait fish out of the bucket then steadied his fishing pole against his leg he expertly threaded the fish onto the hook then handed me the pole the fish flipped back and forth on the hook want to try he asked i wondered why he was suddenly acting so nice to me now had louisa gotten on his case or was he setting me up for another joke sure ill try i told him what do i do sam showed me how to cast the line out my first try wasnt great the line landed about a foot from the shore sam laughed and cast it for me again dont worry he said handing the pole back to me it takes a lot of practice to learn to cast this sam was certainly different from the sam we had seen before maybe it just takes him a while to get friendly i told myself now what do i do i asked him keep casting out and reeling in he said and if you feel a tug yell sam turned to terri do you want to try too he asked of course she replied sam started to grab a bunker for terri from the bucket thats okay terri said i can do it sam stepped back and let terri do the honors i think she must have been showing off id never seen her bait a live fish before she always hated slimy things terri started to cast out her line without any help i was about to accuse her again of showing off but then her fishing line got tangled in the tree branches above us that got everyone laughing especially when the bait fish squirmed off the hook and dropped down into terris hair terri shrieked thrashed her arms and swatted the fish into the water sam collapsed with laughter on the rock the rest of us laughed too we were all sprawled out on a big flat rock this seemed a good time to bring up the cave guess what i started last night i came down to the beach and i saw that flickering light you were talking about in the cave sams smile faded instantly you did louisas eyes grew wide with concern you you didnt go in there did you please say no no i didnt go inside i told them its really dangerous louisa said you shouldnt climb up there really yeah really sam quickly agreed his eyes burned into mine i glanced at terri i could tell what she was thinking these three kids really were frightened they didnt want to admit it they didnt want to talk about it but they were terrified of the cave why i only knew one thing for sure i had to find out at dinner we sat at the round table in the living room off the kitchen brad was tackling a piece of corn on the cob with his knife trying to saw off all the little niblets so he could eat them with a fork brad uh i was wondering about the cave i started fiddling with my silverware i felt terris foot nudge mine under the table what about it brad asked well uh the strangest thing i hesitated agathas head turned sharply you didnt go into that cave did you no i replied you really shouldnt go into the cave she warned it isnt safe well thats what i wanted to talk about i continued i saw that everyone had stopped eating last night when i went to look for the beach towel there was a light flickering inside the cave do you know what it was brad narrowed his eyes at me just an optical illusion he said curtly then he picked up his corn and began sawing again i dont understand i told him what do you mean brad patiently put down his corn jerry did you ever hear of the northern lights aurora borealis sure i said but thats what that flickering light was he said cutting me off he picked up his corn again oh i replied i turned to agatha hoping shed help fill in the blanks she did it happens at certain times of the year she explained something electric gets in the air the whole sky lights up in streamers she reached for the bowl of mashed potatoes more potatoes sure thanks i felt terris foot bump me again from across the table i shook my head at her brad and agatha were wrong that couldnt have been the northern lights the light was coming from the cave not the sky were they mistaken or were they deliberately lying to me after dinner terri and i walked along the beach wisps of gray clouds floated over the full moon shadows stretched and shifted in front of us as we made our way over the pebbly sand they lied to me i insisted to terri my hands shoved deep into the pockets of my cutoffs brad and agatha are hiding something they dont want us to know the truth about the cave theyre just worried my sister replied they dont want us to get hurt up there they feel responsible and terri look i cried i pointed up to the cave this time terri saw the flickering light too as we watched it floating above our heads in the cave entrance the clouds covered the moon and the sky darkened its not the northern lights i whispered theres someone up there lets check it out terri whispered back before we even realized what we were doing we were climbing the rocks pulling ourselves up toward the cave it felt as if i were being pulled by a magnet i had to get closer close enough to see what was causing that strange floating light behind us the ocean waves crashed against the lowest rocks spraying surf in every direction we were almost to the mouth of the cave i glanced back and saw that the beach lay far below in the cave mouth the light still flickered and floated we pulled ourselves up the last few rocks and stood up we found ourselves standing on a wide ledge the dark cave loomed up ahead towering over us i peered into the cave opening how deep was the cave i couldnt tell squinting into the dim light i thought i saw a tunnel leading off to one side i took a step closer terri moved up close beside me i could see the fear on her face she bit her lower lip well she asked in a hushed whisper lets go in i said my heart thudded as we stepped into the darkness our sneakers slid on the smooth damp cave floor i nearly choked on the sour musty smell hey i cried out as terri grabbed my arm the light look she whispered it flickered near the back of the cave staying close together we took a few steps toward it our sneakers squished loudly the air grew warmer it its a tunnel i stammered the cave narrowed then curved away the dim light flickered from around the corner from somewhere deeper in the cave i swallowed hard lets just go a little farther i urged terri lingered behind me that tunnel looks creepy she uttered in a tiny voice i heard a soft chittering sound somewhere up ahead weve come this far i urged might as well go just a little bit farther following the light we lowered our heads and stepped into the tunnel i could hear the drip drip drip of water nearby the air grew even warmer steamy the tunnel curved then suddenly widened into a deep round chamber i stopped as i heard the chittering sound again a soft flapping fluttering sound growing louder whats that noise terri cried her shrill voice echoed against the cave walls before i could answer the fluttering became a deafening clatter nooooo my cry was drowned out by the horrifying roar i raised my eyes in time to see the black cave ceiling crumble and fall over us noooooo i was still wailing as i hit the wet cave floor i covered my head with both hands and waited waited for the crashing pain the clatter swirled over me a shrill whistle rose up over the sound my heart thudding i raised my eyes and saw the bats thousands of black bats flapping and fluttering swooping back and forth across the chamber darting low then twisting away the ceiling hadnt fallen by entering their chamber terri and i had awakened the bats they whistled and hissed as they swooped wildly over our heads llets get out of here i cried helping terri to her feet i hate bats this is why brad and agatha warned us away terri cried shouting over the roar of fluttering wings we both turned to leave but the flickering light at the far end of the chamber made me stop just a few feet farther if we made our way a few feet deeper into the chamber we could solve the mystery and never have to think about this frightening cave again come on i shouted i grabbed terris hand and tugged the bats swooped and darted over our heads chittering and whistling we ducked our heads as we ran under them to the back wall of the chamber into another narrow curving tunnel i pressed my back against the tunnel wall and edged forward still holding terris hand the pale light grew brighter we were getting close the tunnel opened into another large chamber about the same size as the first chamber terri and i had to shield our eyes the entrance glowed with a bright flickering light i took a few slow steps in giving my eyes a chance to adjust to the light then i saw them candles dozens of short white candles perched around the chamber on rock ledges all of them lighted all of them flickering so that explains it i whispered flickering candlelight it doesnt explain anything terri protested shadows dancing over her pale face who put the candles here we both saw the man at the same time an old man with long stringy white hair and a beaklike nose he sat hunched over a crude table made from a log of driftwood pale and terribly thin his worn shirt hung loosely on him his eyes were closed shadows played over him he seemed to flicker in and out with the candlelight as if he were part of the light part of the ghostly light terri and i froze staring at him did he see us was he alive was he a ghost his eyes opened large dark eyes sunk deep in their sockets he turned to us stared back at us with those frightening sunken eyes slowly he curled a bony gnarled finger come here his voice was a dry whisper dry as death and before we could move he rose up from the chair and began to come for us i wanted to run but my feet felt glued to the floor as if the ghostly figure were holding me there keeping me from escaping terri let out a low cry she bumped me from behind i think she had stumbled but her bump got us both moving i took one last glance back at the pale flickering figure his bony frame shimmered in the eerie candlelight he started toward us his mouth twisted into a strange grin the dark eyes gazed at us blankly like black buttons on a snowman then we turned and ran terri sprinted ahead of me through the tunnel her sneakers slapping the wet floor slipping and stumbling i struggled to keep up with her my legs felt as if they weighed a thousand pounds the blood pulsed so hard at my temples i thought my head might explode go go go i shouted all the way i turned and glanced back he was coming after us noooo i screamed i shouldnt have turned back i stumbled over a jagged rock and went sprawling on the hard floor i landed hard on my elbows and knees gasping for breath i spun around in time to see the ghosts bony hands reach out for my throat i let out a terrified howl scrambled to my feet and lurched away from his bony outstretched hands a few feet up ahead terri watched in horror her mouth open her eyes wide with fright i heard the ghost groan as he reached out with both arms somehow i found the strength to run terri and i were both running now through the narrow curving tunnel through the bat chamber silent and empty now to the mouth of the cave and then we were slipping and sliding scrambling down the dewwet boulders down down to the rocky moonlit beach i turned back once i couldnt help it the cave opening was dark now i saw darker than the night sky we ran along the shore then turned into the woods we were both breathing hard panting loudly as we reached the cottage i pushed open the door stumbled in after terri then slammed it hard behind us terri jerry is that you agathas voice floated from the kitchen she came in wiping her hands on a checkered dish towel well she demanded did you find it huh i gaped at her still struggling to catch my breath did we find the ghost is that what agatha was asking did you find it agatha repeated did you find the beach towel she stared at us in bewilderment as terri and i burst out in relieved laughter i couldnt get to sleep that night i kept picturing the ghost his stringy white hair his sunken eyes his bony fingers reaching out for me and i kept wondering if terri and i had done the right thing by not telling agatha and brad about him well only get in trouble for going into the cave i had told my sister they probably wont believe us anyway terri added and why should we get them upset i said theyve been so nice to us and we went into the cave when they told us not to so we hadnt told them about the frightening ghost surrounded by candles in the creepy cave and now as i lay in bed tossing and turning my mind tossed and turned too and i wondered if terri and i should confess to our cousins what we had done and seen despite the summer heat i pulled the covers up to my chin and stared at the window behind the billowing curtains pale white moonlight shimmered brightly the moonlight didnt cheer me it reminded me of the ghosts pale skin suddenly my troubled thoughts were interrupted by a soft tapping tap tap tap tap tap i sat up quickly the sound was repeated tap tap tap tap tap and then i heard a ghostly whisper come here tap tap tap come here and i knew that the ghost had followed me home come here sitting up in bed rigid with fear i stared helplessly as a face rose up in the moonlit window first i saw a pale tuft of hair then a broad forehead a pair of dark eyes gleaming blue in the bright light nat he grinned at me through the window nat its you i cried gratefully jumping out of bed pulling my robe over my pajamas and lurching to the open window he giggled i peered out sam had nat on his shoulders and was lowering him to the ground louisa in white tennis shorts and a loosefitting gray sweater stood beside them whwhat are you guys doing out here i stammered you scared me to death we werent trying to scare you sam replied his hands on nats slender shoulders we saw you and your sister running on the beach we wondered what happened you wont believe it i exclaimed i realized that my voice was probably carrying up to brad and agathas room i didnt want to wake them i motioned to the three kids come into my room we can talk in here sam lifted nat up to the windowsill i pulled him in then the other two climbed in after him they sat down on the bed i paced excitedly in front of them terri and i went into the cave i told them in a low voice we saw the ghost he was sitting in a back chamber filled with candles all three of them showed surprise on their faces he was very old and scarylooking i continued he didnt walk he kind of floated when he saw us he started to chase us i fell and he nearly grabbed me but i got away wow sam muttered the other two continued to stare at me in amazement then what nat asked then we ran back here as fast as we could i told him thats it they stared at me for a long moment i tried to figure out what they were thinking did they believe me finally sam climbed off the bed and walked to the window we didnt want you to know about the ghost he said softly tossing back his brown hair why not i demanded sam hesitated we didnt want to scare you i let out a scornful laugh you scared terri and me just about every time we saw you that was just for fun sam explained but we knew if you found out about the ghost his voice trailed off have you seen him too i asked pulling my robe tighter around me all three of them nodded we stay away from there nat told me scratching his arm the ghost is too scary hes really dangerous louisa revealed i think he wants to kill us all her eyes locked on mine even you you and terri i shuddered why terri and i didnt do anything to him it doesnt matter nobodys safe sam said softly glancing nervously out the window you saw the skeleton in the woods right thats what the ghost will do to you if he catches you i shuddered again i was really scared now theres a way to get rid of the ghost louisa said breaking into my troubled thoughts she was nervously clasping and unclasping her hands in her lap but we need your help she continued we cant do it without you and terri i swallowed hard what can terri and i do i asked before she could answer we heard creaking above our heads voices had we awakened agatha and brad louisa and her two brothers hurried to the window and lowered themselves to the ground meet us at the beach tomorrow morning sam instructed i stood at the window and watched them disappear into the woods the room fell quiet again the curtains fluttered gently i stared out into the gently swaying pine trees how can terri and i help to get rid of an ancient ghost i wondered what can we do i woke up the next morning to the sound of rain i jumped out of bed and ran to the window the rain swirled in a gusting wind in the garden narrow rivulets of water had formed between the vegetable rows and trickled off into the yard a thick fog had settled on the trees do you believe this weather terri asked coming into my room i spun away from the window terri listen i have something to tell you i told her about my latenight talk with the three sadlers when i finished terri stared out the window so what do we do now how can we meet them on the beach if its raining this hard we cant i said we have to wait till it stops i hate suspense terri moaned she hurried back to her room to get dressed i pulled on my old faded jeans torn at both knees and a gray sweatshirt and hurried to join everyone for breakfast agatha cooked us oatmeal with big lumps of brown sugar and butter on top after breakfast brad built a big cozy fire and terri worked on her wildflower collection on the floor in front of the fireplace while terri glued dried flower samples onto sheets of cardboard i sat around and waited for the rain to stop stupid rain the sun didnt come out until after lunch as soon as we could get away terri and i hurried to the beach we waited there for nearly an hour i practiced skipping stones and terri scrounged around for shells no sign of sam nat and louisa now what i asked kicking at a small rock the whole day had been a big waste i brought my gravestonerubbing stuff terri replied lets go over to the cemetery we made our way to the small graveyard climbed over the old stone wall and took a good look around the graves were so old many of the gravestones had been knocked over or broken or covered with weeds the forest had started taking over a couple of big trees had sprouted on top of graves and one giant tree had crashed across the wall knocking over several tombstones im going to look for something interesting by that big fallen tree terri announced terri ran ahead and i poked along at my own speed the last time we were here we stuck to the edge of the cemetery now i made my way into the middle i started reading the names on the tombstones the first one i stopped at read here lies the body of martin sadler thats strange i thought another sadler i remembered that sam had told us sadler was a common name around here maybe this was the sadler family section or something the gravestone next to martin sadler belonged to mary sadler his wife then a couple of sadler kids sarah and miles i moved to the next row and continued reading the inscriptions another sadler this one was named peter beside peter lay miriam sadler whoa i thought starting to get the creeps didnt anyone else ever die around here i moved to another section all sadlers too hiram margaret constance charity was this a whole cemetery of sadlers terris scream cut through the air jerry come here i found her near the fallen pine tree her face was twisted in confusion look she instructed pointing to a cluster of gravestones at her feet i lowered my glance to two large stones thomas sadler died february and priscilla sadler wife of thomas died march yeah i know i told terri the whole cemetery is filled with sadlers creepy huh no no check out the kids graves terri said impatiently i saw three small identical stones lined up beside the parents the three stones stood up straight they were clean and easy to read as if someone had taken care of them i hunched down to read the names sam sadler son of thomas and priscilla i straightened back up so read the next one terri instructed i lowered myself again louisa sadler uhoh i murmured i bet i can guess the last name i bet you can too terri replied in a trembling whisper my eyes moved to the last marker here lies nat sadler who died in his fifth year of life i stared at the three stones until they blurred before my eyes three stones three kids sam louisa and nat all dead in the early s i dont get it i murmured i felt dizzy as i climbed to my feet i just dont get it we have to ask brad and agatha about this terri said this is just too weird we ran back to the cottage i kept seeing those three stones as we ran sam louisa and nat we found brad and agatha out back under the trees in their matching rocking chairs agatha laughed as we came running up to them breathlessly you kids run everywhere dont you wish i had your pep we were in the cemetery i blurted out we have to ask you about something she raised her eyebrows oh were you working on gravestone rubbings we didnt get that far terri told her we were reading the stones they were all sadlers all of them agathas chair rocked back and forth steadily she nodded but didnt say anything you know those kids we met on the beach i broke in well we found tombstones for sam louisa and nat sadler they died in something but those are the same names as the kids we met agatha and brad rocked in unison back and forth back and forth agatha smiled up at me well whats your question jerry how come there are so many sadlers in that graveyard i asked and how come those stones have our friends names on them good questions brad muttered quietly agatha smiled its nice to see youre both so observant sit down its sort of a long story terri and i dropped down onto the grass tell us i urged impatiently agatha took a deep breath and began well in the winter of a large group of sadlers practically the whole family sailed from england and settled here they were pilgrims who came to start a new life she glanced at brad who continued to rock staring out at the shimmering trees it was one of the worst winters in history agatha continued and sadly tragically the sadlers were unprepared for the cold they died one by one and were buried in the little cemetery by there were almost none left brad tsktsked and shook his head agatha rocking in a steady rhythm continued your friends sam nat and louisa are your distant cousins like brad and me they were named for their ancestors the children buried in the cemetery we were named for our ancestors too youll find gravestones for an agatha and bradford sadler in the cemetery too we will terri cried agatha nodded solemnly thats right but your cousin and i arent quite ready for the boneyard yet are we brad brad shook his head no maam he replied grinning terri and i laughed relieved laughter i was so glad there was a good explanation for what we had seen i suddenly felt tempted to tell brad and agatha about the ghost in the cave but terri started talking about wildflowers and i settled onto the grass and kept my thoughts to myself we finally ran into sam louisa and nat on the beach the next morning where were you guys i asked we waited for you here all afternoon hey give us a break sam protested it was raining we werent allowed outside we were at the little graveyard yesterday terri told them we saw three old gravestones with your names on them louisa and sam exchanged glances those are our ancestors sam said we were named after them jerry said you have a plan to get rid of the ghost terri broke in my sister always likes to get down to business we do sam said his expression turning serious come with us he began walking quickly over the pebbly sand toward the cave i hurried to catch up whoa where are we going im not climbing back inside that cave again no way i cried me either terri agreed being chased once by a ghost was enough for me sams hazel eyes locked on mine you dont have to go into the cave again i promise he led us to the rocks below the cave i gazed up shielding my eyes against the bright sunlight the cave looked a little less frightening in the daytime the smooth white stone gleamed the dark entrance didnt seem as deep and forbidding sam pointed up at the mouth see all those big rocks piled on top of the cave i squinted what about them all you have to do is climb up there and push those rocks down the rocks will cover the mouth of the cave and the old ghost will be trapped inside forever terri and i stared at the enormous white rocks each one must have weighed about two hundred pounds youre kidding right i said louisa shook her head were very serious she murmured we cover the cave mouth with rocks i repeated staring up at it the dark hole seemed to stare back at me like a giant black eye and that will keep the ghost inside what will stop him from floating out hes a ghost remember he can float right through the rocks no he cant louisa explained the old legends say that the cave is a sanctuary that means that if something evil gets trapped inside it cant escape through the ancient rocks the ghost will be trapped inside forever terri frowned so why didnt you ever go up and push the rocks down were too scared nat blurted out if we mess up the ghost could come after us sam said we live here he could find our house and get revenge weve been waiting for outsiders to come help us louisa added gazing at me with pleading eyes weve been waiting for someone we could trust but what about us i demanded if we try to trap the ghost tonight and we mess up wont he come out looking for us we wont mess up sam replied solemnly well all work together if the ghost comes out nat louisa and i will distract him we wont let him see that youre up on top will you help us please louisa begged our whole lives the old ghost has terrified us you would make everyone around here happy if you agreed to help trap him sam added i hesitated so many things could go wrong what if the rocks wouldnt budge what if the ghost floated out and found terri and me up there what if one of us slipped and fell off the top of the cave no i decided no way we cant do it its just too risky i turned to tell them my decision of course well help you i heard terri say we spent the afternoon picking blueberries with agatha then we made blueberry ice cream using an oldfashioned churn it tasted better than any ice cream id ever eaten agatha said it was because we picked the blueberries ourselves as it got closer to suppertime i started feeling more and more frightened were we really going to try to trap a ghost tonight dinnertime finally came i hardly ate a thing when agatha stared at me i explained i had filled up on ice cream after dinner terri and i helped agatha with the dishes then brad insisted on showing me how to tie sailor knots by this time my stomach felt more knotted up than brads rope finally terri and i said we were going to the beach to get some fresh air and we hurried out to meet our three friends it was a clear cloudless night thousands of stars twinkled overhead a heavy dew was falling the full moon made it easy to see without a flashlight terri and i padded in silence along the path down to the beach neither of us felt like talking i kept thinking about mom and dads warning to me before we left home to keep terri from getting into trouble well were in trouble now i thought grimly deep trouble both of us maybe all five of us sam louisa and nat stood waiting at the edge of the shore the moonlight made the dark water sparkle i suddenly wished it werent so bright out what we were about to do needed darkness the knots in my stomach seemed to tighten as i greeted our three friends sam raised a finger to his lips and motioned for us to follow him silently we picked our way across the rocks to the base of the cave hey look i whispered staring up at the cave the light flickered brightly in the entrance the ghost was home i stared up at the cave and planned our route wed go up the same way we had the other night but instead of entering the cave wed keep climbing around the side until we reached the top terri fidgeted beside me ready i whispered she nodded grimly well wait down here sam whispered if the ghost comes out well be ready to distract him good luck the three of them stood huddled together their expressions were tense frightened nat gripped louisas hand bye terri he said in a tiny voice i think he had a little crush on her see you in a few minutes terri whispered back to him dont worry nat well get rid of that bad ghost come on jerry my legs felt rubbery as terri and i made our way over the rocks we climbed steadily carefully i glanced back at terri a few feet behind me she was breathing hard her eyes narrowed in concentration we reached the mouth of the cave the light inside shone brightly i pointed to our right terri nodded she followed me up the rocks on the side of the cave the rocks were damp from the evening dew and slippery we were hunched on all fours as we climbed it was steeper than i had thought i struggled to keep from trembling i knew that one slip could cause a rock slide the ghost would know something was up hand over hand we climbed carefully steadily i stopped to catch my breath and gazed down to the beach our three friends hadnt moved holding on to a rock with one hand i waved to them with my other nat waved back the other two remained still staring up at terri and me i reached the smooth rock surface of the top of the cave turning i held out my hand and helped terri up onto the narrow ledge together we checked out the situation the rocks we were supposed to roll over the mouth of the cave werent as big as id thought they were piled in a solid wall it didnt seem that difficult to get behind them and push them over as i started to move behind the rock wall i caught a glimpse of our three friends down below to my surprise sam was waving his arms and jumping up and down louisa and nat were also motioning frantically whats wrong terri cried why are they doing that theyre trying to tell us something i replied feeling a chill of terror freeze every muscle had the ghost appeared in the cave mouth were terri and i caught already i took a deep breath and ignoring my fear leaned over the edge to peer down at the mouth of the cave no one there jerry stand up terri cried youll fall i stood back up and peered down at the three kids hey i cried out as i saw them running to the woods a stab of terror made me gasp somethings gone wrong i croaked lets get out of here i turned in time to see the ghost step up behind us his entire body shimmered pale in the bright moonlight his vacant sunken eyes glared angrily at us he grabbed me by the shoulder and wrapped his other bony hand around terris waist come with me he said in a dry whisper a whisper of doom he dragged us down to the cave entrance hes so strong i thought so strong for someone old and fraillooking the rocks slid under my feet a gray blur the ground appeared to tilt and sway long shadows seemed to reach out to me to pull me down i tried to cry out but my breath caught in my throat i tried to jerk free of his grasp but he was too strong for me terri uttered loud sobbing gasps she thrashed her arms struggling to free herself but the old ghost held her tightly before i knew it we were stumbling through the dark twisting tunnels the flickering candlelight grew brighter up ahead we were too frightened to fight him too frightened to break away my shoulder scraped against the narrow tunnel wall terror tightened my throat i couldnt even cry out from the pain the ghost released us as we reached the candlelit chamber glaring at us sternly he motioned with a bony finger for us to follow him to his driftwood table whwhat are you going to do to us terri managed to choke out he didnt reply he brushed the long stringy white hair from over his face then he motioned for us to sit down on the floor i dropped down quickly my legs were shaking so hard i was grateful not to have to stand i glanced at my sister her lower lip was trembling her hands were clasped tightly in her lap the old ghost cleared his throat he leaned heavily against the crude table you are both in serious trouble he said in a thin reedy voice we we didnt mean to do any harm i blurted out it is dangerous to get involved with ghosts he said ignoring my words well go away i offered desperately well never come back we didnt mean to disturb you terri added in a shrill voice his sunken eyes suddenly widened in surprise me a strange smile played across his pale face we wont tell anyone we saw you i told him his smile grew wider me he repeated he leaned forward on the large chunk of driftwood im not a ghost he cried your three friends are huh i gaped at the old ghost in disbelief his smile faded im telling you the truth he said softly rubbing his pale cheek with a bony hand youre trying to trick us terri replied those three kids theyre not kids the old man interrupted sharply theyre over years old terri and i exchanged glances the blood was pounding so hard at my temples i couldnt think clearly allow me to introduce myself the old man said lowering himself onto the table edge his lined face flickered in the shifting candlelight im harrison sadler another sadler i blurted out were sadlers too terri cried i know he said softly he coughed a dry hacking cough i came here from england quite a while ago he told us in i demanded he is a ghost i realized with a shudder my question seemed to amuse him i havent been here that long he replied dryly after college i traced my ancestors here i study ghosts and the occult he sighed it turned out there was plenty to study here i stared hard at him studying him could he possibly be telling the truth was he human not a ghost or was this an evil trick his black sunken eyes didnt reveal anything to me why did you drag us in here i demanded climbing to my knees to warn you harrison sadler replied to warn you about the ghosts you are in great danger here i have studied them i have seen their evil terri let out a low cry i couldnt tell if she believed the old man or not i realized that i didnt believe him at all his story didnt make any sense i climbed to my feet if you are a scientist studying the occult i said why are you shut up here in this weird cave he slowly raised his hand and motioned toward the shadowy ceiling this cave is a sanctuary he murmured sanctuary that was the word that sam had used once inside this cave harrison explained ghosts cannot escape through the rocks so that means you are trapped in here i insisted his eyes narrowed at me my plan is to trap the ghosts in here he replied softly that is why i stacked the rocks above the entrance i hope some day to trap them in here forever i turned to my sister she stared thoughtfully at harrison but why are you living here i demanded i am safe here he replied the sanctuary keeps me safe the ghosts cannot surprise me by coming through the rocks didnt you wonder why they sent you up here instead of coming up themselves they sent us up here because theyre terrified of you i shouted forgetting my fear they sent us up here because youre the ghost his expression changed he pushed himself away from the driftwood table and moved quickly toward terri and me his deep sunken eyes glowed like dark coals what are you going to do i cried harrison took another menacing step toward us you dont believe me do you he accused terri and i were too frightened to answer whwhat are you going to do i repeated my voice tiny and shrill he glared at us for a long moment the candlelight flickering over his pale face im going to let you go he said finally terri let out a cry of surprise i edged back toward the tunnel im going to let you go harrison sadler repeated so that you can examine the east corner of the old graveyard he waved a bony hand go go now to the graveyard you youre really letting us go i stammered once youve seen the east corner youll come back harrison replied mysteriously youll come back no way i thought my heart pounding no way ill ever come near this frightening cave again go the old ghost cried terri and i spun around and scrambled out of his chamber neither of us looked back as we hurried out of the cave and down the rocks i couldnt get harrisons face out of my mind i kept picturing his glowing evil eyes his long stringy hair his yellow teeth when he flashed us that eerie smile with a shudder i remembered the inhuman strength of his grip as he dragged terri and me into his chamber i also couldnt stop thinking about sam louisa and nat there was no way they were ghosts they were our friends they had tried to warn terri and me that the ghost was sneaking up behind us they said theyd been terrified of harrison their whole lives and i remembered nats sad face as he told us how much he was scared of ghosts harrison sadler is a liar i thought bitterly a yearold ghost of a liar down on the beach terri and i stopped to catch our breath he hes so scary terri gasped i couldnt believe he let us go i replied bending over pressing my hands against my knees waiting for the sharp pain in my side to fade i searched for our three friends but they were nowhere to be seen are we going to the graveyard i asked i know what he wants us to see terri replied gazing back up at the dark cave i know why he wants us to check out the east corner thats where we found the gravestones for louisa nat and sam yeah so harrison is just trying to scare us he thinks if we see the old graves it will prove to us that louisa nat and sam are ghosts but we already know the truth about those old graves i said we stepped off the beach and into the trees the air grew cooler moonlight trickling through the branches overhead made strange shadows stretch across our path we reached the cemetery entrance and stopped might as well check it out terri murmured i followed her through the graveyard stepping over footstones and loose brush as we made our way to the east corner a pale beam of moonlight played over the three old sadler kids graves see anything strange terri whispered my eyes roamed the area nope we stepped up to the sadler kids graves these look the same as yesterday i said neat square whoa something caught my eye in the corner whats your problem terri demanded my eyes struggled to see in the pale light i think theres something huh do you see something terri cried some fresh dirt i said in the corner on the other side of that fallen tree it looks like a fresh grave no way said terri ive checked out all these gravestones no ones been buried in here for the last fifty years we took a couple of steps toward the fallen tree jerry youre right it is a grave terri whispered a fresh grave we stepped over the fallen tree trunk keeping close together a narrow shaft of moonlight lit up the freshly dug ground its two graves i gasped two fresh graves with little markers on them i squatted down to try to read them terri moved behind me what do they say jerry my mouth went dry i couldnt answer her jerry can you read them yes i finally choked out its us terri the names on these markers read jerry sadler and terri sadler whwhat does this mean i stammered who dug these graves terri asked who put up these markers lets get out of here i urged grabbing her arm lets go tell agatha and brad terri hesitated we have to i insisted we have to tell them everything we should have told them a long time ago okay terri agreed i turned to leave and gasped when i saw the three figures staring at us from the shadows sam stepped quickly over the fallen tree where are you going he asked what are you doing here louisa and nat followed close behind him we were going back to the cottage i told them its late and did you kill the ghost nat demanded his eyes peered up at me hopefully i patted his hair it felt real his head was warm he didnt feel ghostlike at all he was a real little boy harrison sadler is a total liar i thought did you kill the old ghost nat repeated eagerly no we couldnt i told him nat let out a disappointed sigh then how did you get away sam demanded suspiciously we ran away terri told him it was almost the truth where were you guys i demanded yeah you didnt do a very good job of distracting him terri added sharply we we tried to warn you louisa replied tugging nervously at a strand of long auburn hair then we got scared we ran into the woods and hid when we didnt hear the rocks fall we got even more scared sam added we were afraid the ghost got you we were afraid we would never see you again nat uttered a frightened sob and took louisas hand we have to kill the ghost the little guy whimpered we have to sam and louisa tried to comfort their little brother i gazed down at the two fresh graves a cool wind made the trees whisper and shake i started to ask sam about the two graves but he spoke before i had a chance lets try again he said staring hard at terri then me with pleading eyes louisa rested her hands on nats tiny shoulders yes she agreed softly lets go back and try again no way i cried terri and i got away from there once im not going back and but its the perfect time louisa insisted hell never expect you to come back tonight well catch him completely offguard it will be a total surprise please nat begged in a tiny voice i opened my mouth but no sound came out i couldnt believe they were asking us to do this terri and i had risked our lives by climbing up there we could have been killed by that lying old ghost we could look like that horrible dog skeleton right now and here they were asking us to climb right back up there and try again it was a ridiculous idea no way i would agree to it no way okay i heard my sister say well do it louisa and her brothers burst into happy cheers terri had done it to me again terri led the way to the beach i scrambled to catch up with her the three sadlers talking excitedly among themselves trailed behind the night suddenly seemed darker as if someone had dimmed the lights i raised my eyes searching for the full moon but it had disappeared behind heavy clouds i felt a large raindrop on my shoulder then another on the top of my head the wind picked up as we neared the ocean are you totally crazy i whispered to my sister as we made our way over the pebbly sand toward the cave how could you agree to do this we have to solve the mystery terri replied glancing up at the cave it sat darkly above the rocks no flickering light no sign of the old ghost this isnt one of your dumb mystery books i told her angrily this is real life we could be in terrible danger we already are she replied mysteriously she said something else but the strong wind off the ocean carried her words away the raindrops started to come down faster large heavy drops stop terri i demanded lets turn back lets tell the kids we changed our minds she shook her head lets at least go back to the cottage and tell agatha and brad i pleaded we can trap the ghost tomorrow during the day maybe terri kept walking she picked up the pace we have to solve the mystery jerry she said again those two fresh graves they really scared me i have to find out the truth but terri the truth is we might get killed i cried she didnt seem to hear me i brushed raindrops from my eyebrows the gusting winds were swirling the rain around us the rain pattered against the rocks sounding like sharp drumbeats we stopped at the bottom of the rocks up above the cave stood over us still completely dark well wait down here sam said his eyes kept darting up to the cave i could tell he was really frightened this time well do a better job of distracting the ghost if he comes out he better not come out i muttered lowering my head against the falling rain a jagged bolt of white lightning crackled across the sky i shivered come up with us terri told the three of them you cant help us way down here they hung back i could see the fear on their faces come up to the cave entrance terri urged you can always run down the rocks if the ghost appears louisa shook her head were too afraid she confessed we need your help terri insisted we dont want the ghost to know were on top of the cave come stand on the ledge in front of the cave then no hell hurt us hell eat us up nat cried jerry and i cant go up there again unless you come up to help us terri insisted firmly louisa and sam exchanged frightened glances nat clung to louisa trembling the rain swept down harder finally sam nodded okay well wait for you at the cave mouth we dont mean to be so frightened louisa added its just that weve been afraid of him our whole lives he he her voice trailed off we turned and started our climb it was much harder this time it was so much darker without the moon rain kept blowing into my eyes and the rocks were slippery and wet i stumbled twice fell forward scraping my knees and elbows the wet rocks kept sliding under my sneakers rolling down toward the beach another jagged bolt of lightning stretched across the sky making the cave glow white above us we stopped at the ledge in front of the dark cave mouth my entire body trembled from the rain from the cold from fear lets just warm up inside for a moment terri suggested the three sadlers clung together no we cant were too scared louisa replied just for a second terri insisted just to wipe the rain from our eyes look its coming down in sheets she practically shoved louisa and her brothers into the cave nat began to cry he held on tightly to his sister a roar of thunder made us all jump this is the dumbest thing i have ever done i thought shivering i will never forgive terri for this never and then a yellow light flared in front of us at the mouth of the cave and under the yellow light the old ghost flickered into view he carried a flaming torch in one hand a strange smile played over his pale face well well he uttered in a voice just loud enough to be heard over the rain here we all are nooo nat let out a terrified wail and tried to bury his head in his sisters wet tshirt sam and louisa froze like statues the flickering light of the torch revealed expressions of horror on their faces harrison sadler stood in the cave entrance blocking our escape his dark sunken eyes peered from one of us to the next behind him the rain crashed down glowing eerily from flashes of bright lightning he turned his attention to terri and me you brought the ghosts to me he said youre the ghost sam cried nat wailed his arms wrapped tightly around louisas waist you have terrified people long enough the old man told the three trembling kids more than three hundred years it is time for you to leave this place time for you to rest hes crazy louisa cried to me dont listen to him dont let him fool you sam added with emotion look at him look at his eyes look where he lives all alone in this dark cave hes the threehundredyearold ghost and hes lying to you dont hurt us nat wailed clinging to louisa please dont hurt us the rain suddenly slowed water splattered off the rocks outside and dripped steadily from the top of the cave thunder rumbled but in the distance the storm was moving out to sea i turned and caught the strangest expression on my sisters face to my surprise terri was actually smiling she caught me staring at her the solution she whispered and i suddenly realized why she had agreed to come back to this frightening cave to face the frightening old man again terri wanted to solve the mystery she needed to solve it who was the ghost was it harrison sadler or was harrison telling us the truth were our three friends the ghosts my sister is really crazy i thought shaking my head she risked our lives because she had to solve the mystery let us go sam told the old man breaking into my thoughts let us go and we wont tell anyone we saw the ghost the torchlight dipped low as a strong gust of wind invaded the cave harrisons eyes seemed to grow darker ive waited too long to get you here he said quietly louisa suddenly reached out to terri help us she cried you believe us dont you you know were alive not ghosts sam said to me help us get away from him hes evil jerry weve seen his evil our whole lives i turned from harrison to the three kids who was telling the truth who was alive and who had been dead for over three hundred years harrisons face hovered darkly in the dipping waving torchlight he pushed his long stringy hair off his forehead with his free hand and then he startled us all by puckering his dry lips and letting out a long highpitched whistle my heart skipped a beat i gasped what was he doing why was he making that shrill sound he stopped then whistled again i heard the scraping of footsteps rapid footsteps on the stone cave floor and then a low dark figure came loping toward us out of the darkness a monster i thought a ghost monster it uttered low menacing growls as it neared its head bobbed low and two red eyes flared as the creature bounded into the light of the flaming torch oh i cried out as i saw that it was a dog a long lean german shepherd the dog stopped a few feet in front of us when it saw harrison it bared its teeth its growl became a ferocious snarl dogs can recognize ghosts i remembered dogs can recognize ghosts the dogs red eyes caught the light of the torch as it turned to louisa and her two brothers it reared back on its hind legs and began to howl and bark theyre the ghosts harrison sadler cried triumphantly to terri and me pointing snarling the big dog leaped at sam with a cry of fright sam raised both arms to shield himself the three kids edged deeper into the cave the dog barked fiercely baring its jagged teeth you you really are ghosts i cried out louisa let out a pained sigh we never had a chance to live she cried the first winter it was so horrible tears rolled down her cheeks i saw that nat was crying too the dog continued to snarl and rage the three kids backed farther into the dark chamber we sailed here with our parents to start a new life sam explained in a trembling voice but we all died in the cold it wasnt fair it just wasnt fair the rain started up again the wind blew sheets of water into the cave entrance the torch flame dipped and nearly blew out we never had a life at all louisa cried thunder roared the cave seemed to shake the dog growled and snarled and as i stared at the three kids in the wavering light they began to change their hair dropped off first it fell in clumps to the cave floor and then their skin peeled away curling up and falling off until three grinning skulls stared at terri and me through empty eye sockets come stay with us cousins louisas skull whispered her bony fingers reached out toward us join usssss sam hissed his fleshless jaw slid up and down we dug such nice graves for you so close to ours play with me nats skull pleaded stay and play with me i dont want you to go ever the three ghosts moved toward us their skeleton hands outstretched reaching reaching for terri and me i gasped and stumbled back i saw a frightened harrison stagger back too and then the torch blew out the torchlight flickered and died the heavy darkness made me gasp i could feel bodies moving scraping over the wet stone cave floor i could hear the whispered pleas of the three ghosts closer closer and then a cold hand gripped mine i screamed before i heard her whispered voice jerry run terri before i could catch my breath my sister was pulling me through the darkness into the rain onto the slippery rock ledge run run terri cried her eyes wild her cold hand still gripping mine run run the word became a desperate chant run run but as we struggled to lower ourselves down the rocks the roar of thunder drowned out terris shouts the ground shook my legs nearly slid out from under me i cried out when i realized the roar in my ears wasnt thunder halfblinded by the rain terri and i spun around in time to see the rocks topple from the top of the cave the rain and wind must have loosened them and now the big boulders rumbled down cracking knocking against each other bumping and rolling rock after rock thudding onto the stone ledge until the dark cave mouth was completely covered shielding my eyes from the rain with both hands i peered up at the cave and waited waited to see if anyone would come out but no one did no ghostly kids no old man harrison sadler had given his life to capture the ghosts the cave glimmered white in a flash of lightning now it was my turn to pull terri away lets go i pleaded but she didnt budge she stood staring through the rain at the closedup cave terri please lets go its over i said tugging her away the mystery is solved the terror its all over a few minutes later agatha threw open the front door of the cottage and rushed out to greet us where were you brad and i were worried sick she ushered us in fussing over us shaking her head talking excitedly glad we were back safe and sound terri and i got dried off and into clean clothes the rain had stopped by the time we joined brad and agatha in the kitchen for steaming mugs of hot cider outside the kitchen window the wind still blew the trees sending water cascading down from the leaves now tell us what happened to you brad said agatha and i really were terribly upset that you were out in this storm its kind of a long story i told them warming my hands on the hot cider mug i dont know where to start start at the beginning brad said quietly thats usually the best place terri and i did our best to tell them the whole story of the three ghostly kids the old man and the frightening cave as we talked i could see their expressions changing i could see how worried they were for terri and me and i could see how unhappy they were that we had ignored their wishes and ventured into the cave when i finished the story the room grew quiet brad stared out the window at the dripping rainwater on the glass agatha cleared her throat but didnt speak were really sorry terri said breaking the silence i hope youre not angry at us the important thing is that youre both safe and sound agatha replied she stood up stepped over to terri and gave her a warm hug agatha started toward me her arms outstretched when a sound outside made her stop barking loud dog barking terri lunged for the back door and pulled it open jerry look she cried its harrison sadlers dog he got out of the cave he must have followed us here i moved to the open doorway the dog had been drenched in the rain its wet gray fur was matted to its back terri and i reached out to pet the dog but to our surprise it reared back and growled easy boy i said you must be really frightened huh the dog snarled at me and started to bark terri bent down and tried to soothe the animal but it backed away from her barking ferociously whoa i cried im your friend remember im no ghost terri turned to me her expression puzzled youre right were not ghosts why is it carrying on like that i shrugged whoa easy boy easy the dog ignored my pleas barking and howling i turned back to see brad and agatha huddled against the kitchen wall their faces tight with fear thats only brad and agatha i told the dog theyre nice people they wont hurt you and then i swallowed hard my heart began to throb i realized why the dog was barking like that he was barking at brad and agatha agatha stepped into the doorway shaking her finger at the snarling animal bad dog she cried bad dog now youve given away our secret too terri gasped she realized what agatha was saying agatha slammed the kitchen door hard and turned back to brad what a pity that dog had to show up she said shaking her head fretfully now what do we do with these two kids brad what do we do with the kids
