picked them up there was a map under the papers on the map were the words valley of zar these may be important thought salahadin ill take them with me and look at them later salahadin folded the papers and the map and put them carefully in his wallet by this time the policemen had opened the boxes there was nothing important in them the boxes were full of spades and other things for digging theres nothing important or valuable in these boxes said salahadin we must speak to all of the hotel staff perhaps one of them noticed something unusual the manager brought the staff to ahmed and salahadin they asked each person many questions but they did not learn anything important then salahadin had an idea who carried these boxes to this room he asked the manager the manager brought back two porters did you carry these boxes into this room salahadin asked the porters yes they replied how many boxes were there asked salahadin six boxes replied the first porter i carried three and my friend carried three salahadin looked at the boxes there were six of them no one had taken a box wait a moment said the second porter youre wrong there were seven boxes you carried three i carried three but that makes six boxes not seven said ahmed with a smile you cant count i can count replied the porter there were seven boxes mr pearson carried one into the room himself it was a heavy box but it was smaller than the others that is the box which is missing salahadin said to ahmed theres something valuable in that seventh box when we find the seventh box well find the murderer chapter

he was very tired but his work was not yet finished he took some pieces of paper out of his wallet they were the pieces of paper from pearsons room salahadin sat down and looked at pearsons notes the pharaoh ankuten this pharaoh did not live long he died when he was still a boy where was ankuten buried ankuten was going to the sudan when he did it the valley of zar is beside the road to the sudan was ankuten buried in the valley of zar what was buried with ankuten in his tomb was there a cat buried with ankuten there are many old stories about a black cat ankuten loved black cats when he died a black cat was put in his tomb but this cat was very usual it was made of gold its eyes were diamonds there was a collar of diamonds round its neck is this story true or not why was the cat covered with black paint fear of robbers black paint hid the gold and diamonds a cat painted in thick black paint did not look valuable questions that must be answered is ankuten buried in the valley of zar is there a black cat in his tomb is the black cat made of gold or is it made of wood are the stories true or false salahadin read the notes again he asked himself some questions did pearson find the tomb of ankuten he asked himself did he find a black cat and is the black cat made of gold there was a reason for pearsons death was the black cat the reason there are too many questions thought salahadin i must find some answers the answers are in the missing box and its probably on its way to beirut ill be there tomorrow chapter six in beirut at half past ten the next morning salahadin

very happy in beirut it was nice and cool after the heat and dust of cairo when he got to the docks he asked about the boat from alexandria the sudan did not arrive at beirut until half past six in the evening salahadin had more than six hours to wait he decided to visit a friend called fuad fuad had been a student with salahadin at cairo university he now worked in the lebanese department of

fuad ill phone my wife immediately ten minutes later they were in fuads car fuad lived in a small village in the mountains above beirut the road was very steep it twisted and turned up the mountain

four people were killed for a few moments nothing happened then the black car began to go faster it had moved into the middle of the road and was trying to pass barkmans taxi the two cars were now side by side they were almost touching each other there was a sharp bend in the road in front of them theyll never get round that bend shouted fuad but it was already too late there was a loud crashing noise fuad slowed down and drove carefully round the bend the black car and the taxi had disappeared in front of them the road was empty everything was silent chapter eight barkmans story

first plane to athens i want to get there as soon as possible salahadins plane flew over athens early in the morning from the aeroplane he looked down on the ruins of the acropolis they looked wonderful in the early morning sunlight but salahadin was not a tourist he was a detective and he had to find peterson salahadin took a taxi from the airport to piraeus the seaport of athens he got out of the taxi at piraeus and went to an office at the dock gate what time does the syria arrive from alexandria he asked at midday was the reply and it leaves again for venice at four oclock it was only six oclock in the morning salahadin had a long time to wait but piraeus is full of small cafes and restaurants salahadin passed the time drinking coffee and sleeping at eleven oclock salahadin walked back to the docks he tried to walk through the gate but a policeman stopped him you cant go through the gate without a ticket said the policeman salahadin had an idea the man in the office had said that the syria was going to venice salahadin went back to the office and bought a first class ticket to venice when he got into the docks the syria had not yet arrived salahadin sat down on a box and waited peterson is not an egyptian name thought salahadin its another swedish name like borkman perhaps peterson is swedish also ill look for a man with fair hair hell be carrying a box the syria was half an hour late it arrived in the docks at half past twelve salahadin watched the people getting off the boat they were all egyptian there were some men with their wives and children and many students there was no one who looked swedish at that moment someone appeared on the top deck of the syria he was a tall man with fair hair thats peterson thought salahadin so hes decided to stay on the boat perhaps hes going to venice ill get on the boat and go to venice too but salahadin was careful perhaps it was a trick and peterson was going to get off the boat at the last moment salahadin waited but no one else got off at five oclock salahadin got on the boat the gangway was taken down and the syria was ready to leave salahadin went to the ticket office on the boat and showed his ticket to the officer ive just got on the boat said salahadin can i have a cabin please youre travelling first class sir the officer said you can go into cabin its just under the top deck the officer turned to get the key for cabin wait a moment sir said the officer im sorry ive made a mistake cabin isnt empty mr petersons in cabin hes decided to go on to venice but cabin is empty you can go there salahadin took the key from the officer went to cabin and sat down he had found peterson chapter eleven salahadin finds the black cat ten minutes later there was a knock at the door of salahadins cabin it was the steward do you want to eat in the diningroom or in your cabin sir asked the steward where do people usually eat asked salahadin in the diningroom replied the steward but you can have your dinner in your cabin if you want thats an idea said salahadin ill eat here ill bring you dinner at eight oclock then said the steward and walked down the corridor salahadin watched the steward carefully the steward walked to a small room under the stairs salahadin took out his notebook and drew a plan of the corridor and the cabins here is the plan after a few moments the steward came out of his room and walked down the corridor salahadin waited for five minutes everything was quiet in the corridor salahadin left his cabin and walked quietly to the stewards room under the stairs the steward had not locked the door salahadin opened it carefully and looked in the room was small with brushes and cleaning things in it there were some hooks on the wall a key hung from every hook and there was a number above each one salahadin took the key of cabin and went to the door suddenly he heard a noise peterson had come back he was standing at the door of his cabin salahadin waited in the stewards room peterson went into his cabin and closed the door salahadin quietly went back to his own cabin sat down and listened there was the noise of music peterson had turned on a radio then there was the noise of running water peterson was having a shower salahadin had a shower too got dressed and waited a few minutes later there was a knock at his door the steward had brought salahadins dinner at the same time peterson came out of his cabin he locked the door and walked down the corridor peterson was going to the diningroom the steward went away and salahadin was left alone he looked out into the corridor everything was quiet salahadin left his cabin and crossed the corridor he put the key in the lock of cabin and quietly opened the door then he went into the cabin and shut the door carefully behind him salahadin looked round the cabin there was a case on top of the cupboard and some clothes on the bed but he did not see a box he looked inside the showerroom it was empty the black cat must be here thought salahadin where has he hidden it then he had an idea the showerroom was very high salahadin looked up there was a box placed above the shower salahadin lifted the box down on the bed and started to open it but something had gone wrong there was a noise and the door of cabin suddenly opened there was a man in the doorway it was peterson and he had a gun in his hand the gun was pointing at salahadin chapter twelve death on the syria dont move said peterson peterson came into the cabin and shut the door salahadin stood still in front of the bed who are you asked peterson and what are you doing in my cabin salahadin thought quickly he had to say something borkman sent me he said i have a message for you youre telling lies said peterson theres something on the bed stand back salahadin moved back and peterson saw the open box so youve found the black cat said peterson youre a member of the red hand gang peterson opened the door and looked out into the corridor it was empty put your hands behind your back and come out of the cabin said peterson then walk slowly up the stairs to the top deck salahadin came out of the cabin and peterson followed him salahadin walked slowly up the stairs when they reached the top deck peterson spoke again walk over to the rail there was a rail round the side of the ship over the rail was the sea the syria had now passed through the corinth canal and the ship was rolling from side to side salahadin walked slowly forward towards the funnel stop said peterson turn round salahadin turned and looked at peterson now tell me the truth said peterson who are you salahadin decided to tell some truth and some lies borkmans dead said salahadin and jusef is caught the baalbek gang is finished the police are waiting for you at venice i dont believe you said peterson how do you know this who are you im an inspector in the egyptian police replied salahadin ive followed you from beirut the italian police are waiting for you at venice youre telling lies again said peterson why didnt you bring the police onto the boat at athens salahadin did not reply and peterson started to laugh you didnt tell anyone at athens he said theres no one waiting for this boat at venice now im going to shoot you ill throw your body into the sea and no one will ever know suddenly peterson lifted his gun at the same moment a large wave shook the side of the ship peterson was thrown against the rail and the gun fell onto the deck for a second both men looked at the gun then at each other the wind pressed hard against them neither of them moved forward peterson was the first to move he tried to pick up the gun and salahadin ran straight at him he held peterson round the neck and pushed him over the rail peterson fell backwards over the rail and disappeared into the angry sea below there was a scream then there was silence salahadin walked slowly away from the rail and sat down on the deck no one came everyone was busy eating dinner no one had heard the noise chapter thirteen do not disturb the corridor outside cabin was still empty everything was silent salahadin went into the cabin and picked up the box carefully then he carried it across the corridor to his own cabin he went back across the corridor once more in every cabin there was a notice with the words do not disturb written on it in large letters salahadin took this notice and hung it on the door of cabin the steward will see this on the door thought salahadin to himself hell think that peterson is sick no one will go into cabin until venice he locked the door of cabin and put the key on its hook in the stewards room then salahadin went back to his own cabin the food was still on the table but he was not hungry he threw it out of the window salahadin looked at his watch he was surprised it was only aquarter to nine a lot had happened in a short time after a few minutes there was a knock at the door it was the steward i hope that you enjoyed your dinner sir he said to salahadin thank you replied salahadin i enjoyed it very much mr petersons put the do not disturb notice on his door said the steward perhaps hes sick ill not disturb him until venice yes said salahadin i met him half an hour ago he said that he felt sick hell not want anything until tomorrow when do you want breakfast sir asked the steward i feel tired replied salahadin dont wake me in the morning when i want breakfast ill call you goodnight then said the steward salahadin said goodnight and locked his door he had not slept on a bed for many hours and he was very tired he undressed and got into bed at first the movement of the boat kept him awake but he was soon asleep and slept deeply all night when salahadin woke up the next morning the bright sun was shining into his cabin he looked at his watch it was nearly eleven oclock he rang the bell for the steward when do we arrive in venice asked salahadin were early today replied the steward well be there in two hours but you dont need to get off the boat immediately you can have lunch first no thank you said salahadin i want to get off the boat as soon as possible what about mr

drank his coffee slowly and got dressed he heard a lot of noise the ship was arriving at venice salahadin looked out into the corridor it was empty the steward had gone to the diningroom salahadin picked up the heavy box and left the cabin from the side of the boat salahadin saw the tall buildings of venice they were passing in front of st marks cathedral they were now near the docks after half an hour the boat was beside the dock salahadin left the syria while the other passengers were having lunch whats in that box asked a policeman some books replied salahadin he did not want any trouble the policeman did not ask salahadin to open the box in a few minutes salahadin was in a water taxi on his way to the railway station safe at last thought salahadin when they open cabin theyll find it empty theyll be very surprised chapter fourteen return to cairo salahadin took the first train from venice to rome the next morning he was on a plane for cairo the plane was late and he did not arrive until after ten oclock in the morning the sun was high in the sky and it was getting hotter and hotter salahadin felt better he preferred the heat of cairo to the cold deck of the syria he took a taxi

old city i sat down and asked for coffee then i asked for jusef i told jusef about borkmans death the police were waiting outside fuad continued they were hiding in a car i told jusef about the black cat and he thanked me then he hurried out of the cafe and the police saw him asked salahadin yes said fuad they watched him carefully where did jusef go he got into a car replied fuad and drove to a farm in the mountains the police followed him then they hid in the hills round the farm and waited how many men were at the farm salahadin asked the police didnt know replied fuad they waited for more police then they shouted to the men at the farm and told them to come out didnt the men at the farm shoot at the police no they didnt replied fuad there were only three of them at the farm barkman was

black cat with them they met a friend called faisal who worked in the museum salahadin gave the black cat to faisal and told him the story it looks old said faisal and perhaps its valuable but i dont know about the gold and diamonds ill have to look at it carefully salahadin leila and fuad went and had some coffee they came back to the museum about two hours later well whats the answer asked fuad its very old replied faisal but its not made of gold and there are no diamonds the eyes and collar are made of stone the cat is made of a heavy kind of wood so it isnt valuable said leila seven men have died for a piece of wood no youre wrong said faisal its very very valuable its more than two thousand years old the gold and diamonds arent important perhaps there really was a gold cat said salahadin perhaps tomb robbers stole the real cat thousands of years ago then they put this wooden cat into the tomb well never know said fuad but were lucky to have this one yes we are lucky said faisal can we have it for our museum of course you can replied salahadin this is the right place for it come back in november said faisal then youll see the black cat in its right place and well come
