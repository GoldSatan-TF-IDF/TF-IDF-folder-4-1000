the children of night i we met before i told haber in when you were running the des moines office he beamed and held out his hand why darn it so we did i remember now odin i dont like to be called odin no all right mr gunnarsen not mr gunnarsen either just gunner thats right gunner id almost forgotten i said no you hadnt forgotten you never knew my name in des moines you didnt even know i was alive because you were too busy losing the state for our client i pulled you out of that one just like im going to pull you out now public relations he informed me starts at home they know were here eh gunner reminds me of the iowa office i said and he stumbled where there wasnt even a sill that was the presidential campaign of where haber had been trying to carry the state for the candidate who had retained us and those twelve electoral votes came over at the last minute only because we sent haber to nassau to rest and i took over from him i believe habers wife had owned stock in the company his belport layout was pretty good at that though four pry booths each with a simplex and an operatorreceptionist in the donors waiting room you cant tell from appearances but the donors who were waiting for their interrogation looked like a good representative samplea good mixture of sexes ages conditions of affluence and with proper attention to weighing he should at least be getting a fair survey of opinions integration of the pry scores was in a readout station in backi recognized one of the programmers and nodded to him good manalong with telefax equipment to the major research sources the britannica library of congress newswire services and so on from the integration room the readout operator could construct a speech a v commercial a space ad or anything else with the research lines to feed him any data he needed and test its appeal on his subjects in the front of the building was a taping booth and studio everything was small and semiportable but good stuff you could put together a v interview or edit one as well here as you could on the lot in the home office an anumberone setup right gunner said haber set it up myself to do the job i said then why arent you doing it he tightened up the eyes looked smaller and more intelligent but he didnt say anything directly he took my elbow and turned me to the dataprocessing room want you to meet someone he said opened the door led me inside and left me a tall slim girl looked up from a typer why hello gunner she said its been a long time i said hello candace apparently haber was not quite such a fat cat as he had seemed for he had clearly found out a little something about my personal life before i showed up in his office the rest of the list i had scribbled down in the scatjet was need big lie investigate children investigate opponents proposition marry candace harmon this was a relatively small job for moultrie bigelow but it was for a very very big account it was important to win it the client was the arcturan confederacy in the shop the word was that they had been turned down by three or four other pr agencies before we took them on nobody said why exactly but the reason was perfectly clear it was just because they were the arcturan confederacy there is nothing in any way illegal or immoral about a public relations firm representing a foreign account that is a matter of statuteas most people dont take the trouble to know the smithmacchioni act of and the courts held that it applied to extraplanetary foreigners as well as to terrestrials in back when the only intelligent aliens were the mummies on mars not that the mummies had ever hired anybody on earth to do anything for them but it was moultrie bigelows law department that sued for the declaratory judgment as a matter of fact just on the off chance thats how m b operates any public relations man takes on the color of his clients in the eyes of some people thats the nature of the beast the same people wouldnt think of blaming a surgeon because he dissolved a malignancy out of public enemy no or even a lawyer for defending him but when you are in charge of a clients emotional image and that image isnt liked some of the dislike rubs off on you at m b there is enough in the pay check at the end of every month so that we dont mind that m b has a reputation for taking on the tough onesthe only surviving american cigarette manufacturer is ours so is the exiled castroite government of cuba that still thinks it might one day get the state department to back up its claim for paying off on the bonds it printed for itself however for two reasonsas a simple matter of making things easy for ourselves and because its better doctrinewe dont flaunt our connection with the unpopular clients especially when the job is going badly one of the surest ways to get a bad public response to pr is to let the public know that some hotshot pr outfit is working on it so every last thing haber had done was wrong in this town it was too late for pry booths and m r i had just five minutes left before the conference and i spent it in the prybooth section anyhow i noticed a trid display of our clients home planet in the reception room where donors were sitting and waiting their turn it was very attractive the wide calm seas with the vertical airmount islets jutting out at intervals i turned around and walked out fast boiling mad a layman might not have seen just how many ways haber had found to go wrong the whole prybooth project was probably a mistake anyway to begin with to get any good out of pry booths you need depth interviews way deepdown m r stuff and for that you need paid donors lots of them and to get them you have to have a panel to pick from that means advertising in the papers and on the nets and interviewing twenty people for every one you hire to get a satisfactory sample in a town the size of belport you need to hire maybe fifty donors and that means talking to a thousand people every one of whom will go home and talk to his wife or her mother or their neighbors in a city like chicago or saskatoon you can get away with it with good technique the donor never really knows what hes being interviewed for although of course a good newspaperman or private eye can interview a couple of donors and work backward from the sense impulse stimuli with pretty fair accuracy but not in belport not when we never had a branch here before not when every living soul in town knew what we were doing because the rezoning ordinance was topic one over every coffee table in short we had tipped our hand completely as i say an amateur might not have spotted that but haber was not supposed to be an amateur i had just seen the trend charts too the referendum on granting rezoning privileges to our client was going to a vote in less than two weeks when haber had opened the branch sampling showed that it would fail by a fourtothree vote now a month and a half later he had worsened the percentage to three to two and going downhill all the way our client would be extremely unhappyprobably was unhappy already if they had managed to puzzle out the queer terrestrial progress reports we had been sending them and this was the kind of client that a flackery didnt want to have unhappy i mean all the others were littleleague stuff in comparison the arcturan confederacy was a culture as wealthy and as powerful as all earth governments combined and as arcturans dont bother with nonsense like national governments or private enterprise at least not in any way that makes sense to us this one client wasas big as every other possible client combined they were the ones who decided they needed this base in belport and it was up to m band specifically to me odin gunnarsen to see that they got it it was too bad that they had been fighting earth six months earlier in fact in a technical sense we were still at war it was only armistice not a peace that had called off the hbomb raids and the fleet engagements like i say m b takes on the tough ones besides haber four of the staff looked as though they knew which end was up candace harmon the pryintegration programmer and two very junior tas i took the head chair at the conference table without waiting to see where haber would want to sit and said well make this fast because were in trouble here and we dont have time to be polite youre percy that was the programmer he nodded and i didnt catch your name i said turning to the next along the table it was the copy chief a lanky shaveheaded oldster named tracy spockman his assistant one of the tas i had had my eye on turned out to be named manny brock i had picked easy jobs for all the deadheads reserving the smart ones for whatever might turn up so i started with the copy chief spockman were opening an arcturan purchasing agency and youre it you should be able to handle this one if i remember correctly you ran the duluth shop for a year he sucked on a cal pipe without expression well thanks mr gun just gunner well thanks but as copy chief manny here should be able to take care of that if i remember the way you ran the duluth operation youve probably got things set up so he can step right in and so he probably did at least it surely would do no real harm to give somebody else a chance at lousing things up i handed spockman the positions wanted page from the paper id picked up at the scatport and a scrawled list of notes id made up on the way in hire these girls ive marked for your staff rent an office and get some letters out youll see what i want from the list letters to every real estate dealer in town asking them if they can put together a fivethousandacre parcel in the area covered by the zoning referendum letter to every general contractor asking for bids on buildings make it separate bids on eachi think therell be five buildings altogether one exoclimatizedso get the airconditioning heating and plumbing contractors to bid too letter to every food wholesaler and major grocery outlet asking if they are interested in bidding on supplying arcturans with food fax chicago for what the arcturans fancy i dont rememberno meat i think but a lot of green vegetablesanyway find out and include the data in the letters electronics manufacturers office equipment dealers car and truck agencieswell the whole list is on that piece of paper i want every businessman in belport starting to figure out by tomorrow morning how much profit he might make on an arcturan base got it i think so mrgunner i was thinking how about stationery suppliers attorneys cpas dont askdo it now you down at the end there henry dane gunner henry what about club outlets in belport i mean specialized groups the arcturans are hot for navigation sailing like that see what you can do with the motorboat clubs and so on i noticed in the paper that theres a flower show at the armory next saturday its pretty late but squeeze in a speaker on arcturan fungi well fly in a display they tell me arcturans are hot gardeners when theyre homelove all the biological sciencesnice folks like to dabble i hesitated and looked at my notes i have something down here about veterans groups but i havent got the handle for it still if you can think of an angle let me knowwhats the matter he was looking doubtful its only that i dont want to conflict with candy gunner and so of course i had to face up to things and turn to candace harmon whats that honey i asked i think henry means my arcturanamerican friendship league it turned out that that had been one of habers proudest ideas i wasnt surprised after several weeks and about three thousand dollars it had worked up to a total of fortyone members how many of those were employees of the m b branch well all but eight candace admitted at once she wasnt smiling but she was amused dont worry about it i advised henry dane were folding the arcturanamerican friendship league anyway candace wont have time for it shell be working with me why fine gunner she said doing what i almost did marry candace one time and every once in a while since i have wished i hadnt backed away a very good thing was candace harmon doing i said what gunner says for you to do lets see first thing ive got five hundred arcturan domestic animals coming in tomorrow i havent seen them but they tell me theyre cute look like kittens are pretty durable figure out some way of getting them distributed fastmaybe a pet shop will sell them for fifty cents each haber protested my dear gunner the freight alone sure haber they cost about forty dollars apiece just to get them here any other questions like that no thats good i want one in each of five hundred homes by the end of the week and if i had to pay a hundred dollars to each customer to take them id pay next i want somebody to find me a veteran preferably disabled preferably who was actually involved in the bombing of the home planet i laid out a dozen more working linesan art show of the arcturan basrelief stuff that was partly to look at but mostly to feel a v panel show on arcturus that we could plant the whole routine none of it would do the job but all of it would help until i got my bearings then i got down to business whats the name of this fellow whos running for councilmanconnick thats right said haber whatve you got on him i asked i turned to candace who said promptly fortyone years old methodist married three kids of his own plus one of the casualties ran for state senate last year and lost but he carried belport running opposed to the referendum this year very big in junior chamber of commerce and vfw no whatve you got on him i persisted candace said slowly gunner look this is a nice guy why i know that honey i read his piece in the paper today so now tell me the dirt that he cant afford to have come out it wouldnt be fair to destroy him for nothing i brushed aside the fair business what do you mean for nothing were not going to win this referendum you know honey ive got news for you this is the biggest account anybody ever had and i want it we will win whatve you got on connick nothing really nothing she said quietly but you can get it candace said visibly upset of course theres probably some of course get it today ii but i wasnt relying totally on anyone not even candace since connick was the central figure of the opposition i caught a cab and went to see him it was already dark a cold clear night and over the mushroom towers of the business district a quartermoon was beginning to rise i looked at it almost with affection i had hated it so when i was there as i paid the cab two kids in snowsuits came sidling out to inspect me i said hello is your daddy home one was about five with freckles and bright blue eyes the other was darker browneyed and he had a limp the blueeyed one said daddys down in the cellar mommy will let you in if you ring the doorbell just push that button oh thats how those things work thanks connicks wife turned out to be a goodlooking skinny blonde in her thirties and the kids must have raced around the back way and alerted the old man because as she was taking my coat he was already coming through the hall i shook his hand and said i can tell by the smells from your kitchen that its dinnertime i wont keep you my name is gunnarsen and and youre from moultrie bigelowhere sit down mr gunnarsenand you want to know if i wont think it over and back the arcturan base no mr gunnarsen i wont but why dont you have a drink with me before dinner and then why dont you have dinner he was a genuine article this connick i had to admit he had caught me off balance why i dont mind if i do i said after a moment i see you know why im here he was pouring drinks well not altogether mr gunnarsen you dont really think youll change my mind do you i cant say that until i know why you oppose the base in the first place connick thats what i want to find out he handed me a drink sat down across from me and took a thoughtful pull at his own it was good scotch then he looked to see if the kids were within earshot and said the thing is this mr gunnarsen if i could i would kill every arcturan alive and if it meant i had to accept the death of a few million earthmen to do it that wouldnt be too high a price i dont want the base here because i dont want anything to do with those murdering animals well youre candid i said finished my drink and added if you meant that invitation to dinner i believe i will take you up on it i must say they were a nice family ive worked elections before connick was a good candidate because he was a good man the way his kids behaved around him proved it and the way he behaved around me was the clincher i didnt scare him a bit of course that was not altogether bad from my point of view connick kept the conversation off topic a during dinner which was all right with me but as soon as it was over and we were alone he said all right you can make your pitch now mr gunnarsen although i dont know why youre here instead of with tom schlitz schlitz was the man he was running against i said you dont know this business i guess what do we need him for hes already committed on our side and im already committed against you but i guess thats what youre hoping to change well whats your offer he was moving too fast for me i pretended to misunderstand really mr connick i wouldnt insult you by offering a bribe no i know you wouldnt because youre smart enough to know i wouldnt take money so it isnt money what is it then moultrie bigelow working for me instead of schlitz in the election thats a pretty good offer but the price is too high i wont pay it well i said as a matter of fact we would be willing yes i thought so no deal anyway do you really think i need help to get elected that was a good point i was forced to admit i conceded no not if everything else were equal youre way ahead right now as your surveys and ours both show but everything else isnt equal by which you mean that youre going to help old slitsandfits all right that makes it a horse race i held up my glass and he refilled it i said mr connick i told you once you didnt know this business you dont it isnt a horse race because you cant win against us i can sure give it a hell of a try though anywayhe finished his own drink thoughtfullyyou brainwashers are a little bit fat i think everybody knows how powerful you are and you havent really had to show it much lately i wonder if the emperors really running around naked oh no mr connick bestdressed emperor you ever saw take my word for it he said frowning a little bit i think ill have to find out for myself anyway frankly i think peoples minds are made up and you cant change them we dont have to i said dont you know why people vote the way they do connick they dont vote their minds they vote attitudes and they vote impulses frankly id rather work on your side than against you schlitz would be easy to beat hes jewish connick said angrily theres none of that in belport man of antisemitism you mean of course not but if one candidate is jewish and if it turns up that fifteen years ago he tried to square a parking ticketand theres always something that turns up connick believe methen theyll vote against him for fixing parking tickets thats what i mean by attitudes your voteroh not all of them but enough to swing any electiongoes into the booth pulled this way and that we dont have to change his mind we just have to help him decide which part of it to operate on i let him refill my glass and took a pull at it i was aware that i was beginning to feel the effects take you connick i said suppose youre a democrat and you go in to cast your vote we know how youre going to vote for president right youre going to vote for the democratic candidate connick said not unbending much not necessarily but probably not necessarily right and why not necessarily because maybe you know this fellow whos running on the democratic ticketor maybe somebody you know has a grudge against him couldnt get the postmasters job he wanted or ran against his delegates for the convention point is you have something against him just because your first instinct is for him so how do you vote whichever way happens to get dominance at the moment of voting not at any other moment not as a matter of principle but right then no we dont have to change any minds because most people dont have enough mind to change he stood up and absentmindedly filled his own glassi wasnt the only one who was beginning to feel the liquor id hate to be you he said half to himself oh its not bad he shook his head then recollected himself and said well thanks for the lesson i didnt know but ill tell you one thing youll never do youll never get me to vote on the arcturan side on any question i sneered theres an open mind for you leader of the people takes an objective look at every question all right im not objective they stink race prejudice connick oh dont be a fool there is i said an arcturan aroma they cant help it i didnt say smell i said stink i dont want them in this town and neither does anybody else not even schlitz you dont ever have to see them they dont like earth climate you know too hot for them too much air why connick i said ill bet you a hundred bucks you wont set eyes on an arcturan for at least a year not until the base is built and staffed and then i doubt theyll bother towhats the matter he was looking at me as though i were an idiot and i almost began to think i was why he said again in that tone that was more to himself than to me i guess ive been overrating you you think youre god so ive been accepting your own valuation what do you mean inexcusably bad staff work mr gunnarsen he said nodding judgmatically it ought to make me feel good but you know it doesnt it scares me with the kind of power you throw around you should always be right spit it out its just that you lose your bet didnt you know theres an arcturan in town right now iii when i got back to the car the phone was buzzing and the message recorded light blinked at me the message was from candace gunner a truce team has checked into the statlerbills to supervise the election and get this one of thems an arcturan the staff work wasnt so bad after all just unpardonably slow but there wasnt much comfort in that i called the hotel and was connected with one of the truce team staffthe best the hotel would do for me the staff man was a colonel who said yes mr knafti is aware of your work here and specifically does not wish to see you this is a truce team mr gunnarsen do you know what that means exactly and he hung up on me well i did know what it meantstrictly handsoff all the wayi simply hadnt known that they would interpret it that rigidly it was a kick in the eye any way i looked at it because it made me look like a fool in front of connick when i kind of wanted him scared of me because arcturans do after all stinknot good public relations at all when your product smells like wellrotted garlic buds a few hundred feet away i didnt want the voters smelling them and most of all because of the inference that i was sure any redblooded stubbornminded confused voter would draw jeez sam you hear about that arcturan coming to spy on us yeah charlie the damn bugs are practically accusing us of rigging the election damn right sam and you know what else they stink sam half an hour later i got a direct call from haber gunner boy good god oh this is the reeking end i said it sounds to me like youve found out about the arcturan on the truce team you know and you didnt tell me well i had been about to ream him for not telling me but obviously that wasnt going to do any good i tried anyway but he fell back on his fat ignorance they didnt clue me in from chicago can i help that be fair now gunner boy gunner boy very fairly hung up i was beginning to feel very sleepy for a moment i debated taking a briskup pill but the mild buzz connicks liquor had left with me was pleasant enough and besides it was getting late i went to the hotel suite candace had reserved for me and crawled into bed it only took me a few minutes to fall asleep but i was faintly aware of an odor it was the same hotel the truce team was staying at i couldnt really be smelling this arcturan knafti it was just my imagination thats what i told myself as i dialed for sleep and drifted off the pillowphone hummed and candaces voice said out of it wake up and get decent gunner im coming up i managed to sit up shook my head and took a few whiffs of amphetamine as always it woke me right up but at the usual price of feeling that i hadnt had quite enough sleep still i got into a robe and was in the bathroom fixing breakfast when she knocked on the door its open i called want some coffee sure gunner she came and stood in the doorway watching me turn the hilsch squirt to full boil and fill two cups i spooned dry coffee into them and turned the squirt to cold orange juice she took the coffee and shook her head so i just mixed one glassful swallowed it tossed the glass in the disposal hamper and took the coffee into the other room the bed had stripped itself already it was now a couch and i leaned back on it drinking my coffee all right honey i said whats the dirt on connick she hesitated then opened her bag and took out a photofax and handed it to me it was a reproduction of an old steel engraving headed in antique script the army of the united states and it said be it known to all men that daniel t connick asin aj has this date been separated from the service of the united states for the convenience of the government and be it further known to all men that the conditions of his discharge are dishonorable well what do you know i said you see honey theres always something candace finished her coffee set the cup down neatly on a windowsill and took out a cigarette that was like her she always did one thing at a time an orderly sort of mind that i couldnt matchand couldnt stand either undoubtedly she knew what i was thinking because undoubtedly she was thinking it too but there wasnt any nostalgia in her voice when she said you went and saw him last night didnt you and youre still going to knife him i said im going to see that he is defeated in the election yes thats what they pay me for me and some others no gunner she said thats not what m b pay me for if thats what you mean because there isnt that much money i got up and went over beside her more coffee no well i guess i dont want any either honey candace stood up crossed the room and sat down in a straight backed chair you wake up all of a sudden dont you dont change the subject we were talking about we were talking i told her about a job that were paid to do all right youve done one part of it for meyou got me what i wanted on connick i stopped because she was shaking her head im not so sure i did hows that well its not on the fax but i know why he got his dd desertion of hazardous duty on the moon in the un space force the year was i nodded because i understood what she was talking about connick wasnt the only one half the space force had cracked up that year november a heavy leonid strike of meteorites and a solar flare at the same time the space force top brass had decided they had to crack down and asked the us army to courtmartial every soldier who cut and ran for an underground shelter and the army had felt obliged to comply but most of them got presidential clemency i said he didnt candace shook her head he didnt apply um well its still on record i dismissed the subject something else what about these children candace put out her cigarette and stood up why im here gunner it was on your list soget dressed for what she grinned for my peace of mind for one thing also for investigating the children like you say ive made you an appointment at the hospital in fiftyfive minutes you have to remember that i didnt know anything about the children except rumors bless haber he hadnt thought it necessary to explain and candace only said wait till we get to the hospital youll see for yourself donnegan general was seven stories of creamcolored ceramic brick aircontrolled walllighted throughout tiny asepsis lamps sparkling blue where the ventilation ducts opened candace parked the car in an underground garage and led me to an elevator then to a waiting room she seemed to know her way around very well she glanced at her watch told me we were a couple of minutes early and pointed to a routing map that was a mural with colored lights showing visitors the way to whatever might be their destination it also showed quite impressively the size and scope of donnegan general the hospital had twentytwo fully equipped operating rooms a specimen and transplant bank xray and radiochemical departments a cryogenics room the most complete prosthesis installation on earth a geriatrics section ot rooms beyond number and of all things a fully equipped and crowded pediatric wing i said i thought this was a va facility exactly here comes our boy a navy officer was coming in hand and smile outstretched to candace hi good to see you and you must be mr gunnarsen candace introduced us as we shook hands the fellows name was commander whitling she called him tom he said well have to move since i talked to you theres been an allhands evolution scheduled for elevensome high brass inspection i dont want to hurry you but id like it if we were out of the way this is a little irregular nice of you to arrange it i said lead on we went up a highrise elevator and came out on the top floor of the building into a corridor covered with murals of disney and mother goose from a sun deck came the tinkle of a music box three children chasing each other down the hail dodged past us yelling they made pretty good time considering that two of them were on crutches what the hell are you doing here asked commander whitling sharply i looked twice but he wasnt talking to me or the kids he was talking to a man with a young face but a heavy black beard who was standing behind a donald duck mobile looking inconspicuous and guilty oh hi mr whitling the man said jeez i mustve got lost again looking for the px carhart said the commander dangerously if i catch you in this wing again you wont have to worry about the px for a year hear me well jeez all right mr whitling as the man saluted and turned his face wearing an expression of injury i noticed that the left sleeve of his bathrobe was tucked empty into a pocket you cant keep them out said whitling and spread his hands well all right mr gunnarsen here it is youre seeing the whole thing i looked carefully around it was all childrenlimping children stumbling children pale children weary children but what am i seeing exactly i asked why the children mr gunnarsen the ones we liberated the ones the arcturans captured on mars and then i connected i remembered about the capture of the colony on mars interstellar war is waged at the pace of a snails crawl because it takes so long to go from star to star the main battles of our war with arcturus had been fought no farther from earth than the surface of mars and the fleet engagement around orbit saturn still it had taken eleven years first to last from the surprise attack on the martian colony to the armistice signed in washington i remembered seeing a reconstructed tape of that martian surprise attack it was a summers dayhotat full noon ice melted into water the place was the colony around the southern springs out of the small descending sun a ship appeared it was a rocket it was brilliant gold metal and it came down with a halo of gold radiation around its splayed front like the fleshy protuberance of a starnosed mole it landed with an electrical crackle on the finegrained orange sand and out of it came the arcturans of course no one had known they were arcturans then they had swung around the sun in a long anecliptic orbit watching and studying and they had selected the small martian outpost as the place to strike in mars gravity they were bipedstwo of their ropy limbs were enough to lift them off the groundman tall in golden pressure suits the colonists came running out to meet themand were killed all of them all of the adults the children however had not been killed not that quickly or that easily at least some had not been killed at all and some of those were here in donnegan general hospital but not all comprehension beginning to emerge in my small mind i said then these are the survivors candace standing very close to me said most of them gunner the ones that arent well enough to be sent back into normal life and the others well they mostly dont have familieshaving been killed you see so theyve been adopted out into foster homes here in belport a hundred and eight of themisnt that right tom and now maybe you get some idea of what youre up against there were something like a hundred of the children in that wing and i didnt see all of them some of them were not to be seen whitling just told me about but couldnt show me the blood temperature room where the very young and very bad cases lived they had a gnotobiotic atmosphere a little rich in oxygen a little more humid than the ambient air plus pressure to help their weak metabolism keep oxygen spread in their parts on their right a little farther along were the small individual rooms belonging to the worst cases of all the contagious the incurables the unfortunates whose very appearance was bad for the others whitling was good enough to open polarizing shutters and let me look in on some of those where they lay in permanent solitary one of the arcturan efforts had been transplantation and the project seemed to have been directed by a whimsical person the youngest was about three the oldest in the late teens they were a disturbing lot and if i have glossed lightly over what i felt it is because what i felt is all too obvious kids in trouble of course those who had been put back into population werent put back shocking as these but they would pull at the heartstringsthey even pulled at mineand every time a foster parent or a foster parents neighbor or a casual passerby on the street felt that heartstring tug he would feel too a single thought the arcturans did this for after killing the potentially dangerous adults they had caged the tractable small ones as valuable research specimens and i had hoped to counteract this with five hundred arcturan pets whitling had been all this time taking me around the wing and i could hear in his voice the sound of what i was up against because he loved and pitied those kids hi terry he said on the sun deck bending over a bed and patting its occupant on his snowwhite hair terry smiled up at him cant hear us of course said whitling we grafted in new auditory nerves four weeks agoi did it myself but theyre not surviving third try too and of course each attempt is a worse risk than the one before antibodies i said he doesnt look more than five years old whitling nodded but the attack on the colony was oh i see what you mean said whitling the arcturans were of course interested in reproduction too ellenshe left us a couple of weeks agowas only thirteen but shed had six children now this is nancy nancy was perhaps twelve but her gait and arm coordination were those of a toddler she came stumbling in after a ball stopped and regarded me with dislike and suspicion nancys one of our cures whitling said proudly he followed my eyes oh nothing wrong there he said marsbred she hasnt adjusted to earth gravity is all she isnt slowthe balls bouncing too fast heres sam sam was a nearteenager giggling from his bed as he tried what was obviously the extremely wearing exercise of lifting his head off the mattress a candystriped practical nurse was counting time for him as he touched chin to chest one and two one and two he did it five times then slumped back grinning sams central nervous system was almost gone whitling said fondly but were making progress nervous tissue regeneration though is awfully i wasnt listening i was looking at sams grin which showed black and broken teeth diet deficiency said whitling following my look again all right i said ive seen enough now i want to get out of here before they have me changing diapers i thank you commander whiting i think i thank you which way is out iv i didnt want to go back to habers office i was afraid of what the conversation might be like but i had to get a fillin on what had been happening with our work and i had to eat so i took candace back to my room and ordered lunch from room service i stood at the thermal window looking out at the city while candace checked with the office i didnt even listen because candace knew what i would want to know i just watched belport cycle through an average dull monday at my feet belport was a radial town with an urban centercluster of the mushroomshaped buildings that were popular twenty years ago the hotel we were in was one in fact and from my window i could see three others looming above and below me to right and left and beyond them the cathedral spires of the apartment condominia of the residential districts i could see a creeping serpent of gaily colored cars moving along one of the trafficways pinpointed with sparks of our proreferendum campaign parades or one of the oppositions from four hundred feet it didnt seem to matter you know honey i said as she clicked off the v there isnt any sense to this i admit the kids are sad cases and who can resist kids in trouble but they dont have one solitary damned thing to do with whether or not the arcturans should have a telemetry and tracking station out on the lake candace said werent you the man who told me that logic didnt have anything to do with public relations she came to the window beside me turned and halfsat on the ledge and read from her notes survey index off another halfpoint haber says be sure to tell you thats a victorywould have been off two points at least without the arcats supplier letters out chicago approves budget overdraft and thats all that matters thanks the door chimed and she left me to let the waiter in with our lunch i watched her without much appetite except maybe for the one thing that i knew wasnt on the menu candace herself but i tried to eat candace did not seem to be trying to help me eat in fact she did something that was quite out of character for her all the way through lunch she kept talking and the one subject she kept talking about was the kids i heard about nina who was fifteen when she came to donnegan general and had been through the occupation all the waywho wouldnt talk to anybody and weighed fiftyone pounds and screamed unless she was allowed to hide under the bed and after six months said candace they gave her a handpuppet and she finally talked through that howd you find all this out i asked from tom and then there were the germfree kids she told me about them and about the series of injections and marrow transplants that they had needed to restore the bodys immune reaction without killing the patient and the ones with auditory and vocal nerves destroyed apparently because the arcturans were investigating the question of whether humans could think rationally in the absence of articulate words the ones raised on chemically pure glucose for dietary studies the induced bleeders the kids with no sense of touch and the kids with no developed musculature tom told you all this and lots more gunner and remember these are the survivors some of the kids who were deliberately how long have you known tom she put down her fork sugared her coffee and took a sip looking at me over the cup oh since ive been here two years since before the kids came of course pretty well i judge oh yes he really likes those kidsi could see that and so do you i swallowed some more of my own coffee which tasted like diluted pig swill and reached for a cigarette and said i think maybe i waited too long about the situation here wouldnt you say why yes gunner she said carefully i think you maybe missed the boat i tell you what else i think honey i think youre trying to tell me something and it isnt all about proposition four on the ballot next week and she said not irrelevantly as a matter of fact gunner im going to marry tom whitling on christmas day i sent her back to the office and stretched out on my bed smoking and watching the smoke being sucked into the wall vents it was rather peaceful and quiet because id told the desk to hold all calls until further notice and i wasnt feeling a thing perfection is so rare that it is interesting to find a case in which one has been perfectly wrong all the way if i had taken out my little list then i could have checked off all the points one way or another i hadnt fired haber and in fact i really didnt want to anymore because he wasnt much worse than i was at this particular job the record showed it i had investigated the children all right a little late i had investigated connick the number one opponent to the proposition and what i had found would hurt connick all right but i couldnt really see how it would help do our job and i certainly wasnt going to marry candace harmon come to think of it i thought lighting another cigarette from the stub of the old one there had been a fifth item and i had blown that one too the classics of public relations clearly show how little reason has to do with m r and yet i had allowed myself to fall into that oldest and most imbecilic of traps set for flacks think of historys master strokes of flackery the jews stabbed germany in the back seventyeight cardcarrying communists in the state department i will go to korea it is not enough for a theme to be rational indeed it is wrong for a theme to be rational if you want to move mens glands because above all else it must seem new and fresh and of such revolutionary simplicity that it illuminates an enormous confused and disagreeable problem in a fresh and hopeful light or so it must seem to the average man and since he has spent any number of surly worried hours groping for some personal salvation in the face of a bankrupt germany or a threat of subversion or a war that is going nowhere no rational solution can ever meet those strictures since he has already considered all the rational solutions and found either that they are useless or that the cost is more than he wants to pay so what i should have concentrated on in belport was the bright irrational distractive issue the big lie if you will and i had hardly found even a sly insinuation it was interesting to consider in just how many ways i had done the wrong thing including maybe the wrongest of all i had let candace harmon get away and then in these thoughts myself almost despising haply the door chimed and i opened it and there was this fellow in space force olivegreens saying come along mr gunnarsen the truce team wants to talk to you for one frozen moment there i was nineteen years old again i was a rocketman c on the moon guarding the aristarchus base against invaders from outer space this fellow was a colonel and his name was peyroles and he took me down the corridor to a private elevator i had never known was there up to the flat dome of the mushroom and into a suite that made my suite look like the cellar under a dog run in old levittown the reek was overpowering by then i had gotten over my quick response to the brass and i took out a kerpak and held it to my nose the colonel did not even look at me sit down barked the colonel and left me in front of an unlighted fireplace something was going on i could hear voices from another room a lot of them burned one in effigy and by god well burn a real one smells like a skunk turns my stomach and that last fellow whoever he was was pretty near right at thatalthough actually in the few seconds since id entered the suite i had almost forgotten the smell it was funny how you got used to it like a ripe cheese the first whiff knocked you sick but pretty soon the olfactory nerves got the hang of the thing and built up a defense all right the wars over and we have to get along with them but a mans home town whatever it was that was going on in the other room it was going on loudly tempers were always short when arcturans were around because the smell of course put everybody on edge people dont like bad smells theyre not nice they remind us of sweat and excrement which we have buttressed our lives against admitting as real personal facts then there was a loud military yell for orderi recognized the colonel peyrolesand then a voice that sounded queerly notquitehuman although it spoke in english an arcturan what was his name knafti but i had understood they couldnt make human sounds whoever it was he put an end to the meeting the door opened through it i could see a couple of dozen hostile backs leaving through another door and coming toward me the space force colonel a very young man with a pale angels face and a dragging limp in civilian clothes and yes the arcturan it was the first one i had ever been with at so close range in so small a group he wobbled toward me on four or six of his coathanger limbs breathingthorax encased in a golden shell his mantis face and bright black eyes staring at me peyroles closed the door behind them he turned to me and said mr gunnarsen knafti timmy brown i hadnt the ghost of a clue whether to offer to shake and if so with what knafti however merely regarded me gravely the boy nodded i said im glad to meet you gentlemen as you perhaps know i tried to set up an appointment before but your people turned me down i take it now the shoe is on the other foot colonel peyroles frowned toward the door he had just shutthere were still noises behind itbut said to me youre quite right that was a meeting of a civic leaders committee the door interrupted him by opening and a man leaned through and yelled peyroles can that thing understand white mans talk i hope so i hope it hears me when i say that im going to make it my personal business to take it apart if its still in belport this time tomorrow and if any human being or socalled human being like you gets in the way ill take him apart too he slammed the door without waiting for an answer you see said peyroles gruffly angrily things like that would never have happened with welltempered troops thats what we want to talk to you about i see i said and i did see very clearly because that fellow who had leaned through the door had been the arcturanpropertysale standard bearer we had counted on oldwhat had connick called himold slitsandfits schlitz the man we were attempting to elect to get our proposition through judging by the amount of noise id heard from the citizens delegation there was lynching in the atmosphere i could understand why they would reverse themselves and ask for me before things got totally out of control and wound up in murder if you call killing an arcturan murderalthough it occurred to me lynching knafti might not be the worst thing that could happen public sentiment might bounce back i shoved that thought out of my mind and got down to business what exactly i asked i gather you want me to do something about your image knafti sat himself down if thats what arcturans do on a twiningrack the pale boy whispered something to him then came to me mr gunnarsen he said i am knafti he spoke with a great precision of vowels and a stress at the end of each sentence as though he had learned english out of a handbook i had no trouble in understanding him at least not in understanding what it was he said it did take me a moment to comprehend what he meant and then peyroles had to help he means at this moment hes speaking for knafti said the colonel interpreter see the boy moved his lips for a momentshifting gears it seemed and said that is right i am timmy brown knaftis translator and assistant then ask knafti what he wants from me i tried to say it the way he hada sort of sneeze for the k and an indescribable whistle for the f timmy brown moved his lips again and said i knafti wish you to stop to leave to discontinue your operation in belport from the twiningtree the arcturan waved his ropy limbs and chittered like a squirrel the boy chirped back and said i knafti commend you on your effective work but stop it by which rumbled colonel peyroles he means knock it off go fight a space war peyroles timmyi mean knafti this is the job im paid to do the arcturan confederacy itself hired us i take my orders from arthur s bigelow jr and i carry them out whether knafti likes it or not chirp and chitter between knafti and the pale limping boy the arcturan left his twiningtree and moved to the window looking out into the sky and the copter traffic timmy brown said it does not matter what your orders may be i knafti tell you that your work is harmful he hesitated mumbling to himself we do not wish to obtain our base here at the cost of what is true and he turned imploringly to the arcturanit is apparent you are attempting to change the truth he chirped at the arcturan who took his blind black eyes from the window and came toward us arcturans dont walk exactly they drag themselves on the lower part of the thorax their limbs are supple and thin and what are not used for support are used for gestures knafti used a number of his now as he chirped one short series of sounds at the boy otherwise timmy brown finished off i knafti tell you we will have to fight this war over again as soon as i was back in my room i messaged chicago for orders and clarification and got back the answer i expected hold everything referring matter to asbjr await instructions so i awaited the way i awaited was to call candace at the office and get the latest sitrep i told her about the nearriot in the truce teams suite and asked her what it was all about she shook her head we have their appointments schedule gunner it just says meeting with civic leaders but one of the leaders has a secretary who goes to lunch with a girl from records and accounting here and and youll find out all right do that and now whats the current picture she began reading off briefing digests and field reports they were mixed but not altogether bad opinion sampling showed a small rise in favor of the arcturans in fact it wasnt much but it was the first plus change i had seen and doubly puzzling because of knaftis attitude and the brawl with the civic leaders i asked why honey candaces face in the screen was as puzzled as mine were still digging all right go on there were more pluses the flower show had yielded surprisingly big profits in attitudesamong those who attended of course they were only a tiny fraction of the population of belport the arcats were showing a plus for us too where we were down was in pta meeting resolutions in resignations from candaces arcturanamerican friendship league in poor attendance at neighborhood kaffeeklatsches now that i knew what to look for i could see what the children had done to us in every familysituation sampling the attitudes were measurably worse than when the subjects were interviewed in a nonfamily environmentat work stopped on the street in a theater the importance of that was just what i had told connick no man is a simple entity he behaves one way when his selfimage is as head of a family another when he is at a cocktail party another at work another still when a pretty girl sits down beside him on a commutercopter elementary truths but it had taken the m r boys half a century to learn how to use them in this case the use was clear play down family elements play up play i ordered more floats torchlight parades and a teenage beauty contest i canceled the picnic rallies we had planned and ordered a hold on the kaffeeklatsches i was not exactly obeying chicagos orders but it didnt matter all this could be canceled with a single word and anyway it was only nitpicking detail the one big weeny still escaped me i lit a cigarette thought for a minute and said honey get me some of the synoptic extracts of opinion sampling from heads of families and particularly families containing some of the children i dont want the integration or analysis just the raw interviews but with the scutwork left out and as soon as she was off the line the chicago circuit came in with a message theyd been holding query from asbjr provided top is taken off budget and your hand is freed can you guarantee repeat guarantee win on referendum question it was not the response i had expected from them still it was a legitimate question i took a moment to think it over junior bigelow had already given me a pretty free handas he always did how else can a troubleshooter work if he was now emphasizing that my hand was freed entirely it would not be because he thought i hadnt understood him in the first place nor would it be because he suspected i might be cheeseparing secretarial salaries he meant one thing win no matter what under those conditions could i do it well of course i could win yes provided i found the one big weeny you can always win an election any election anywhere provided you are willing to pay the right price it was finding the price to pay that was hard not just money sometimes the price you pay is a human being in the role for which i had been lining up connick throw a human sacrifice to the gods and your prayer is granted but was connick the sacrifice the gods wanted would it help to defeat him bearing in mind that his opponent was one of the men who had been screaming at knafti in the truce team suite and if sohad my knife enough edge to drain his blood well it always had had before and if connick wasnt the right man i would find the man who was i messaged back short and sweet yes and in less than a minute as though junior had been standing by at the faxtape receiver waiting for the word from meand perhaps he hadhis reply came back gunner weve lost the arcturan confederacy account arc con liaison man says all bets off theyre giving notice of cancellation our contract suggestion they will cancel entire armistice treaty too i dont have to tell you we need them some possibility that showing strong results in belport will get them back thats what we have to play for no holds barred gunner win that election the office circuit chimed then probably it was candace but i didnt want to talk to her just then i turned all the communication circuits to hold stripped down climbed into the shower set it for full needle spray and let the water beat on me it was not an aid to thought it was a replacement for thought i didnt want to think anymore i wanted time out i did not want to think about whether the war would break out again and if so in what degree i would have helped to bring that about what i was doing to nice guy connick whether it was all worth it or how much i was going to dislike myself that coming christmas day i only wanted to let the hot splash of scented foaming water anesthetize me when my skin began to look pale and wrinkly although i had not come to any conclusions or found any solutions i came out dressed opened the communications circuits and let them all begin blinking ringing and winking at once i took candace first she said gunner dear lord have you heard about the armistice commission theyve just released a statement i heard what else honey good girl she shifted gears without missing a beat then there was that meeting of civic leaders in the truce team suite i saw feedback from the armistice commissions statement what else she glanced at the papers in her hand hesitated then said nothing important uhgunner that v preempt for tonight yeah honey do you want me to cancel it i said no youre right we wont use the time for the arcturanamerican friendship league or whatever we had scheduled but youre wrong well use the time some way i dont know how right now but junior said honey i told her junior says all sorts of things anybody looking to scalp me well she said theres mr connick i didnt think youd want to see him no ill see him ill see anybody anybody i had surprised her she dove into her list again theres somebody from the truce team make it everybody from the truce team and commander whitling from from the hospital sure and tell him to bring some kids and she trailed off and looked at me gunner are you putting me on you dont really want to see all these people i smiled and reached out and patted the viewphone from her point of view it would look like an enormous cloudy hand closing in on her screen but she would know what i meant i said you could not be more wrong i do i want to see them all the more the better and the way id like to see them best is in my office all at once so set it up honey because ill be busy between now and then busy doing what gunner busy trying to think of what i want to see them for and i turned off the viewphone got up and walked out leaving the others gobbling into emptiness behind me what i needed was a long long walk and i took it when i was tired of walking i went to the office and evicted haber from his private quarters i kept him standing by what had once been his own desk while i checked with candace and found that she had made all my appointments for that evening then i told him to get lost and thanks i said he paused on his way to the door for what gunner for a very nice office to kill time in i waved at the furnishings i wondered what youd spent fifty grand on when i saw the invoices in the chicago office haber and i admit i thought there might have been a little padding but i was wrong he said woundedly gunnerboy i wouldnt do anything like that i believe you wait a minute i thought for a second then told him to send in some of the technical people and not to let anybody repeat anybody disturb me for any purpose whatever i scared him good too he left a shaken man a little angry a little admiring a little excited inside i think at the prospect of seeing how the great man would get himself out of this one meanwhile the great man talked briefly to the technicians took a tenminute nap drank the martinis out of his dinner tray and pitched the rest of it in the disposal then as i had nearly an hour before the appointments candace had set up for me i scrounged around fatcat habers office to see what entertainment it offered there were his files i glanced at them and forgot them there was nothing about the hoarded memoranda that interested me not even for gossip there were the books on his shelf but i did not care to disturb the patina of dust that even the cleaning machines had not been able to touch there was his private bar and the collection of photographs in the end compartment of his desk drawer it looked like very dull times waiting until the studio men reported in that they had completed their arrangements at my request and the v tapeeffects monitor could now be controlled by remote from my desk and then i knew i had a pleasant way of killing any amount of time have you ever played with the console of a v monitor backed by a library of tapeeffects strips it is very much like being god all that the machine does is take the stored videotapes that are in its files and play them back but it also manipulates size and perspective or superimposes one over another so that you can as i in fact have done put the living person of someone you dont like in a position embarrassing to him and project it on a montage screen so that only a studio tech can find the dots on the pattern where the override betrays its presence obviously this is a way out of almost any propaganda difficulty since it is childs play to make up any event you like and give it the seeming of reality of course everybody knows it can be done so the evidence of ones own eyes is no longer quite enough even for a voter and the laws can cut you down i had thought of whomping up some frightful frame around connick for example but it wouldnt work no matter when i did it there would still be time for the other side to spread the word of an electoral fraud and a hoax of this magnitude would make its own way onto the front pages so i used the machine for something much more interesting to me i used it as a toy i started by dialing the lunar base at aristarchus for background found a corps of rocketmen marching off in the long lunar step patched my own face onto one of the helmeted figures and zoomed in and out with the imaginary camera watching r c odin gunnarsen as a boy of nineteen scared witless but doing his job he was a pretty nice boy i thought objectively and wondered what had gone wrong with him later i abandoned that and sought for other amusements i found candaces images on tape in the files and pleasured myself with her for a time her open friendly face gave some dignity to the fantastic bodies of half a dozen v strippers in the files but i stopped that childs game i looked for a larger scope i spread the whole panoply of the heavens across the screen of the tape machine i sought out the crook of the big dippers handle traced its arc across half the heavens until i located orange arcturus then i zoomed in on the star as littler stars grew larger and hurtled out of range around it sought its seven graygreen planets and located number five among them the watery world that knafti had spawned upon i bade the computing mind inside the tape machine reconstruct the events of the orbit bombing for me and watched hellbombs splash enormous mushrooms of poisonous foam into the arcturan sky whipping the island cities with tidal waves and drowning them in death then i destroyed the whole planet i turned arcturus into a nova and watched the hot driven gases sphere out to embrace the planet boil its seas slag its cities and found myself sweating i ordered another drink from the dispenser and switched the machine off and then i became aware that the pale blue light over the door to habers office was glowing insistently it was time my visitors had arrived connick had brought his kids along three of them the lover from donnegan general had brought two more knafti and colonel peyroles had timmy brown welcome to romper room i said theyre making lynch mobs young this year they all yelled at me at onceor all but knafti whose tweeting chitter just didnt have the volume to compete i listened and when they showed signs of calming down i reached into fat cat habers booze drawer and poured myself a stiff one and said all right which of you creeps want first crack and they boiled up again while i drank my drink all of them except candace harmon who only stood by the door and looked at me so i said all right connick you first are you going to make me spread it all over the newscasts that you had a dishonorable discharge and by the way maybe youd like to meet my assistant blackmailer miss harmon over there dug up the dirt on you her boyfriend yelped but candace just went on looking i didnt look back but kept my eyes on connick he squinted his eyes put his hands in his pockets and said with considerable selfrestraint you know i was only seventeen years old when that happened oh sure i know more you had a nervous breakdown the year after your discharge space scared as they call it on the soapies yellow fever is what we called it on the moon he glanced quickly at his kids the two who were his own and the one who was not and said rapidly you know i could have had that dd reversed but you didnt the significant fact isnt that you deserted the significant fact is that you were loopy and id say still are timmy brown stuttered one moment i knafti have asked that you cease but connick brushed him aside why gunnarsen because i intend to win this election i dont care what it costs especially what it costs you but i knafti have instructed that was timmy brown trying again the armistice commission issued orders that was peyroles i dont know which is worse you or the bugs and that was candaces little friend from the hospital and they all were talking at once again even knafti came dragging toward me on his golden slugs belly chirruping and hooting and timmy brown was actually weeping as he tried to tell me i was wrong i had to stop the whole thing was against orders and why wouldnt i desist i shouted shut up all of you they didnt but the volume level dropped minutely i rode over it what the hell do i care what any of you want im paid to do a job my job is to make people act in a certain way i do it maybe tomorrow ill be paid to make them act the opposite way and ill do that too anyway who the hell are you to order me around a stinkbug like you knafti a gi quack like yourself whitling or you connick a a candidate for public office he said clearly and i give him much mannahe didnt shout but he talked right over me and as such i have an obligation but i outyelled him anyway candidate youre a candidate right up till the minute i tell the voters youre a nut connick and then youre dead and i will tell them i promise if i didnt get a chance to finish that sentence because all three of connicks kids were diving at me his own two and the other one they sent papers flying off habers desk and smashed his sandcrystal decanter but they didnt get to my throat where they clearly were aimed because connick and timmy brown dragged them back not easily i allowed myself a sneer and what does that prove your kids like you i admiteven the one from mars the one that knaftis people used for vivisectionthat knafti himself worked over likely as not nice picture right your bugbuddy there killing babies destroying kids or didnt you know that knafti himself was one of the boss bugs on the babykilling project timmy brown shrieked wildly you dont know what you are doing it was not knaftis fault at all his ashen face was haggard his rotten teeth bared in a grimace and he was weeping if you apply heat to a single molecule it will take off like a torn with a spark under his tail but you cannot say where it will go if you heat a dozen molecules they will fling out in all directions but you still do not know which directions they will be if however you heat a few billion about as many as are in a thimble of dilute gas you know where they will go they will expand mass action you cant tell what a single molecule may docall it the molecules free will if you likebut masses obey mass laws masses of anything even so small a mass as the growling troop that confronted me in habers office i let them yell and all the yelling was at me even candace was showing the frown and the darkening of the eyes and the working of the lips although she watched me as silently and steadily as ever connick brought it to a head all right everybody he yelled now listen to me lets get this thing straightened out he stood up a child gripped by each elbow and the third the youngest trapped between him and the door he looked at me with such loathing that i could feel itand didnt like it either although it was no more than i had expected and he said its true sammy here was one of the kids from mars maybe that has made me think things i shouldnt have thoughthes my kid now and when i think of those stink bugs cutting he stopped himself and turned to knafti well i see something a man who would do a thing like that would be a fiend id cut his heart out with my bare hands but you arent a man grimly he let go of the kids and strode toward knafti i cant forgive you god help me it isnt possible but i cant blame youexactlyany more than i can blame lightning for striking my house i think i was wrong maybe im wrong now buti dont know what you people doid like to shake your hand or whatever the hell it is youve got there ive been thinking of you as a perverted murderer and a filthy animal but ill tell you right now id rather work together with youfor your base for peace for whatever we can get together onthan with some human beings in this room i didnt stay to watch the tender scene that followed i didnt have to since the cameras and tape recorders that the studio people had activated for me behind every oneway mirror in the room would be watching for me i could only hope they had not missed a single word or scream because i didnt think i could do that scene over again i opened the door quietly and left and as i was going i caught the littlest connick kid sneaking past me headed for the v set in the waiting room and snaked out an arm to stop him stinker he hissed rat fink you may be right i told him but go back and keep your father company youre in on living history today nuts i always watch dr zhivago on monday nights and its on in five minutes and not tonight it isnt son you can hold that against me too we preempted the time for a different show entirely i escorted him back into the room closed the door picked up my coat and left candace was waiting for me with the car she was driving it herself will i make the ninethirty flight i asked sure gunner she steered onto the autotraffic lane put the car on servo and dialed the scatport then sat back and lit a cigarette for each of us i took one and looked morosely out the window down below us on the slowtraffic level we were passing a torchlight parade with floats and glee clubs and free beer at the major pedestrian intersections i opened the glove compartment and took out field glasses looked through them oh you dont have to check up gunner i took care of it theyre all plugging the program i see they are not only were the marchers carrying streamers that advertised our preempt show that was now already beginning to be on the air but the floats carried projection screens and amplifiers you couldnt look anywhere in the procession without seeing knafti huge and hideous in his gold carapace clutching the children and protecting them against the attack of that monster from another planet me the studio people had done a splendid job of splicing in no time at all the whole scene was there on camera as real as i had just lived it want to listen candace fished out and passed me a hyperboloid longhearer but i didnt need it i remembered what the voices would be saying there would be connick denouncing me timmy brown denouncing me the kids denouncing me all of them colonel peyroles denouncing me commander whitling denouncing me even knafti denouncing me all that hate and only one target me of course juniorll fire you hell have to gunner i said i need a vacation anyway it wouldnt matter sooner or later when the pressure was off junior would find a way to hire me back once the lawsuits had been settled once the armistice commission could finish its work once i could be put on the payroll inconspicuously at an inconspicuous job in an inconspicuous outpost of the firm with an inconspicuous future we slid over the top of a spiraling ramp and down into the parking bays of the scatport so long honey i said and merry christmas to you both oh gunner i wish but i knew what she really wished and i wouldnt let her finish i said hes a nice fellow whitling and you know im not i didnt kiss her goodbye the scatjet was ready for boarding i fed my ticket into the checkin slot got the green light as the turnstile clicked open entered the plane and took a seat on the far side by the window you can win any cause if you care to pay the price all it takes is one human sacrifice by the time the scatjet began to roar to quiver and to turn on its axis away from the terminal i had faced the fact that that price once and for all was paid i saw candace standing there on the roof of the loading dock her skirts whipped by the backblast she didnt wave to me but she didnt go away as long as i could see her standing on the platform then of course she would go back to her job and ultimately on christmas morning to that nice guy at the hospital haber would stay in charge of his nolongerimportant branch office connick would win his campaign knafti would transact his incomprehensible business with earth and if any of them ever thought of me again it would be with loathing anger and contempt but that is the way to win an election you have to pay the price it was just the breaks of the game that the price of this one was me
