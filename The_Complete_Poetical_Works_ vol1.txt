the complete poetical works vol preface this edition of his poetical works contains all shelleys ascertained poems and fragments of verse that have hitherto appeared in print in preparing the volume i have worked as far as possible on the principle of recognizing the editio princeps as the primary textual authority i have not been content to reprint mrs shelleys recension of or that of any subsequent editor of the poems the present text is the result of a fresh collation of the early editions and in every material instance of departure from the wording of those originals the rejected reading has been subjoined in a footnote again wherever as in the case of julian and maddalo there has appeared to be good reason for superseding the authority of the editio princeps the fact is announced and the substituted exemplar indicated in the prefatory note in the case of a few pieces extant in two or more versions of debatable authority the alternative text or texts will be found at the end of the relevant work but it may be said once for all that this does not pretend to be a variorum edition in the proper sense of the term the textual apparatus does not claim to be exhaustive thus i have not thought it necessary to cumber the footnotes with every minute grammatical correction introduced by mrs shelley apparently on her own authority into the texts of nor has it come within the scheme of this edition to record every conjectural emendation adopted or proposed by rossetti and others in recent times but it is hoped that up to and including the editions of at least no important variation of the text has been overlooked whenever a reading has been adopted on manuscript authority a reference to the particular source has been added below i have been chary of gratuitous interference with the punctuation of the manuscripts and early editions in this direction however some revision was indispensable even in his most carefully finished fair copy shelley underpunctuates thus in the exquisite autograph hunt ms of julian and maddalo mr buxton forman the most conservative of editors finds it necessary to supplement shelleys punctuation in no fewer than ninetyfour places and sometimes punctuates capriciously in the very act of transcribing his mind was apt to stray from the work in hand to higher things he would lose himself in contemplating those airy abstractions and lofty visions of which alone he greatly cared to sing to the neglect and detriment of the merely external and formal element of his song shelley recked little of the jots and tittles of literary craftsmanship he committed many a small sin against the rules of grammar and certainly paid but a halting attention to the nice distinctions of punctuation thus in the early editions a comma occasionally plays the part of a semicolon colons and semicolons seem to be employed interchangeably a semicolon almost invariably appears where nowadays we should employ the dash and lastly the dash itself becomes a point of all work replacing indifferently commas colons semicolons or periods inadequate and sometimes haphazard as it is however shelleys punctuation so far as it goes is of great value as an index to his metrical or at times it may be to his rhetorical intention for in shelleys hands punctuation serves rather to mark the rhythmical pause and onflow of the verse or to secure some declamatory effect than to indicate the structure or elucidate the sense for this reason the original pointing has been retained save where it tends to obscure or pervert the poets meaning amongst the editors notes at the end of the volume the reader will find lists of the punctual variations in the longer poems by means of which the supplementary points now added may be identified and the original points which in this edition have been deleted or else replaced by others ascertained in the order of their occurrence in the use of capitals shelleys practice has been followed while an attempt has been made to reduce the number of his inconsistencies in this regard to have reproduced the spelling of the manuscripts would only have served to divert attention from shelleys poetry to my own ingenuity in disgusting the reader according to the rules of editorial punctilio i adapt a phrase or two from the preface to the revolt of islam shelley was neither very accurate nor always consistent in his spelling he was to say the truth indifferent about all such matters indeed to one absorbed in the spectacle of a world travailing for lack of the gospel of political justice the study of orthographical niceties must have seemed an occupation for bedlamites again as a distinguished critic and editor of shelley professor dowden aptly observes in this connexion a great poet is not of an age but for all time irregular or antiquated forms such as recieve sacrifize tyger gulph desart falshood and the like can only serve to distract the readers attention and mar his enjoyment of the verse accordingly shelleys eccentricities in this kind have been discarded and his spelling reversed in accordance with modern usage all weak preteriteforms whether indicatives or participles have been printed with ed rather than t participial adjectives and substantives such as past alone excepted in the case of leap which has two preteriteforms both employed by shelley see for an example of the longer form the hymn to mercury where leaped rhymes with heaped line the shorter form rhyming to wept adapt etc occurs more frequently one with the long vowel of the presentform the other with a vowelchange of course wherever this vowelshortening takes place whether indicated by a corresponding change in the spelling or not t not ed is properly used cleave cleft deal dealt etc the forms discarded under the general rule laid down above are such as wrackt prankt snatcht kist opprest etc like that of crept from creep i have not hesitated to print the longer form leaped and the shorter after mr henry sweets example lept in order clearly to indicate the pronunciation intended by shelley in the editions the two vowelsounds are confounded under the one spelling leapt in a few cases shelleys spelling though unusual or obsolete has been retained thus in aethereal paean and one or two more words the ae will be found and airy still appears as aery shelley seems to have uniformly written lightening here the word is so printed whenever it is employed as a trisyllable elsewhere the ordinary spelling has been adopted not a little has been written about uprest revolt of islam which has been described as a nonceword deliberately coined by shelley on no better warrant than the exigency of the rhyme there can be little doubt that uprest is simply an overlooked misprint for uprist not by any means a nonceword but a genuine english verbal substantive of regular formation familiar to many from its employment by chaucer true the corresponding rhymewords in the passage above referred to are nest possessed breast but a laxity such as nest uprist is quite in shelleys manner thus in this very poem we find midst shedst mist rest blest loveliest mist kissed dressed shelley may have first seen the word in the ancient mariner but he employs it more correctly than coleridge who seems to have mistaken it for a preteriteform uprose whereas in truth it serves either as the third person singular of the present upriseth or as here for the verbal substantive uprising the editor of shelley today enters upon a goodly heritage the accumulated gains of a series of distinguished predecessors mrs shelleys two editions of form the nucleus of the present volume and her notes are here reprinted in full but the arrangement of the poems differs to some extent from that followed by her chiefly in respect of queen mab which is here placed at the head of the juvenilia instead of at the forefront of the poems of shelleys maturity in a slender volume of poems and fragments entitled relics of shelley was published by dr richard garnett cb a precious sheaf gleaned from the manuscripts preserved at boscombe manor the relics constitute a salvage second only in value to the posthumous poems of to the growing mass of shelleys verse yet more material was added in by mr william michael rossetti who edited for moxon the complete poetical works published in that year to him we owe in particular a revised and greatly enlarged version of the fragmentary drama of charles i but though not seldom successful in restoring the text mr rossetti pushed revision beyond the bounds of prudence freely correcting grammatical errors rectifying small inconsistencies in the sense and too lightly adopting conjectural emendations on the grounds of rhyme or metre in the course of an article published in the westminster review for july miss mathilde blind with the aid of material furnished by dr garnett was enabled in the words of mr buxton forman to supply omissions make authoritative emendations and controvert erroneous changes in mr rossettis work and in the more cautiously edited text of his later edition published by moxon in may be traced the influence of her strictures six years later appeared a variorum edition in which for the first time shelleys text was edited with scientific exactness of method and with a due respect for the authority of the original editions it would be difficult indeed to overestimate the gains which have accrued to the lovers of shelley from the strenuous labours of mr harry buxton forman cb he too has enlarged the body of shelleys poetry mr formans most notable addition is the second part of the daemon of the world which he printed privately in and included in his library edition of the poetical works published in the same year see the list of editions etc at the end of volume but important as his editions undoubtedly are it may safely be affirmed that his services in this direction constitute the least part of what we owe him he has vindicated the authenticity of the text in many places while in many others he has succeeded with the aid of manuscripts in restoring it his untiring industry in research his wide bibliographical knowledge and experience above all his accuracy as invariable as it is minute have combined to make him in the words of professor dowden our chief living authority on all that relates to shelleys writings his name stands securely linked for all time to shelleys by a long series of notable words including three successive editions of the poems an edition of the prose remains as well as many minor publications a bibliography the shelley library and several facsimile reprints of the early issues edited for the shelley society to professor dowden whose authoritative biography of the poet published in was followed in by an edition of the poems macmillans is due the addition of several pieces belonging to the juvenile period incorporated by him in the pages of the life of shelley professor dowden has also been enabled with the aid of the manuscripts placed in his hands to correct the text of the juvenilia in many places in professor george e woodberry edited a centenary edition of the complete poetical works in which to quote his own words an attempt is made to summarize the labours of more than half a century on shelleys text and on his biography so far as the biography is bound up with the text in this centenary edition the textual variations found in the harvard college manuscripts as well as those in the manuscripts belonging to mr frederickson of brooklyn are fully recorded professor woodberrys text is conservative on the whole but his revision of the punctuation is drastic and occasionally sacrifices melody to perspicuity in mr cd locock published in a quarto volume of seventyfive pages the fruits of a careful scrutiny of the shelley manuscripts now lodged in the bodleian library mr locock succeeded in recovering several inedited fragments of verse and prose amongst the poems chiefly concerned in the results of his examination may be named marenghi prince athanase the witch of atlas to constantia the ode to naples and last not least prometheus unbound full use has been made in this edition of mr lococks collations and the fragments recovered and printed by him are included in the text variants derived from the bodleian manuscripts are marked b in the footnotes on the state of the text generally and the various quarters in which it lies open to conjectural emendation i cannot do better than quote the following succinct and luminous account from a causerie on the shelley manuscripts in the bodleian library contributed by dr richard garnett cb to the columns of the speaker of december from the textual point of view shelleys works may be divided into three classes those published in his lifetime under his own direction those also published in his lifetime but in his absence from the press and those published after his death the first class includes queen mab the revolt of islam and alastor with its appendages published in england before his final departure for the continent and the cenci and adonais printed under his own eye at leghorn and pisa respectively except for some provoking but corrigible misprints in the revolt of islam and one crucial passage in alastor these poems afford little material for conjectural emendation for the alexandrines now and then left in the middle of stanzas in the revolt of islam must remain untouched as proceeding not from the printers carelessness but the authors the second class poems printed during shelleys lifetime but not under his immediate inspection comprise prometheus unbound and rosalind and helen together with the pieces which accompanied them epipsychidion hellas and swellfoot the tyrant the correction of the most important of these the prometheus was the least satisfactory shelley though speaking plainly to the publisher rather hints than expresses his dissatisfaction when writing to gisborne the corrector but there is a pretty clear hint when on a subsequent occasion he says to him i have received hellas which is prettily printed and with fewer mistakes than any poem i ever published this also was probably not without influence on his determination to have the cenci and adonais printed in italyof the third class of shelleys writings those which were first published after his death sufficient facsimiles have been published to prove that trelawnys graphic description of the chaotic state of most of them was really in no respect exaggeratedthe difficulty is much augmented by the fact that these pieces are rarely consecutive but literally disiecti membra poetae scattered through various notebooks in a way to require piecing together as well as deciphering the editors of the posthumous poems moreover though diligent according to their light were neither endowed with remarkable acumen nor possessed of the wide knowledge requisite for the full intelligence of so erudite a poet as shelley hence the perpetration of numerous mistakes some few of the manuscripts indeed such as those of the witch of atlas julian and maddalo and the lines at naples were beautifully written out for the press in shelleys best hand but their very value and beauty necessitated the ordeal of transcription with disastrous results in several instances an entire line dropped out of the lines at naples and although julian and maddalo was extant in more than one very clear copy the printed text had several such sensedestroying errors as least for lead the corrupt state of the text has stimulated the ingenuity of numerous correctors who have suggested many acute and convincing emendations and some very specious ones which sustained scrutiny has proved untenable it should be needless to remark that success has in general been proportionate to the facilities of access to the manuscripts which have only of late become generally available if shelley is less fortunate than most modern poets in the purity of his text he is more fortunate than many in the preservation of his manuscripts these have not as regards a fair proportion been destroyed or dispersed at auctions but were protected from either fate by their very character as confused memoranda as such they remained in the possession of shelleys widow and passed from her to her son and daughterinlaw after sir percy shelleys death lady shelley took the occasion of the erection of the monument to shelley at university college oxford to present certain of the manuscripts to the bodleian library and verse and sculpture form an imperishable memorial of his connection with the university where his residence was so brief and troubled dr garnett proceeds the most important of the bodleian manuscripts is that of prometheus unbound which says mr locock has the appearance of being an intermediate draft and also the first copy made this should confer considerable authority on its variations from the accepted text as this appears to have been printed from a copy not made by shelley himself my prometheus he writes to ollier on september is now being transcribed an expression which he would hardly have used if he had himself been the copyist he wished the proofs to be sent to him in italy for correction but to this ollier objected and on may shelley signifies his acquiescence adding however in this case i shall repose trust in your care respecting the correction of the press mr gisborne will revise it he heard it recited and will therefore more readily seize any error this confidence in the accuracy of gisbornes verbal memory is touching from a letter to gisborne on may following it appears that the offer to correct came from him and that shelley sent him two little papers of corrections and additions which were probably made use of or the fact would have been made known in the case of additions this may satisfactorily account for apparent omissions in the bodleian manuscript gisborne after all did not prove fully up to the mark it is to be regretted writes shelley to ollier on november that the errors of the press are so numerous adding i shall send you the list of errata in a day or two this was probably the list of errata written by shelley himself from which mrs shelley corrected the edition of in placing queen mab at the head of the juvenilia i have followed the arrangement adopted by mr buxton forman in his library edition of i have excluded the wandering jew having failed to satisfy myself of the sufficiency of the grounds on which in certain quarters it is accepted as the work of shelley the shorter fragments are printed as in professor dowdens edition of along with the miscellaneous poems of the years to which they severally belong under titles which are sometimes borrowed from mr buxton forman sometimes of my own choosing i have added a few brief editors notes mainly on textual questions at the end of the book of the poverty of my work in this direction i am painfully aware but in the present edition the ordinary reader will it is hoped find an authentic complete and accurately printed text and if this be so the principal end and aim of the oxford shelley will have been attained i desire cordially to acknowledge the courtesy of mr h buxton forman cb by whose kind sanction the second part of the daemon the world appears in this volume and i would fain express my deep sense of obligation for manifold information and guidance derived from mr buxton formans various editions reprints and other publications especially from the monumental library edition of acknowledgements are also due to the poets grandson charles ej esdaile esq for permission to include the early poems first printed in professor dowdens life of shelley and to mr cd locock for leave to make full use of the material contained in his interesting and stimulating volume to dr richard garnett cb and to professor dowden cordial thanks are hereby tendered for good counsel cheerfully bestowed to two of the editors of the shelley society reprints mr thomas j wise and mr robert a potts both generously communicative collectors i am deeply indebted for the gift or loan of scarce volumes as well as for many kind offices in other ways lastly to the staff of the oxford university press my heartiest thanks are owing for their unremitting care in all that relates to the printing and correcting of the sheets thomas hutchinson december postscript in a valuable paper notes on passages in shelley contributed to the modern language review october mr ac bradley discussed amongst other things some fifty places in the text of shelleys verse and indicated certain errors and omissions in this edition with the aid of these notes the editor has now carefully revised the text and has in many places adopted the suggestions or conclusions of their accomplished author june preface by mrs shelley to first collected edition obstacles have long existed to my presenting the public with a perfect edition of shelleys poems these being at last happily removed i hasten to fulfil an important duty that of giving the productions of a sublime genius to the world with all the correctness possible and of at the same time detailing the history of those productions as they sprang living and warm from his heart and brain i abstain from any remark on the occurrences of his private life except inasmuch as the passions which they engendered inspired his poetry this is not the time to relate the truth and i should reject any colouring of the truth no account of these events has ever been given at all approaching reality in their details either as regards himself or others nor shall i further allude to them than to remark that the errors of action committed by a man as noble and generous as shelley may as far as he only is concerned be fearlessly avowed by those who loved him in the firm conviction that were they judged impartially his character would stand in fairer and brighter light than that of any contemporary whatever faults he had ought to find extenuation among his fellows since they prove him to be human without them the exalted nature of his soul would have raised him into something divine the qualities that struck any one newly introduced to shelley were first a gentle and cordial goodness that animated his intercourse with warm affection and helpful sympathy the other the eagerness and ardour with which he was attached to the cause of human happiness and improvement and the fervent eloquence with which he discussed such subjects his conversation was marked by its happy abundance and the beautiful language in which he clothed his poetic ideas and philosophical notions to defecate life of its misery and its evil was the ruling passion of his soul he dedicated to it every power of his mind every pulsation of his heart he looked on political freedom as the direct agent to effect the happiness of mankind and thus any newsprung hope of liberty inspired a joy and an exultation more intense and wild than he could have felt for any personal advantage those who have never experienced the workings of passion on general and unselfish subjects cannot understand this and it must be difficult of comprehension to the younger generation rising around since they cannot remember the scorn and hatred with which the partisans of reform were regarded some few years ago nor the persecutions to which they were exposed he had been from youth the victim of the state of feeling inspired by the reaction of the french revolution and believing firmly in the justice and excellence of his views it cannot be wondered that a nature as sensitive as impetuous and as generous as his should put its whole force into the attempt to alleviate for others the evils of those systems from which he had himself suffered many advantages attended his birth he spurned them all when balanced with what he considered his duties he was generous to imprudence devoted to heroism these characteristics breathe throughout his poetry the struggle for human weal the resolution firm to martyrdom the impetuous pursuit the glad triumph in good the determination not to despair such were the features that marked those of his works which he regarded with most complacency as sustained by a lofty subject and useful aim in addition to these his poems may be divided into two classes the purely imaginative and those which sprang from the emotions of his heart among the former may be classed the witch of atlas adonais and his latest composition left imperfect the triumph of life in the first of these particularly he gave the reins to his fancy and luxuriated in every idea as it rose in all there is that sense of mystery which formed an essential portion of his perception of life a clinging to the subtler inner spirit rather than to the outward form a curious and metaphysical anatomy of human passion and perception the second class is of course the more popular as appealing at once to emotions common to us all some of these rest on the passion of love others on grief and despondency others on the sentiments inspired by natural objects shelleys conception of love was exalted absorbing allied to all that is purest and noblest in our nature and warmed by earnest passion such it appears when he gave it a voice in verse yet he was usually averse to expressing these feelings except when highly idealized and many of his more beautiful effusions he had cast aside unfinished and they were never seen by me till after i had lost him others as for instance rosalind and helen and lines written among the euganean hills i found among his papers by chance and with some difficulty urged him to complete them there are others such as the ode to the skylark and the cloud which in the opinion of many critics bear a purer poetical stamp than any other of his productions they were written as his mind prompted listening to the carolling of the bird aloft in the azure sky of italy or marking the cloud as it sped across the heavens while he floated in his boat on the thames no poet was ever warmed by a more genuine and unforced inspiration his extreme sensibility gave the intensity of passion to his intellectual pursuits and rendered his mind keenly alive to every perception of outward objects as well as to his internal sensations such a gift is among the sad vicissitudes of human life the disappointments we meet and the galling sense of our own mistakes and errors fraught with pain to escape from such he delivered up his soul to poetry and felt happy when he sheltered himself from the influence of human sympathies in the wildest regions of fancy his imagination has been termed too brilliant his thoughts too subtle he loved to idealize reality and this is a taste shared by few we are willing to have our passing whims exalted into passions for this gratifies our vanity but few of us understand or sympathize with the endeavour to ally the love of abstract beauty and adoration of abstract good the to agathon kai to kalon of the socratic philosophers with our sympathies with our kind in this shelley resembled plato both taking more delight in the abstract and the ideal than in the special and tangible this did not result from imitation for it was not till shelley resided in italy that he made plato his study he then translated his symposium and his ion and the english language boasts of no more brilliant composition than platos praise of love translated by shelley to return to his own poetry the luxury of imagination which sought nothing beyond itself as a child burdens itself with spring flowers thinking of no use beyond the enjoyment of gathering them often showed itself in his verses they will be only appreciated by minds which have resemblance to his own and the mystic subtlety of many of his thoughts will share the same fate the metaphysical strain that characterizes much of what he has written was indeed the portion of his works to which apart from those whose scope was to awaken mankind to aspirations for what he considered the true and good he was himself particularly attached there is much however that speaks to the many when he would consent to dismiss these huntings after the obscure which entwined with his nature as they were he did with difficulty no poet ever expressed in sweeter more heartreaching or more passionate verse the gentler or more forcible emotions of the soul a wise friend once wrote to shelley you are still very young and in certain essential respects you do not yet sufficiently perceive that you are so it is seldom that the young know what youth is till they have got beyond its period and time was not given him to attain this knowledge it must be remembered that there is the stamp of such inexperience on all he wrote he had not completed his nineandtwentieth year when he died the calm of middle life did not add the seal of the virtues which adorn maturity to those generated by the vehement spirit of youth through life also he was a martyr to illhealth and constant pain wound up his nerves to a pitch of susceptibility that rendered his views of life different from those of a man in the enjoyment of healthy sensations perfectly gentle and forbearing in manner he suffered a good deal of internal irritability or rather excitement and his fortitude to bear was almost always on the stretch and thus during a short life he had gone through more experience of sensation than many whose existence is protracted if i die tomorrow he said on the eve of his unanticipated death i have lived to be older than my father the weight of thought and feeling burdened him heavily you read his sufferings in his attenuated frame while you perceived the mastery he held over them in his animated countenance and brilliant eyes he died and the world showed no outward sign but his influence over mankind though slow in growth is fast augmenting and in the ameliorations that have taken place in the political state of his country we may trace in part the operation of his arduous struggles his spirit gathers peace in its new state from the sense that though late his exertions were not made in vain and in the progress of the liberty he so fondly loved he died and his place among those who knew him intimately has never been filled up he walked beside them like a spirit of good to comfort and benefit to enlighten the darkness of life with irradiations of genius to cheer it with his sympathy and love any one once attached to shelley must feel all other affections however true and fond as wasted on barren soil in comparison it is our best consolation to know that such a pureminded and exalted being was once among us and now exists where we hope one day to join him although the intolerant in their blindness poured down anathemas the spirit of good who can judge the heart never rejected him in the notes appended to the poems i have endeavoured to narrate the origin and history of each the loss of nearly all letters and papers which refer to his early life renders the execution more imperfect than it would otherwise have been i have however the liveliest recollection of all that was done and said during the period of my knowing him every impression is as clear as if stamped yesterday and i have no apprehension of any mistake in my statements as far as they go in other respects i am indeed incompetent but i feel the importance of the task and regard it as my most sacred duty i endeavour to fulfil it in a manner he would himself approve and hope in this publication to lay the first stone of a monument due to shelleys genius his sufferings and his virtues se al seguir son tarda forse avverra che l bel nome gentile consacrero con questa stanca penna postscript in second edition of in revising this new edition and carefully consulting shelleys scattered and confused papers i found a few fragments which had hitherto escaped me and was enabled to complete a few poems hitherto left unfinished what at one time escapes the searching eye dimmed by its own earnestness becomes clear at a future period by the aid of a friend i also present some poems complete and correct which hitherto have been defaced by various mistakes and omissions it was suggested that the poem to the queen of my heart was falsely attributed to shelley i certainly find no trace of it among his papers and as those of his intimate friends whom i have consulted never heard of it i omit it two poems are added of some length swellfoot the tyrant and peter bell the third i have mentioned the circumstances under which they were written in the notes and need only add that they are conceived in a very different spirit from shelleys usual compositions they are specimens of the burlesque and fanciful but although they adopt a familiar style and homely imagery there shine through the radiance of the poets imagination the earnest views and opinions of the politician and the moralist at my request the publisher has restored the omitted passages of queen mab i now present this edition as a complete collection of my husbands poetical works and i do not foresee that i can hereafter add to or take away a word or line putney november preface by mrs shelley to the volume of posthumous poems published in in nobil sangue vita umile e queta ed in alto intelletto un puro core frutto senile in sul giovenil fibre e in aspetto pensoso anima lieta petrarca it had been my wish on presenting the public with the posthumous poems of mr shelley to have accompanied them by a biographical notice as it appeared to me that at this moment a narration of the events of my husbands life would come more gracefully from other hands than mine i applied to mr leigh hunt the distinguished friendship that mr shelley felt for him and the enthusiastic affection with which mr leigh hunt clings to his friends memory seemed to point him out as the person best calculated for such an undertaking his absence from this country which prevented our mutual explanation has unfortunately rendered my scheme abortive i do not doubt but that on some other occasion he will pay this tribute to his lost friend and sincerely regret that the volume which i edit has not been honoured by its insertion the comparative solitude in which mr shelley lived was the occasion that he was personally known to few and his fearless enthusiasm in the cause which he considered the most sacred upon earth the improvement of the moral and physical state of mankind was the chief reason why he like other illustrious reformers was pursued by hatred and calumny no man was ever more devoted than he to the endeavour of making those around him happy no man ever possessed friends more unfeignedly attached to him the ungrateful world did not feel his loss and the gap it made seemed to close as quickly over his memory as the murderous sea above his living frame hereafter men will lament that his transcendent powers of intellect were extinguished before they had bestowed on them their choicest treasures to his friends his loss is irremediable the wise the brave the gentle is gone for ever he is to them as a bright vision whose radiant track left behind in the memory is worth all the realities that society can afford before the critics contradict me let them appeal to any one who had ever known him to see him was to love him and his presence like ithuriels spear was alone sufficient to disclose the falsehood of the tale which his enemies whispered in the ear of the ignorant world his life was spent in the contemplation of nature in arduous study or in acts of kindness and affection he was an elegant scholar and a profound metaphysician without possessing much scientific knowledge he was unrivalled in the justness and extent of his observations on natural objects he knew every plant by its name and was familiar with the history and habits of every production of the earth he could interpret without a fault each appearance in the sky and the varied phenomena of heaven and earth filled him with deep emotion he made his study and readingroom of the shadowed copse the stream the lake and the waterfall ill health and continual pain preyed upon his powers and the solitude in which we lived particularly on our first arrival in italy although congenial to his feelings must frequently have weighed upon his spirits those beautiful and affecting lines written in dejection near naples were composed at such an interval but when in health his spirits were buoyant and youthful to an extraordinary degree such was his love for nature that every page of his poetry is associated in the minds of his friends with the loveliest scenes of the countries which he inhabited in early life he visited the most beautiful parts of this country and ireland afterwards the alps of switzerland became his inspirers prometheus unbound was written among the deserted and flowergrown ruins of rome and when he made his home under the pisan hills their roofless recesses harboured him as he composed the witch of atlas adonais and hellas in the wild but beautiful bay of spezzia the winds and waves which he loved became his playmates his days were chiefly spent on the water the management of his boat its alterations and improvements were his principal occupation at night when the unclouded moon shone on the calm sea he often went alone in his little shallop to the rocky caves that bordered it and sitting beneath their shelter wrote the triumph of life the last of his productions the beauty but strangeness of this lonely place the refined pleasure which he felt in the companionship of a few selected friends our entire sequestration from the rest of the world all contributed to render this period of his life one of continued enjoyment i am convinced that the two months we passed there were the happiest which he had ever known his health even rapidly improved and he was never better than when i last saw him full of spirits and joy embark for leghorn that he might there welcome leigh hunt to italy i was to have accompanied him but illness confined me to my room and thus put the seal on my misfortune his vessel bore out of sight with a favourable wind and i remained awaiting his return by the breakers of that sea which was about to engulf him he spent a week at pisa employed in kind offices toward his friend and enjoying with keen delight the renewal of their intercourse he then embarked with mr williams the chosen and beloved sharer of his pleasures and of his fate to return to us we waited for them in vain the sea by its restless moaning seemed to desire to inform us of what we would not learn but a veil may well be drawn over such misery the real anguish of those moments transcended all the fictions that the most glowing imagination ever portrayed our seclusion the savage nature of the inhabitants of the surrounding villages and our immediate vicinity to the troubled sea combined to imbue with strange horror our days of uncertainty the truth was at last known a truth that made our loved and lovely italy appear a tomb its sky a pall every heart echoed the deep lament and my only consolation was in the praise and earnest love that each voice bestowed and each countenance demonstrated for him we had lost not i fondly hope for ever his unearthly and elevated nature is a pledge of the continuation of his being although in an altered form rome received his ashes they are deposited beneath its weedgrown wall and the worlds sole monument is enriched by his remains i must add a few words concerning the contents of this volume julian and maddalo the witch of atlas and most of the translations were written some years ago and with the exception of the cyclops and the scenes from the magico prodigioso may be considered as having received the authors ultimate corrections the triumph of life was his last work and was left in so unfinished a state that i arranged it in its present form with great difficulty all his poems which were scattered in periodical works are collected in this volume and i have added a reprint of alastor or the spirit of solitude the difficulty with which a copy can be obtained is the cause of its republication many of the miscellaneous poems written on the spur of the occasion and never retouched i found among his manuscript books and have carefully copied i have subjoined whenever i have been able the date of their composition i do not know whether the critics will reprehend the insertion of some of the most imperfect among them but i frankly own that i have been more actuated by the fear lest any monument of his genius should escape me than the wish of presenting nothing but what was complete to the fastidious reader i feel secure that the lovers of shelleys poetry who know how more than any poet of the present day every line and word he wrote is instinct with peculiar beauty will pardon and thank me i consecrate this volume to them the size of this collection has prevented the insertion of any prose pieces they will hereafter appear in a separate publication mary w shelley london june

morn when throned on oceans wave it breathes over the world yet both so passing strange and wonderful hath then the ironsceptred skeleton whose reign is in the tainted sepulchres to the hell dogs that

outline is as fair as marble clothed in light of some sublimest mind decay nor putrefactions breath leave aught of this pure spectacle but loathsomeness and ruin spare aught but a dark theme on which the lightest heart might moralize or is it but that downywinged slumbers have charmed their nurse coy silence near her lids to watch their own repose will they when mornings beam flows through those wells of light seek far from noise and day some western cave where woods and streams with soft and pausing winds a lulling murmur weave ianthe doth not sleep the dreamless sleep of death nor in her moonlight chamber silently doth henry hear her regular pulses throb or mark her delicate cheek with interchange of hues mock the broad moon outwatching weary night without assured reward her dewy eyes are closed on their translucent lids whose texture fine scarce hides the dark blue orbs that burn below with unapparent fire the baby sleep is pillowed her golden tresses shade the bosoms stainless pride twining like tendrils of the parasite around a marble column hark whence that rushing sound tis like a wondrous strain that sweeps around a lonely ruin when west winds sigh and evening waves respond in whispers from the shore tis wilder than the unmeasured notes which from the unseen lyres of dells and groves the genii of the breezes sweep floating on waves of music and of light the chariot of the daemon of the world descends in silent power its shape reposed within slight as some cloud that catches but the palest tinge of day when evening yields to night bright as that fibrous woof when stars indue its transitory robe four shapeless shadows bright and beautiful draw that strange car of glory reins of light check their unearthly speed they stop and fold their wings of braided air the daemon leaning from the ethereal car gazed on the slumbering maid human eye hath neer beheld a shape so wild so bright so beautiful as that which oer the maidens charmed sleep waving a starry wand hung like a mist of light such sounds as breathed around like odorous winds of wakening spring arose filling the chamber and the moonlight sky maiden the worlds supremest spirit beneath the shadow of her wings folds all thy memory doth inherit from ruin of divinest things feelings that lure thee to betray and light of thoughts that pass away for thou hast earned a mighty boon the truths which wisest poets see dimly thy mind may make its own rewarding its own majesty entranced in some diviner mood of selfoblivious solitude custom and faith and power thou spurnest from hate and awe thy heart is free ardent and pure as day thou burnest for dark and cold mortality a living light to cheer it long the watchfires of the world among therefore from natures inner shrine where gods and fiends in worship bend majestic spirit be it thine the flame to seize the veil to rend where the vast snake eternity in charmed sleep doth ever lie all that inspires thy voice of love or speaks in thy unclosing eyes or through thy frame doth burn or move or think or feel awake arise spirit leave for mine and me earths unsubstantial mimicry it ceased and from the mute and moveless frame a radiant spirit arose all beautiful in naked purity robed in its human hues it did ascend disparting as it went the silver clouds it moved towards the car and took its seat beside the daemon shape obedient to the sweep of aery song the mighty ministers unfurled their prismy wings the magic car moved on the night was fair innumerable stars studded heavens dark blue vault the eastern wave grew pale with the first smile of morn the magic car moved on from the swift sweep of wings the atmosphere in flaming sparkles flew and where the burning wheels eddied above the mountains loftiest peak was traced a line of lightning now far above a rock the utmost verge of the wide earth it flew the rival of the andes whose dark brow frowned oer the silver sea far far below the chariots stormy path calm as a slumbering babe tremendous ocean lay its broad and silent mirror gave to view the pale and waning stars the chariots fiery track and the grey light of morn tingeing those fleecy clouds that cradled in their folds the infant dawn the chariot seemed to fly through the abyss of an immense concave radiant with million constellations tinged with shades of infinite colour and semicircled with a belt flashing incessant meteors as they approached their goal the winged shadows seemed to gather speed the sea no longer was distinguished earth appeared a vast and shadowy sphere suspended in the black concave of heaven with the suns cloudless orb whose rays of rapid light parted around the chariots swifter course and fell like oceans feathery spray dashed from the boiling surge before a vessels prow the magic car moved on earths distant orb appeared the smallest light that twinkles in the heavens whilst round the chariots way innumerable systems widely rolled and countless spheres diffused an ever varying glory it was a sight of wonder some were horned and like the moons argentine crescent hung in the dark dome of heaven some did shed a clear mild beam like hesperus while the sea yet glows with fading sunlight others dashed athwart the night with trains of bickering fire like sphered worlds to death and ruin driven some shone like stars and as the chariot passed bedimmed all other light spirit of nature here in this interminable wilderness of worlds at whose involved immensity even soaring fancy staggers here is thy fitting temple yet not the lightest leaf that quivers to the passing breeze is less instinct with thee yet not the meanest worm that lurks in graves and fattens on the dead less shares thy eternal breath spirit of nature thou imperishable as this glorious scene here is thy fitting temple if solitude hath ever led thy steps to the shore of the immeasurable sea and thou hast lingered there until the suns broad orb seemed resting on the fiery line of ocean thou must have marked the braided webs of gold that without motion hang over the sinking sphere thou must have marked the billowy mountain clouds edged with intolerable radiancy towering like rocks of jet above the burning deep and yet there is a moment when the suns highest point peers like a star oer oceans western edge when those far clouds of feathery purple gleam like fairy lands girt by some heavenly sea then has thy rapt imagination soared where in the midst of all existing things the temple of the mightiest daemon stands yet not the golden islands that gleam amid yon flood of purple light nor the feathery curtains that canopy the suns resplendent couch nor the burnished ocean waves paving that gorgeous dome so fair so wonderful a sight as the eternal temple could afford the elements of all that human thought can frame of lovely or sublime did join to rear the fabric of the fane nor aught of earth may image forth its majesty yet likest evenings vault that faery hall as heaven low resting on the wave it spread its floors of flashing light its vast and azure dome and on the verge of that obscure abyss where crystal battlements oerhang the gulf of the dark world ten thousand spheres diffuse their lustre through its adamantine gates the magic car no longer moved the daemon and the spirit entered the eternal gates those clouds of aery gold that slept in glittering billows beneath the azure canopy with the ethereal footsteps trembled not while slight and odorous mists floated to strains of thrilling melody through the vast columns and the pearly shrines the daemon and the spirit approached the overhanging battlement below lay stretched the boundless universe there far as the remotest line that limits swift imaginations flight unending orbs mingled in mazy motion immutably fulfilling eternal natures law above below around the circling systems formed a wilderness of harmony each with undeviating aim in eloquent silence through the depths of space pursued its wondrous way awhile the spirit paused in ecstasy yet soon she saw as the vast spheres swept by strange things within their belted orbs appear like animated frenzies dimly moved shadows and skeletons and fiendly shapes thronging round human graves and oer the dead sculpturing records for each memory in verse such as malignant gods pronounce blasting the hopes of men when heaven and hell confounded burst in ruin oer the world and they did build vast trophies instruments of murder human bones barbaric gold skins torn from living men and towers of skulls with sightless holes gazing on blinder heaven mitres and crowns and brazen chariots stained with blood and scrolls of mystic wickedness the sanguine codes of venerable crime the likeness of a throned king came by when these had passed bearing upon his brow a threefold crown his countenance was calm his eye severe and cold but his right hand was charged with bloody coin and he did gnaw by fits with secret smiles a human heart concealed beneath his robe and motley shapes a multitudinous throng around him knelt with bosoms bare and bowed heads and false looks of true submission as the sphere rolled by brooking no eye to witness their foul shame which human hearts must feel while human tongues tremble to speak they did rage horribly breathing in selfcontempt fierce blasphemies against the daemon of the world and high hurling their armed hands where the pure spirit serene and inaccessibly secure stood on an isolated pinnacle the flood of ages combating below the depth of the unbounded universe above and all around

progress on his mind man where the gloom of the long polar night lowered oer the snowclad rocks and frozen soil where scarce the hardiest herb that braves the frost basked in the moonlights ineffectual glow shrank with the plants and darkened with the night nor where the tropics bound the realms of day with a broad belt of mingling cloud and flame where blue mists through the unmoving atmosphere scattered the seeds of pestilence and fed unnatural vegetation where the land teemed with all earthquake tempest and disease was man a nobler being slavery had crushed him to his countrys

heath near windsor park autumn published as the titlepiece of a slender volume containing other poems see biographical list by baldwin cradock and joy london march reprinted the first edition being sold out amongst the posthumous poems sources of the text are the editio princeps posthumous poems poetical works editions st and nd for and mrs shelley is responsible preface the poem entitled alastor may be considered as allegorical of one of the most interesting situations of the human mind it represents a youth of uncorrupted feelings and adventurous genius led forth by an imagination inflamed and purified through familiarity with all that is excellent and majestic to the contemplation of the universe he drinks deep of the fountains of knowledge and is still insatiate the magnificence and beauty of the external world sinks profoundly into the frame of his conceptions and affords to their modifications at variety not to be exhausted so long as it is possible for his desires to point towards objects thus infinite and unmeasured he is joyous and tranquil and selfpossessed but the period arrives when these objects cease to suffice his mind is at length suddenly awakened and thirsts for intercourse with an intelligence similar to itself he images to himself the being whom he loves conversant with speculations of the sublimest and most perfect natures the vision in which he embodies his own imaginations unites all of wonderful or wise or beautiful which the poet the philosopher or the lover could depicture the intellectual faculties the imagination the functions of sense have their respective requisitions on the sympathy of corresponding powers in other human beings the poet is represented as uniting these requisitions and attaching them to a single image he seeks in vain for a prototype of his conception blasted by his disappointment he descends to an untimely grave the picture is not barren of instruction to actual men the poets selfcentred seclusion was avenged by the furies of an irresistible passion pursuing him to speedy ruin but that power which strikes the luminaries of the world with sudden darkness and extinction by awakening them to too exquisite a perception of its influences dooms to a slow and poisonous decay those manner spirits that dare to abjure its dominion their destiny is more abject and inglorious as their delinquency is more contemptible and pernicious they who deluded by no generous error instigated by no sacred thirst of doubtful knowledge duped by no illustrious superstition loving nothing on this earth and cherishing no hopes beyond yet keep aloof from sympathies with their kind rejoicing neither in human joy nor mourning with human grief these and such as they have their apportioned curse they languish because none feel with them their common nature they are morally dead they are neither friends nor lovers nor fathers nor citizens of the world nor benefactors of their country among those who attempt to exist without human sympathy the pure and tenderhearted perish through the intensity and passion of their search after its communities when the vacancy of their spirit suddenly makes itself felt all else selfish blind and torpid are those unforeseeing multitudes who constitute together with their own the lasting misery and loneliness of the world those who love not their fellowbeings live unfruitful lives and prepare for their old age a miserable grave the good die first and those whose hearts are dry as summer dust burn to the socket december alastor or the spirit of solitude earth ocean air beloved brotherhood if our great mother has imbued my soul with aught of natural piety to feel your love and recompense the boon with mine if dewy morn and odorous noon and even with sunset and its gorgeous ministers and solemn midnights tingling silentness if autumns hollow sighs in the sere wood and winter robing with pure snow and crowns of starry ice the grey grass and bare boughs if springs voluptuous pantings when she breathes her first sweet kisses have been dear to me if no bright bird insect or gentle beast i consciously have injured but still loved and cherished these my kindred then forgive this boast beloved brethren and withdraw no portion of your wonted favour now mother of this unfathomable world favour my solemn song for i have loved thee ever and thee only i have watched thy shadow and the darkness of thy steps and my heart ever gazes on the depth of thy deep mysteries i have made my bed in charnels and on coffins where black death keeps record of the trophies won from thee hoping to still these obstinate questionings of thee and thine by forcing some lone ghost thy messenger to render up the tale of what we are in lone and silent hours when night makes a weird sound of its own stillness like an inspired and desperate alchymist staking his very life on some dark hope have i mixed awful talk and asking looks with my most innocent love until strange tears uniting with those breathless kisses made such magic as compels the charmed night to render up thy chargeand though neer yet thou hast unveiled thy inmost sanctuary enough from incommunicable dream and twilight phantasms and deep noonday thought has shone within me that serenely now and moveless as a longforgotten lyre suspended in the solitary dome of some mysterious and deserted fane i wait thy breath great parent that my strain may modulate with murmurs of the air and motions of the forests and the sea and voice of living beings and woven hymns of night and day and the deep heart of man there was a poet whose untimely tomb no human hands with pious reverence reared but the charmed eddies of autumnal winds built oer his mouldering bones a pyramid of mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness a lovely youth no mourning maiden decked with weeping flowers or votive cypress wreath the lone couch of his everlasting sleep gentle and brave and generous no lorn bard breathed oer his dark fate one melodious sigh he lived he died he sung in solitude strangers have wept to hear his passionate notes and virgins as unknown he passed have pined and wasted for fond love of his wild eyes the fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn and silence too enamoured of that voice locks its mute music in her rugged cell by solemn vision and bright silver dream his infancy was nurtured every sight and sound from the vast earth and ambient air sent to his heart its choicest impulses the fountains of divine philosophy fled not his thirsting lips and all of great or good or lovely which the sacred past in truth or fable consecrates he felt and knew when early youth had passed he left his cold fireside and alienated home to seek strange truths in undiscovered lands many a wide waste and tangled wilderness has lured his fearless steps and he has bought with his sweet voice and eyes from savage men his rest and food natures most secret steps he like her shadow has pursued whereer the red volcano overcanopies its fields of snow and pinnacles of ice with burning smoke or where bitumen lakes on black bare pointed islets ever beat with sluggish surge or where the secret caves rugged and dark winding among the springs of fire and poison inaccessible to avarice or pride their starry domes of diamond and of gold expand above numberless and immeasurable halls frequent with crystal column and clear shrines of pearl and thrones radiant with chrysolite nor had that scene of ampler majesty than gems or gold the varying roof of heaven and the green earth lost in his heart its claims to love and wonder he would linger long in lonesome vales making the wild his home until the doves and squirrels would partake from his innocuous hand his bloodless food lured by the gentle meaning of his looks and the wild antelope that starts wheneer the dry leaf rustles in the brake suspend her timid steps to gaze upon a form more graceful than her own his wandering step obedient to high thoughts has visited the awful ruins of the days of old athens and tyre and balbec and the waste where stood jerusalem the fallen towers of babylon the eternal pyramids memphis and thebes and whatsoeer of strange sculptured on alabaster obelisk or jasper tomb or mutilated sphynx dark aethiopia in her desert hills conceals among the ruined temples there stupendous columns and wild images of more than man where marble daemons watch the zodiacs brazen mystery and dead men hang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around he lingered poring on memorials of the worlds youth through the long burning day gazed on those speechless shapes nor when the moon filled the mysterious halls with floating shades suspended he that task but ever gazed and gazed till meaning on his vacant mind flashed like strong inspiration and he saw the thrilling secrets of the birth of time meanwhile an arab maiden brought his food her daily portion from her fathers tent and spread her matting for his couch and stole from duties and repose to tend his steps enamoured yet not daring for deep awe to speak her love and watched his nightly sleep sleepless herself to gaze upon his lips parted in slumber whence the regular breath of innocent dreams arose then when red morn made paler the pale moon to her cold home wildered and wan and panting she returned the poet wandering on through arabie and persia and the wild carmanian waste and oer the aerial mountains which pour down indus and oxus from their icy caves in joy and exultation held his way till in the vale of cashmire far within its loneliest dell where odorous plants entwine beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched his languid limbs a vision on his sleep there came a dream of hopes that never yet had flushed his cheek he dreamed a veiled maid sate near him talking in low solemn tones her voice was like the voice of his own soul heard in the calm of thought its music long like woven sounds of streams and breezes held his inmost sense suspended in its web of manycoloured woof and shifting hues knowledge and truth and virtue were her theme and lofty hopes of divine liberty thoughts the most dear to him and poesy herself a poet soon the solemn mood of her pure mind kindled through all her frame a permeating fire wild numbers then she raised with voice stifled in tremulous sobs subdued by its own pathos her fair hands were bare alone sweeping from some strange harp strange symphony and in their branching veins the eloquent blood told an ineffable tale the beating of her heart was heard to fill the pauses of her music and her breath tumultuously accorded with those fits of intermitted song sudden she rose as if her heart impatiently endured its bursting burthen at the sound he turned and saw by the warm light of their own life her glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veil of woven wind her outspread arms now bare her dark locks floating in the breath of night her beamy bending eyes her parted lips outstretched and pale and quivering eagerly his strong heart sunk and sickened with excess of love he reared his shuddering limbs and quelled his gasping breath and spread his arms to meet her panting bosomshe drew back a while then yielding to the irresistible joy with frantic gesture and short breathless cry folded his frame in her dissolving arms now blackness veiled his dizzy eyes and night involved and swallowed up the vision sleep like a dark flood suspended in its course rolled back its impulse on his vacant brain roused by the shock he started from his trance the cold white light of morning the blue moon low in the west the clear and garish hills the distinct valley and the vacant woods spread round him where he stood whither have fled the hues of heaven that canopied his bower of yesternight the sounds that soothed his sleep the mystery and the majesty of earth the joy the exultation his wan eyes gaze on the empty scene as vacantly as oceans moon looks on the moon in heaven the spirit of sweet human love has sent a vision to the sleep of him who spurned her choicest gifts he eagerly pursues beyond the realms of dream that fleeting shade he overleaps the bounds alas alas were limbs and breath and being intertwined thus treacherously lost lost for ever lost in the wide pathless desert of dim sleep that beautiful shape does the dark gate of death conduct to thy mysterious paradise o sleep does the bright arch of rainbow clouds and pendent mountains seen in the calm lake lead only to a black and watery depth while deaths blue vault with loathliest vapours hung where every shade which the foul grave exhales hides its dead eye from the detested day conducts o sleep to thy delightful realms this doubt with sudden tide flowed on his heart the insatiate hope which it awakened stung his brain even like despair while daylight held the sky the poet kept mute conference with his still soul at night the passion came like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream and shook him from his rest and led him forth into the darkness as an eagle grasped in folds of the green serpent feels her breast burn with the poison and precipitates through night and day tempest and calm and cloud frantic with dizzying anguish her blind flight oer the wide aery wilderness thus driven by the bright shadow of that lovely dream beneath the cold glare of the desolate night through tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells startling with careless step the moonlight snake he fled red morning dawned upon his flight shedding the mockery of its vital hues upon his cheek of death he wandered on till vast aornos seen from petras steep hung oer the low horizon like a cloud through balk and where the desolated tombs of parthian kings scatter to every wind their wasting dust wildly he wandered on day after day a weary waste of hours bearing within his life the brooding care that ever fed on its decaying flame and now his limbs were lean his scattered hair sered by the autumn of strange suffering sung dirges in the wind his listless hand hung like dead bone within its withered skin life and the lustre that consumed it shone as in a furnace burning secretly from his dark eyes alone the cottagers who ministered with human charity his human wants beheld with wondering awe their fleeting visitant the mountaineer encountering on some dizzy precipice that spectral form deemed that the spirit of wind with lightning eyes and eager breath and feet disturbing not the drifted snow had paused in its career the infant would conceal his troubled visage in his mothers robe in terror at the glare of those wild eyes to remember their strange light in many a dream of aftertimes but youthful maidens taught by nature would interpret half the woe that wasted him would call him with false names brother and friend would press his pallid hand at parting and watch dim through tears the path of his departure from their fathers door at length upon the lone chorasmian shore he paused a wide and melancholy waste of putrid marshes a strong impulse urged his steps to the seashore a swan was there beside a sluggish stream among the reeds it rose as he approached and with strong wings scaling the upward sky bent its bright course high over the immeasurable main his eyes pursued its flight thou hast a home beautiful bird thou voyagest to thine home where thy sweet mate will twine her downy neck with thine and welcome thy return with eyes bright in the lustre of their own fond joy and what am i that i should linger here with voice far sweeter than thy dying notes spirit more vast than thine frame more attuned to beauty wasting these surpassing powers in the deaf air to the blind earth and heaven that echoes not my thoughts a gloomy smile of desperate hope wrinkled his quivering lips for sleep he knew kept most relentlessly its precious charge and silent death exposed faithless perhaps as sleep a shadowy lure with doubtful smile mocking its own strange charms startled by his own thoughts he looked around there was no fair fiend near him not a sight or sound of awe but in his own deep mind a little shallop floating near the shore caught the impatient wandering of his gaze it had been long abandoned for its sides gaped wide with many a rift and its frail joints swayed with the undulations of the tide a restless impulse urged him to embark and meet lone death on the drear oceans waste for well he knew that mighty shadow loves the slimy caverns of the populous deep the day was fair and sunny sea and sky drank its inspiring radiance and the wind swept strongly from the shore blackening the waves following his eager soul the wanderer leaped in the boat he spread his cloak aloft on the bare mast and took his lonely seat and felt the boat speed oer the tranquil sea like a torn cloud before the hurricane as one that in a silver vision floats obedient to the sweep of odorous winds upon resplendent clouds so rapidly along the dark and ruffled waters fled the straining boat a whirlwind swept it on with fierce gusts and precipitating force through the white ridges of the chafed sea the waves arose higher and higher still their fierce necks writhed beneath the tempests scourge like serpents struggling in a vultures grasp calm and rejoicing in the fearful war of wave ruining on wave and blast on blast descending and black flood on whirlpool driven with dark obliterating course he sate as if their genii were the ministers appointed to conduct him to the light of those beloved eyes the poet sate holding the steady helm evening came on the beams of sunset hung their rainbow hues high mid the shifting domes of sheeted spray that canopied his path oer the waste deep twilight ascending slowly from the east entwined in duskier wreaths her braided locks oer the fair front and radiant eyes of day night followed clad with stars on every side more horribly the multitudinous streams of oceans mountainous waste to mutual war rushed in dark tumult thundering as to mock the calm and spangled sky the little boat still fled before the storm still fled like foam down the steep cataract of a wintry river now pausing on the edge of the riven wave now leaving far behind the bursting mass that fell convulsing ocean safely fled as if that frail and wasted human form had been an elemental god at midnight the moon arose and lo the ethereal cliffs of caucasus whose icy summits shone among the stars like sunlight and around whose caverned base the whirlpools and the waves bursting and eddying irresistibly rage and resound forever who shall save the boat fled on the boiling torrent drove the crags closed round with black and jagged arms the shattered mountain overhung the sea and faster still beyond all human speed suspended on the sweep of the smooth wave the little boat was driven a cavern there yawned and amid its slant and winding depths ingulfed the rushing sea the boat fled on with unrelaxing speed vision and love the poet cried aloud i have beheld the path of thy departure sleep and death shall not divide us long the boat pursued the windings of the cavern daylight shone at length upon that gloomy rivers flow now where the fiercest war among the waves is calm on the unfathomable stream the boat moved slowly where the mountain riven exposed those black depths to the azure sky ere yet the floods enormous volume fell even to the base of caucasus with sound that shook the everlasting rocks the mass filled with one whirlpool all that ample chasm stair above stair the eddying waters rose circling immeasurably fast and laved with alternating dash the gnarled roots of mighty trees that stretched their giant arms in darkness over it i the midst was left reflecting yet distorting every cloud a pool of treacherous and tremendous calm seized by the sway of the ascending stream with dizzy swiftness round and round and round ridge after ridge the straining boat arose till on the verge of the extremest curve where through an opening of the rocky bank the waters overflow and a smooth spot of glassy quiet mid those battling tides is left the boat paused shuddering shall it sink down the abyss shall the reverting stress of that resistless gulf embosom it now shall it fall a wandering stream of wind breathed from the west has caught the expanded sail and lo with gentle motion between banks of mossy slope and on a placid stream beneath a woven grove it sails and hark the ghastly torrent mingles its far roar with the breeze murmuring in the musical woods where the embowering trees recede and leave a little space of green expanse the cove is closed by meeting banks whose yellow flowers for ever gaze on their own drooping eyes reflected in the crystal calm the wave of the boats motion marred their pensive task which naught but vagrant bird or wanton wind or falling speargrass or their own decay had eer disturbed before the poet longed to deck with their bright hues his withered hair but on his heart its solitude returned and he forbore not the strong impulse hid in those flushed cheeks bent eyes and shadowy frame had yet performed its ministry it hung upon his life as lightning in a cloud gleams hovering ere it vanish ere the floods of night close over it the noonday sun now shone upon the forest one vast mass of mingling shade whose brown magnificence a narrow vale embosoms there huge caves scooped in the dark base of their aery rocks mocking its moans respond and roar for ever the meeting boughs and implicated leaves wove twilight oer the poets path as led by love or dream or god or mightier death he sought in natures dearest haunt some bank her cradle and his sepulchre more dark and dark the shades accumulate the oak expanding its immense and knotty arms embraces the light beech the pyramids of the tall cedar overarching frame most solemn domes within and far below like clouds suspended in an emerald sky the ash and the acacia floating hang tremulous and pale like restless serpents clothed in rainbow and in fire the parasites starred with ten thousand blossoms flow around the grey trunks and as gamesome infants eyes with gentle meanings and most innocent wiles fold their beams round the hearts of those that love these twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs uniting their close union the woven leaves make network of the dark blue light of day and the nights noontide clearness mutable as shapes in the weird clouds soft mossy lawns beneath these canopies extend their swells fragrant with perfumed herbs and eyed with blooms minute yet beautiful one darkest glen sends from its woods of muskrose twined with jasmine a souldissolving odour to invite to some more lovely mystery through the dell silence and twilight here twinsisters keep their noonday watch and sail among the shades like vaporous shapes halfseen beyond a well dark gleaming and of most translucent wave images all the woven boughs above and each depending leaf and every speck of azure sky darting between their chasms nor aught else in the liquid mirror laves its portraiture but some inconstant star between one foliaged lattice twinkling fair or painted bird sleeping beneath the moon or gorgeous insect floating motionless unconscious of the day ere yet his wings have spread their glories to the gaze of noon hither the poet came his eyes beheld their own wan light through the reflected lines of his thin hair distinct in the dark depth of that still fountain as the human heart gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave sees its own treacherous likeness there he heard the motion of the leaves the grass that sprung startled and glanced and trembled even to feel an unaccustomed presence and the sound of the sweet brook that from the secret springs of that dark fountain rose a spirit seemed to stand beside him clothed in no bright robes of shadowy silver or enshrining light borrowed from aught the visible world affords of grace or majesty or mystery but undulating woods and silent well and leaping rivulet and evening gloom now deepening the dark shades for speech assuming held commune with him as if he and it were all that was onlywhen his regard was raised by intense pensivenesstwo eyes two starry eyes hung in the gloom of thought and seemed with their serene and azure smiles to beckon him obedient to the light that shone within his soul he went pursuing the windings of the dell the rivulet wanton and wild through many a green ravine beneath the forest flowed sometimes it fell among the moss with hollow harmony dark and profound now on the polished stones it danced like childhood laughing as it went then through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept reflecting every herb and drooping bud that overhung its quietness o stream whose source is inaccessibly profound whither do thy mysterious waters tend thou imagest my life thy darksome stillness thy dazzling waves thy loud and hollow gulfs thy searchless fountain and invisible course have each their type in me and the wide sky and measureless ocean may declare as soon what oozy cavern or what wandering cloud contains thy waters as the universe tell where these living thoughts reside when stretched upon thy flowers my bloodless limbs shall waste i the passing wind beside the grassy shore of the small stream he went he did impress on the green moss his tremulous step that caught strong shuddering from his burning limbs as one roused by some joyous madness from the couch of fever he did move yet not like him forgetful of the grave where when the flame of his frail exultation shall be spent he must descend with rapid steps he went beneath the shade of trees beside the flow of the wild babbling rivulet and now the forests solemn canopies were changed for the uniform and lightsome evening sky grey rocks did peep from the spare moss and stemmed the struggling brook tall spires of windlestrae threw their thin shadows down the rugged slope and nought but gnarled roots of ancient pines branchless and blasted clenched with grasping roots the unwilling soil a gradual change was here yet ghastly for as fast years flow away the smooth brow gathers and the hair grows thin and white and where irradiate dewy eyes had shone gleam stony orbs so from his steps bright flowers departed and the beautiful shade of the green groves with all their odorous winds and musical motions calm he still pursued the stream that with a larger volume now rolled through the labyrinthine dell and there fretted a path through its descending curves with its wintry speed on every side now rose rocks which in unimaginable forms lifted their black and barren pinnacles in the light of evening and its precipice obscuring the ravine disclosed above mid toppling stones black gulfs and yawning caves whose windings gave ten thousand various tongues to the loud stream lo where the pass expands its stony jaws the abrupt mountain breaks and seems with its accumulated crags to overhang the world for wide expand beneath the wan stars and descending moon islanded seas blue mountains mighty streams dim tracts and vast robed in the lustrous gloom of leadencoloured even and fiery hills mingling their flames with twilight on the verge of the remote horizon the near scene in naked and severe simplicity made contrast with the universe a pine rockrooted stretched athwart the vacancy its swinging boughs to each inconstant blast yielding one only response at each pause in most familiar cadence with the howl the thunder and the hiss of homeless streams mingling its solemn song whilst the broad river foaming and hurrying oer its rugged path fell into that immeasurable void scattering its waters to the passing winds yet the grey precipice and solemn pine and torrent were not all one silent nook was there even on the edge of that vast mountain upheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks it overlooked in its serenity the dark earth and the bending vault of stars it was a tranquil spot that seemed to smile even in the lap of horror ivy clasped the fissured stones with its entwining arms and did embower with leaves for ever green and berries dark the smooth and even space of its inviolated floor and here the children of the autumnal whirlwind bore in wanton sport those bright leaves whose decay red yellow or ethereally pale rivals the pride of summer tis the haunt of every gentle wind whose breath can teach the wilds to love tranquillity one step one human step alone has ever broken the stillness of its solitude one voice alone inspired its echoes even that voice which hither came floating among the winds and led the loveliest among human forms to make their wild haunts the depository of all the grace and beauty that endued its motions render up its majesty scatter its music on the unfeeling storm and to the damp leaves and blue cavern mould nurses of rainbow flowers and branching moss commit the colours of that varying cheek that snowy breast those dark and drooping eyes the dim and horned moon hung low and poured a sea of lustre on the horizons verge that overflowed its mountains yellow mist filled the unbounded atmosphere and drank wan moonlight even to fulness not a star shone not a sound was heard the very winds dangers grim playmates on that precipice slept clasped in his embrace o storm of death whose sightless speed divides this sullen night and thou colossal skeleton that still guiding its irresistible career in thy devastating omnipotence art king of this frail world from the red field of slaughter from the reeking hospital the patriots sacred couch the snowy bed of innocence the scaffold and the throne a mighty voice invokes thee ruin calls his brother death a rare and regal prey he hath prepared prowling around the world glutted with which thou mayst repose and men go to their graves like flowers or creeping worms nor ever more offer at thy dark shrine the unheeded tribute of a broken heart when on the threshold of the green recess the wanderers footsteps fell he knew that death was on him yet a little ere it fled did he resign his high and holy soul to images of the majestic past that paused within his passive being now like winds that bear sweet music when they breathe through some dim latticed chamber he did place his pale lean hand upon the rugged trunk of the old pine upon an ivied stone reclined his languid head his limbs did rest diffused and motionless on the smooth brink of that obscurest chasm and thus he lay surrendering to their final impulses the hovering powers of life hope and despair the torturers slept no mortal pain or fear marred his repose the influxes of sense and his own being unalloyed by pain yet feebler and more feeble calmly fed the stream of thought till he lay breathing there at peace and faintly smiling his last sight was the great moon which oer the western line of the wide world her mighty horn suspended with whose dun beams inwoven darkness seemed to mingle now upon the jagged hills it rests and still as the divided frame of the vast meteor sunk the poets blood that ever beat in mystic sympathy with natures ebb and flow grew feebler still and when two lessening points of light alone gleamed through the darkness the alternate gasp of his faint respiration scarce did stir the stagnate night till the minutest ray was quenched the pulse yet lingered in his heart it paused it fluttered but when heaven remained utterly black the murky shades involved an image silent cold and motionless as their own voiceless earth and vacant air even as a vapour fed with golden beams that ministered on sunlight ere the west eclipses it was now that wondrous frame no sense no motion no divinity a fragile lute on whose harmonious strings the breath of heaven did wander a bright stream once fed with manyvoiced waves a dream of youth which night and time have quenched for ever still dark and dry and unremembered now oh for medeas wondrous alchemy which wheresoeer it fell made the earth gleam with bright flowers and the wintry boughs exhale from vernal blooms fresh fragrance o that god profuse of poisons would concede the chalice which but one living man has drained who now vessel of deathless wrath a slave that feels no proud exemption in the blighting curse he bears over the world wanders for ever lone as incarnate death o that the dream of dark magician in his visioned cave raking the cinders of a crucible for life and power even when his feeble hand shakes in its last decay were the true law of this so lovely world but thou art fled like some frail exhalation which the dawn robes in its golden beams ah thou hast fled the brave the gentle and the beautiful the child of grace and genius heartless things are done and said i the world and many worms and beasts and men live on and mighty earth from sea and mountain city and wilderness in vesper low or joyous orison lifts still its solemn voice but thou art fled thou canst no longer know or love the shapes of this phantasmal scene who have to thee been purest ministers who are alas now thou art not upon those pallid lips so sweet even in their silence on those eyes that image sleep in death upon that form yet safe from the worms outrage let no tear be shed not even in thought nor when those hues are gone and those divinest lineaments worn by the senseless wind shall live alone in the frail pauses of this simple strain let not high verse mourning the memory of that which is no more or paintings woe or sculpture speak in feeble imagery their own cold powers art and eloquence and all the shows o the world are frail and vain to weep a loss that turns their lights to shade it is a woe too deep for tears when all is reft at once when some surpassing spirit whose light adorned the world around it leaves those who remain behind not sobs or groans the passionate tumult of a clinging hope but pale despair and cold tranquillity natures vast frame the web of human things birth and the grave that are not as they were notes conduct edition see editors notes roots edition query stumps or trunks see editors notes note on alastor by mrs shelley alastor is written in a very different tone from queen mab in the latter shelley poured out all the cherished speculations of his youth all the irrepressible emotions of sympathy censure and hope to which the present suffering and what he considers the proper destiny of his fellowcreatures gave birth alastor on the contrary contains an individual interest only a very few years with their attendant events had checked the ardour of shelleys hopes though he still thought them wellgrounded and that to advance their fulfilment was the noblest task man could achieve this is neither the time nor place to speak of the misfortunes that chequered his life it will be sufficient to say that in all he did he at the time of doing it believed himself justified to his own conscience while the various ills of poverty and loss of friends brought home to him the sad realities of life physical suffering had also considerable influence in causing him to turn his eyes inward inclining him rather to brood over the thoughts and emotions of his own soul than to glance abroad and to make as in queen mab the whole universe the object and subject of his song in the spring of an eminent physician pronounced that he was dying rapidly of a consumption abscesses were formed on his lungs and he suffered acute spasms suddenly a complete change took place and though through life he was a martyr to pain and debility every symptom of pulmonary disease vanished his nerves which nature had formed sensitive to an unexampled degree were rendered still more susceptible by the state of his health as soon as the peace of had opened the continent he went abroad he visited some of the more magnificent scenes of switzerland and returned to england from lucerne by the reuss and the rhine this rivernavigation enchanted him in his favourite poem of thalaba his imagination had been excited by a description of such a voyage in the summer of after a tour along the southern coast of devonshire and a visit to clifton he rented a house on bishopgate heath on the borders of windsor forest where he enjoyed several months of comparative health and tranquil happiness the later summer months were warm and dry accompanied by a few friends he visited the source of the thames making a voyage in a wherry from windsor to crichlade his beautiful stanzas in the churchyard of lechlade were written on that occasion alastor was composed on his return he spent his days under the oakshades of windsor great park and the magnificent woodland was a fitting study to inspire the various descriptions of forest scenery we find in the poem none of shelleys poems is more characteristic than this the solemn spirit that reigns throughout the worship of the majesty of nature the broodings of a poets heart in solitude the mingling of the exulting joy which the various aspects of the visible universe inspires with the sad and struggling pangs which human passion imparts give a touching interest to the whole the death which he had often contemplated during the last months as certain and near he here represented in such colours as had in his lonely musings soothed his soul to peace the versification sustains the solemn spirit which breathes throughout it is peculiarly melodious the poem ought rather to be considered didactic than narrative it was the outpouring of his own emotions embodied in the purest form he could conceive painted in the ideal hues which his brilliant

authors preface the poem which i now present to the world is an attempt from which i scarcely dare to expect success and in which a writer of established fame might fail without disgrace it is an experiment on the temper of the public mind as to how far a thirst for a happier condition of moral and political society survives among the enlightened and refined the tempests which have shaken the age in which we live i have sought to enlist the harmony of metrical language the ethereal combinations of the fancy the rapid and subtle transitions of human passion all those elements which essentially compose a poem in the cause of a liberal and comprehensive morality and in the view of kindling within the bosoms of my readers a virtuous enthusiasm for those doctrines of liberty and justice that faith and hope in something good which neither violence nor misrepresentation nor prejudice can ever totally extinguish among mankind for this purpose i have chosen a story of human passion in its most universal character diversified with moving and romantic adventures and appealing in contempt of all artificial opinions or institutions to the common sympathies of every human breast i have made no attempt to recommend the motives which i would substitute for those at present governing mankind by methodical and systematic argument i would only awaken the feelings so that the reader should see the beauty of true virtue and be incited to those inquiries which have led to my moral and political creed and that of some of the sublimest intellects in the world the poem therefore with the exception of the first canto which is purely introductory is narrative not didactic it is a succession of pictures illustrating the growth and progress of individual mind aspiring after excellence and devoted to the love of mankind its influence in refining and making pure the most daring and uncommon impulses of the imagination the understanding and the senses its impatience at all the oppressions which are done under the sun its tendency to awaken public hope and to enlighten and improve mankind the rapid effects of the application of that tendency the awakening of an immense nation from their slavery and degradation to a true sense of moral dignity and freedom the bloodless dethronement of their oppressors and the unveiling of the religious frauds by which they had been deluded into submission the tranquillity of successful patriotism and the universal toleration and benevolence of true philanthropy the treachery and barbarity of hired soldiers vice not the object of punishment and hatred but kindness and pity the faithlessness of tyrants the confederacy of the rulers of the world and the restoration of the expelled dynasty by foreign arms the massacre and extermination of the patriots and the victory of established power the consequences of legitimate despotism civil war famine plague superstition and an utter extinction of the domestic affections the judicial murder of the advocates of liberty the temporary triumph of oppression that secure earnest of its final and inevitable fall the transient nature of ignorance and error and the eternity of genius and virtue such is the series of delineations of which the poem consists and if the lofty passions with which it has been my scope to distinguish this story shall not excite in the reader a generous impulse an ardent thirst for excellence an interest profound and strong such as belongs to no meaner desires let not the failure be imputed to a natural unfitness for human sympathy in these sublime and animating themes it is the business of the poet to communicate to others the pleasure and the enthusiasm arising out of those images and feelings in the vivid presence of which within his own mind consists at once his inspiration and his reward the panic which like an epidemic transport seized upon all classes of men during the excesses consequent upon the french revolution is gradually giving place to sanity it has ceased to be believed that whole generations of mankind ought to consign themselves to a hopeless inheritance of ignorance and misery because a nation of men who had been dupes and slaves for centuries were incapable of conducting themselves with the wisdom and tranquillity of freemen so soon as some of their fetters were partially loosened that their conduct could not have been marked by any other characters than ferocity and thoughtlessness is the historical fact from which liberty derives all its recommendations and falsehood the worst features of its deformity there is a reflux in the tide of human things which bears the shipwrecked hopes of men into a secure haven after the storms are past methinks those who now live have survived an age of despair the french revolution may be considered as one of those manifestations of a general state of feeling among civilised mankind produced by a defect of correspondence between the knowledge existing in society and the improvement or gradual abolition of political institutions the year may be assumed as the epoch of one of the most important crises produced by this feeling the sympathies connected with that event extended to every bosom the most generous and amiable natures were those which participated the most extensively in these sympathies but such a degree of unmingled good was expected as it was impossible to realise if the revolution had been in every respect prosperous then misrule and superstition would lose half their claims to our abhorrence as fetters which the captive can unlock with the slightest motion of his fingers and which do not eat with poisonous rust into the soul the revulsion occasioned by the atrocities of the demagogues and the reestablishment of successive tyrannies in france was terrible and felt in the remotest corner of the civilised world could they listen to the plea of reason who had groaned under the calamities of a social state according to the provisions of which one man riots in luxury whilst another famishes for want of bread can he who the day before was a trampled slave suddenly become liberalminded forbearing and independent this is the consequence of the habits of a state of society to be produced by resolute perseverance and indefatigable hope and longsuffering and longbelieving courage and the systematic efforts of generations of men of intellect and virtue such is the lesson which experience teaches now but on the first reverses of hope in the progress of french liberty the sanguine eagerness for good overleaped the solution of these questions and for a time extinguished itself in the unexpectedness of their result thus many of the most ardent and tenderhearted of the worshippers of public good have been morally ruined by what a partial glimpse of the events they deplored appeared to show as the melancholy desolation of all their cherished hopes hence gloom and misanthropy have become the characteristics of the age in which we live the solace of a disappointment that unconsciously finds relief only in the wilful exaggeration of its own despair this influence has tainted the literature of the age with the hopelessness of the minds from which it flows metaphysics i ought to except sir w drummonds academical questions a volume of very acute and powerful metaphysical criticism and inquiries into moral and political science have become little else than vain attempts to revive exploded superstitions or sophisms like those of mr malthus it is remarkable as a symptom of the revival of public hope that mr malthus has assigned in the later editions of his work an indefinite dominion to moral restraint over the principle of population this concession answers all the inferences from his doctrine unfavourable to human improvement and reduces the essay on population to a commentary illustrative of the unanswerableness of political justice calculated to lull the oppressors of mankind into a security of everlasting triumph our works of fiction and poetry have been overshadowed by the same infectious gloom but mankind appear to me to be emerging from their trance i am aware methinks of a slow gradual silent change in that belief i have composed the following poem i do not presume to enter into competition with our greatest contemporary poets yet i am unwilling to tread in the footsteps of any who have preceded me i have sought to avoid the imitation of any style of language or versification peculiar to the original minds of which it is the character designing that even if what i have produced be worthless it should still be properly my own nor have i permitted any system relating to mere words to divert the attention of the reader from whatever interest i may have succeeded in creating to my own ingenuity in contriving to disgust them according to the rules of criticism i have simply clothed my thoughts in what appeared to me the most obvious and appropriate language a person familiar with nature and with the most celebrated productions of the human mind can scarcely err in following the instinct with respect to selection of language produced by that familiarity there is an education peculiarly fitted for a poet without which genius and sensibility can hardly fill the circle of their capacities no education indeed can entitle to this appellation a dull and unobservant mind or one though neither dull nor unobservant in which the channels of communication between thought and expression have been obstructed or closed how far it is my fortune to belong to either of the latter classes i cannot know i aspire to be something better the circumstances of my accidental education have been favourable to this ambition i have been familiar from boyhood with mountains and lakes and the sea and the solitude of forests danger which sports upon the brink of precipices has been my playmate i have trodden the glaciers of the alps and lived under the eye of mont blanc i have been a wanderer among distant fields i have sailed down mighty rivers and seen the sun rise and set and the stars come forth whilst i have sailed night and day down a rapid stream among mountains i have seen populous cities and have watched the passions which rise and spread and sink and change amongst assembled multitudes of men i have seen the theatre of the more visible ravages of tyranny and war cities and villages reduced to scattered groups of black and roofless houses and the naked inhabitants sitting famished upon their desolated thresholds i have conversed with living men of genius the poetry of ancient greece and rome and modern italy and our own country has been to me like external nature a passion and an enjoyment such are the sources from which the materials for the imagery of my poem have been drawn i have considered poetry in its most comprehensive sense and have read the poets and the historians and the metaphysicians in this sense there may be such a thing as perfectibility in works of fiction notwithstanding the concession often made by the advocates of human improvement that perfectibility is a term applicable only to science whose writings have been accessible to me and have looked upon the beautiful and majestic scenery of the earth as common sources of those elements which it is the province of the poet to embody and combine yet the experience and the feelings to which i refer do not in themselves constitute men poets but only prepares them to be the auditors of those who are how far i shall be found to possess that more essential attribute of poetry the power of awakening in others sensations like those which animate my own bosom is that which to speak sincerely i know not and which with an acquiescent and contented spirit i expect to be taught by the effect which i shall produce upon those whom i now address i have avoided as i have said before the imitation of any contemporary style but there must be a resemblance which does not depend upon their own will between all the writers of any particular age they cannot escape from subjection to a common influence which arises out of an infinite combination of circumstances belonging to the times in which they live though each is in a degree the author of the very influence by which his being is thus pervaded thus the tragic poets of the age of pericles the italian revivers of ancient learning those mighty intellects of our own country that succeeded the reformation the translators of the bible shakespeare spenser the dramatists of the reign of elizabeth and lord bacon milton stands alone in the age which he illumined the colder spirits of the interval that succeeded all resemble each other and differ from every other in their several classes in this view of things ford can no more be called the imitator of shakespeare than shakespeare the imitator of ford there were perhaps few other points of resemblance between these two men than that which the universal and inevitable influence of their age produced and this is an influence which neither the meanest scribbler nor the sublimest genius of any era can escape and which i have not attempted to escape i have adopted the stanza of spenser a measure inexpressibly beautiful not because i consider it a finer model of poetical harmony than the blank verse of shakespeare and milton but because in the latter there is no shelter for mediocrity you must either succeed or fail this perhaps an aspiring spirit should desire but i was enticed also by the brilliancy and magnificence of sound which a mind that has been nourished upon musical thoughts can produce by a just and harmonious arrangement of the pauses of this measure yet there will be found some instances where i have completely failed in this attempt and one which i here request the reader to consider as an erratum where there is left most inadvertently an alexandrine in the middle of a stanza but in this as in every other respect i have written fearlessly it is the misfortune of this age that its writers too thoughtless of immortality are exquisitely sensible to temporary praise or blame they write with the fear of reviews before their eyes this system of criticism sprang up in that torpid interval when poetry was not poetry and the art which professes to regulate and limit its powers cannot subsist together longinus could not have been the contemporary of homer nor boileau of horace yet this species of criticism never presumed to assert an understanding of its own it has always unlike true science followed not preceded the opinion of mankind and would even now bribe with worthless adulation some of our greatest poets to impose gratuitous fetters on their own imaginations and become unconscious accomplices in the daily murder of all genius either not so aspiring or not so fortunate as their own i have sought therefore to write as i believe that homer shakespeare and milton wrote with an utter disregard of anonymous censure i am certain that calumny and misrepresentation though it may move me to compassion cannot disturb my peace i shall understand the expressive silence of those sagacious enemies who dare not trust themselves to speak i shall endeavour to extract from the midst of insult and contempt and maledictions those admonitions which may tend to correct whatever imperfections such censurers may discover in this my first serious appeal to the public if certain critics were as clearsighted as they are malignant how great would be the benefit to be derived from their virulent writings as it is i fear i shall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives should the public judge that my composition is worthless i shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which milton received his crown of immortality and shall seek to gather if i live strength from that defeat which may nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless i cannot conceive that lucretius when he meditated that poem whose doctrines are yet the basis of our metaphysical knowledge and whose eloquence has been the wonder of mankind wrote in awe of such censure as the hired sophists of the impure and superstitious noblemen of rome might affix to what he should produce it was at the period when greece was led captive and asia made tributary to the republic fast verging itself to slavery and ruin that a multitude of syrian captives bigoted to the worship of their obscene ashtaroth and the unworthy successors of socrates and zeno found there a precarious subsistence by administering under the name of freedmen to the vices and vanities of the great these wretched men were skilled to plead with a superficial but plausible set of sophisms in favour of that contempt for virtue which is the portion of slaves and that faith in portents the most fatal substitute for benevolence in the imaginations of men which arising from the enslaved communities of the east then first began to overwhelm the western nations in its stream were these the kind of men whose disapprobation the wise and loftyminded lucretius should have regarded with a salutary awe the latest and perhaps the meanest of those who follow in his footsteps would disdain to hold life on such conditions the poem now presented to the public occupied little more than six months in the composition that period has been devoted to the task with unremitting ardour and enthusiasm i have exercised a watchful and earnest criticism on my work as it grew under my hands i would willingly have sent it forth to the world with that perfection which long labour and revision is said to bestow but i found that if i should gain something in exactness by this method i might lose much of the newness and energy of imagery and language as it flowed fresh from my mind and although the mere composition occupied no more than six months the thoughts thus arranged were slowly gathered in as many years i trust that the reader will carefully distinguish between those opinions which have a dramatic propriety in reference to the characters which they are designed to elucidate and such as are properly my own the erroneous and degrading idea which men have conceived of a supreme being for instance is spoken against but not the supreme being itself the belief which some superstitious persons whom i have brought upon the stage entertain of the deity as injurious to the character of his benevolence is widely different from my own in recommending also a great and important change in the spirit which animates the social institutions of mankind i have avoided all flattery to those violent and malignant passions of our nature which are ever on the watch to mingle with and to alloy the most beneficial innovations there is no quarter given to revenge or envy or prejudice love is celebrated everywhere as the sole law which should govern the moral world dedication there is no danger to a man that knows what life and death is theres not any law exceeds his knowledge neither is it lawful that he should stoop to any other law chapman to mary so now my summertask is ended mary and i return to thee mine own hearts home as to his queen some victor knight of faery earning bright spoils for her enchanted dome nor thou disdain that ere my fame become a star among the stars of mortal night if it indeed may cleave its natal gloom its doubtful promise thus i would unite with thy beloved name thou child of love and light the toil which stole from thee so many an hour is ended and the fruit is at thy feet no longer where the woods to frame a bower with interlaced branches mix and meet or where with sound like many voices sweet waterfalls leap among wild islands green which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat of mossgrown trees and weeds shall i be seen but beside thee where still my heart has ever been thoughts of great deeds were mine dear friend when first the clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass i do remember well the hour which burst my spirits sleep a fresh maydawn it was when i walked forth upon the glittering grass and wept i knew not why until there rose from the near schoolroom voices that alas were but one echo from a world of woes the harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes and then i clasped my hands and looked around but none was near to mock my streaming eyes which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground so without shame i spake i will be wise and just and free and mild if in me lies such power for i grow weary to behold the selfish and the strong still tyrannise without reproach or check i then controlled my tears my heart grew calm and i was meek and bold and from that hour did i with earnest thought heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught i cared to learn but from that secret store wrought linked armour for my soul before it might walk forth to war among mankind thus power and hope were strengthened more and more within me till there came upon my mind a sense of loneliness a thirst with which i pined alas that love should be a blight and snare to those who seek all sympathies in one such once i sought in vain then black despair the shadow of a starless night was thrown over the world in which i moved alone yet never found i one not false to me hard hearts and cold like weights of icy stone which crushed and withered mine that could not be aught but a lifeless clod until revived by thee thou friend whose presence on my wintry heart fell like bright spring upon some herbless plain how beautiful and calm and free thou wert in thy young wisdom when the mortal chain of custom thou didst burst and rend in twain and walked as free as light the clouds among which many an envious slave then breathed in vain from his dim dungeon and my spirit sprung to meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long no more alone through the worlds wilderness although i trod the paths of high intent i journeyed now no more companionless where solitude is like despair i went there is the wisdom of a stern content when poverty can blight the just and good when infamy dares mock the innocent and cherished friends turn with the multitude to trample this was ours and we unshaken stood now has descended a serener hour and with inconstant fortune friends return though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power which says let scorn be not repaid with scorn and from thy side two gentle babes are born to fill our home with smiles and thus are we most fortunate beneath lifes beaming morn and these delights and thou have been to me the parents of the song i consecrate to thee is it that now my inexperienced fingers but strike the prelude of a loftier strain or must the lyre on which my spirit lingers soon pause in silence neer to sound again though it might shake the anarch customs reign and charm the minds of men to truths own sway holier than was amphions i would fain reply in hope but i am worn away and death and love are yet contending for their prey and what art thou i know but dare not speak time may interpret to his silent years yet in the paleness of thy thoughtful cheek and in the light thine ample forehead wears and in thy sweetest smiles and in thy tears and in thy gentle speech a prophecy is whispered to subdue my fondest fears and through thine eyes even in thy soul i see a lamp of vestal fire burning internally they say that thou wert lovely from thy birth of glorious parents thou aspiring child i wonder not for one then left this earth whose life was like a setting planet mild which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled of its departing glory still her fame shines on thee through the tempests dark and wild which shake these latter days and thou canst claim the shelter from thy sire of an immortal name one voice came forth from many a mighty spirit which was the echo of three thousand years and the tumultuous world stood mute to hear it as some lone man who in a desert hears the music of his home unwonted fears fell on the pale oppressors of our race and faith and custom and lowthoughted cares like thunderstricken dragons for a space left the torn human heart their food and dwellingplace truths deathless voice pauses among mankind if there must be no response to my cry if men must rise and stamp with fury blind on his pure name who loves them thou and i sweet friend can look from our tranquillity like lamps into the worlds tempestuous night two tranquil stars while clouds are passing by which wrap them from the foundering seamans sight that burn from year to year with unextinguished light notes cloaking edition see notes at end canto when the last hope of trampled france had failed like a brief dream of unremaining glory from visions of despair i rose and scaled the peak of an aerial promontory whose caverned base with the vexed surge was hoary and saw the golden dawn break forth and waken each cloud and every wave but transitory the calm for sudden the firm earth was shaken as if by the last wreck its frame were overtaken so as i stood one blast of muttering thunder burst in far peals along the waveless deep when gathering fast around above and under long trains of tremulous mist began to creep until their complicating lines did steep the orient sun in shadow not a sound was heard one horrible repose did keep the forests and the floods and all around darkness more dread than night was poured upon the ground hark tis the rushing of a wind that sweeps earth and the ocean see the lightnings yawn deluging heaven with fire and the lashed deeps glitter and boil beneath it rages on one mighty stream whirlwind and waves upthrown lightning and hail and darkness eddying by there is a pause the seabirds that were gone into their caves to shriek come forth to spy what calm has falln on earth what light is in the sky for where the irresistible storm had cloven that fearful darkness the blue sky was seen fretted with many a fair cloud interwoven most delicately and the ocean green beneath that opening spot of blue serene quivered like burning emerald calm was spread on all below but far on high between earth and the upper air the vast clouds fled countless and swift as leaves on autumns tempest shed for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon i could not choose but gaze a fascination dwelt in that moon and sky and clouds which drew my fancy thither and in expectation of what i knew not i remained the hue of the white moon amid that heaven so blue suddenly stained with shadow did appear a speck a cloud a shape approaching grew like a great ship in the suns sinking sphere beheld afar at sea and swift it came anear even like a bark which from a chasm of mountains dark vast and overhanging on a river which there collects the strength of all its fountains comes forth whilst with the speed its frame doth quiver sails oars and stream tending to one endeavour so from that chasm of light a winged form on all the winds of heaven approaching ever floated dilating as it came the storm pursued it with fierce blasts and lightnings swift and warm a course precipitous of dizzy speed suspending thought and breath a monstrous sight for in the air do i behold indeed an eagle and a serpent wreathed in fight and now relaxing its impetuous flight before the aerial rock on which i stood the eagle hovering wheeled to left and right and hung with lingering wings over the flood and startled with its yells the wide airs solitude a shaft of light upon its wings descended and every golden feather gleamed therein feather and scale inextricably blended the serpents mailed and manycoloured skin shone through the plumes its coils were twined within by many a swoln and knotted fold and high and far the neck receding lithe and thin sustained a crested head which warily shifted and glanced before the eagles steadfast eye around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantly sometimes on high concealing its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek upon his enemys heart a mortal wound to wreak what life what power was kindled and arose within the sphere of that appalling fray for from the encounter of those wondrous foes a vapour like the seas suspended spray hung gathered in the void air far away floated the shattered plumes bright scales did leap whereer the eagles talons made their way like sparks into the darkness as they sweep blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep swift chances in that combat many a check and many a change a dark and wild turmoil sometimes the snake around his enemys neck locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil until the eagle faint with pain and toil remitted his strong flight and near the sea languidly fluttered hopeless so to foil his adversary who then reared on high his red and burning crest radiant with victory then on the white edge of the bursting surge where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailing the event of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while oer the continent with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion of waves like mountains oer the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the seashore the evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste sea fair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had falln and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the seamark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate it seemed that this fair shape had looked upon that unimaginable fight and now that her sweet eyes were weary of the sun as brightly it illustrated her woe for in the tears which silently to flow paused not its lustre hung she watching aye the foamwreaths which the faint tide wove below upon the spangled sands groaned heavily and after every groan looked up over the sea and when she saw the wounded serpent make his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her starbright robe and shadowy hair poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth i heard alone what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play oer its marmoreal depth one moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay then she arose and smiled on me with eyes serene yet sorrowing like that planet fair while yet the daylight lingereth in the skies which cleaves with arrowy beams the darkred air and said to grieve is wise but the despair was weak and vain which led thee here from sleep this shalt thou know and more if thou dost dare with me and with this serpent oer the deep a voyage divine and strange companionship to keep her voice was like the wildest saddest tone yet sweet of some loved voice heard long ago i wept shall this fair woman all alone over the sea with that fierce serpent go his head is on her heart and who can know how soon he may devour his feeble prey such were my thoughts when the tide gan to flow and that strange boat like the moons shade did sway amid reflected stars that in the waters lay a boat of rare device which had no sail but its own curved prow of thin moonstone wrought like a web of texture fine and frail to catch those gentlest winds which are not known to breathe but by the steady speed alone with which it cleaves the sparkling sea and now we are embarked the mountains hang and frown over the starry deep that gleams below a vast and dim expanse as oer the waves we go and as we sailed a strange and awful tale that woman told like such mysterious dream as makes the slumberers cheek with wonder pale twas midnight and around a shoreless stream wide ocean rolled when that majestic theme shrined in her heart found utterance and she bent her looks on mine those eyes a kindling beam of love divine into my spirit sent and ere her lips could move made the air eloquent speak not to me but hear much shalt thou learn much must remain unthought and more untold in the dark futures everflowing urn know then that from the depth of ages old two powers oer mortal things dominion hold ruling the world with a divided lot immortal allpervading manifold twin genii equal gods when life and thought sprang forth they burst the womb of inessential nought the earliest dweller of the world alone stood on the verge of chaos lo afar oer the wide wild abyss two meteors shone sprung from the depth of its tempestuous jar a bloodred comet and the morning star mingling their beams in combat as he stood all thoughts within his mind waged mutual war in dreadful sympathy when to the flood that fair star fell he turned and shed his brothers blood thus evil triumphed and the spirit of evil one power of many shapes which none may know one shape of many names the fiend did revel in victory reigning oer a world of woe for the new race of man went to and fro famished and homeless loathed and loathing wild and hating good for his immortal foe he changed from starry shape beauteous and mild to a dire snake with man and beast unreconciled the darkness lingering oer the dawn of things was evils breath and life this made him strong to soar aloft with overshadowing wings and the great spirit of good did creep among the nations of mankind and every tongue cursed and blasphemed him as he passed for none knew good from evil though their names were hung in mockery oer the fane where many a groan as king and lord and god the conquering fiend did own the fiend whose name was legion death decay earthquake and blight and want and madness pale winged and wan diseases an array numerous as leaves that strew the autumnal gale poison a snake in flowers beneath the veil of food and mirth hiding his mortal head and without whom all these might nought avail fear hatred faith and tyranny who spread those subtle nets which snare the living and the dead his spirit is their power and they his slaves in air and light and thought and language dwell and keep their state from palaces to graves in all resorts of men invisible but when in ebon mirror nightmare fell to tyrant or impostor bids them rise black winged demon forms whom from the hell his reign and dwelling beneath nether skies he loosens to their dark and blasting ministries in the worlds youth his empire was as firm as its foundationssoon the spirit of good though in the likeness of a loathsome worm sprang from the billows of the formless flood which shrank and fled and with that fiend of blood renewed the doubtful warthrones then first shook and earths immense and trampled multitude in hope on their own powers began to look and fear the demon pale his sanguine shrine forsook then greece arose and to its bards and sages in dream the goldenpinioned genii came even where they slept amid the night of ages steeping their hearts in the divinest flame which thy breath kindled power of holiest name and oft in cycles since when darkness gave new weapons to thy foe their sunlike fame upon the combat shone a light to save like paradise spread forth beyond the shadowy grave such is this conflict when mankind doth strive with its oppressors in a strife of blood or when free thoughts like lightnings are alive and in each bosom of the multitude justice and truth with customs hydra brood wage silent war when priests and kings dissemble in smiles or frowns their fierce disquietude when round pure hearts a host of hopes assemble the snake and eagle meet the worlds foundations tremble thou hast beheld that fight when to thy home thou dost return steep not its hearth in tears though thou mayst hear that earth is now become the tyrants garbage which to his compeers the vile reward of their dishonoured years he will dividing give the victor fiend omnipotent of yore now quails and fears his triumph dearly won which soon will lend an impulse swift and sure to his approaching end list stranger list mine is an human form like that thou wearest touch me shrink not now my hand thou feelst is not a ghosts but warm with human blood twas many years ago since first my thirsting soul aspired to know the secrets of this wondrous world when deep my heart was pierced with sympathy for woe which could not be mine own and thought did keep in dream unnatural watch beside an infants sleep woe could not be mine own since far from men i dwelt a free and happy orphan child by the seashore in a deep mountain glen and near the waves and through the forests wild i roamed to storm and darkness reconciled for i was calm while tempest shook the sky but when the breathless heavens in beauty smiled i wept sweet tears yet too tumultuously for peace and clasped my hands aloft in ecstasy these were forebodings of my fate before a womans heart beat in my virgin breast it had been nurtured in divinest lore a dying poet gave me books and blessed with wild but holy talk the sweet unrest in which i watched him as he died away a youth with hoary hair a fleeting guest of our lone mountains and this lore did sway my spirit like a storm contending there alway thus the dark tale which history doth unfold i knew but not methinks as others know for they weep not and wisdom had unrolled the clouds which hide the gulf of mortal woe to few can she that warning vision show for i loved all things with intense devotion so that when hopes deep source in fullest flow like earthquake did uplift the stagnant ocean of human thoughts mine shook beneath the wide emotion when first the living blood through all these veins kindled a thought in sense great france sprang forth and seized as if to break the ponderous chains which bind in woe the nations of the earth i saw and started from my cottagehearth and to the clouds and waves in tameless gladness shrieked till they caught immeasurable mirth and laughed in light and music soon sweet madness was poured upon my heart a soft and thrilling sadness deep slumber fell on me my dreams were fire soft and delightful thoughts did rest and hover like shadows oer my brain and strange desire the tempest of a passion raging over my tranquil soul its depths with light did cover which passed and calm and darkness sweeter far came then i loved but not a human lover for when i rose from sleep the morning star shone through the woodbinewreaths which round my casement were twas like an eye which seemed to smile on me i watched till by the sun made pale it sank under the billows of the heaving sea but from its beams deep love my spirit drank and to my brain the boundless world now shrank into one thought one image yes for ever even like the dayspring poured on vapours dank the beams of that one star did shoot and quiver through my benighted mind and were extinguished never the day passed thus at night methought in dream a shape of speechless beauty did appear it stood like light on a careering stream of golden clouds which shook the atmosphere a winged youth his radiant brow did wear the morning star a wild dissolving bliss over my frame he breathed approaching near and bent his eyes of kindling tenderness near mine and on my lips impressed a lingering kiss and said a spirit loves thee mortal maiden how wilt thou prove thy worth then joy and sleep together fled my soul was deeply laden and to the shore i went to muse and weep but as i moved over my heart did creep a joy less soft but more profound and strong than my sweet dream and it forbade to keep the path of the seashore that spirits tongue seemed whispering in my heart and bore my steps along how to that vast and peopled city led which was a field of holy warfare then i walked among the dying and the dead and shared in fearless deeds with evil men calm as an angel in the dragons den how i braved death for liberty and truth and spurned at peace and power and fame and when those hopes had lost the glory of their youth how sadly i returned might move the hearers ruth warm tears throng fast the tale may not be said know then that when this grief had been subdued i was not left like others cold and dead the spirit whom i loved in solitude sustained his child the tempestshaken wood the waves the fountains and the hush of night these were his voice and well i understood his smile divine when the calm sea was bright with silent stars and heaven was breathless with delight in lonely glens amid the roar of rivers when the dim nights were moonless have i known joys which no tongue can tell my pale lip quivers when thought revisits them know thou alone that after many wondrous years were flown i was awakened by a shriek of woe and over me a mystic robe was thrown by viewless hands and a bright star did glow before my steps the snake then met his mortal foe thou fearest not then the serpent on thy heart fear it she said with brief and passionate cry and spake no more that silence made me start i looked and we were sailing pleasantly swift as a cloud between the sea and sky beneath the rising moon seen far away mountains of ice like sapphire piled on high hemming the horizon round in silence lay on the still waters these we did approach alway and swift and swifter grew the vessels motion so that a dizzy trance fell on my brain wild music woke me we had passed the ocean which girds the pole natures remotest reign and we glode fast oer a pellucid plain of waters azure with the noontide day ethereal mountains shone around a fane stood in the midst girt by green isles which lay on the blue sunny deep resplendent far away it was a temple such as mortal hand has never built nor ecstasy nor dream reared in the cities of enchanted land twas likest heaven ere yet days purple stream ebbs oer the western forest while the gleam of the unrisen moon among the clouds is gathering when with many a golden beam the thronging constellations rush in crowds paving with fire the sky and the marmoreal floods like what may be conceived of this vast dome when from the depths which thought can seldom pierce genius beholds it rise his native home girt by the deserts of the universe yet nor in paintings light or mightier verse or sculptures marble language can invest that shape to mortal sense such glooms immerse that incommunicable sight and rest upon the labouring brain and overburdened breast winding among the lawny islands fair whose blosmy forests starred the shadowy deep the wingless boat paused where an ivory stair its fretwork in the crystal sea did steep encircling that vast fanes aerial heap we disembarked and through a portal wide we passed whose roof of moonstone carved did keep a glimmering oer the forms on every side sculptures like life and thought immovable deepeyed we came to a vast hall whose glorious roof was diamond which had drunk the lightnings sheen in darkness and now poured it through the woof of spellinwoven clouds hung there to screen its blinding splendour through such veil was seen that work of subtlest power divine and rare orb above orb with starry shapes between and horned moons and meteors strange and fair on nightblack columns poised one hollow hemisphere ten thousand columns in that quivering light distinct between whose shafts wound far away the long and labyrinthine aisles more bright with their own radiance than the heaven of day and on the jasper walls around there lay paintings the poesy of mightiest thought which did the spirits history display a tale of passionate change divinely taught which in their winged dance unconscious genii wrought beneath there sate on many a sapphire throne the great who had departed from mankind a mighty senate some whose white hair shone like mountain snow mild beautiful and blind some female forms whose gestures beamed with mind and ardent youths and children bright and fair and some had lyres whose strings were intertwined with pale and clinging flames which ever there waked faint yet thrilling sounds that pierced the crystal air one seat was vacant in the midst a throne reared on a pyramid like sculptured flame distinct with circling steps which rested on their own deep fire soon as the woman came into that hall she shrieked the spirits name and fell and vanished slowly from the sight darkness arose from her dissolving frame which gathering filled that dome of woven light blotting its sphered stars with supernatural night then first two glittering lights were seen to glide in circles on the amethystine floor small serpent eyes trailing from side to side like meteors on a rivers grassy shore they round each other rolled dilating more and more then rose commingling into one one clear and mighty planet hanging oer a cloud of deepest shadow which was thrown athwart the glowing steps and the crystalline throne the cloud which rested on that cone of flame was cloven beneath the planet sate a form fairer than tongue can speak or thought may frame the radiance of whose limbs roselike and warm flowed forth and did with softest light inform the shadowy dome the sculptures and the state of those assembled shapes with clinging charm sinking upon their hearts and mine he sate majestic yet most mild calm yet compassionate wonder and joy a passing faintness threw over my brow a hand supported me whose touch was magic strength an eye of blue looked into mine like moonlight soothingly and a voice said thou must a listener be this day two mighty spirits now return like birds of calm from the worlds raging sea they pour fresh light from hopes immortal urn a tale of human power despair not list and learn i looked and lo one stood forth eloquently his eyes were dark and deep and the clear brow which shadowed them was like the morning sky the cloudless heaven of spring when in their flow through the bright air the soft winds as they blow wake the green world his gestures did obey the oracular mind that made his features glow and where his curved lips halfopen lay passions divinest stream had made impetuous way beneath the darkness of his outspread hair he stood thus beautiful but there was one who sate beside him like his shadow there and held his hand far lovelier she was known to be thus fair by the few lines alone which through her floating locks and gathered cloak glances of souldissolving glory shone none else beheld her eyes in him they woke memories which found a tongue as thus he silence broke canto the starlight smile of children the sweet looks of women the fair breast from which i fed the murmur of the unreposing brooks and the green light which shifting overhead some tangled bower of vines around me shed the shells on the seasand and the wild flowers the lamplight through the rafters cheerly spread and on the twining flax in lifes young hours these sights and sounds did nurse my spirits folded powers in argolis beside the echoing sea such impulses within my mortal frame arose and they were dear to memory like tokens of the dead but others came soon in another shape the wondrous fame of the past world the vital words and deeds of minds whom neither time nor change can tame traditions dark and old whence evil creeds start forth and whose dim shade a stream of poison feeds i heard as all have heard the various story of human life and wept unwilling tears feeble historians of its shame and glory false disputants on all its hopes and fears victims who worshipped ruin chroniclers of daily scorn and slaves who loathed their state yet flattering power had given its ministers a throne of judgement in the grave twas fate that among such as these my youth should seek its mate the land in which i lived by a fell bane was withered up tyrants dwelt side by side and stabled in our homes until the chain stifled the captives cry and to abide that blasting curse men had no shame all vied in evil slave and despot fear with lust strange fellowship through mutual hate had tied like two dark serpents tangled in the dust which on the paths of men their mingling poison thrust earth our bright home its mountains and its waters and the ethereal shapes which are suspended over its green expanse and those fair daughters the clouds of sun and ocean who have blended the colours of the air since first extended it cradled the young world none wandered forth to see or feel a darkness had descended on every heart the light which shows its worth must among gentle thoughts and fearless take its birth this vital world this home of happy spirits was as a dungeon to my blasted kind all that despair from murdered hope inherits they sought and in their helpless misery blind a deeper prison and heavier chains did find and stronger tyrants a dark gulf before the realm of a stern ruler yawned behind terror and time conflicting drove and bore on their tempestuous flood the shrieking wretch from shore out of that oceans wrecks had guilt and woe framed a dark dwelling for their homeless thought and starting at the ghosts which to and fro glide oer its dim and gloomy strand had brought the worship thence which they each other taught well might men loathe their life well might they turn even to the ills again from which they sought such refuge after death well might they learn to gaze on this fair world with hopeless unconcern for they all pined in bondage body and soul tyrant and slave victim and torturer bent before one power to which supreme control over their will by their own weakness lent made all its many names omnipotent all symbols of things evil all divine and hymns of blood or mockery which rent the air from all its fanes did intertwine impostures impious toils round each discordant shrine i heard as all have heard lifes various story and in no careless heart transcribed the tale but from the sneers of men who had grown hoary in shame and scorn from groans of crowds made pale by famine from a mothers desolate wail oer her polluted child from innocent blood poured on the earth and brows anxious and pale with the hearts warfare did i gather food to feed my many thoughts a tameless multitude i wandered through the wrecks of days departed far by the desolated shore when even oer the still sea and jagged islets darted the light of moonrise in the northern heaven among the clouds near the horizon driven the mountains lay beneath one planet pale around me broken tombs and columns riven looked vast in twilight and the sorrowing gale waked in those ruins gray its everlasting wail i knew not who had framed these wonders then nor had i heard the story of their deeds but dwellings of a race of mightier men and monuments of less ungentle creeds tell their own tale to him who wisely heeds the language which they speak and now to me the moonlight making pale the blooming weeds the bright stars shining in the breathless sea interpreted those scrolls of mortal mystery such man has been and such may yet become ay wiser greater gentler even than they who on the fragments of yon shattered dome have stamped the sign of power i felt the sway of the vast stream of ages bear away my floating thoughts my heart beat loud and fast even as a storm let loose beneath the ray of the still moon my spirit onward passed beneath truths steady beams upon its tumult cast it shall be thus no more too long too long sons of the glorious dead have ye lain bound in darkness and in ruin hope is strong justice and truth their winged child have found awake arise until the mighty sound of your career shall scatter in its gust the thrones of the oppressor and the ground hide the last altars unregarded dust whose idol has so long betrayed your impious trust it must be so i will arise and waken the multitude and like a sulphurous hill which on a sudden from its snows has shaken the swoon of ages it shall burst and fill the world with cleansing fire it must it will it may not be restrained and who shall stand amid the rocking earthquake steadfast still but laon on high freedoms desert land a tower whose marble walls the leagued storms withstand one summer night in commune with the hope thus deeply fed amid those ruins gray i watched beneath the dark skys starry cope and ever from that hour upon me lay the burden of this hope and night or day in vision or in dream clove to my breast among mankind or when gone far away to the lone shores and mountains twas a guest which followed where i fled and watched when i did rest these hopes found words through which my spirit sought to weave a bondage of such sympathy as might create some response to the thought which ruled me now and as the vapours lie bright in the outspread mornings radiancy so were these thoughts invested with the light of language and all bosoms made reply on which its lustre streamed wheneer it might through darkness wide and deep those tranced spirits smite yes many an eye with dizzy tears was dim and oft i thought to clasp my own hearts brother when i could feel the listeners senses swim and hear his breath its own swift gaspings smother even as my words evoked them and another and yet another i did fondly deem felt that we all were sons of one great mother and the cold truth such sad reverse did seem as to awake in grief from some delightful dream yes oft beside the ruined labyrinth which skirts the hoary caves of the green deep did laon and his friend on one gray plinth round whose worn base the wild waves hiss and leap resting at eve a lofty converse keep and that this friend was false may now be said calmly that he like other men could weep tears which are lies and could betray and spread snares for that guileless heart which for his own had bled then had no great aim recompensed my sorrow i must have sought dark respite from its stress in dreamless rest in sleep that sees no morrow for to tread lifes dismaying wilderness without one smile to cheer one voice to bless amid the snares and scoffs of human kind is hard but i betrayed it not nor less with love that scorned return sought to unbind the interwoven clouds which make its wisdom blind with deathless minds which leave where they have passed a path of light my soul communion knew till from that glorious intercourse at last as from a mine of magic store i drew words which were weapons round my heart there grew the adamantine armour of their power and from my fancy wings of golden hue sprang forth yet not alone from wisdoms tower a minister of truth these plumes young laon bore an orphan with my parents lived whose eyes were lodestars of delight which drew me home when i might wander forth nor did i prize aught human thing beneath heavens mighty dome beyond this child so when sad hours were come and baffled hope like ice still clung to me since kin were cold and friends had now become heartless and false i turned from all to be cythna the only source of tears and smiles to thee what wert thou then a child most infantine yet wandering far beyond that innocent age in all but its sweet looks and mien divine even then methought with the worlds tyrant rage a patient warfare thy young heart did wage when those soft eyes of scarcely conscious thought some tale or thine own fancies would engage to overflow with tears or converse fraught with passion oer their depths its fleeting light had wrought she moved upon this earth a shape of brightness a power that from its objects scarcely drew one impulse of her being in her lightness most like some radiant cloud of morning dew which wanders through the waste airs pathless blue to nourish some far desert she did seem beside me gathering beauty as she grew like the bright shade of some immortal dream which walks when tempest sleeps the wave of lifes dark stream as mine own shadow was this child to me a second self far dearer and more fair which clothed in undissolving radiancy all those steep paths which languor and despair of human things had made so dark and bare but which i trod alone nor till bereft of friends and overcome by lonely care knew i what solace for that loss was left though by a bitter wound my trusting heart was cleft once she was dear now she was all i had to love in human life this playmate sweet this child of twelve years old so she was made my sole associate and her willing feet wandered with mine where earth and ocean meet beyond the aereal mountains whose vast cells the unreposing billows ever beat through forests wild and old and lawny dells where boughs of incense droop over the emerald wells and warm and light i felt her clasping hand when twined in mine she followed where i went through the lone paths of our immortal land it had no waste but some memorial lent which strung me to my toil some monument vital with mind then cythna by my side until the bright and beaming day were spent would rest with looks entreating to abide too earnest and too sweet ever to be denied and soon i could not have refused her thus for ever day and night we two were neer parted but when brief sleep divided us and when the pauses of the lulling air of noon beside the sea had made a lair for her soothed senses in my arms she slept and i kept watch over her slumbers there while as the shifting visions over her swept amid her innocent rest by turns she smiled and wept and in the murmur of her dreams was heard sometimes the name of laon suddenly she would arise and like the secret bird whom sunset wakens fill the shore and sky with her sweet accents a wild melody hymns which my soul had woven to freedom strong the source of passion whence they rose to be triumphant strains which like a spirits tongue to the enchanted waves that child of glory sung her white arms lifted through the shadowy stream of her loose hair oh excellently great seemed to me then my purpose the vast theme of those impassioned songs when cythna sate amid the calm which rapture doth create after its tumult her heart vibrating her spirit oer the oceans floating state from her deep eyes far wandering on the wing of visions that were mine beyond its utmost spring for before cythna loved it had my song peopled with thoughts the boundless universe a mighty congregation which were strong whereer they trod the darkness to disperse the cloud of that unutterable curse which clings upon mankind all things became slaves to my holy and heroic verse earth sea and sky the planets life and fame and fate or whateer else binds the worlds wondrous frame and this beloved child thus felt the sway of my conceptions gathering like a cloud the very wind on which it rolls away hers too were all my thoughts ere yet endowed with music and with light their fountains flowed in poesy and her still and earnest face pallid with feelings which intensely glowed within was turned on mine with speechless grace watching the hopes which there her heart had learned to trace in me communion with this purest being kindled intenser zeal and made me wise in knowledge which in hers mine own mind seeing left in the human world few mysteries how without fear of evil or disguise was cythna what a spirit strong and mild which death or pain or peril could despise yet melt in tenderness what genius wild yet mighty was enclosed within one simple child new lore was this old age with its gray hair and wrinkled legends of unworthy things and icy sneers is nought it cannot dare to burst the chains which life for ever flings on the entangled souls aspiring wings so is it cold and cruel and is made the careless slave of that dark power which brings evil like blight on man who still betrayed laughs oer the grave in which his living hopes are laid nor are the strong and the severe to keep the empire of the world thus cythna taught even in the visions of her eloquent sleep unconscious of the power through which she wrought the woof of such intelligible thought as from the tranquil strength which cradled lay in her smilepeopled rest my spirit sought why the deceiver and the slave has sway oer heralds so divine of truths arising day within that fairest form the female mind untainted by the poison clouds which rest on the dark world a sacred home did find but else from the wide earths maternal breast victorious evil which had dispossessed all native power had those fair children torn and made them slaves to soothe his vile unrest and minister to lust its joys forlorn till they had learned to breathe the atmosphere of scorn this misery was but coldly felt till she became my only friend who had endued my purpose with a wider sympathy thus cythna mourned with me the servitude in which the half of humankind were mewed victims of lust and hate the slaves of slaves she mourned that grace and power were thrown as food to the hyena lust who among graves over his loathed meal laughing in agony raves and i still gazing on that glorious child even as these thoughts flushed oer her cythna sweet well with the world art thou unreconciled never will peace and human nature meet till free and equal man and woman greet domestic peace and ere this power can make in human hearts its calm and holy seat this slavery must be broken as i spake from cythnas eyes a light of exultation brake she replied earnestly it shall be mine this task mine laon thou hast much to gain nor wilt thou at poor cythnas pride repine if she should lead a happy female train to meet thee over the rejoicing plain when myriads at thy call shall throng around the golden city then the child did strain my arm upon her tremulous heart and wound her own about my neck till some reply she found i smiled and spake not wherefore dost thou smile at what i say laon i am not weak and though my cheek might become pale the while with thee if thou desirest will i seek through their array of banded slaves to wreak ruin upon the tyrants i had thought it was more hard to turn my unpractised cheek to scorn and shame and this beloved spot and thee o dearest friend to leave and murmur not whence came i what i am thou laon knowest how a young child should thus undaunted be methinks it is a power which thou bestowest through which i seek by most resembling thee so to become most good and great and free yet far beyond this oceans utmost roar in towers and huts are many like to me who could they see thine eyes or feel such lore as i have learnt from them like me would fear no more thinkst thou that i shall speak unskilfully and none will heed me i remember now how once a slave in tortures doomed to die was saved because in accents sweet and low he sung a song his judge loved long ago as he was led to death all shall relent who hear me tears as mine have flowed shall flow hearts beat as mine now beats with such intent as renovates the world a will omnipotent yes i will tread prides golden palaces through penurys roofless huts and squalid cells will i descend whereer in abjectness woman with some vile slave her tyrant dwells there with the music of thine own sweet spells will disenchant the captives and will pour for the despairing from the crystal wells of thy deep spirit reasons mighty lore and power shall then abound and hope arise once more can man be free if woman be a slave chain one who lives and breathes this boundless air to the corruption of a closed grave can they whose mates are beasts condemned to bear scorn heavier far than toil or anguish dare to trample their oppressors in their home among their babes thou knowest a curse would wear the shape of woman hoary crime would come behind and fraud rebuild religions tottering dome i am a child i would not yet depart when i go forth alone bearing the lamp aloft which thou hast kindled in my heart millions of slaves from many a dungeon damp shall leap in joy as the benumbing cramp of ages leaves their limbs no ill may harm thy cythna ever truth its radiant stamp has fixed as an invulnerable charm upon her childrens brow dark falsehood to disarm wait yet awhile for the appointed day thou wilt depart and i with tears shall stand watching thy dim sail skirt the ocean gray amid the dwellers of this lonely land i shall remain alone and thy command shall then dissolve the worlds unquiet trance and multitudinous as the desert sand borne on the storm its millions shall advance thronging round thee the light of their deliverance then like the forests of some pathless mountain which from remotest glens two warring winds involve in fire which not the loosened fountain of broadest floods might quench shall all the kinds of evil catch from our uniting minds the spark which must consume them cythna then will have cast off the impotence that binds her childhood now and through the paths of men will pass as the charmed bird that haunts the serpents den we part o laon i must dare nor tremble to meet those looks no more oh heavy stroke sweet brother of my soul can i dissemble the agony of this thought as thus she spoke the gathered sobs her quivering accents broke and in my arms she hid her beating breast i remained still for tears sudden she woke as one awakes from sleep and wildly pressed my bosom her whole frame impetuously possessed we part to meet again but yon blue waste yon desert wide and deep holds no recess within whose happy silence thus embraced we might survive all ills in one caress nor doth the grave i fear tis passionless nor yon cold vacant heaven we meet again within the minds of men whose lips shall bless our memory and whose hopes its light retain when these dissevered bones are trodden in the plain i could not speak though she had ceased for now the fountains of her feeling swift and deep seemed to suspend the tumult of their flow so we arose and by the starlight steep went homeward neither did we speak nor weep but pale were calm with passion thus subdued like evening shades that oer the mountains creep we moved towards our home where in this mood each from the other sought refuge in solitude canto what thoughts had sway oer cythnas lonely slumber that night i know not but my own did seem as if they might ten thousand years outnumber of waking life the visions of a dream which hid in one dim gulf the troubled stream of mind a boundless chaos wild and vast whose limits yet were never memorys theme and i lay struggling as its whirlwinds passed sometimes for rapture sick sometimes for pain aghast two hours whose mighty circle did embrace more time than might make gray the infant world rolled thus a weary and tumultuous space when the third came like mist on breezes curled from my dim sleep a shadow was unfurled methought upon the threshold of a cave i sate with cythna drooping briony pearled with dew from the wild streamlets shattered wave hung where we sate to taste the joys which nature gave we lived a day as we were wont to live but nature had a robe of glory on and the bright air oer every shape did weave intenser hues so that the herbless stone the leafless bough among the leaves alone had being clearer than its own could be and cythnas pure and radiant self was shown in this strange vision so divine to me that if i loved before now love was agony morn fled noon came evening then night descended and we prolonged calm talk beneath the sphere of the calm moon when suddenly was blended with our repose a nameless sense of fear and from the cave behind i seemed to hear sounds gathering upwards accents incomplete and stifled shrieks and now more near and near a tumult and a rush of thronging feet the caverns secret depths beneath the earth did beat the scene was changed and away away away through the air and over the sea we sped and cythna in my sheltering bosom lay and the winds bore me through the darkness spread around the gaping earth then vomited legions of foul and ghastly shapes which hung upon my flight and ever as we fled they plucked at cythna soon to me then clung a sense of actual things those monstrous dreams among and i lay struggling in the impotence of sleep while outward life had burst its bound though still deluded strove the tortured sense to its dire wanderings to adapt the sound which in the light of morn was poured around our dwelling breathless pale and unaware i rose and all the cottage crowded found with armed men whose glittering swords were bare and whose degraded limbs the tyrants garb did wear and ere with rapid lips and gathered brow i could demand the cause a feeble shriek it was a feeble shriek faint far and low arrested me my mien grew calm and meek and grasping a small knife i went to seek that voice among the crowd twas cythnas cry beneath most calm resolve did agony wreak its whirlwind rage so i passed quietly till i beheld where bound that dearest child did lie i started to behold her for delight and exultation and a joyance free solemn serene and lofty filled the light of the calm smile with which she looked on me so that i feared some brainless ecstasy wrought from that bitter woe had wildered her farewell farewell she said as i drew nigh at first my peace was marred by this strange stir now i am calm as truth its chosen minister look not so laon say farewell in hope these bloody men are but the slaves who bear their mistress to her task it was my scope the slavery where they drag me now to share and among captives willing chains to wear awhile the rest thou knowest return dear friend let our first triumph trample the despair which would ensnare us now for in the end in victory or in death our hopes and fears must blend these words had fallen on my unheeding ear whilst i had watched the motions of the crew with seemingcareless glance not many were around her for their comrades just withdrew to guard some other victim so i drew my knife and with one impulse suddenly all unaware three of their number slew and grasped a fourth by the throat and with loud cry my countrymen invoked to death or liberty what followed then i know not for a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with blood when i awoke i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughter overthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow of blazing roofs shone far oer the white oceans flow upon that rock a mighty column stood whose capital seemed sculptured in the sky which to the wanderers oer the solitude of distant seas from ages long gone by had made a landmark oer its height to fly scarcely the cloud the vulture or the blast has power and when the shades of evening lie on earth and ocean its carved summits cast the sunken daylight far through the aerial waste they bore me to a cavern in the hill beneath that column and unbound me there and one did strip me stark and one did fill a vessel from the putrid pool one bare a lighted torch and four with friendless care guided my steps the cavernpaths along then up a steep and dark and narrow stair we wound until the torchs fiery tongue amid the gushing day beamless and pallid hung they raised me to the platform of the pile that columns dizzy height the grate of brass through which they thrust me open stood the while as to its ponderous and suspended mass with chains which eat into the flesh alas with brazen links my naked limbs they bound the grate as they departed to repass with horrid clangour fell and the far sound of their retiring steps in the dense gloom was drowned the noon was calm and bright around that column the overhanging sky and circling sea spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay it was so calm that scarce the feathery weed sown by some eagle on the topmost stone swayed in the air so bright that noon did breed no shadow in the sky beside mine own mine and the shadow of my chain alone below the smoke of roofs involved in flame rested like night all else was clearly shown in that broad glare yet sound to me none came but of the living blood that ran within my frame the peace of madness fled and ah too soon a ship was lying on the sunny main its sails were flagging in the breathless noon its shadow lay beyond that sight again waked with its presence in my tranced brain the stings of a known sorrow keen and cold i knew that ship bore cythna oer the plain of waters to her blighting slavery sold and watched it with such thoughts as must remain untold i watched until the shades of evening wrapped earth like an exhalation then the bark moved for that calm was by the sunset snapped it moved a speck upon the ocean dark soon the wan stars came forth and i could mark its path no more i sought to close mine eyes but like the balls their lids were stiff and stark i would have risen but ere that i could rise my parched skin was split with piercing agonies i gnawed my brazen chain and sought to sever its adamantine links that i might die o liberty forgive the base endeavour forgive me if reserved for victory the champion of thy faith eer sought to fly that starry night with its clear silence sent tameless resolve which laughed at misery into my soul linked remembrance lent to that such power to me such a severe content to breathe to be to hope or to despair and die i questioned not nor though the sun its shafts of agony kindling through the air moved over me nor though in evening dun or when the stars their visible courses run or morning the wide universe was spread in dreary calmness round me did i shun its presence nor seek refuge with the dead from one faint hope whose flower a dropping poison shed two days thus passed i neither raved nor died thirst raged within me like a scorpions nest built in mine entrails i had spurned aside the watervessel while despair possessed my thoughts and now no drop remained the uprest of the third sun brought hunger but the crust which had been left was to my craving breast fuel not food i chewed the bitter dust and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst oer the golden isles a fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep with whirlwind swiftness a fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnels loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well remember like a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels foul ceaseless shadows thought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied the sense of day and night of false and true was dead within me yet two visions burst that darkness one as since that hour i knew was not a phantom of the realms accursed where then my spirit dwelt but of the first i know not yet was it a dream or no but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memorys waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were three the fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung a womans shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the manycoloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew to my dry lips what radiance did inform those horny eyes whose was that withered form alas alas it seemed that cythnas ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teeth a whirlwind keen as frost then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless space it languished there and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than famine in the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leaves the chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound as lifting me it fell what next i heard were billows leaping on the harbourbar and the shrill seawind whose breath idly stirred my hair i looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark for now indeed over the salt seabillow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent oer me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raised now looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim sea now cheeringly though he said little did he speak to me it is a friend beside thee take good cheer poor victim thou art now at liberty i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the oceanstreams and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled and then the nightwind steaming from the shore sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtleblossoms starring the dim grove as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove notes torches editions bentmeant cj j nettleship canto the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivytrails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest seashells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of mans art nursed amid natures brood when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallen we came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed upon a couch of grass and oakleaves interlaced the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become the rockbuilt barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountains did my spirit wake from sleep as manycoloured as the snake that girds eternity in life and truth might not my heart its cravings ever slake was cythna then a dream and all my youth and all its hopes and fears and all its joy and ruth thus madness came again a milder madness which darkened nought but times unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that islefretted flood he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lips it was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart a glance as keen as is the lightnings stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did reassume through the enchantments of that hermit old then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope oer mans bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friends heart i told my thought that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not that hoary man had spent his livelong age in converse with the dead who leave the stamp of everburning thoughts on many a page when they are gone into the senseless damp of graves his spirit thus became a lamp of splendour like to those on which it fed through peopled haunts the city and the camp deep thirst for knowledge had his footsteps led and all the ways of men among mankind he read but custom maketh blind and obdurate the loftiest hearts he had beheld the woe in which mankind was bound but deemed that fate which made them abject would preserve them so and in such faith some steadfast joy to know he sought this cell but when fame went abroad that one in argolis did undergo torture for liberty and that the crowd high truths from gifted lips had heard and understood and that the multitude was gathering wide his spirit leaped within his aged frame in lonely peace he could no more abide but to the land on which the victors flame had fed my native land the hermit came each heart was there a shield and every tongue was as a sword of truth young laons name rallied their secret hopes though tyrants sung hymns of triumphant joy our scattered tribes among he came to the lone column on the rock and with his sweet and mighty eloquence the hearts of those who watched it did unlock and made them melt in tears of penitence they gave him entrance free to bear me thence since this the old man said seven years are spent while slowly truth on thy benighted sense has crept the hope which wildered it has lent meanwhile to me the power of a sublime intent yes from the records of my youthful state and from the lore of bards and sages old from whatsoeer my wakened thoughts create out of the hopes of thine aspirings bold have i collected language to unfold truth to my countrymen from shore to shore doctrines of human power my words have told they have been heard and men aspire to more than they have ever gained or ever lost of yore in secret chambers parents read and weep my writings to their babes no longer blind and young men gather when their tyrants sleep and vows of faith each to the other bind and marriageable maidens who have pined with love till life seemed melting through their look a warmer zeal a nobler hope now find and every bosom thus is rapt and shook like autumns myriad leaves in one swoln mountainbrook the tyrants of the golden city tremble at voices which are heard about the streets the ministers of fraud can scarce dissemble the lies of their own heart but when one meets another at the shrine he inly weets though he says nothing that the truth is known murderers are pale upon the judgementseats and gold grows vile even to the wealthy crone and laughter fills the fane and curses shake the throne kind thoughts and mighty hopes and gentle deeds abound for fearless love and the pure law of mild equality and peace succeeds to faiths which long have held the world in awe bloody and false and cold as whirlpools draw all wrecks of ocean to their chasm the sway of thy strong genius laon which foresaw this hope compels all spirits to obey which round thy secret strength now throng in wide array for i have been thy passive instrument as thus the old man spake his countenance gleamed on me like a spirits thou hast lent to me to all the power to advance towards this unforeseen deliverance from our ancestral chains ay thou didst rear that lamp of hope on high which time nor chance nor change may not extinguish and my share of good was oer the world its gathered beams to bear but i alas am both unknown and old and though the woof of wisdom i know well to dye in hues of language i am cold in seeming and the hopes which inly dwell my manners note that i did long repel but laons name to the tumultuous throng were like the star whose beams the waves compel and tempests and his soulsubduing tongue were as a lance to quell the mailed crest of wrong perchance blood need not flow if thou at length wouldst rise perchance the very slaves would spare their brethren and themselves great is the strength of words for lately did a maiden fair who from her childhood has been taught to bear the tyrants heaviest yoke arise and make her sex the law of truth and freedom hear and with these quiet words for thine own sake i prithee spare me did with ruth so take all hearts that even the torturer who had bound her meek calm frame ere it was yet impaled loosened her weeping then nor could be found one human hand to harm her unassailed therefore she walks through the great city veiled in virtues adamantine eloquence gainst scorn and death and pain thus trebly mailed and blending in the smiles of that defence the serpent and the dove wisdom and innocence the wildeyed women throng around her path from their luxurious dungeons from the dust of meaner thralls from the oppressors wrath or the caresses of his sated lust they congregate in her they put their trust the tyrants send their armed slaves to quell her power they even like a thundergust caught by some forest bend beneath the spell of that young maidens speech and to their chiefs rebel thus she doth equal laws and justice teach to woman outraged and polluted long gathering the sweetest fruit in human reach for those fair hands now free while armed wrong trembles before her look though it be strong thousands thus dwell beside her virgins bright and matrons with their babes a stately throng lovers renew the vows which they did plight in early faith and hearts long parted now unite and homeless orphans find a home near her and those poor victims of the proud no less fair wrecks on whom the smiling world with stir thrusts the redemption of its wickedness in squalid huts and in its palaces sits lust alone while oer the land is borne her voice whose awful sweetness doth repress all evil and her foes relenting turn and cast the vote of love in hopes abandoned urn so in the populous city a young maiden has baffled havoc of the prey which he marks as his own wheneer with chains oerladen men make them arms to hurl down tyranny false arbiter between the bound and free and oer the land in hamlets and in towns the multitudes collect tumultuously and throng in arms but tyranny disowns their claim and gathers strength around its trembling thrones blood soon although unwillingly to shed the free cannot forbear the queen of slaves the hoodwinked angel of the blind and dead custom with iron mace points to the graves where her own standard desolately waves over the dust of prophets and of kings many yet stand in her array she paves her path with human hearts and oer it flings the wildering gloom of her immeasurable wings there is a plain beneath the citys wall bounded by misty mountains wide and vast millions there lift at freedoms thrilling call ten thousand standards wide they load the blast which bears one sound of many voices past and startles on his throne their sceptred foe he sits amid his idle pomp aghast and that his power hath passed away doth know why pause the victor swords to seal his overthrow the tyrants guards resistance yet maintain fearless and fierce and hard as beasts of blood they stand a speck amid the peopled plain carnage and ruin have been made their food from infancy ill has become their good and for its hateful sake their will has wove the chains which eat their hearts the multitude surrounding them with words of human love seek from their own decay their stubborn minds to move over the land is felt a sudden pause as night and day those ruthless bands around the watch of love is kept a trance which awes the thoughts of men with hope as when the sound of whirlwind whose fierce blasts the waves and clouds confound dies suddenly the mariner in fear feels silence sink upon his heart thus bound the conquerors pause and oh may freemen neer clasp the relentless knees of dread the murderer if blood be shed tis but a change and choice of bonds from slavery to cowardice a wretched fall uplift thy charmed voice pour on those evil men the love that lies hovering within those spiritsoothing eyes arise my friend farewell as thus he spake from the green earth lightly i did arise as one out of dim dreams that doth awake and looked upon the depth of that reposing lake i saw my countenance reflected there and then my youth fell on me like a wind descending on still waters my thin hair was prematurely gray my face was lined with channels such as suffering leaves behind not age my brow was pale but in my cheek and lips a flush of gnawing fire did find their food and dwelling though mine eyes might speak a subtle mind and strong within a frame thus weak and though their lustre now was spent and faded yet in my hollow looks and withered mien the likeness of a shape for which was braided the brightest woof of genius still was seen one who methought had gone from the worlds scene and left it vacant twas her lovers face it might resemble her it once had been the mirror of her thoughts and still the grace which her minds shadow cast left there a lingering trace what then was i she slumbered with the dead glory and joy and peace had come and gone doth the cloud perish when the beams are fled which steeped its skirts in gold or dark and lone doth it not through the paths of night unknown on outspread wings of its own wind upborne pour rain upon the earth the stars are shown when the cold moon sharpens her silver horn under the sea and make the wide night not forlorn strengthened in heart yet sad that aged man i left with interchange of looks and tears and lingering speech and to the camp began my war oer many a mountainchain which rears its hundred crests aloft my spirit bears my frame oer many a dale and many a moor and gaily now meseems serene earth wears the blosmy springs starbright investiture a vision which aught sad from sadness might allure my powers revived within me and i went as one whom winds waft oer the bending grass through many a vale of that broad continent at night when i reposed fair dreams did pass before my pillow my own cythna was not like a child of death among them ever when i arose from rest a woful mass that gentlest sleep seemed from my life to sever as if the light of youth were not withdrawn for ever aye as i went that maiden who had reared the torch of truth afar of whose high deeds the hermit in his pilgrimage had heard haunted my thoughts ah hope its sickness feeds with whatsoeer it finds or flowers or weeds could she be cythna was that corpse a shade such as selftorturing thought from madness breeds why was this hope not torture yet it made a light around my steps which would not ever fade notes wherewhen edition canto over the utmost hill at length i sped a snowy steep the moon was hanging low over the asian mountains and outspread the plain the city and the camp below skirted the midnight oceans glimmering flow the citys moonlit spires and myriad lamps like stars in a sublunar sky did glow and fires blazed far amid the scattered camps like springs of flame which burst whereer swift earthquake stamps all slept but those in watchful arms who stood and those who sate tending the beacons light and the few sounds from that vast multitude made silence more profound oh what a might of human thought was cradled in that night how many hearts impenetrably veiled beat underneath its shade what secret fight evil and good in woven passions mailed waged through that silent throng a war that never failed and now the power of good held victory so through the labyrinth of many a tent among the silent millions who did lie in innocent sleep exultingly i went the moon had left heaven desert now but lent from eastern morn the first faint lustre showed an armed youth over his spear he bent his downward face a friend i cried aloud and quickly common hopes made freemen understood i sate beside him while the morning beam crept slowly over heaven and talked with him of those immortal hopes a glorious theme which led us forth until the stars grew dim and all the while methought his voice did swim as if it drowned in remembrance were of thoughts which make the moist eyes overbrim at last when daylight gan to fill the air he looked on me and cried in wonder thou art here then suddenly i knew it was the youth in whom its earliest hopes my spirit found but envious tongues had stained his spotless truth and thoughtless pride his love in silence bound and shame and sorrow mine in toils had wound whilst he was innocent and i deluded the truth now came upon me on the ground tears of repenting joy which fast intruded fell fast and oer its peace our mingling spirits brooded thus while with rapid lips and earnest eyes we talked a sound of sweeping conflict spread as from the earth did suddenly arise from every tent roused by that clamour dread our bands outsprung and seized their arms we sped towards the sound our tribes were gathering far those sanguine slaves amid ten thousand dead stabbed in their sleep trampled in treacherous war the gentle hearts whose power their lives had sought to spare like rabid snakes that sting some gentle child who brings them food when winter false and fair allures them forth with its cold smiles so wild they rage among the camp they overbear the patriot hosts confusion then despair descends like night when laon one did cry like a bright ghost from heaven that shout did scare the slaves and widening through the vaulted sky seemed sent from earth to heaven in sign of victory in sudden panic those false murderers fled like insect tribes before the northern gale but swifter still our hosts encompassed their shattered ranks and in a craggy vale where even their fierce despair might nought avail hemmed them around and then revenge and fear made the high virtue of the patriots fail one pointed on his foe the mortal spear i rushed before its point and cried forbear forbear the spear transfixed my arm that was uplifted in swift expostulation and the blood gushed round its point i smiled and oh thou gifted with eloquence which shall not be withstood flow thus i cried in joy thou vital flood until my heart be dry ere thus the cause for which thou wert aught worthy be subdued ah ye are pale ye weep your passions pause tis well ye feel the truth of loves benignant laws soldiers our brethren and our friends are slain ye murdered them i think as they did sleep alas what have ye done the slightest pain which ye might suffer there were eyes to weep but ye have quenched them there were smiles to steep your hearts in balm but they are lost in woe and those whom love did set his watch to keep around your tents truths freedom to bestow ye stabbed as they did sleep but they forgive ye now oh wherefore should ill ever flow from ill and pain still keener pain for ever breed we all are brethren even the slaves who kill for hire are men and to avenge misdeed on the misdoer doth but misery feed with her own broken heart o earth o heaven and thou dread nature which to every deed and all that lives or is to be hath given even as to thee have these done ill and are forgiven join then your hands and hearts and let the past be as a grave which gives not up its dead to evil thoughts a film then overcast my sense with dimness for the wound which bled freshly swift shadows oer mine eyes had shed when i awoke i lay mid friends and foes and earnest countenances on me shed the light of questioning looks whilst one did close my wound with balmiest herbs and soothed me to repose and one whose spear had pierced me leaned beside with quivering lips and humid eyes and all seemed like some brothers on a journey wide gone forth whom now strange meeting did befall in a strange land round one whom they might call their friend their chief their father for assay of peril which had saved them from the thrall of death now suffering thus the vast array of those fraternal bands were reconciled that day lifting the thunder of their acclamation towards the city then the multitude and i among them went in joy a nation made free by love a mighty brotherhood linked by a jealous interchange of good a glorious pageant more magnificent than kingly slaves arrayed in gold and blood when they return from carnage and are sent in triumph bright beneath the populous battlement afar the citywalls were thronged on high and myriads on each giddy turret clung and to each spire far lessening in the sky bright pennons on the idle winds were hung as we approached a shout of joyance sprung at once from all the crowd as if the vast and peopled earth its boundless skies among the sudden clamour of delight had cast when from before its face some general wreck had passed our armies through the citys hundred gates were poured like brooks which to the rocky lair of some deep lake whose silence them awaits throng from the mountains when the storms are there and as we passed through the calm sunny air a thousand flowerinwoven crowns were shed the token flowers of truth and freedom fair and fairest hands bound them on many a head those angels of loves heaven that over all was spread i trod as one tranced in some rapturous vision those bloody bands so lately reconciled were ever as they went by the contrition of anger turned to love from ill beguiled and every one on them more gently smiled because they had done evil the sweet awe of such mild looks made their own hearts grow mild and did with soft attraction ever draw their spirits to the love of freedoms equal law and they and all in one loud symphony my name with liberty commingling lifted the friend and the preserver of the free the parent of this joy and fair eyes gifted with feelings caught from one who had uplifted the light of a great spirit round me shone and all the shapes of this grand scenery shifted like restless clouds before the steadfast sun where was that maid i asked but it was known of none laone was the name her love had chosen for she was nameless and her birth none knew where was laone now the words were frozen within my lips with fear but to subdue such dreadful hope to my great task was due and when at length one brought reply that she tomorrow would appear i then withdrew to judge what need for that great throng might be for now the stars came thick over the twilight sea yet need was none for rest or food to care even though that multitude was passing great since each one for the other did prepare all kindly succour therefore to the gate of the imperial house now desolate i passed and there was found aghast alone the fallen tyrant silently he sate upon the footstool of his golden throne which starred with sunny gems in its own lustre shone alone but for one child who led before him a graceful dance the only living thing of all the crowd which thither to adore him flocked yesterday who solace sought to bring in his abandonment she knew the king had praised her dance of yore and now she wove its circles aye weeping and murmuring mid her sad task of unregarded love that to no smiles it might his speechless sadness move she fled to him and wildly clasped his feet when human steps were heard he moved nor spoke nor changed his hue nor raised his looks to meet the gaze of strangers our loud entrance woke the echoes of the hall which circling broke the calm of its recesses like a tomb its sculptured walls vacantly to the stroke of footfalls answered and the twilights gloom lay like a charnels mist within the radiant dome the little child stood up when we came nigh her lips and cheeks seemed very pale and wan but on her forehead and within her eye lay beauty which makes hearts that feed thereon sick with excess of sweetness on the throne she leaned the king with gathered brow and lips wreathed by long scorn did inly sneer and frown with hue like that when some great painter dips his pencil in the gloom of earthquake and eclipse she stood beside him like a rainbow braided within some storm when scarce its shadows vast from the blue paths of the swift sun have faded a sweet and solemn smile like cythnas cast one moments light which made my heart beat fast oer that childs parted lips a gleam of bliss a shade of vanished days as the tears passed which wrapped it even as with a fathers kiss i pressed those softest eyes in trembling tenderness the sceptred wretch then from that solitude i drew and of his change compassionate with words of sadness soothed his rugged mood but he while pride and fear held deep debate with sullen guile of illdissembled hate glared on me as a toothless snake might glare pity not scorn i felt though desolate the desolator now and unaware the curses which he mocked had caught him by the hair i led him forth from that which now might seem a gorgeous grave through portals sculptured deep with imagery beautiful as dream we went and left the shades which tend on sleep over its unregarded gold to keep their silent watch the child trod faintingly and as she went the tears which she did weep glanced in the starlight wildered seemed she and when i spake for sobs she could not answer me at last the tyrant cried she hungers slave stab her or give her bread it was a tone such as sick fancies in a newmade grave might hear i trembled for the truth was known he with this child had thus been left alone and neither had gone forth for food but he in mingled pride and awe cowered near his throne and she a nursling of captivity knew nought beyond those walls nor what such change might be and he was troubled at a charm withdrawn thus suddenly that sceptres ruled no more that even from gold the dreadful strength was gone which once made all things subject to its power such wonder seized him as if hour by hour the past had come again and the swift fall of one so great and terrible of yore to desolateness in the hearts of all like wonder stirred who saw such awful change befall a mighty crowd such as the wide land pours once in a thousand years now gathered round the fallen tyrant like the rush of showers of hail in spring pattering along the ground their many footsteps fell else came no sound from the wide multitude that lonely man then knew the burden of his change and found concealing in the dust his visage wan refuge from the keen looks which through his bosom ran and he was faint withal i sate beside him upon the earth and took that child so fair from his weak arms that ill might none betide him or her when food was brought to them her share to his averted lips the child did bear but when she saw he had enough she ate and wept the while the lonely mans despair hunger then overcame and of his state forgetful on the dust as in a trance he sate slowly the silence of the multitudes passed as when far is heard in some lone dell the gathering of a wind among the woods and he is fallen they cry he who did dwell like famine or the plague or aught more fell among our homes is fallen the murderer who slaked his thirsting soul as from a well of blood and tears with ruin he is here sunk in a gulf of scorn from which none may him rear then was heard he who judged let him be brought to judgement blood for blood cries from the soil on which his crimes have deep pollution wrought shall othman only unavenged despoil shall they who by the stress of grinding toil wrest from the unwilling earth his luxuries perish for crime while his foul blood may boil or creep within his veins at will arise and to high justice make her chosen sacrifice what do ye seek what fear ye then i cried suddenly starting forth that ye should shed the blood of othman if your hearts are tried in the true love of freedom cease to dread this one poor lonely man beneath heaven spread in purest light above us all through earth maternal earth who doth her sweet smiles shed for all let him go free until the worth of human nature win from these a second birth what call ye justice is there one who neer in secret thought has wished anothers ill are ye all pure let those stand forth who hear and tremble not shall they insult and kill if such they be their mild eyes can they fill with the false anger of the hypocrite alas such were not pure the chastened will of virtue sees that justice is the light of love and not revenge and terror and despite the murmur of the people slowly dying paused as i spake then those who near me were cast gentle looks where the lone man was lying shrouding his head which now that infant fair clasped on her lap in silence through the air sobs were then heard and many kissed my feet in pitys madness and to the despair of him whom late they cursed a solace sweet his very victims brought soft looks and speeches meet then to a home for his repose assigned accompanied by the still throng he went in silence where to soothe his rankling mind some likeness of his ancient state was lent and if his heart could have been innocent as those who pardoned him he might have ended his days in peace but his straight lips were bent men said into a smile which guile portended a sight with which that child like hope with fear was blended twas midnight now the eve of that great day whereon the many nations at whose call the chains of earth like mist melted away decreed to hold a sacred festival a rite to attest the equality of all who live so to their homes to dream or wake all went the sleepless silence did recall laone to my thoughts with hopes that make the flood recede from which their thirst they seek to slake the dawn flowed forth and from its purple fountains i drank those hopes which make the spirit quail as to the plain between the misty mountains and the great city with a countenance pale i went it was a sight which might avail to make men weep exulting tears for whom now first from human power the reverend veil was torn to see earth from her general womb pour forth her swarming sons to a fraternal doom to see far glancing in the misty morning the signs of that innumerable host to hear one sound of many made the warning of earth to heaven from its free children tossed while the eternal hills and the sea lost in wavering light and starring the blue sky the citys myriad spires of gold almost with human joy made mute society its witnesses with men who must hereafter be to see like some vast island from the ocean the altar of the federation rear its pile i the midst a work which the devotion of millions in one night created there sudden as when the moonrise makes appear strange clouds in the east a marble pyramid distinct with steps that mighty shape did wear the light of genius its still shadow hid far ships to know its height the morning mists forbid to hear the restless multitudes for ever around the base of that great altar flow as on some mountainislet burst and shiver atlantic waves and solemnly and slow as the wind bore that tumult to and fro to feel the dreamlike music which did swim like beams through floating clouds on waves below falling in pauses from that altar dim as silversounding tongues breathed an aerial hymn to hear to see to live was on that morn lethean joy so that all those assembled cast off their memories of the past outworn two only bosoms with their own life trembled and mine was one and we had both dissembled so with a beating heart i went and one who having much covets yet more resembled a lost and dear possession which not won he walks in lonely gloom beneath the noonday sun to the great pyramid i came its stair with female choirs was thronged the loveliest among the free grouped with its sculptures rare as i approached the mornings golden mist which now the wonderstricken breezes kissed with their cold lips fled and the summit shone like athos seen from samothracia dressed in earliest light by vintagers and one sate there a female shape upon an ivory throne a form most like the imagined habitant of silver exhalations sprung from dawn by winds which feed on sunrise woven to enchant the faiths of men all mortal eyes were drawn as famished mariners through strange seas gone gaze on a burning watchtower by the light of those divinest lineaments alone with thoughts which none could share from that fair sight i turned in sickness for a veil shrouded her countenance bright and neither did i hear the acclamations which from brief silence bursting filled the air with her strange name and mine from all the nations which we they said in strength had gathered there from the sleep of bondage nor the vision fair of that bright pageantry beheld but blind and silent as a breathing corpse did fare leaning upon my friend till like a wind to fevered cheeks a voice flowed oer my troubled mind like music of some minstrel heavenly gifted to one whom fiends enthral this voice to me scarce did i wish her veil to be uplifted i was so calm and joyous i could see the platform where we stood the statues three which kept their marble watch on that high shrine the multitudes the mountains and the sea as when eclipse hath passed things sudden shine to mens astonished eyes most clear and crystalline at first laone spoke most tremulously but soon her voice the calmness which it shed gathered and thou art whom i sought to see and thou art our first votary here she said i had a dear friend once but he is dead and of all those on the wide earth who breathe thou dost resemble him alone i spread this veil between us two that thou beneath shouldst image one who may have been long lost in death for this wilt thou not henceforth pardon me yes but those joys which silence well requite forbid reply why men have chosen me to be the priestess of this holiest rite i scarcely know but that the floods of light which flow over the world have borne me hither to meet thee long most dear and now unite thine hand with mine and may all comfort wither from both the hearts whose pulse in joy now beat together if our own will as others law we bind if the foul worship trampled here we fear if as ourselves we cease to love our kind she paused and pointed upwards sculptured there three shapes around her ivory throne appear one was a giant like a child asleep on a loose rock whose grasp crushed as it were in dream sceptres and crowns and one did keep its watchful eyes in doubt whether to smile or weep a woman sitting on the sculptured disk of the broad earth and feeding from one breast a human babe and a young basilisk her looks were sweet as heavens when loveliest in autumn eves the third image was dressed in white wings swift as clouds in winter skies beneath his feet mongst ghastliest forms repressed lay faith an obscene worm who sought to rise while calmly on the sun he turned his diamond eyes beside that image then i sate while she stood mid the throngs which ever ebbed and flowed like light amid the shadows of the sea cast from one cloudless star and on the crowd that touch which none who feels forgets bestowed and whilst the sun returned the steadfast gaze of the great image as oer heaven it glode that rite had place it ceased when sunsets blaze burned oer the isles all stood in joy and deep amaze when in the silence of all spirits there laones voice was felt and through the air her thrilling gestures spoke most eloquently fair calm art thou as yon sunset swift and strong as newfledged eagles beautiful and young that float among the blinding beams of morning and underneath thy feet writhe faith and folly custom and hell and mortal melancholy hark the earth starts to hear the mighty warning of thy voice sublime and holy its free spirits here assembled see thee feel thee know thee now to thy voice their hearts have trembled like ten thousand clouds which flow with one wide wind as it flies wisdom thy irresistible children rise to hail thee and the elements they chain and their own will to swell the glory of thy train o spirit vast and deep as night and heaven mother and soul of all to which is given the light of life the loveliness of being lo thou dost reascend the human heart thy throne of power almighty as thou wert in dreams of poets old grown pale by seeing the shade of thee now millions start to feel thy lightnings through them burning nature or god or love or pleasure or sympathy the sad tears turning to mutual smiles a drainless treasure descends amidst us scorn and hate revenge and selfishness are desolate a hundred nations swear that there shall be pity and peace and love among the good and free eldest of things divine equality wisdom and love are but the slaves of thee the angels of thy sway who pour around thee treasures from all the cells of human thought and from the stars and from the ocean brought and the last living heart whose beatings bound thee the powerful and the wise had sought thy coming thou in light descending oer the wide land which is thine own like the spring whose breath is blending all blasts of fragrance into one comest upon the paths of men earth bares her general bosom to thy ken and all her children here in glory meet to feed upon thy smiles and clasp thy sacred feet my brethren we are free the plains and mountains the gray seashore the forests and the fountains are haunts of happiest dwellers man and woman their common bondage burst may freely borrow from lawless love a solace for their sorrow for oft we still must weep since we are human a stormy nights serenest morrow whose showers are pitys gentle tears whose clouds are smiles of those that die like infants without hopes or fears and whose beams are joys that lie in blended hearts now holds dominion the dawn of mind which upwards on a pinion borne swift as sunrise far illumines space and clasps this barren world in its own bright embrace my brethren we are free the fruits are glowing beneath the stars and the nightwinds are flowing oer the ripe corn the birds and beasts are dreaming never again may blood of bird or beast stain with its venomous stream a human feast to the pure skies in accusation steaming avenging poisons shall have ceased to feed disease and fear and madness the dwellers of the earth and air shall throng around our steps in gladness seeking their food or refuge there our toil from thought all glorious forms shall cull to make this earth our home more beautiful and science and her sister poesy shall clothe in light the fields and cities of the free victory victory to the prostrate nations bear witness night and ye mute constellations who gaze on us from your crystalline cars thoughts have gone forth whose powers can sleep no more victory victory earths remotest shore regions which groan beneath the antarctic stars the green lands cradled in the roar of western waves and wildernesses peopled and vast which skirt the oceans where morning dyes her golden tresses shall soon partake our high emotions kings shall turn pale almighty fear the fiendgod when our charmed name he hear shall fade like shadow from his thousand fanes while truth with joy enthroned oer his lost empire reigns ere she had ceased the mists of night entwining their dim woof floated oer the infinite throng she like a spirit through the darkness shining in tones whose sweetness silence did prolong as if to lingering winds they did belong poured forth her inmost soul a passionate speech with wild and thrilling pauses woven among which whoso heard was mute for it could teach to rapture like her own all listening hearts to reach her voice was as a mountain stream which sweeps the withered leaves of autumn to the lake and in some deep and narrow bay then sleeps in the shadow of the shores as dead leaves wake under the wave in flowers and herbs which make those green depths beautiful when skies are blue the multitude so moveless did partake such living change and kindling murmurs flew as oer that speechless calm delight and wonder grew over the plain the throngs were scattered then in groups around the fires which from the sea even to the gorge of the first mountainglen blazed wide and far the banquet of the free was spread beneath many a dark cypresstree beneath whose spires which swayed in the red flame reclining as they ate of liberty and hope and justice and laones name earths children did a woof of happy converse frame their feast was such as earth the general mother pours from her fairest bosom when she smiles in the embrace of autumn to each other as when some parent fondly reconciles her warring children she their wrath beguiles with her own sustenance they relenting weep such was this festival which from their isles and continents and winds and oceans deep all shapes might throng to share that fly or walk or creep might share in peace and innocence for gore or poison none this festal did pollute but piled on high an overflowing store of pomegranates and citrons fairest fruit melons and dates and figs and many a root sweet and sustaining and bright grapes ere yet accursed fire their mild juice could transmute into a mortal bane and brown corn set in baskets with pure streams their thirsting lips they wet laone had descended from the shrine and every deepest look and holiest mind fed on her form though now those tones divine were silent as she passed she did unwind her veil as with the crowds of her own kind she mixed some impulse made my heart refrain from seeking her that night so i reclined amidst a group where on the utmost plain a festal watchfire burned beside the dusky main and joyous was our feast pathetic talk and wit and harmony of choral strains while far orion oer the waves did walk that flow among the isles held us in chains of sweet captivity which none disdains who feels but when his zone grew dim in mist which clothes the oceans bosom oer the plains the multitudes went homeward to their rest which that delightful day with its own shadow blessed notes flamelight edition canto beside the dimness of the glimmering sea weaving swift language from impassioned themes with that dear friend i lingered who to me so late had been restored beneath the gleams of the silver stars and ever in soft dreams of future love and peace sweet converse lapped our willing fancies till the pallid beams of the last watchfire fell and darkness wrapped the waves and each bright chain of floating fire was snapped and till we came even to the citys wall and the great gate then none knew whence or why disquiet on the multitudes did fall and first one pale and breathless passed us by and stared and spoke not then with piercing cry a troop of wildeyed women by the shrieks of their own terror driven tumultuously hither and thither hurrying with pale cheeks each one from fear unknown a sudden refuge seeks then rallying cries of treason and of danger resounded and they come to arms to arms the tyrant is amongst us and the stranger comes to enslave us in his name to arms in vain for panic the pale fiend who charms strength to forswear her right those millions swept like waves before the tempest these alarms came to me as to know their cause i lept on the gates turret and in rage and grief and scorn i wept for to the north i saw the town on fire and its red light made morning pallid now which burst over wide asia louder higher the yells of victory and the screams of woe i heard approach and saw the throng below stream through the gates like foamwrought waterfalls fed from a thousand storms the fearful glow of bombs flares overhead at intervals the red artillerys bolt mangling among them falls and now the horsemen come and all was done swifter than i have spoken i beheld their red swords flash in the unrisen sun i rushed among the rout to have repelled that miserable flight one moment quelled by voice and looks and eloquent despair as if reproach from their own hearts withheld their steps they stood but soon came pouring there new multitudes and did those rallied bands oerbear i strove as drifted on some cataract by irresistible streams some wretch might strive who hears its fatal roar the files compact whelmed me and from the gate availed to drive with quickening impulse as each bolt did rive their ranks with bloodier chasm into the plain disgorged at length the dead and the alive in one dread mass were parted and the stain of blood from mortal steel fell oer the fields like rain for now the despots bloodhounds with their prey unarmed and unaware were gorging deep their gluttony of death the loose array of horsemen oer the wide fields murdering sweep and with loud laughter for their tyrant reap a harvest sown with other hopes the while far overhead ships from propontis keep a killing rain of fire when the waves smile as sudden earthquakes light many a volcanoisle thus sudden unexpected feast was spread for the carrionfowls of heaven i saw the sight i moved i lived as oer the heaps of dead whose stony eyes glared in the morning light i trod to me there came no thought of flight but with loud cries of scorn which whoso heard that dreaded death felt in his veins the might of virtuous shame return the crowd i stirred and desperations hope in many hearts recurred a band of brothers gathering round me made although unarmed a steadfast front and still retreating with stern looks beneath the shade of gathered eyebrows did the victors fill with doubt even in success deliberate will inspired our growing troop not overthrown it gained the shelter of a grassy hill and ever still our comrades were hewn down and their defenceless limbs beneath our footsteps strown immovably we stood in joy i found beside me then firm as a giant pine among the mountainvapours driven around the old man whom i loved his eyes divine with a mild look of courage answered mine and my young friend was near and ardently his hand grasped mine a moment now the line of war extended to our rallying cry as myriads flocked in love and brotherhood to die for ever while the sun was climbing heaven the horseman hewed our unarmed myriads down safely though when by thirst of carnage driven too near those slaves were swiftly overthrown by hundreds leaping on them flesh and bone soon made our ghastly ramparts then the shaft of the artillery from the sea was thrown more fast and fiery and the conquerors laughed in pride to hear the wind our screams of torment waft for on one side alone the hill gave shelter so vast that phalanx of unconquered men and there the living in the blood did welter of the dead and dying which in that green glen like stifled torrents made a plashy fen under the feet thus was the butchery waged while the sun clomb heavens eastern steep but when it gan to sink a fiercer combat raged for in more doubtful strife the armies were engaged within a cave upon the hill were found a bundle of rude pikes the instrument of those who war but on their native ground for natural rights a shout of joyance sent even from our hearts the wide air pierced and rent as those few arms the bravest and the best seized and each sixth thus armed did now present a line which covered and sustained the rest a confident phalanx which the foes on every side invest that onset turned the foes to flight almost but soon they saw their present strength and knew that coming night would to our resolute host bring victory so dismounting close they drew their glittering files and then the combat grew unequal but most horrible and ever our myriads whom the swift bolt overthrew or the red sword failed like a mountain river which rushes forth in foam to sink in sands for ever sorrow and shame to see with their own kind our human brethren mix like beasts of blood to mutual ruin armed by one behind who sits and scoffs that friend so mild and good who like its shadow near my youth had stood was stabbed my old preservers hoary hair with the flesh clinging to its roots was strewed under my feet i lost all sense or care and like the rest i grew desperate and unaware the battle became ghastlier in the midst i paused and saw how ugly and how fell o hate thou art even when thy life thou sheddst for love the ground in many a little dell was broken up and down whose steeps befell alternate victory and defeat and there the combatants with rage most horrible strove and their eyes started with cracking stare and impotent their tongues they lolled into the air flaccid and foamy like a mad dogs hanging want and moonmadness and the pests swift bane when its shafts smite while yet its bow is twanging have each their mark and sign some ghastly stain and this was thine o war of hate and pain thou loathed slave i saw all shapes of death and ministered to many oer the plain while carnage in the sunbeams warmth did seethe till twilight oer the east wove her serenest wreath the few who yet survived resolute and firm around me fought at the decline of day winding above the mountains snowy term new banners shone they quivered in the ray of the suns unseen orb ere night the array of fresh troops hemmed us in of those brave bands i soon survived alone and now i lay vanquished and faint the grasp of bloody hands i felt and saw on high the glare of falling brands when on my foes a sudden terror came and they fled scattering lo with reinless speed a black tartarian horse of giant frame comes trampling over the dead the living bleed beneath the hoofs of that tremendous steed on which like to an angel robed in white sate one waving a sword the hosts recede and fly as through their ranks with awful might sweeps in the shadow of eve that phantom swift and bright and its path made a solitude i rose and marked its coming it relaxed its course as it approached me and the wind that flows through night bore accents to mine ear whose force might create smiles in death the tartar horse paused and i saw the shape its might which swayed and heard her musical pants like the sweet source of waters in the desert as she said mount with me laon now i rapidly obeyed then away away she cried and stretched her sword as twere a scourge over the coursers head and lightly shook the reins we spake no word but like the vapour of the tempest fled over the plain her dark hair was dispread like the pines locks upon the lingering blast over mine eyes its shadowy strings it spread fitfully and the hills and streams fled fast as oer their glimmering forms the steeds broad shadow passed and his hoofs ground the rocks to fire and dust his strong sides made the torrents rise in spray and turbulence as of a whirlwinds gust surrounded us and still away away through the desert night we sped while she alway gazed on a mountain which we neared whose crest crowned with a marble ruin in the ray of the obscure stars gleamed its rugged breast the steed strained up and then his impulse did arrest a rocky hill which overhung the ocean from that lone ruin when the steed that panted paused might be heard the murmur of the motion of waters as in spots for ever haunted by the choicest winds of heaven which are enchanted to music by the wand of solitude that wizard wild and the far tents implanted upon the plain be seen by those who stood thence marking the dark shore of oceans curved flood one moment these were heard and seen another passed and the two who stood beneath that night each only heard or saw or felt the other as from the lofty steed she did alight cythna for from the eyes whose deepest light of love and sadness made my lips feel pale with influence strange of mournfullest delight my own sweet cythna looked with joy did quail and felt her strength in tears of human weakness fail and for a space in my embrace she rested her head on my unquiet heart reposing while my faint arms her languid frame invested at length she looked on me and half unclosing her tremulous lips said friend thy bands were losing the battle as i stood before the king in bonds i burst them then and swiftly choosing the time did seize a tartars sword and spring upon his horse and swift as on the whirlwinds wing have thou and i been borne beyond pursuer and we are here then turning to the steed she pressed the white moon on his front with pure and roselike lips and many a fragrant weed from the green ruin plucked that he might feed but i to a stone seat that maiden led and kissing her fair eyes said thou hast need of rest and i heaped up the coursers bed in a green mossy nook with mountain flowers dispread within that ruin where a shattered portal looks to the eastern stars abandoned now by man to be the home of things immortal memories like awful ghosts which come and go and must inherit all he builds below when he is gone a hall stood oer whose roof fair clinging weeds with ivy pale did grow clasping its gray rents with a verdurous woof a hanging dome of leaves a canopy moonproof the autumnal winds as if spellbound had made a natural couch of leaves in that recess which seasons none disturbed but in the shade of flowering parasites did spring love to dress with their sweet blooms the wintry loneliness of those dead leaves shedding their stars wheneer the wandering wind her nurslings might caress whose intertwining fingers ever there made music wild and soft that filled the listening air we know not where we go or what sweet dream may pilot us through caverns strange and fair of far and pathless passion while the stream of life our bark doth on its whirlpools bear spreading swift wings as sails to the dim air nor should we seek to know so the devotion of love and gentle thoughts be heard still there louder and louder from the utmost ocean of universal life attuning its commotion to the pure all things are pure oblivion wrapped our spirits and the fearful overthrow of public hope was from our being snapped though linked years had bound it there for now a power a thirst a knowledge which below all thoughts like light beyond the atmosphere clothing its clouds with grace doth ever flow came on us as we sate in silence there beneath the golden stars of the clear azure air in silence which doth follow talk that causes the baffled heart to speak with sighs and tears when wildering passion swalloweth up the pauses of inexpressive speech the youthful years which we together passed their hopes and fears the blood itself which ran within our frames that likeness of the features which endears the thoughts expressed by them our very names and all the winged hours which speechless memory claims had found a voice and ere that voice did pass the night grew damp and dim and through a rent of the ruin where we sate from the morass a wandering meteor by some wild wind sent hung high in the green dome to which it lent a faint and pallid lustre while the song of blasts in which its blue hair quivering bent strewed strangest sounds the moving leaves among a wondrous light the sound as of a spirits tongue the meteor showed the leaves on which we sate and cythnas glowing arms and the thick ties of her soft hair which bent with gathered weight my neck near hers her dark and deepening eyes which as twin phantoms of one star that lies oer a dim well move though the star reposes swam in our mute and liquid ecstasies her marble brow and eager lips like roses with their own fragrance pale which spring but half uncloses the meteor to its far morass returned the beating of our veins one interval made still and then i felt the blood that burned within her frame mingle with mine and fall around my heart like fire and over all a mist was spread the sickness of a deep and speechless swoon of joy as might befall two disunited spirits when they leap in union from this earths obscure and fading sleep was it one moment that confounded thus all thought all sense all feeling into one unutterable power which shielded us even from our own cold looks when we had gone into a wide and wild oblivion of tumult and of tenderness or now had ages such as make the moon and sun the seasons and mankind their changes know left fear and time unfelt by us alone below i know not what are kisses whose fire clasps the failing heart in languishment or limb twined within limb or the quick dying gasps of the life meeting when the faint eyes swim through tears of a wide mist boundless and dim in one caress what is the strong control which leads the heart that dizzy steep to climb where far over the world those vapours roll which blend two restless frames in one reposing soul it is the shadow which doth float unseen but not unfelt oer blind mortality whose divine darkness fled not from that green and lone recess where lapped in peace did lie our linked frames till from the changing sky that night and still another day had fled and then i saw and felt the moon was high and clouds as of a coming storm were spread under its orb loud winds were gathering overhead cythnas sweet lips seemed lurid in the moon her fairest limbs with the night wind were chill and her dark tresses were all loosely strewn oer her pale bosom all within was still and the sweet peace of joy did almost fill the depth of her unfathomable look and we sate calmly though that rocky hill the waves contending in its caverns strook for they foreknew the storm and the gray ruin shook there we unheeding sate in the communion of interchanged vows which with a rite of faith most sweet and sacred stamped our union few were the living hearts which could unite like ours or celebrate a bridal night with such close sympathies for they had sprung from linked youth and from the gentle might of earliest love delayed and cherished long which common hopes and fears made like a tempest strong and such is natures law divine that those who grow together cannot choose but love if faith or custom do not interpose or common slavery mar what else might move all gentlest thoughts as in the sacred grove which shades the springs of ethiopian nile that living tree which if the arrowy dove strike with her shadow shrinks in fear awhile but its own kindred leaves clasps while the sunbeams smile and clings to them when darkness may dissever the close caresses of all duller plants which bloom on the wide earth thus we for ever were linked for love had nursed us in the haunts where knowledge from its secret source enchants young hearts with the fresh music of its springing ere yet its gathered flood feeds human wants as the great nile feeds egypt ever flinging light on the woven boughs which oer its waves are swinging the tones of cythnas voice like echoes were of those far murmuring streams they rose and fell mixed with mine own in the tempestuous air and so we sate until our talk befell of the late ruin swift and horrible and how those seeds of hope might yet be sown whose fruit is evils mortal poison well for us this ruin made a watchtower lone but cythnas eyes looked faint and now two days were gone since she had food therefore i did awaken the tartar steed who from his ebon mane soon as the clinging slumbers he had shaken bent his thin head to seek the brazen rein following me obediently with pain of heart so deep and dread that one caress when lips and heart refuse to part again till they have told their fill could scarce express the anguish of her mute and fearful tenderness cythna beheld me part as i bestrode that willing steed the tempest and the night which gave my path its safety as i rode down the ravine of rocks did soon unite the darkness and the tumult of their might borne on all winds far through the streaming rain floating at intervals the garments white of cythna gleamed and her voice once again came to me on the gust and soon i reached the plain i dreaded not the tempest nor did he who bore me but his eyeballs wide and red turned on the lightnings cleft exultingly and when the earth beneath his tameless tread shook with the sullen thunder he would spread his nostrils to the blast and joyously mock the fierce peal with neighings thus we sped oer the lit plain and soon i could descry where death and fire had gorged the spoil of victory there was a desolate village in a wood whose bloominwoven leaves now scattering fed the hungry storm it was a place of blood a heap of hearthless walls the flames were dead within those dwellings now the life had fled from all those corpses now but the wide sky flooded with lightning was ribbed overhead by the black rafters and around did lie women and babes and men slaughtered confusedly beside the fountain in the marketplace dismounting i beheld those corpses stare with horny eyes upon each others face and on the earth and on the vacant air and upon me close to the waters where i stooped to slake my thirst i shrank to taste for the salt bitterness of blood was there but tied the steed beside and sought in haste if any yet survived amid that ghastly waste no living thing was there beside one woman whom i found wandering in the streets and she was withered from a likeness of aught human into a fiend by some strange misery soon as she heard my steps she leaped on me and glued her burning lips to mine and laughed with a loud long and frantic laugh of glee and cried now mortal thou hast deeply quaffed the plagues blue kisses soon millions shall pledge the draught my name is pestilence this bosom dry once fed two babes a sister and a brother when i came home one in the blood did lie of three deathwounds the flames had ate the other since then i have no longer been a mother but i am pestilence hither and thither i flit about that i may slay and smother all lips which i have kissed must surely wither but deaths if thou art he well go to work together what seekst thou here the moonlight comes in flashes the dew is rising dankly from the dell twill moisten her and thou shalt see the gashes in my sweet boy now full of worms but tell first what thou seekst i seek for food tis well thou shalt have food famine my paramour waits for us at the feast cruel and fell is famine but he drives not from his door those whom these lips have kissed alone no more no more as thus she spake she grasped me with the strength of madness and by many a ruined hearth she led and over many a corpse at length we came to a lone hut where on the earth which made its floor she in her ghastly mirth gathering from all those homes now desolate had piled three heaps of loaves making a dearth among the dead round which she set in state a ring of cold stiff babes silent and stark they sate she leaped upon a pile and lifted high her mad looks to the lightning and cried eat share the great feast tomorrow we must die and then she spurned the loaves with her pale feet towards her bloodless guests that sight to meet mine eyes and my heart ached and but that she who loved me did with absent looks defeat despair i might have raved in sympathy but now i took the food that woman offered me and vainly having with her madness striven if i might win her to return with me departed in the eastern beams of heaven the lightning now grew pallid rapidly as by the shore of the tempestuous sea the dark steed bore me and the mountain gray soon echoed to his hoofs and i could see cythna among the rocks where she alway had sate with anxious eyes fixed on the lingering day and joy was ours to meet she was most pale famished and wet and weary so i cast my arms around her lest her steps should fail as to our home we went and thus embraced her full heart seemed a deeper joy to taste than eer the prosperous know the steed behind trod peacefully along the mountain waste we reached our home ere morning could unbind nights latest veil and on our bridalcouch reclined her chilled heart having cherished in my bosom and sweetest kisses past we two did share our peaceful meal as an autumnal blossom which spreads its shrunk leaves in the sunny air after cold showers like rainbows woven there thus in her lips and cheeks the vital spirit mantled and in her eyes an atmosphere of health and hope and sorrow languished near it and fear and all that dark despondence doth inherit notes isle bradley who cps mariannes dream st see note at end canto so we sate joyous as the morning ray which fed upon the wrecks of night and storm now lingering on the winds light airs did play among the dewy weeds the sun was warm and we sate linked in the inwoven charm of converse and caresses sweet and deep speechless caresses talk that might disarm time though he wield the darts of death and sleep and those thrice mortal barbs in his own poison steep i told her of my sufferings and my madness and how awakened from that dreamy mood by libertys uprise the strength of gladness came to my spirit in my solitude and all that now i was while tears pursued each other down her fair and listening cheek fast as the thoughts which fed them like a flood from sunbright dales and when i ceased to speak her accents soft and sweet the pausing air did wake she told me a strange tale of strange endurance like broken memories of many a heart woven into one to which no firm assurance so wild were they could her own faith impart she said that not a tear did dare to start from the swoln brain and that her thoughts were firm when from all mortal hope she did depart borne by those slaves across the oceans term and that she reached the port without one fear infirm one was she among many there the thralls of the cold tyrants cruel lust and they laughed mournfully in those polluted halls but she was calm and sad musing alway on loftiest enterprise till on a day the tyrant heard her singing to her lute a wild and sad and spiritthrilling lay like winds that die in wastes one moment mute the evil thoughts it made which did his breast pollute even when he saw her wondrous loveliness one moment to great natures sacred power he bent and was no longer passionless but when he bade her to his secret bower be borne a loveless victim and she tore her locks in agony and her words of flame and mightier looks availed not then he bore again his load of slavery and became a king a heartless beast a pageant and a name she told me what a loathsome agony is that when selfishness mocks loves delight foul as in dreams most fearful imagery to dally with the mowing dead that night all torture fear or horror made seem light which the soul dreams or knows and when the day shone on her awful frenzy from the sight where like a spirit in fleshly chains she lay struggling aghast and pale the tyrant fled away her madness was a beam of light a power which dawned through the rent soul and words it gave gestures and looks such as in whirlwinds bore which might not be withstood whence none could save all who approached their sphere like some calm wave vexed into whirlpools by the chasms beneath and sympathy made each attendant slave fearless and free and they began to breathe deep curses like the voice of flames far underneath the king felt pale upon his noonday throne at night two slaves he to her chamber sent one was a green and wrinkled eunuch grown from human shape into an instrument of all things ill distorted bowed and bent the other was a wretch from infancy made dumb by poison who nought knew or meant but to obey from the fire isles came he a diver lean and strong of omans coral sea they bore her to a bark and the swift stroke of silent rowers clove the blue moonlight seas until upon their path the morning broke they anchored then where be there calm or breeze the gloomiest of the drear symplegades shakes with the sleepless surge the ethiop there wound his long arms around her and with knees like iron clasped her feet and plunged with her among the closing waves out of the boundless air swift as an eagle stooping from the plain of morning light into some shadowy wood he plunged through the green silence of the main through many a cavern which the eternal flood had scooped as dark lairs for its monster brood and among mighty shapes which fled in wonder and among mightier shadows which pursued his heels he wound until the dark rocks under he touched a golden chain a sound arose like thunder a stunning clang of massive bolts redoubling beneath the deep a burst of waters driven as from the roots of the sea raging and bubbling and in that roof of crags a space was riven through which there shone the emerald beams of heaven shot through the lines of many waves inwoven like sunlight through acacia woods at even through which his way the diver having cloven passed like a spark sent up out of a burning oven and then she said he laid me in a cave above the waters by that chasm of sea a fountain round and vast in which the wave imprisoned boiled and leaped perpetually down which one moment resting he did flee winning the adverse depth that spacious cell like an hupaithric temple wide and high whose aery dome is inaccessible was pierced with one round cleft through which the sunbeams fell below the fountains brink was richly paven with the deeps wealth coral and pearl and sand like spangling gold and purple shells engraven with mystic legends by no mortal hand left there when thronging to the moons command the gathering waves rent the hesperian gate of mountains and on such bright floor did stand columns and shapes like statues and the state of kingless thrones which earth did in her heart create the fiend of madness which had made its prey of my poor heart was lulled to sleep awhile there was an interval of many a day and a seaeagle brought me food the while whose nest was built in that untrodden isle and who to be the gaoler had been taught of that strange dungeon as a friend whose smile like light and rest at morn and even is sought that wild bird was to me till madness misery brought the misery of a madness slow and creeping which made the earth seem fire the sea seem air and the white clouds of noon which oft were sleeping in the blue heaven so beautiful and fair like hosts of ghastly shadows hovering there and the seaeagle looked a fiend who bore thy mangled limbs for food thus all things were transformed into the agony which i wore even as a poisoned robe around my bosoms core again i knew the day and night fast fleeing the eagle and the fountain and the air another frenzy came there seemed a being within me a strange load my heart did bear as if some living thing had made its lair even in the fountains of my life a long and wondrous vision wrought from my despair then grew like sweet reality among dim visionary woes an unreposing throng methought i was about to be a mother month after month went by and still i dreamed that we should soon be all to one another i and my child and still new pulses seemed to beat beside my heart and still i deemed there was a babe within and when the rain of winter through the rifted cavern streamed methought after a lapse of lingering pain i saw that lovely shape which near my heart had lain it was a babe beautiful from its birth it was like thee dear love its eyes were thine its brow its lips and so upon the earth it laid its fingers as now rest on mine thine own beloved twas a dream divine even to remember how it fled how swift how utterly might make the heart repine though twas a dream then cythna did uplift her looks on mine as if some doubt she sought to shift a doubt which would not flee a tenderness of questioning grief a source of thronging tears which having passed as one whom sobs oppress she spoke yes in the wilderness of years her memory aye like a green home appears she sucked her fill even at this breast sweet love for many months i had no mortal fears methought i felt her lips and breath approve it was a human thing which to my bosom clove i watched the dawn of her first smiles and soon when zenith stars were trembling on the wave or when the beams of the invisible moon or sun from many a prism within the cave their gemborn shadows to the water gave her looks would hunt them and with outspread hand from the swift lights which might that fountain pave she would mark one and laugh when that command slighting it lingered there and could not understand methought her looks began to talk with me and no articulate sounds but something sweet her lips would frame so sweet it could not be that it was meaningless her touch would meet mine and our pulses calmly flow and beat in response while we slept and on a day when i was happiest in that strange retreat with heaps of golden shells we two did play both infants weaving wings for times perpetual way ere night methought her waning eyes were grown weary with joy and tired with our delight we on the earth like sister twins lay down on one fair mothers bosom from that night she fled like those illusions clear and bright which dwell in lakes when the red moon on high pause ere it wakens tempest and her flight though twas the death of brainless fantasy yet smote my lonesome heart more than all misery it seemed that in the dreary night the diver who brought me thither came again and bore my child away i saw the waters quiver when he so swiftly sunk as once before then morning came it shone even as of yore but i was changed the very life was gone out of my heart i wasted more and more day after day and sitting there alone vexed the inconstant waves with my perpetual moan i was no longer mad and yet methought my breasts were swoln and changed in every vein the blood stood still one moment while that thought was passing with a gush of sickening pain it ebbed even to its withered springs again when my wan eyes in stern resolve i turned from that most strange delusion which would fain have waked the dream for which my spirit yearned with more than human love then left it unreturned so now my reason was restored to me i struggled with that dream which like a beast most fierce and beauteous in my memory had made its lair and on my heart did feast but all that cave and all its shapes possessed by thoughts which could not fade renewed each one some smile some look some gesture which had blessed me heretofore i sitting there alone vexed the inconstant waves with my perpetual moan time passed i know not whether months or years for day nor night nor change of seasons made its note but thoughts and unavailing tears and i became at last even as a shade a smoke a cloud on which the winds have preyed till it be thin as air until one even a nautilus upon the fountain played spreading his azure sail where breath of heaven descended not among the waves and whirlpools driven and when the eagle came that lovely thing oaring with rosy feet its silver boat fled near me as for shelter on slow wing the eagle hovering oer his prey did float but when he saw that i with fear did note his purpose proffering my own food to him the eager plumes subsided on his throat he came where that bright child of sea did swim and oer it cast in peace his shadow broad and dim this wakened me it gave me human strength and hope i know not whence or wherefore rose but i resumed my ancient powers at length my spirit felt again like one of those like thine whose fate it is to make the woes of humankind their prey what was this cave its deep foundation no firm purpose knows immutable resistless strong to save like mind while yet it mocks the alldevouring grave and where was laon might my heart be dead while that far dearer heart could move and be or whilst over the earth the pall was spread which i had sworn to rend i might be free could i but win that friendly bird to me to bring me ropes and long in vain i sought by intercourse of mutual imagery of objects if such aid he could be taught but fruit and flowers and boughs yet never ropes he brought we live in our own world and mine was made from glorious fantasies of hope departed aye we are darkened with their floating shade or cast a lustre on them time imparted such power to me i became fearlesshearted my eye and voice grew firm calm was my mind and piercing like the morn now it has darted its lustre on all hidden things behind yon dim and fading clouds which load the weary wind my mind became the book through which i grew wise in all human wisdom and its cave which like a mine i rifled through and through to me the keeping of its secrets gave one mind the type of all the moveless wave whose calm reflects all moving things that are necessity and love and life the grave and sympathy fountains of hope and fear justice and truth and time and the worlds natural sphere and on the sand would i make signs to range these woofs as they were woven of my thought clear elemental shapes whose smallest change a subtler language within language wrought the key of truths which once were dimly taught in old crotona and sweet melodies of love in that lorn solitude i caught from mine own voice in dream when thy dear eyes shone through my sleep and did that utterance harmonize thy songs were winds whereon i fled at will as in a winged chariot oer the plain of crystal youth and thou wert there to fill my heart with joy and there we sate again on the gray margin of the glimmering main happy as then but wiser far for we smiled on the flowery grave in which were lain fear faith and slavery and mankind was free equal and pure and wise in wisdoms prophecy for to my will my fancies were as slaves to do their sweet and subtile ministries and oft from that bright fountains shadowy waves they would make human throngs gather and rise to combat with my overflowing eyes and voice made deep with passion thus i grew familiar with the shock and the surprise and war of earthly minds from which i drew the power which has been mine to frame their thoughts anew and thus my prison was the populous earth where i saw even as misery dreams of morn before the east has given its glory birth religions pomp made desolate by the scorn of wisdoms faintest smile and thrones uptorn and dwellings of mild people interspersed with undivided fields of ripening corn and love made free a hope which we have nursed even with our blood and tears until its glory burst all is not lost there is some recompense for hope whose fountain can be thus profound even throned evils splendid impotence girt by its hell of power the secret sound of hymns to truth and freedom the dread bound of life and death passed fearlessly and well dungeons wherein the high resolve is found racks which degraded womans greatness tell and what may else be good and irresistible such are the thoughts which like the fires that flare in stormencompassed isles we cherish yet in this dark ruin such were mine even there as in its sleep some odorous violet while yet its leaves with nightly dews are wet breathes in prophetic dreams of days uprise or as ere scythian frost in fear has met springs messengers descending from the skies the buds foreknow their life this hope must ever rise so years had passed when sudden earthquake rent the depth of ocean and the cavern cracked with sound as if the worlds wide continent had fallen in universal ruin wracked and through the cleft streamed in one cataract the stifling waters when i woke the flood whose banded waves that crystal cave had sacked was ebbing round me and my bright abode before me yawned a chasm desert and bare and broad above me was the sky beneath the sea i stood upon a point of shattered stone and heard loose rocks rushing tumultuously with splash and shock into the deep anon all ceased and there was silence wide and lone i felt that i was free the oceanspray quivered beneath my feet the broad heaven shone around and in my hair the winds did play lingering as they pursued their unimpeded way my spirit moved upon the sea like wind which round some thymy cape will lag and hover though it can wake the still cloud and unbind the strength of tempest day was almost over when through the fading light i could discover a ship approaching its white sails were fed with the north wind its moving shade did cover the twilight deep the mariners in dread cast anchor when they saw new rocks around them spread and when they saw one sitting on a crag they sent a boat to me the sailors rowed in awe through many a new and fearful jag of overhanging rock through which there flowed the foam of streams that cannot make abode they came and questioned me but when they heard my voice they became silent and they stood and moved as men in whom new love had stirred deep thoughts so to the ship we passed without a word notes dreams edition opprest edition lone solitude edition canto i sate beside the steersman then and gazing upon the west cried spread the sails behold the sinking moon is like a watchtower blazing over the mountains yet the city of gold yon cape alone does from the sight withhold the stream is fleet the north breathes steadily beneath the stars they tremble with the cold ye cannot rest upon the dreary sea haste haste to the warm home of happier destiny the mariners obeyed the captain stood aloof and whispering to the pilot said alas alas i fear we are pursued by wicked ghosts a phantom of the dead the night before we sailed came to my bed in dream like that the pilot then replied it cannot be she is a human maid her low voice makes you weep she is some bride or daughter of high birth she can be nought beside we passed the islets borne by wind and stream and as we sailed the mariners came near and thronged around to listen in the gleam of the pale moon i stood as one whom fear may not attaint and my calm voice did rear ye are all human yon broad moon gives light to millions who the selfsame likeness wear even while i speak beneath this very night their thoughts flow on like ours in sadness or delight what dream ye your own hands have built an home even for yourselves on a beloved shore for some fond eyes are pining till they come how they will greet him when his toils are oer and laughing babes rush from the wellknown door is this your care ye toil for your own good ye feel and think has some immortal power such purposes or in a human mood dream ye some power thus builds for man in solitude what is that power ye mock yourselves and give a human heart to what ye cannot know as if the cause of life could think and live twere as if mans own works should feel and show the hopes and fears and thoughts from which they flow and he be like to them lo plague is free to waste blight poison earthquake hail and snow disease and want and worse necessity of hate and ill and pride and fear and tyranny what is that power some moonstruck sophist stood watching the shade from his own soul upthrown fill heaven and darken earth and in such mood the form he saw and worshipped was his own his likeness in the worlds vast mirror shown and twere an innocent dream but that a faith nursed by fears dew of poison grows thereon and that men say that power has chosen death on all who scorn its laws to wreak immortal wrath men say that they themselves have heard and seen or known from others who have known such things a shade a form which earth and heaven between wields an invisible rod that priests and kings custom domestic sway ay all that brings mans freeborn soul beneath the oppressors heel are his strong ministers and that the stings of death will make the wise his vengeance feel though truth and virtue arm their hearts with tenfold steel and it is said this power will punish wrong yes add despair to crime and pain to pain and deepest hell and deathless snakes among will bind the wretch on whom is fixed a stain which like a plague a burden and a bane clung to him while he lived for love and hate virtue and vice they say are difference vain the will of strength is right this human state tyrants that they may rule with lies thus desolate alas what strength opinion is more frail than yon dim cloud now fading on the moon even while we gaze though it awhile avail to hide the orb of truth and every throne of earth or heaven though shadow rests thereon one shape of many names for this ye plough the barren waves of ocean hence each one is slave or tyrant all betray and bow command or kill or fear or wreak or suffer woe its names are each a sign which maketh holy all power ay the ghost the dream the shade of power lust falsehood hate and pride and folly the pattern whence all fraud and wrong is made a law to which mankind has been betrayed and human love is as the name well known of a dear mother whom the murderer laid in bloody grave and into darkness thrown gathered her wildered babes around him as his own o love who to the hearts of wandering men art as the calm to oceans weary waves justice or truth or joy those only can from slavery and religions labyrinth caves guide us as one clear star the seaman saves to give to all an equal share of good to track the steps of freedom though through graves she pass to suffer all in patient mood to weep for crime though stained with thy friends dearest blood to feel the peace of selfcontentments lot to own all sympathies and outrage none and in the inmost bowers of sense and thought until lifes sunny day is quite gone down to sit and smile with joy or not alone to kiss salt tears from the worn cheek of woe to live as if to love and live were one this is not faith or law nor those who bow to thrones on heaven or earth such destiny may know but children near their parents tremble now because they must obey one rules another and as one power rules both high and low so man is made the captive of his brother and hate is throned on high with fear her mother above the highest and those fountaincells whence love yet flowed when faith had choked all other are darkened woman as the bondslave dwells of man a slave and life is poisoned in its wells man seeks for gold in mines that he may weave a lasting chain for his own slavery in fear and restless care that he may live he toils for others who must ever be the joyless thralls of like captivity he murders for his chiefs delight in ruin he builds the altar that its idols fee may be his very blood he is pursuing o blind and willing wretch his own obscure undoing woman she is his slave she has become a thing i weep to speak the child of scorn the outcast of a desolated home falsehood and fear and toil like waves have worn channels upon her cheek which smiles adorn as calm decks the false ocean well ye know what woman is for none of woman born can choose but drain the bitter dregs of woe which ever from the oppressed to the oppressors flow this need not be ye might arise and will that gold should lose its power and thrones their glory that love which none may bind be free to fill the world like light and evil faith grown hoary with crime be quenched and die yon promontory even now eclipses the descending moon dungeons and palaces are transitory high temples fade like vapour man alone remains whose will has power when all beside is gone let all be free and equal from your hearts i feel an echo through my inmost frame like sweetest sound seeking its mate it darts whence come ye friends alas i cannot name all that i read of sorrow toil and shame on your worn faces as in legends old which make immortal the disastrous fame of conquerors and impostors false and bold the discord of your hearts i in your looks behold whence come ye friends from pouring human blood forth on the earth or bring ye steel and gold that kings may dupe and slay the multitude or from the famished poor pale weak and cold bear ye the earnings of their toil unfold speak are your hands in slaughters sanguine hue stained freshly have your hearts in guile grown old know yourselves thus ye shall be pure as dew and i will be a friend and sister unto you disguise it not we have one human heart all mortal thoughts confess a common home blush not for what may to thyself impart stains of inevitable crime the doom is this which has or may or must become thine and all humankinds ye are the spoil which time thus marks for the devouring tomb thou and thy thoughts and they and all the toil wherewith ye twine the rings of lifes perpetual coil disguise it not ye blush for what ye hate and enmity is sister unto shame look on your mind it is the book of fate ah it is dark with many a blazoned name of misery all are mirrors of the same but the dark fiend who with his iron pen dipped in scorns fiery poison makes his fame enduring there would oer the heads of men pass harmless if they scorned to make their hearts his den yes it is hate that shapeless fiendly thing of many names all evil some divine whom selfcontempt arms with a mortal sting which when the heart its snaky folds entwine is wasted quite and when it doth repine to gorge such bitter prey on all beside it turns with ninefold rage as with its twine when amphisbaena some fair bird has tied soon oer the putrid mass he threats on every side reproach not thine own soul but know thyself nor hate anothers crime nor loathe thine own it is the dark idolatry of self which when our thoughts and actions once are gone demands that man should weep and bleed and groan oh vacant expiation be at rest the past is deaths the future is thine own and love and joy can make the foulest breast a paradise of flowers where peace might build her nest speak thou whence come ye a youth made reply wearily wearily oer the boundless deep we sail thou readest well the misery told in these faded eyes but much doth sleep within which there the poor heart loves to keep or dare not write on the dishonoured brow even from our childhood have we learned to steep the bread of slavery in the tears of woe and never dreamed of hope or refuge until now yes i must speak my secret should have perished even with the heart it wasted as a brand fades in the dying flame whose life it cherished but that no human bosom can withstand thee wondrous lady and the mild command of thy keen eyes yes we are wretched slaves who from their wonted loves and native land are reft and bear oer the dividing waves the unregarded prey of calm and happy graves we drag afar from pastoral vales the fairest among the daughters of those mountains lone we drag them there where all things best and rarest are stained and trampled years have come and gone since like the ship which bears me i have known no thought but now the eyes of one dear maid on mine with light of mutual love have shone she is my life i am but as the shade of her a smoke sent up from ashes soon to fade for she must perish in the tyrants hall alas alas he ceased and by the sail sate cowering but his sobs were heard by all and still before the ocean and the gale the ship fled fast till the stars gan to fail and round me gathered with mute countenance the seamen gazed the pilot worn and pale with toil the captain with gray locks whose glance met mine in restless awe they stood as in a trance recede not pause not now thou art grown old but hope will make thee young for hope and youth are children of one mother even love behold the eternal stars gaze on us is the truth within your soul care for your own or ruth for others sufferings do ye thirst to bear a heart which not the serpent customs tooth may violate be free and even here swear to be firm till death they cried we swear we swear the very darkness shook as with a blast of subterranean thunder at the cry the hollow shore its thousand echoes cast into the night as if the sea and sky and earth rejoiced with newborn liberty for in that name they swore bolts were undrawn and on the deck with unaccustomed eye the captives gazing stood and every one shrank as the inconstant torch upon her countenance shone they were earths purest children young and fair with eyes the shrines of unawakened thought and brows as bright as spring or morning ere dark time had there its evil legend wrought in characters of cloud which wither not the change was like a dream to them but soon they knew the glory of their altered lot in the bright wisdom of youths breathless noon sweet talk and smiles and sighs all bosoms did attune but one was mute her cheeks and lips most fair changing their hue like lilies newly blown beneath a bright acacias shadowy hair waved by the wind amid the sunny noon showed that her soul was quivering and full soon that youth arose and breathlessly did look on her and me as for some speechless boon i smiled and both their hands in mine i took and felt a soft delight from what their spirits shook canto that night we anchored in a woody bay and sleep no more around us dared to hover than when all doubt and fear has passed away it shades the couch of some unresting lover whose heart is now at rest thus night passed over in mutual joy around a forest grew of poplars and dark oaks whose shade did cover the waning stars pranked in the waters blue and trembled in the wind which from the morning flew the joyous mariners and each free maiden now brought from the deep forest many a bough with woodland spoil most innocently laden soon wreaths of budding foliage seemed to flow over the mast and sails the stern and prow were canopied with blooming boughs the while on the slant suns path oer the waves we go rejoicing like the dwellers of an isle doomed to pursue those waves that cannot cease to smile the many ships spotting the dark blue deep with snowy sails fled fast as ours came nigh in fear and wonder and on every steep thousands did gaze they heard the startling cry like earths own voice lifted unconquerably to all her children the unbounded mirth the glorious joy of thy name liberty they heard as oer the mountains of the earth from peak to peak leap on the beams of mornings birth so from that cry over the boundless hills sudden was caught one universal sound like a volcanos voice whose thunder fills remotest skies such glorious madness found a path through human hearts with stream which drowned its struggling fears and cares dark customs brood they knew not whence it came but felt around a wide contagion poured they called aloud on liberty that name lived on the sunny flood we reached the port alas from many spirits the wisdom which had waked that cry was fled like the brief glory which dark heaven inherits from the false dawn which fades ere it is spread upon the nights devouring darkness shed yet soon bright day will burst even like a chasm of fire to burn the shrouds outworn and dead which wrap the world a wide enthusiasm to cleanse the fevered world as with an earthquakes spasm i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toilworn mariners and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and halfextinguished words which prophesied of change for with strong speech i tore the veil that hid nature and truth and liberty and love as one who from some mountains pyramid points to the unrisen sun the shades approve his truth and flee from every stream and grove thus gentle thoughts did many a bosom fill wisdom the mail of tried affections wove for many a heart and tameless scorn of ill thrice steeped in molten steel the unconquerable will some said i was a maniac wild and lost some that i scarce had risen from the grave the prophets virgin bride a heavenly ghost some said i was a fiend from my weird cave who had stolen human shape and oer the wave the forest and the mountain came some said i was the child of god sent down to save woman from bonds and death and on my head the burden of their sins would frightfully be laid but soon my human words found sympathy in human hearts the purest and the best as friend with friend made common cause with me and they were few but resolute the rest ere yet success the enterprise had blessed leagued with me in their hearts their meals their slumber their hourly occupations were possessed by hopes which i had armed to overnumber those hosts of meaner cares which lifes strong wings encumber but chiefly women whom my voice did waken from their cold careless willing slavery sought me one truth their dreary prison has shaken they looked around and lo they became free their many tyrants sitting desolately in slavedeserted halls could none restrain for wraths red fire had withered in the eye whose lightning once was death nor fear nor gain could tempt one captive now to lock anothers chain those who were sent to bind me wept and felt their minds outsoar the bonds which clasped them round even as a waxen shape may waste and melt in the white furnace and a visioned swound a pause of hope and awe the city bound which like the silence of a tempests birth when in its awful shadow it has wound the sun the wind the ocean and the earth hung terrible ere yet the lightnings have leaped forth like clouds inwoven in the silent sky by winds from distant regions meeting there in the high name of truth and liberty around the city millions gathered were by hopes which sprang from many a hidden lair words which the lore of truth in hues of flame arrayed thine own wild songs which in the air like homeless odours floated and the name of thee and many a tongue which thou hadst dipped in flame the tyrant knew his power was gone but fear the nurse of vengeance bade him wait the event that perfidy and custom gold and prayer and whatsoeer when force is impotent to fraud the sceptre of the world has lent might as he judged confirm his failing sway therefore throughout the streets the priests he sent to curse the rebels to their gods did they for earthquake plague and want kneel in the public way and grave and hoary men were bribed to tell from seats where law is made the slave of wrong how glorious athens in her splendour fell because her sons were free and that among mankind the many to the few belong by heaven and nature and necessity they said that age was truth and that the young marred with wild hopes the peace of slavery with which old times and men had quelled the vain and free and with the falsehood of their poisonous lips they breathed on the enduring memory of sages and of bards a brief eclipse there was one teacher who necessity had armed with strength and wrong against mankind his slave and his avenger aye to be that we were weak and sinful frail and blind and that the will of one was peace and we should seek for nought on earth but toil and misery for thus we might avoid the hell hereafter so spake the hypocrites who cursed and lied alas their sway was past and tears and laughter clung to their hoary hair withering the pride which in their hollow hearts dared still abide and yet obscener slaves with smoother brow and sneers on their strait lips thin blue and wide said that the rule of men was over now and hence the subject world to womans will must bow and gold was scattered through the streets and wine flowed at a hundred feasts within the wall in vain the steady towers in heaven did shine as they were wont nor at the priestly call left plague her banquet in the ethiops hall nor famine from the rich mans portal came where at her ease she ever preys on all who throng to kneel for food nor fear nor shame nor faith nor discord dimmed hopes newly kindled flame for gold was as a god whose faith began to fade so that its worshippers were few and faith itself which in the heart of man gives shape voice name to spectral terror knew its downfall as the altars lonelier grew till the priests stood alone within the fane the shafts of falsehood unpolluting flew and the cold sneers of calumny were vain the union of the free with discords brand to stain the rest thou knowest lo we two are here we have survived a ruin wide and deep strange thoughts are mine i cannot grieve or fear sitting with thee upon this lonely steep i smile though human love should make me weep we have survived a joy that knows no sorrow and i do feel a mighty calmness creep over my heart which can no longer borrow its hues from chance or change dark children of tomorrow we know not what will come yet laon dearest cythna shall be the prophetess of love her lips shall rob thee of the grace thou wearest to hide thy heart and clothe the shapes which rove within the homeless futures wintry grove for i now sitting thus beside thee seem even with thy breath and blood to live and move and violence and wrong are as a dream which rolls from steadfast truth an unreturning stream the blasts of autumn drive the winged seeds over the earth next come the snows and rain and frosts and storms which dreary winter leads out of his scythian cave a savage train behold spring sweeps over the world again shedding soft dews from her ethereal wings flowers on the mountains fruits over the plain and music on the waves and woods she flings and love on all that lives and calm on lifeless things o spring of hope and love and youth and gladness windwinged emblem brightest best and fairest whence comest thou when with dark winters sadness the tears that fade in sunny smiles thou sharest sister of joy thou art the child who wearest thy mothers dying smile tender and sweet thy mother autumn for whose grave thou bearest fresh flowers and beams like flowers with gentle feet disturbing not the leaves which are her windingsheet virtue and hope and love like light and heaven surround the world we are their chosen slaves has not the whirlwind of our spirit driven truths deathless germs to thoughts remotest caves lo winter comes the grief of many graves the frost of death the tempest of the sword the flood of tyranny whose sanguine waves stagnate like ice at faith the enchanters word and bind all human hearts in its repose abhorred the seeds are sleeping in the soil meanwhile the tyrant peoples dungeons with his prey pale victims on the guarded scaffold smile because they cannot speak and day by day the moon of wasting science wanes away among her stars and in that darkness vast the sons of earth to their foul idols pray and gray priests triumph and like blight or blast a shade of selfish care oer human looks is cast this is the winter of the world and here we die even as the winds of autumn fade expiring in the frore and foggy air behold spring comes though we must pass who made the promise of its birth even as the shade which from our death as from a mountain flings the future a broad sunrise thus arrayed as with the plumes of overshadowing wings from its dark gulf of chains earth like an eagle springs o dearest love we shall be dead and cold before this morn may on the world arise wouldst thou the glory of its dawn behold alas gaze not on me but turn thine eyes on thine own heart it is a paradise which everlasting spring has made its own and while drear winter fills the naked skies sweet streams of sunny thought and flowers freshblown are there and weave their sounds and odours into one in their own hearts the earnest of the hope which made them great the good will ever find and though some envious shade may interlope between the effect and it one comes behind who aye the future to the past will bind necessity whose sightless strength for ever evil with evil good with good must wind in bands of union which no power may sever they must bring forth their kind and be divided never the good and mighty of departed ages are in their graves the innocent and free heroes and poets and prevailing sages who leave the vesture of their majesty to adorn and clothe this naked world and we are like to them such perish but they leave all hope or love or truth or liberty whose forms their mighty spirits could conceive to be a rule and law to ages that survive so be the turf heaped over our remains even in our happy youth and that strange lot whateer it be when in these mingling veins the blood is still be ours let sense and thought pass from our being or be numbered not among the things that are let those who come behind for whom our steadfast will has bought a calm inheritance a glorious doom insult with careless tread our undivided tomb our many thoughts and deeds our life and love our happiness and all that we have been immortally must live and burn and move when we shall be no more the world has seen a type of peace and as some most serene and lovely spot to a poor maniacs eye after long years some sweet and moving scene of youthful hope returning suddenly quells his long madness thus man shall remember thee and calumny meanwhile shall feed on us as worms devour the dead and near the throne and at the altar most accepted thus shall sneers and curses be what we have done none shall dare vouch though it be truly known that record shall remain when they must pass who built their pride on its oblivion and fame in human hope which sculptured was survive the perished scrolls of unenduring brass the while we two beloved must depart and sense and reason those enchanters fair whose wand of power is hope would bid the heart that gazed beyond the wormy grave despair these eyes these lips this blood seems darkly there to fade in hideous ruin no calm sleep peopling with golden dreams the stagnant air seems our obscure and rotting eyes to steep in joy but senseless death a ruin dark and deep these are blind fancies reason cannot know what sense can neither feel nor thought conceive there is delusion in the world and woe and fear and pain we know not whence we live or why or how or what mute power may give their being to each plant and star and beast or even these thoughts come near me i do weave a chain i cannot break i am possessed with thoughts too swift and strong for one lone human breast yes yes thy kiss is sweet thy lips are warm o willingly beloved would these eyes might they no more drink being from thy form even as to sleep whence we again arise close their faint orbs in death i fear nor prize aught that can now betide unshared by thee yes love when wisdom fails makes cythna wise darkness and death if death be true must be dearer than life and hope if unenjoyed with thee alas our thoughts flow on with stream whose waters return not to their fountain earth and heaven the ocean and the sun the clouds their daughters winter and spring and morn and noon and even all that we are or know is darkly driven towards one gulf lo what a change is come since i first spake but time shall be forgiven though it change all but thee she ceased nights gloom meanwhile had fallen on earth from the skys sunless dome though she had ceased her countenance uplifted to heaven still spake with solemn glory bright her dark deep eyes her lips whose motions gifted the air they breathed with love her locks undight fair star of life and love i cried my souls delight why lookest thou on the crystalline skies o that my spirit were yon heaven of night which gazes on thee with its thousand eyes she turned to me and smiled that smile was paradise notes hues of grace edition canto was there a human spirit in the steed that thus with his proud voice ere night was gone he broke our linked rest or do indeed all living things a common nature own and thought erect an universal throne where many shapes one tribute ever bear and earth their mutual mother does she groan to see her sons contend and makes she bare her breast that all in peace its drainless stores may share i have heard friendly sounds from many a tongue which was not human the lone nightingale has answered me with her most soothing song out of her ivy bower when i sate pale with grief and sighed beneath from many a dale the antelopes who flocked for food have spoken with happy sounds and motions that avail like mans own speech and such was now the token of waning night whose calm by that proud neigh was broken each night that mighty steed bore me abroad and i returned with food to our retreat and dark intelligence the blood which flowed over the fields had stained the coursers feet soon the dust drinks that bitter dew then meet the vulture and the wild dog and the snake the wolf and the hyaena gray and eat the dead in horrid truce their throngs did make behind the steed a chasm like waves in a ships wake for from the utmost realms of earth came pouring the banded slaves whom every despot sent at that throned traitors summons like the roaring of fire whose floods the wild deer circumvent in the scorched pastures of the south so bent the armies of the leagued kings around their files of steel and flame the continent trembled as with a zone of ruin bound beneath their feet the sea shook with their navies sound from every nation of the earth they came the multitude of moving heartless things whom slaves call men obediently they came like sheep whom from the fold the shepherd brings to the stall red with blood their many kings led them thus erring from their native land tartar and frank and millions whom the wings of indian breezes lull and many a band the arctic anarch sent and idumeas sand fertile in prodigies and lies so there strange natures made a brotherhood of ill the desert savage ceased to grasp in fear his asian shield and bow when at the will of europes subtler son the bolt would kill some shepherd sitting on a rock secure but smiles of wondering joy his face would fill and savage sympathy those slaves impure each one the other thus from ill to ill did lure for traitorously did that foul tyrant robe his countenance in lies even at the hour when he was snatched from death then oer the globe with secret signs from many a mountaintower with smoke by day and fire by night the power of kings and priests those dark conspirators he called they knew his cause their own and swore like wolves and serpents to their mutual wars strange truce with many a rite which earth and heaven abhors myriads had come millions were on their way the tyrant passed surrounded by the steel of hired assassins through the public way choked with his countrys dead his footsteps reel on the fresh blood he smiles ay now i feel i am a king in truth he said and took his royal seat and bade the torturing wheel be brought and fire and pincers and the hook and scorpions that his soul on its revenge might look but first go slay the rebels why return the victor bands he said millions yet live of whom the weakest with one word might turn the scales of victory yet let none survive but those within the walls each fifth shall give the expiation for his brethren here go forth and waste and kill o king forgive my speech a soldier answered but we fear the spirits of the night and morn is drawing near for we were slaying still without remorse and now that dreadful chief beneath my hand defenceless lay when on a hellblack horse an angel bright as day waving a brand which flashed among the stars passed dost thou stand parleying with me thou wretch the king replied slaves bind him to the wheel and of this band whoso will drag that woman to his side that scared him thus may burn his dearest foe beside and gold and glory shall be his go forth they rushed into the plain loud was the roar of their career the horsemen shook the earth the wheeled artillerys speed the pavement tore the infantry file after file did pour their clouds on the utmost hills five days they slew among the wasted fields the sixth saw gore stream through the city on the seventh the dew of slaughter became stiff and there was peace anew peace in the desert fields and villages between the glutted beasts and mangled dead peace in the silent streets save when the cries of victims to their fiery judgement led made pale their voiceless lips who seemed to dread even in their dearest kindred lest some tongue be faithless to the fear yet unbetrayed peace in the tyrants palace where the throng waste the triumphal hours in festival and song day after day the burning sun rolled on over the deathpolluted land it came out of the east like fire and fiercely shone a lamp of autumn ripening with its flame the few lone ears of corn the sky became stagnate with heat so that each cloud and blast languished and died the thirsting air did claim all moisture and a rotting vapour passed from the unburied dead invisible and fast first want then plague came on the beasts their food failed and they drew the breath of its decay millions on millions whom the scent of blood had lured or who from regions far away had tracked the hosts in festival array from their dark deserts gaunt and wasting now stalked like fell shades among their perished prey in their green eyes a strange disease did glow they sank in hideous spasm or pains severe and slow the fish were poisoned in the streams the birds in the green woods perished the insect race was withered up the scattered flocks and herds who had survived the wild beasts hungry chase died moaning each upon the others face in helpless agony gazing round the city all night the lean hyaenas their sad case like starving infants wailed a woeful ditty and many a mother wept pierced with unnatural pity amid the aereal minarets on high the ethiopian vultures fluttering fell from their long line of brethren in the sky startling the concourse of mankind too well these signs the coming mischief did foretell strange panic first a deep and sickening dread within each heart like ice did sink and dwell a voiceless thought of evil which did spread with the quick glance of eyes like withering lightnings shed day after day when the year wanes the frosts strip its green crown of leaves till all is bare so on those strange and congregated hosts came famine a swift shadow and the air groaned with the burden of a new despair famine than whom misrule no deadlier daughter feeds from her thousand breasts though sleeping there with lidless eyes lie faith and plague and slaughter a ghastly brood conceived of lethes sullen water there was no food the corn was trampled down the flocks and herds had perished on the shore the dead and putrid fish were ever thrown the deeps were foodless and the winds no more creaked with the weight of birds but as before those winged things sprang forth were void of shade the vines and orchards autumns golden store were burned so that the meanest food was weighed with gold and avarice died before the god it made there was no corn in the wide marketplace all loathliest things even human flesh was sold they weighed it in small scales and many a face was fixed in eager horror then his gold the miser brought the tender maid grown bold through hunger bared her scorned charms in vain the mother brought her eldest born controlled by instinct blind as love but turned again and bade her infant suck and died in silent pain then fell blue plague upon the race of man o for the sheathed steel so late which gave oblivion to the dead when the streets ran with brothers blood o that the earthquakes grave would gape or ocean lift its stifling wave vain cries throughout the streets thousands pursued each by his fiery torture howl and rave or sit in frenzys unimagined mood upon fresh heaps of dead a ghastly multitude it was not hunger now but thirst each well was choked with rotting corpses and became a cauldron of green mist made visible at sunrise thither still the myriads came seeking to quench the agony of the flame which raged like poison through their bursting veins naked they were from torture without shame spotted with nameless scars and lurid blains childhood and youth and age writhing in savage pains it was not thirst but madness many saw their own lean image everywhere it went a ghastlier self beside them till the awe of that dread sight to selfdestruction sent those shrieking victims some ere life was spent sought with a horrid sympathy to shed contagion on the sound and others rent their matted hair and cried aloud we tread on fire the avenging power his hell on earth has spread sometimes the living by the dead were hid near the great fountain in the public square where corpses made a crumbling pyramid under the sun was heard one stifled prayer for life in the hot silence of the air and strange twas amid that hideous heap to see some shrouded in their long and golden hair as if not dead but slumbering quietly like forms which sculptors carve then love to agony famine had spared the palace of the king he rioted in festival the while he and his guards and priests but plague did fling one shadow upon all famine can smile on him who brings it food and pass with guile of thankful falsehood like a courtier gray the housedog of the throne but many a mile comes plague a winged wolf who loathes alway the garbage and the scum that strangers make her prey so near the throne amid the gorgeous feast sheathed in resplendent arms or loosely dight to luxury ere the mockery yet had ceased that lingered on his lips the warriors might was loosened and a new and ghastlier night in dreams of frenzy lapped his eyes he fell headlong or with stiff eyeballs sate upright among the guests or raving mad did tell strange truths a dying seer of dark oppressions hell the princes and the priests were pale with terror that monstrous faith wherewith they ruled mankind fell like a shaft loosed by the bowmans error on their own hearts they sought and they could find no refuge twas the blind who led the blind so through the desolate streets to the high fane the manytongued and endless armies wind in sad procession each among the train to his own idol lifts his supplications vain o god they cried we know our secret pride has scorned thee and thy worship and thy name secure in human power we have defied thy fearful might we bend in fear and shame before thy presence with the dust we claim kindred be merciful o king of heaven most justly have we suffered for thy fame made dim but be at length our sins forgiven ere to despair and death thy worshippers be driven o king of glory thou alone hast power who can resist thy will who can restrain thy wrath when on the guilty thou dost shower the shafts of thy revenge a blistering rain greatest and best be merciful again have we not stabbed thine enemies and made the earth an altar and the heavens a fane where thou wert worshipped with their blood and laid those hearts in dust which would thy searchless works have weighed well didst thou loosen on this impious city thine angels of revenge recall them now thy worshippers abased here kneel for pity and bind their souls by an immortal vow we swear by thee and to our oath do thou give sanction from thine hell of fiends and flame that we will kill with fire and torments slow the last of those who mocked thy holy name and scorned the sacred laws thy prophets did proclaim thus they with trembling limbs and pallid lips worshipped their own hearts image dim and vast scared by the shade wherewith they would eclipse the light of other minds troubled they passed from the great temple fiercely still and fast the arrows of the plague among them fell and they on one another gazed aghast and through the hosts contention wild befell as each of his own god the wondrous works did tell and oromaze joshua and mahomet moses and buddh zerdusht and brahm and foh a tumult of strange names which never met before as watchwords of a single woe arose each raging votary gan to throw aloft his armed hands and each did howl our god alone is god and slaughter now would have gone forth when from beneath a cowl a voice came forth which pierced like ice through every soul twas an iberian priest from whom it came a zealous man who led the legioned west with words which faith and pride had steeped in flame to quell the unbelievers a dire guest even to his friends was he for in his breast did hate and guile lie watchful intertwined twin serpents in one deep and winding nest he loathed all faith beside his own and pined to wreak his fear of heaven in vengeance on mankind but more he loathed and hated the clear light of wisdom and free thought and more did fear lest kindled once its beams might pierce the night even where his idol stood for far and near did many a heart in europe leap to hear that faith and tyranny were trampled down many a pale victim doomed for truth to share the murderers cell or see with helpless groan the priests his children drag for slaves to serve their own he dared not kill the infidels with fire or steel in europe the slow agonies of legal torture mocked his keen desire so he made truce with those who did despise the expiation and the sacrifice that though detested islams kindred creed might crush for him those deadlier enemies for fear of god did in his bosom breed a jealous hate of man an unreposing need peace peace he cried when we are dead the day of judgement comes and all shall surely know whose god is god each fearfully shall pay the errors of his faith in endless woe but there is sent a mortal vengeance now on earth because an impious race had spurned him whom we all adore a subtle foe by whom for ye this dread reward was earned and kingly thrones which rest on faith nigh overturned think ye because ye weep and kneel and pray that god will lull the pestilence it rose even from beneath his throne where many a day his mercy soothed it to a dark repose it walks upon the earth to judge his foes and what are thou and i that he should deign to curb his ghastly minister or close the gates of death ere they receive the twain who shook with mortal spells his undefended reign ay there is famine in the gulf of hell its giant worms of fire for ever yawn their lurid eyes are on us those who fell by the swift shafts of pestilence ere dawn are in their jaws they hunger for the spawn of satan their own brethren who were sent to make our souls their spoil see see they fawn like dogs and they will sleep with luxury spent when those detested hearts their iron fangs have rent our god may then lull pestilence to sleep pile high the pyre of expiation now a forests spoil of boughs and on the heap pour venomous gums which sullenly and slow when touched by flame shall burn and melt and flow a stream of clinging fire and fix on high a net of iron and spread forth below a couch of snakes and scorpions and the fry of centipedes and worms earths hellish progeny let laon and laone on that pyre linked tight with burning brass perish then pray that with this sacrifice the withering ire of heaven may be appeased he ceased and they a space stood silent as far far away the echoes of his voice among them died and he knelt down upon the dust alway muttering the curses of his speechless pride whilst shame and fear and awe the armies did divide his voice was like a blast that burst the portal of fabled hell and as he spake each one saw gape beneath the chasms of fire immortal and heaven above seemed cloven where on a throne girt round with storms and shadows sate alone their king and judge fear killed in every breast all natural pity then a fear unknown before and with an inward fire possessed they raged like homeless beasts whom burning woods invest twas morn at noon the public crier went forth proclaiming through the living and the dead the monarch saith that his great empires worth is set on laon and laones head he who but one yet living here can lead or who the life from both their hearts can wring shall be the kingdoms heir a glorious meed but he who both alive can hither bring the princess shall espouse and reign an equal king ere night the pyre was piled the net of iron was spread above the fearful couch below it overtopped the towers that did environ that spacious square for fear is never slow to build the thrones of hate her mate and foe so she scourged forth the maniac multitude to rear this pyramid tottering and slow plaguestricken foodless like lean herds pursued by gadflies they have piled the heath and gums and wood night came a starless and a moonless gloom until the dawn those hosts of many a nation stood round that pile as near one lovers tomb two gentle sisters mourn their desolation and in the silence of that expectation was heard on high the reptiles hiss and crawl it was so deep save when the devastation of the swift pest with fearful interval marking its path with shrieks among the crowd would fall morn came among those sleepless multitudes madness and fear and plague and famine still heaped corpse on corpse as in autumnal woods the frosts of many a wind with dead leaves fill earths cold and sullen brooks in silence still the pale survivors stood ere noon the fear of hell became a panic which did kill like hunger or disease with whispers drear as hush hark come they yet just heaven thine hour is near and priests rushed through their ranks some counterfeiting the rage they did inspire some mad indeed with their own lies they said their god was waiting to see his enemies writhe and burn and bleed and that till then the snakes of hell had need of human souls three hundred furnaces soon blazed through the wide city where with speed men brought their infidel kindred to appease gods wrath and while they burned knelt round on quivering knees the noontide sun was darkened with that smoke the winds of eve dispersed those ashes gray the madness which these rites had lulled awoke again at sunset who shall dare to say the deeds which night and fear brought forth or weigh in balance just the good and evil there he might mans deep and searchless heart display and cast a light on those dim labyrinths where hope near imagined chasms is struggling with despair tis said a mother dragged three children then to those fierce flames which roast the eyes in the head and laughed and died and that unholy men feasting like fiends upon the infidel dead looked from their meal and saw an angel tread the visible floor of heaven and it was she and on that night one without doubt or dread came to the fire and said stop i am he kill me they burned them both with hellish mockery and one by one that night young maidens came beauteous and calm like shapes of living stone clothed in the light of dreams and by the flame which shrank as overgorged they laid them down and sung a low sweet song of which alone one word was heard and that was liberty and that some kissed their marble feet with moan like love and died and then that they did die with happy smiles which sunk in white tranquillity notes native home edition earthquakes edition reptilesreptiles edition canto she saw me not she heard me not alone upon the mountains dizzy brink she stood she spake not breathed not moved not there was thrown over her look the shadow of a mood which only clothes the heart in solitude a thought of voiceless depth she stood alone above the heavens were spread below the flood was murmuring in its caves the wind had blown her hair apart through which her eyes and forehead shone a cloud was hanging oer the western mountains before its blue and moveless depth were flying gray mists poured forth from the unresting fountains of darkness in the north the day was dying sudden the sun shone forth its beams were lying like boiling gold on ocean strange to see and on the shattered vapours which defying the power of light in vain tossed restlessly in the red heaven like wrecks in a tempestuous sea it was a stream of living beams whose bank on either side by the clouds cleft was made and where its chasms that flood of glory drank its waves gushed forth like fire and as if swayed by some mute tempest rolled on her the shade of her bright image floated on the river of liquid light which then did end and fade her radiant shape upon its verge did shiver aloft her flowing hair like strings of flame did quiver i stood beside her but she saw me not she looked upon the sea and skies and earth rapture and love and admiration wrought a passion deeper far than tears or mirth or speech or gesture or whateer has birth from common joy which with the speechless feeling that led her there united and shot forth from her far eyes a light of deep revealing all but her dearest self from my regard concealing her lips were parted and the measured breath was now heard there her dark and intricate eyes orb within orb deeper than sleep or death absorbed the glories of the burning skies which mingling with her hearts deep ecstasies burst from her looks and gestures and a light of liquid tenderness like love did rise from her whole frame an atmosphere which quite arrayed her in its beams tremulous and soft and bright she would have clasped me to her glowing frame those warm and odorous lips might soon have shed on mine the fragrance and the invisible flame which now the cold winds stole she would have laid upon my languid heart her dearest head i might have heard her voice tender and sweet her eyes mingling with mine might soon have fed my soul with their own joy one moment yet i gazed we parted then never again to meet never but once to meet on earth again she heard me as i fled her eager tone sunk on my heart and almost wove a chain around my will to link it with her own so that my stern resolve was almost gone i cannot reach thee whither dost thou fly my steps are faint come back thou dearest one return ah me return the wind passed by on which those accents died faint far and lingeringly woe woe that moonless midnight want and pest were horrible but one more fell doth rear as in a hydras swarming lair its crest eminent among those victims even the fear of hell each girt by the hot atmosphere of his blind agony like a scorpion stung by his own rage upon his burning bier of circling coals of fire but still there clung one hope like a keen sword on starting threads uphung not death death was no more refuge or rest not life it was despair to be not sleep for fiends and chasms of fire had dispossessed all natural dreams to wake was not to weep but to gaze mad and pallid at the leap to which the future like a snaky scourge or like some tyrants eye which aye doth keep its withering beam upon his slaves did urge their steps they heard the roar of hells sulphureous surge each of that multitude alone and lost to sense of outward things one hope yet knew as on a foamgirt crag some seaman tossed stares at the rising tide or like the crew whilst now the ship is splitting through and through each if the tramp of a far steed was heard started from sick despair or if there flew one murmur on the wind or if some word which none can gather yet the distant crowd has stirred why became cheeks wan with the kiss of death paler from hope they had sustained despair why watched those myriads with suspended breath sleepless a second night they are not here the victims and hour by hour a vision drear warm corpses fall upon the claycold dead and even in death their lips are wreathed with fear the crowd is mute and moveless overhead silent arcturus shines ha hearst thou not the tread of rushing feet laughter the shout the scream of triumph not to be contained see hark they come they come give way alas ye deem falsely tis but a crowd of maniacs stark driven like a troop of spectres through the dark from the choked well whence a bright deathfire sprung a lurid earthstar which dropped many a spark from its blue train and spreading widely clung to their wild hair like mist the topmost pines among and many from the crowd collected there joined that strange dance in fearful sympathies there was the silence of a long despair when the last echo of those terrible cries came from a distant street like agonies stifled afar before the tyrants throne all night his aged senate sate their eyes in stony expectation fixed when one sudden before them stood a stranger and alone dark priests and haughty warriors gazed on him with baffled wonder for a hermits vest concealed his face but when he spake his tone ere yet the matter did their thoughts arrest earnest benignant calm as from a breast void of all hate or terror made them start for as with gentle accents he addressed his speech to them on each unwilling heart unusual awe did fall a spiritquelling dart ye princes of the earth ye sit aghast amid the ruin which yourselves have made yes desolation heard your trumpets blast and sprang from sleep dark terror has obeyed your bidding o that i whom ye have made your foe could set my dearest enemy free from pain and fear but evil casts a shade which cannot pass so soon and hate must be the nurse and parent still of an ill progeny ye turn to heaven for aid in your distress alas that ye the mighty and the wise who if ye dared might not aspire to less than ye conceive of power should fear the lies which thou and thou didst frame for mysteries to blind your slaves consider your own thought an empty and a cruel sacrifice ye now prepare for a vain idol wrought out of the fears and hate which vain desires have brought ye seek for happiness alas the day ye find it not in luxury nor in gold nor in the fame nor in the envied sway for which o willing slaves to custom old severe taskmistress ye your hearts have sold ye seek for peace and when ye die to dream no evil dreams all mortal things are cold and senseless then if aught survive i deem it must be love and joy for they immortal seem fear not the future weep not for the past oh could i win your ears to dare be now glorious and great and calm that ye would cast into the dust those symbols of your woe purple and gold and steel that ye would go proclaiming to the nations whence ye came that want and plague and fear from slavery flow and that mankind is free and that the shame of royalty and faith is lost in freedoms fame if thus tis well if not i come to say that laon while the stranger spoke among the council sudden tumult and affray arose for many of those warriors young had on his eloquent accents fed and hung like bees on mountainflowers they knew the truth and from their thrones in vindication sprung the men of faith and law then without ruth drew forth their secret steel and stabbed each ardent youth they stabbed them in the back and sneered a slave who stood behind the throne those corpses drew each to its bloody dark and secret grave and one more daring raised his steel anew to pierce the stranger what hast thou to do with me poor wretch calm solemn and severe that

oppressed turns to her chainless child for succour now it draws the milk of power in wisdoms fullest flow that land is like an eagle whose young gaze feeds on the noontide beam whose golden plume

a fierce and monstrous gladness spread through the multitudinous streets fast flying upon the winds of fear from his dull madness the starveling waked and died in joy the dying among the corpses in stark agony lying just heard the happy tidings and in hope closed their faint eyes from house to house replying with loud acclaim the living shook heavens cope and filled the startled earth with echoes morn did ope its pale eyes then and lo the long array of guards in golden arms and priests beside singing their bloody hymns whose garbs betray the blackness of the faith it seems to hide and see the tyrants gemwrought chariot glide among the gloomy cowls and glittering spears a shape of light is sitting by his side a child most beautiful i the midst appears laon exempt alone from mortal hopes and fears his head and feet are bare his hands are bound behind with heavy chains yet none do wreak their scoffs on him though myriads throng around there are no sneers upon his lip which speak that scorn or hate has made him bold his cheek resolve has not turned pale his eyes are mild and calm and like the morn about to break smile on mankind his heart seems reconciled to all things and itself like a reposing child tumult was in the soul of all beside ill joy or doubt or fear but those who saw their tranquil victim pass felt wonder glide into their brain and became calm with awe see the slow pageant near the pile doth draw a thousand torches in the spacious square borne by the ready slaves of ruthless law await the signal round the morning fair is changed to a dim night by that unnatural glare and see beneath a sunbright canopy upon a platform level with the pile the anxious tyrant sit enthroned on high girt by the chieftains of the host all smile in expectation but one child the while i laon led by mutes ascend my bier of fire and look around each distant isle is dark in the bright dawn towers far and near pierce like reposing flames the tremulous atmosphere there was such silence through the host as when an earthquake trampling on some populous town has crushed ten thousand with one tread and men expect the second all were mute but one that fairest child who bold with love alone stood up before the king without avail pleading for laons life her stifled groan was heard she trembled like one aspen pale among the gloomy pines of a norwegian vale what were his thoughts linked in the morning sun among those reptiles stingless with delay even like a tyrants wrath the signalgun roared hark again in that dread pause he lay as in a quiet dream the slaves obey a thousand torches drop and hark the last bursts on that awful silence far away millions with hearts that beat both loud and fast watch for the springing flame expectant and aghast they fly the torches fall a cry of fear has startled the triumphant they recede for ere the cannons roar has died they hear the tramp of hoofs like earthquake and a steed dark and gigantic with the tempests speed bursts through their ranks a woman sits thereon fairer it seems than aught that earth can breed calm radiant like the phantom of the dawn a spirit from the caves of daylight wandering gone all thought it was gods angel come to sweep the lingering guilty to their fiery grave the tyrant from his throne in dread did leap her innocence his child from fear did save scared by the faith they feigned each priestly slave knelt for his mercy whom they served with blood and like the refluence of a mighty wave sucked into the loud sea the multitude with crushing panic fled in terrors altered mood they pause they blush they gaze a gathering shout bursts like one sound from the ten thousand streams of a tempestuous sea that sudden rout one checked who never in his mildest dreams felt awe from grace or loveliness the seams of his rent heart so hard and cold a creed had seared with blistering ice but he misdeems that he is wise whose wounds do only bleed inly for self thus thought the iberian priest indeed and others too thought he was wise to see in pain and fear and hate something divine in love and beauty no divinity now with a bitter smile whose light did shine like a fiends hope upon his lips and eyne he said and the persuasion of that sneer rallied his trembling comrades is it mine to stand alone when kings and soldiers fear a woman heaven has sent its other victim here were it not impious said the king to break our holy oath impious to keep it say shrieked the exulting priest slaves to the stake bind her and on my head the burden lay of her just torments at the judgement day will i stand up before the golden throne of heaven and cry to thee did i betray an infidel but for me she would have known another moments joy the glory be thine own they trembled but replied not nor obeyed pausing in breathless silence cythna sprung from her gigantic steed who like a shade chased by the winds those vacant streets among fled tameless as the brazen rein she flung upon his neck and kissed his mooned brow a piteous sight that one so fair and young the clasp of such a fearful death should woo with smiles of tender joy as beamed from cythna now the warm tears burst in spite of faith and fear from many a tremulous eye but like soft dews which feed springs earliest buds hung gathered there frozen by doubt alas they could not choose but weep for when her faint limbs did refuse to climb the pyre upon the mutes she smiled and with her eloquent gestures and the hues of her quick lips even as a weary child wins sleep from some fond nurse with its caresses mild she won them though unwilling her to bind near me among the snakes when there had fled one soft reproach that was most thrilling kind she smiled on me and nothing then we said but each upon the others countenance fed looks of insatiate love the mighty veil which doth divide the living and the dead was almost rent the world grew dim and pale all light in heaven or earth beside our love did fail yet yet one brief relapse like the last beam of dying flames the stainless air around hung silent and serene a bloodred gleam burst upwards hurling fiercely from the ground the globed smoke i heard the mighty sound of its uprise like a tempestuous ocean and through its chasms i saw as in a swound the tyrants child fall without life or motion before his throne subdued by some unseen emotion and is this death the pyre has disappeared the pestilence the tyrant and the throng the flames grow silent slowly there is heard the music of a breathsuspending song which like the kiss of love when life is young steeps the faint eyes in darkness sweet and deep with everchanging notes it floats along till on my passive soul there seemed to creep a melody like waves on wrinkled sands that leap the warm touch of a soft and tremulous hand wakened me then lo cythna sate reclined beside me on the waved and golden sand of a clear pool upon a bank oertwined with strange and starbright flowers which to the wind breathed divine odour high above was spread the emerald heaven of trees of unknown kind whose moonlike blooms and bright fruit overhead a shadow which was light upon the waters shed and round about sloped many a lawny mountain with incensebearing forests and vast caves of marble radiance to that mighty fountain and where the flood its own bright margin laves their echoes talk with its eternal waves which from the depths whose jagged caverns breed their unreposing strife it lifts and heaves till through a chasm of hills they roll and feed a river deep which flies with smooth but arrowy speed as we sate gazing in a trance of wonder a boat approached borne by the musical air along the waves which sung and sparkled under its rapid keel a winged shape sate there a child with silvershining wings so fair that as her bark did through the waters glide the shadow of the lingering waves did wear light as from starry beams from side to side while veering to the wind her plumes the bark did guide the boat was one curved shell of hollow pearl almost translucent with the light divine of her within the prow and stern did curl horned on high like the young moon supine when oer dim twilight mountains dark with pine it floats upon the sunsets sea of beams whose golden waves in many a purple line fade fast till borne on sunlights ebbing streams dilating on earths verge the sunken meteor gleams its keel has struck the sands beside our feet then cythna turned to me and from her eyes which swam with unshed tears a look more sweet than happy love a wild and glad surprise glanced as she spake ay this is paradise and not a dream and we are all united lo that is mine own child who in the guise of madness came like day to one benighted in lonesome woods my heart is now too well requited and then she wept aloud and in her arms clasped that bright shape less marvellously fair than her own human hues and living charms which as she leaned in passions silence there breathed warmth on the cold bosom of the air which seemed to blush and tremble with delight the glossy darkness of her streaming hair fell oer that snowy child and wrapped from sight the fond and long embrace which did their hearts unite then the bright child the plumed seraph came and fixed its blue and beaming eyes on mine and said i was disturbed by tremulous shame when once we met yet knew that i was thine from the same hour in which thy lips divine kindled a clinging dream within my brain which ever waked when i might sleep to twine thine image with her memory dear again we meet exempted now from mortal fear or pain when the consuming flames had wrapped ye round the hope which i had cherished went away i fell in agony on the senseless ground and hid mine eyes in dust and far astray my mind was gone when bright like dawning day the spectre of the plague before me flew and breathed upon my lips and seemed to say they wait for thee beloved then i knew the deathmark on my breast and became calm anew it was the calm of love for i was dying i saw the black and halfextinguished pyre in its own gray and shrunken ashes lying the pitchy smoke of the departed fire still hung in many a hollow dome and spire above the towers like night beneath whose shade awed by the ending of their own desire the armies stood a vacancy was made in expectations depth and so they stood dismayed the frightful silence of that altered mood the tortures of the dying clove alone till one uprose among the multitude and said the flood of time is rolling on we stand upon its brink whilst they are gone to glide in peace down deaths mysterious stream have ye done well they moulder flesh and bone who might have made this lifes envenomed dream a sweeter draught than ye will ever taste i deem these perish as the good and great of yore have perished and their murderers will repent yes vain and barren tears shall flow before yon smoke has faded from the firmament even for this cause that ye who must lament the death of those that made this world so fair cannot recall them now but there is lent to man the wisdom of a high despair when such can die and he live on and linger here ay ye may fear not now the pestilence from fabled hell as by a charm withdrawn all power and faith must pass since calmly hence in pain and fire have unbelievers gone and ye must sadly turn away and moan in secret to his home each one returning and to long ages shall this hour be known and slowly shall its memory ever burning fill this dark night of things with an eternal morning for me that world is grown too void and cold since hope pursues immortal destiny with steps thus slow therefore shall ye behold how those who love yet fear not dare to die tell to your children this then suddenly he sheathed a dagger in his heart and fell my brain grew dark in death and yet to me there came a murmur from the crowd to tell of deep and mighty change which suddenly befell then suddenly i stood a winged thought before the immortal senate and the seat of that starshining spirit whence is wrought the strength of its dominion good and great the better genius of this worlds estate his realm around one mighty fane is spread elysian islands bright and fortunate calm dwellings of the free and happy dead where i am sent to lead these winged words she said and with the silence of her eloquent smile bade us embark in her divine canoe then at the helm we took our seat the while above her head those plumes of dazzling hue into the winds invisible stream she threw sitting beside the prow like gossamer on the swift breath of morn the vessel flew oer the bright whirlpools of that fountain fair whose shores receded fast while we seemed lingering there till down that mighty stream dark calm and fleet between a chasm of cedarn mountains riven chased by the thronging winds whose viewless feet as swift as twinkling beams had under heaven from woods and waves wild sounds and odours driven the boat fled visibly three nights and days borne like a cloud through morn and noon and even we sailed along the winding watery ways of the vast stream a long and labyrinthine maze a scene of joy and wonder to behold that rivers shapes and shadows changing ever where the broad sunrise filled with deepening gold its whirlpools where all hues did spread and quiver and where melodious falls did burst and shiver among rocks clad with flowers the foam and spray sparkled like stars upon the sunny river or when the moonlight poured a holier day one vast and glittering lake around green islands lay morn noon and even that boat of pearl outran the streams which bore it like the arrowy cloud of tempest or the speedier thought of man which flieth forth and cannot make abode sometimes through forests deep like night we glode between the walls of mighty mountains crowned with cyclopean piles whose turrets proud the homes of the departed dimly frowned oer the bright waves which girt their dark foundations round sometimes between the wide and flowering meadows mile after mile we sailed and twas delight to see far off the sunbeams chase the shadows over the grass sometimes beneath the night of wide and vaulted caves whose roofs were bright with starry gems we fled whilst from their deep and darkgreen chasms shades beautiful and white amid sweet sounds across our path would sweep like swift and lovely dreams that walk the waves of sleep and ever as we sailed our minds were full of love and wisdom which would overflow in converse wild and sweet and wonderful and in quick smiles whose light would come and go like music oer wide waves and in the flow of sudden tears and in the mute caress for a deep shade was cleft and we did know that virtue though obscured on earth not less survives all mortal change in lasting loveliness three days and nights we sailed as thought and feeling number delightful hours for through the sky the sphered lamps of day and night revealing new changes and new glories rolled on high sun moon and moonlike lamps the progeny of a diviner heaven serene and fair on the fourth day wild as a windwrought sea the stream became and fast and faster bare the spiritwinged boat steadily speeding there steady and swift where the waves rolled like mountains within the vast ravine whose rifts did pour tumultuous floods from their ten thousand fountains the thunder of whose earthuplifting roar made the air sweep in whirlwinds from the shore calm as a shade the boat of that fair child securely fled that rapid stress before amid the topmost spray and sunbows wild wreathed in the silver mist in joy and pride we smiled the torrent of that wide and raging river is passed and our aereal speed suspended we look behind a golden mist did quiver when its wild surges with the lake were blended our bark hung there as on a line suspended between two heavens that windless waveless lake which four great cataracts from four vales attended by mists aye feed from rocks and clouds they break and of that azure sea a silent refuge make motionless resting on the lake awhile i saw its marge of snowbright mountains rear their peaks aloft i saw each radiant isle and in the midst afar even like a sphere hung in one hollow sky did there appear the temple of the spirit on the sound which issued thence drawn nearer and more near like the swift moon this glorious earth around the charmed boat approached and there its haven found notes therethen edition therethen edition whenwhere edition wherewhen edition on a lineone line edition note on the revolt of islam by mrs shelley shelley possessed two remarkable qualities of intellect a brilliant imagination and a logical exactness of reason his inclinations led him he fancied almost alike to poetry and metaphysical discussions i say he fancied because i believe the former to have been paramount and that it would have gained the mastery even had he struggled against it however he said that he deliberated at one time whether he should dedicate himself to poetry or metaphysics and resolving on the former he educated himself for it discarding in a great measure his philosophical pursuits and engaging himself in the study of the poets of greece italy and england to these may be added a constant perusal of portions of the old testament the psalms the book of job the prophet isaiah and others the sublime poetry of which filled him with delight as a poet his intellect and compositions were powerfully influenced by exterior circumstances and especially by his place of abode he was very fond of travelling and illhealth increased this restlessness the sufferings occasioned by a cold english winter made him pine especially when our colder spring arrived for a more genial climate in he again visited switzerland and rented a house on the banks of the lake of geneva and many a day in cloud or sunshine was passed alone in his boat sailing as the wind listed or weltering on the calm waters the majestic aspect of nature ministered such thoughts as he afterwards enwove in verse his lines on the bridge of the arve and his hymn to intellectual beauty were written at this time perhaps during this summer his genius was checked by association with another poet whose nature was utterly dissimilar to his own yet who in the poem he wrote at that time gave tokens that he shared for a period the more abstract and etherealised inspiration of shelley the saddest events awaited his return to england but such was his fear to wound the feelings of others that he never expressed the anguish he felt and seldom gave vent to the indignation roused by the persecutions he underwent while the course of deep unexpressed passion and the sense of injury engendered the desire to embody themselves in forms defecated of all the weakness and evil which cling to real life he chose therefore for his hero a youth nourished in dreams of liberty some of whose actions are in direct opposition to the opinions of the world but who is animated throughout by an ardent love of virtue and a resolution to confer the boons of political and intellectual freedom on his fellowcreatures he created for this youth a woman such as he delighted to imagine full of enthusiasm for the same objects and they both with will unvanquished and the deepest sense of the justice of their cause met adversity and death there exists in this poem a memorial of a friend of his youth the character of the old man who liberates laon from his tower prison and tends on him in sickness is founded on that of doctor lind who when shelley was at eton had often stood by to befriend and support him and whose name he never mentioned without love and veneration during the year we were established at marlow in buckinghamshire shelleys choice of abode was fixed chiefly by this town being at no great distance from london and its neighbourhood to the thames the poem was written in his boat as it floated under the beech groves of bisham or during wanderings in the neighbouring country which is distinguished for peculiar beauty the chalk hills break into cliffs that overhang the thames or form valleys clothed with beech the wilder portion of the country is rendered beautiful by exuberant vegetation and the cultivated part is peculiarly fertile with all this wealth of nature which either in the form of gentlemens parks or soil dedicated to agriculture flourishes around marlow was inhabited i hope it is altered now by a very poor population the women are lacemakers and lose their health by sedentary labour for which they were very ill paid the poorlaws ground to the dust not only the paupers but those who had risen just above that state and were obliged to pay poorrates the changes produced by peace following a long war and a bad harvest brought with them the most heartrending evils to the poor shelley afforded what alleviation he could in the winter while bringing out his poem he had a severe attack of ophthalmia caught while visiting the poor cottages i mention these things for this minute and active sympathy with his fellowcreatures gives a thousandfold interest to his speculations and stamps with reality his pleadings for the human race the poem bold in its opinions and uncompromising in their expression met with many censurers not only among those who allow of no virtue but such as supports the cause they espouse but even among those whose opinions were similar to his own i extract a portion of a letter written in answer to one of these friends it best details the impulses of shelleys mind and his motives it was written with entire unreserve and is therefore a precious monument of his own opinion of his powers of the purity of his designs and the ardour with which he clung in adversity and through the valley of the shadow of death to views from which he believed the permanent happiness of mankind must eventually spring marlowe december i have read and considered all that you say about my general powers and the particular instance of the poem in which i have attempted to develop them nothing can be more satisfactory to me than the interest which your admonitions express but i think you are mistaken in some points with regard to the peculiar nature of my powers whatever be their amount i listened with deference and selfsuspicion to your censures of the revolt of islam but the productions of mine which you commend hold a very low place in my own esteem and this reassures me in some degree at least the poem was produced by a series of thoughts which filled my mind with unbounded and sustained enthusiasm i felt the precariousness of my life and i engaged in this task resolved to leave some record of myself much of what the volume contains was written with the same feeling as real though not so prophetic as the communications of a dying man i never presumed indeed to consider it anything approaching to faultless but when i consider contemporary productions of the same apparent pretensions i own i was filled with confidence i felt that it was in many respects a genuine picture of my own mind i felt that the sentiments were true not assumed and in this have i long believed that my power consists in sympathy and that part of the imagination which relates to sentiment and contemplation i am formed if for anything not in common with the herd of mankind to apprehend minute and remote distinctions of feeling whether relative to external nature or the living beings which surround us and to communicate the conceptions which result from considering either the moral or the material universe as a whole of course i believe these faculties which perhaps comprehend all that is sublime in man to exist very imperfectly in my own mind but when you advert to my chancerypaper a cold forced unimpassioned insignificant piece of cramped and cautious argument and to the little scrap about mandeville which expressed my feelings indeed but cost scarcely two minutes thought to express as specimens of my powers more favourable than that which grew as it were from the agony and bloody sweat of intellectual travail surely i must feel that in some manner either i am mistaken in believing that i have any talent at all or you in the selection of the specimens of it yet after all i cannot but be conscious in much of what i write of an absence of that tranquillity which is the attribute and accompaniment of power this feeling alone would make your most kind and wise admonitions on the subject of the economy of intellectual force valuable to me and if i live or if i see any trust in coming years doubt not but that i shall do something whatever it may be which a serious and earnest estimate of my powers will suggest to me and which will be in every respect accommodated to their utmost limits shelley to godwin prince athanase a fragment the idea shelley had formed of prince athanase was a good deal modelled on alastor in the first sketch of the poem he named it pandemos and urania athanase seeks through the world the one whom he may love he meets in the ship in which he is embarked a lady who appears to him to embody his ideal of love and beauty but she proves to be pandemos or the earthly and unworthy venus who after disappointing his cherished dreams and hopes deserts him athanase crushed by sorrow pines and dies on his deathbed the lady who can really reply to his soul comes and kisses his lips the deathbed of athanase the poet describes her in the words of the final fragment

shelley manuscripts in the bodleian library oxford clarendon press part there was a youth who as with toil and travel had grown quite weak and gray before his time nor any could the restless griefs unravel which burned within him withering up his prime and goading him like fiends from land to land not his the load of any secret crime for nought of ill his heart could understand but pity and wild sorrow for the same not his the thirst for glory or command baffled with blast of hopeconsuming shame nor evil joys which fire the vulgar breast and quench in speedy smoke its feeble flame had left within his soul their dark unrest nor what religion fables of the grave feared he philosophys accepted guest for none than he a purer heart could have or that loved good more for itself alone of nought in heaven or earth was he the slave what sorrow strange and shadowy and unknown sent him a hopeless wanderer through mankind if with a human sadness he did groan he had a gentle yet aspiring mind just innocent with varied learning fed and such a glorious consolation find in others joy when all their own is dead he loved and laboured for his kind in grief and yet unlike all others it is said that from such toil he never found relief although a child of fortune and of power of an ancestral name the orphan chief his soul had wedded wisdom and her dower is love and justice clothed in which he sate apart from men as in a lonely tower pitying the tumult of their dark estate yet even in youth did he not eer abuse the strength of wealth or thought to consecrate those false opinions which the harsh rich use to blind the world they famish for their pride nor did he hold from any man his dues but like a steward in honest dealings tried with those who toiled and wept the poor and wise his riches and his cares he did divide fearless he was and scorning all disguise what he dared do or think though men might start he spoke with mild yet unaverted eyes liberal he was of soul and frank of heart and to his many friends all loved him well whateer he knew or felt he would impart if words he found those inmost thoughts to tell if not he smiled or wept and his weak foes he neither spurned nor hated though with fell and mortal hate their thousand voices rose they passed like aimless arrows from his ear nor did his heart or mind its portal close to those or them or any whom lifes sphere may comprehend within its wide array what sadness made that vernal spirit sere he knew not though his life day after day was failing like an unreplenished stream though in his eyes a cloud and burthen lay through which his soul like vespers serene beam piercing the chasms of ever rising clouds shone softly burning though his lips did seem like reeds which quiver in impetuous floods and through his sleep and oer each waking hour thoughts after thoughts unresting multitudes were driven within him by some secret power which bade them blaze and live and roll afar like lights and sounds from haunted tower to tower oer castled mountains borne when tempests war is levied by the nightcontending winds and the pale dalesmen watch with eager ear though such were in his spirit as the fiends which wake and feed an everliving woe what was this grief which neer in other minds a mirror found he knew not none could know but on whoeer might question him he turned the light of his frank eyes as if to show he knew not of the grief within that burned but asked forbearance with a mournful look or spoke in words from which none ever learned the cause of his disquietude or shook with spasms of silent passion or turned pale so that his friends soon rarely undertook to stir his secret pain without avail for all who knew and loved him then perceived that there was drawn an adamantine veil between his heart and mind both unrelieved wrought in his brain and bosom separate strife some said that he was mad others believed that memories of an antenatal life made this where now he dwelt a penal hell and others said that such mysterious grief from gods displeasure like a darkness fell on souls like his which owned no higher law than love love calm steadfast invincible by mortal fear or supernatural awe and others tis the shadow of a dream which the veiled eye of memory never saw but through the souls abyss like some dark stream through shattered mines and caverns underground rolls shaking its foundations and no beam of joy may rise but it is quenched and drowned in the dim whirlpools of this dream obscure soon its exhausted waters will have found a lair of rest beneath thy spirit pure o athanase in one so good and great evil or tumult cannot long endure so spake they idly of anothers state babbling vain words and fond philosophy this was their consolation such debate men held with one another nor did he like one who labours with a human woe decline this talk as if its theme might be another not himself he to and fro questioned and canvassed it with subtlest wit and none but those who loved him best could know that which he knew not how it galled and bit his weary mind this converse vain and cold for like an eyeless nightmare grief did sit upon his being a snake which fold by fold pressed out the life of life a clinging fiend which clenched him if he stirred with deadlier hold and so his grief remained let it remain untold part fragment prince athanase had one beloved friend an old old man with hair of silver white and lips where heavenly smiles would hang and blend with his wise words and eyes whose arrowy light shone like the reflex of a thousand minds he was the last whom superstitions blight had spared in greece the blight that cramps and blinds and in his olive bower at oenoe had sate from earliest youth like one who finds a fertile island in the barren sea one mariner who has survived his mates many a drear month in a great ship so he with soulsustaining songs and sweet debates of ancient lore there fed his lonely being the mind becomes that which it contemplates and thus zonoras by for ever seeing their bright creations grew like wisest men and when he heard the crash of nations fleeing a bloodier power than ruled thy ruins then o sacred hellas many weary years he wandered till the path of laians glen was grassgrown and the unremembered tears were dry in laian for their honoured chief who fell in byzant pierced by moslem spears and as the lady looked with faithful grief from her high lattice oer the rugged path where she once saw that horseman toil with brief and blighting hope who with the news of death struck body and soul as with a mortal blight she saw between the chestnuts far beneath an old man toiling up a weary wight and soon within her hospitable hall she saw his white hairs glittering in the light of the wood fire and round his shoulders fall and his wan visage and his withered mien yet calm and gentle and majestical and athanase her child who must have been then three years old sate opposite and gazed in patient silence fragment such was zonoras and as daylight finds one amaranth glittering on the path of frost when autumn nights have nipped all weaker kinds thus through his age dark cold and tempesttossed shone truth upon zonoras and he filled from fountains pure nigh overgrown and lost the spirit of prince athanase a child with soulsustaining songs of ancient lore and philosophic wisdom clear and mild and sweet and subtle talk they evermore the pupil and the master shared until sharing that undiminishable store the youth as shadows on a grassy hill outrun the winds that chase them soon outran his teacher and did teach with native skill strange truths and new to that experienced man still they were friends as few have ever been who mark the extremes of lifes discordant span so in the caverns of the forest green or on the rocks of echoing ocean hoar zonoras and prince athanase were seen by summer woodmen and when winters roar sounded oer earth and sea its blast of war the balearic fisher driven from shore hanging upon the peaked wave afar then saw their lamp from laians turret gleam piercing the stormy darkness like a star which pours beyond the sea one steadfast beam whilst all the constellations of the sky seemed reeling through the stormthey did but seem for lo the wintry clouds are all gone by and bright arcturus through yon pines is glowing and far oer southern waves immovably belted orion hangs warm light is flowing from the young moon into the sunsets chasm o summer eve with power divine bestowing on thine own bird the sweet enthusiasm which overflows in notes of liquid gladness filling the sky like light how many a spasm of fevered brains oppressed with grief and madness were lulled by thee delightful nightingale and these soft waves murmuring a gentle sadness and the far sighings of yon piny dale made vocal by some wind we feel not here i bear alone what nothing may avail to lighten a strange load no human ear heard this lament but oer the visage wan of athanase a ruffling atmosphere of dark emotion a swift shadow ran like wind upon some forestbosomed lake glassy and dark and that divine old man beheld his mystic friends whole being shake even where its inmost depths were gloomiest and with a calm and measured voice he spake and with a soft and equal pressure pressed that cold lean hand dost thou remember yet when the curved moon then lingering in the west paused in yon waves her mighty horns to wet how in those beams we walked half resting on the sea tis just one year sure thou dost not forget then platos words of light in thee and me lingered like moonlight in the moonless east for we had just then read thy memory is faithful now the story of the feast and agathon and diotima seemed from death and dark forgetfulness released fragment and when the old man saw that on the green leaves of his opening a blight had lighted he said my friend one grief alone can wean a gentle mind from all that once delighted thou lovest and thy secret heart is laden with feelings which should not be unrequited and athanase then smiled as one oerladen with iron chains might smile to talk of bands twined round her lovers neck by some blithe maiden and said fragment twas at the season when the earth upsprings from slumber as a sphered angels child shadowing its eyes with green and golden wings stands up before its mother bright and mild of whose soft voice the air expectant seems so stood before the sun which shone and smiled to see it rise thus joyous from its dreams the fresh and radiant earth the hoary grove waxed green and flowers burst forth like starry beams the grass in the warm sun did start and move and seabuds burst under the waves serene how many a one though none be near to love loves then the shade of his own soul half seen in any mirror or the springs young minions the winged leaves amid the copses green how many a spirit then puts on the pinions of fancy and outstrips the lagging

boscombe manuscripts the poem is reprinted here from the editio princeps verbal alterations are recorded in the footnotes punctual in the editors notes at the end of volume advertisement the story of rosalind and helen is undoubtedly not an attempt in the highest style of poetry it is in no degree calculated to excite profound meditation and if by interesting the affections and amusing the imagination it awakens a certain ideal melancholy favourable to the reception of more important impressions it will produce in the reader all that the writer experienced in the composition i resigned myself as i wrote to the impulses of the feelings which moulded the conception of the story and this impulse determined the pauses of a measure which only pretends to be regular inasmuch as it corresponds with and expresses the irregularity of the imaginations which inspired it i do not know which of the few scattered poems i left in england will be selected by my bookseller to add to this collection one lines written among the euganean hills editor which i sent from italy was written after a days excursion among those lovely mountains which surround what was once the retreat and where is now the sepulchre of petrarch if any one is inclined to condemn the insertion of the introductory lines which image forth the sudden relief of a state of deep despondency by the radiant visions disclosed by the sudden burst of an italian sunrise in autumn on the highest peak of those delightful mountains i can only offer as my excuse that they were not erased at the request of a dear friend with whom added years of intercourse only add to my apprehension of its value and who would have had more right than any one to complain that she has not been able to extinguish in me the very power of delineating sadness naples december rosalind helen and her child scene the shore of the lake of como helen come hither my sweet rosalind tis long since thou and i have met and yet methinks it were unkind those moments to forget come sit by me i see thee stand by this lone lake in this far land thy loose hair in the light wind flying thy sweet voice to each tone of even united and thine eyes replying to the hues of yon fair heaven come gentle friend wilt sit by me and be as thou wert wont to be ere we were disunited none doth behold us now the power that led us forth at this lone hour will be but ill requited if thou depart in scorn oh come and talk of our abandoned home remember this is italy and we are exiles talk with me of that our land whose wilds and floods barren and dark although they be were dearer than these chestnut woods those heathy paths that inland stream and the blue mountains shapes which seem like wrecks of childhoods sunny dream which that we have abandoned now weighs on the heart like that remorse which altered friendship leaves i seek no more our youthful intercourse that cannot be rosalind speak speak to me leave me not when morn did come when evening fell upon our common home when for one hour we parted do not frown i would not chide thee though thy faith is broken but turn to me oh by this cherished token of woven hair which thou wilt not disown turn as twere but the memory of me and not my scorned self who prayed to thee rosalind is it a dream or do i see and hear frail helen i would flee thy tainting touch but former years arise and bring forbidden tears and my oerburthened memory seeks yet its lost repose in thee i share thy crime i cannot choose but weep for thee mine own strange grief but seldom stoops to such relief nor ever did i love thee less though mourning oer thy wickedness even with a sisters woe i knew what to the evil world is due and therefore sternly did refuse to link me with the infamy of one so lost as helen now bewildered by my dire despair wondering i blush and weep that thou shouldst love me still thou only there let us sit on that gray stone till our mournful talk be done helen alas not there i cannot bear the murmur of this lake to hear a sound from there rosalind dear which never yet i heard elsewhere but in our native land recurs even here where now we meet it stirs too much of suffocating sorrow in the dell of yon dark chestnutwood is a stone seat a solitude less like our own the ghost of peace will not desert this spot tomorrow if thy kind feelings should not cease we may sit here rosalind thou lead my sweet and i will follow henry tis fenicis seat where you are going this is not the way mamma it leads behind those trees that grow close to the little river helen yes i know i was bewildered kiss me and be gay dear boy why do you sob henry i do not know but it might break any ones heart to see you and the lady cry so bitterly helen it is a gentle child my friend go home henry and play with lilla till i come we only cried with joy to see each other we are quite merry now goodnight the boy lifted a sudden look upon his mother and in the gleam of forced and hollow joy which lightened oer her face laughed with the glee of light and unsuspecting infancy and whispered in her ear bring home with you that sweet strange ladyfriend then off he flew but stopped and beckoned with a meaning smile where the road turned pale rosalind the while hiding her face stood weeping silently in silence then they took the way beneath the forests solitude it was a vast and antique wood thro which they took their way and the gray shades of evening oer that green wilderness did fling still deeper solitude pursuing still the path that wound the vast and knotted trees around through which slow shades were wandering to a deep lawny dell they came to a stone seat beside a spring oer which the columned wood did frame a roofless temple like the fane where ere new creeds could faith obtain mans early race once knelt beneath the overhanging deity oer this fair fountain hung the sky now spangled with rare stars the snake the pale snake that with eager breath creeps here his noontide thirst to slake is beaming with many a mingled hue shed from yon domes eternal blue when he floats on that dark and lucid flood in the light of his own loveliness and the birds that in the fountain dip their plumes with fearless fellowship above and round him wheel and hover the fitful wind is heard to stir one solitary leaf on high the chirping of the grasshopper fills every pause there is emotion in all that dwells at noontide here then through the intricate wild wood a maze of life and light and motion is woven but there is stillness now gloom and the trance of nature now the snake is in his cave asleep the birds are on the branches dreaming only the shadows creep only the glowworm is gleaming only the owls and the nightingales wake in this dell when daylight fails and gray shades gather in the woods and the owls have all fled far away in a merrier glen to hoot and play for the moon is veiled and sleeping now the accustomed nightingale still broods on her accustomed bough but she is mute for her false mate has fled and left her desolate this silent spot tradition old had peopled with the spectral dead for the roots of the speakers hair felt cold and stiff as with tremulous lips he told that a hellish shape at midnight led the ghost of a youth with hoary hair and sate on the seat beside him there till a naked child came wandering by when the fiend would change to a lady fair a fearful tale the truth was worse for here a sister and a brother had solemnized a monstrous curse meeting in this fair solitude for beneath yon very sky had they resigned to one another body and soul the multitude tracking them to the secret wood tore limb from limb their innocent child and stabbed and trampled on its mother but the youth for gods most holy grace a priest saved to burn in the marketplace duly at evening helen came to this lone silent spot from the wrecks of a tale of wilder sorrow so much of sympathy to borrow as soothed her own dark lot duly each evening from her home with her fair child would helen come to sit upon that antique seat while the hues of day were pale and the bright boy beside her feet now lay lifting at intervals his broad blue eyes on her now where some sudden impulse calls following he was a gentle boy and in all gentle sorts took joy oft in a dry leaf for a boat with a small feather for a sail his fancy on that spring would float if some invisible breeze might stir its marble calm and helen smiled through tears of awe on the gay child to think that a boy as fair as he in years which never more may be by that same fount in that same wood the like sweet fancies had pursued and that a mother lost like her had mournfully sate watching him then all the scene was wont to swim through the mist of a burning tear for many months had helen known this scene and now she thither turned her footsteps not alone the friend whose falsehood she had mourned sate with her on that seat of stone silent they sate for evening and the power its glimpses bring had with one awful shadow quelled the passion of their grief they sate with linked hands for unrepelled had helen taken rosalinds like the autumn wind when it unbinds the tangled locks of the nightshades hair which is twined in the sultry summer air round the walls of an outworn sepulchre did the voice of helen sad and sweet and the sound of her heart that ever beat as with sighs and words she breathed on her unbind the knots of her friends despair till her thoughts were free to float and flow and from her labouring bosom now like the bursting of a prisoned flame the voice of a long pent sorrow came rosalind i saw the dark earth fall upon the coffin and i saw the stone laid over him whom this cold breast had pillowed to his nightly rest thou knowest not thou canst not know my agony oh i could not weep the sources whence such blessings flow were not to be approached by me but i could smile and i could sleep though with a selfaccusing heart in mornings light in evenings gloom i watched and would not thence depart my husbands unlamented tomb my children knew their sire was gone but when i told them he is dead they laughed aloud in frantic glee they clapped their hands and leaped about answering each others ecstasy with many a prank and merry shout but i sate silent and alone wrapped in the mock of mourning weed they laughed for he was dead but i sate with a hard and tearless eye and with a heart which would deny the secret joy it could not quell low muttering oer his loathed name till from that selfcontention came remorse where sin was none a hell which in pure spirits should not dwell ill tell thee truth he was a man hard selfish loving only gold yet full of guile his pale eyes ran with tears which each some falsehood told and oft his smooth and bridled tongue would give the lie to his flushing cheek he was a coward to the strong he was a tyrant to the weak on whom his vengeance he would wreak for scorn whose arrows search the heart from many a strangers eye would dart and on his memory cling and follow his soul to its home so cold and hollow he was a tyrant to the weak and we were such alas the day oft when my little ones at play were in youths natural lightness gay or if they listened to some tale of travellers or of fairy land when the light from the woodfires dying brand flashed on their faces if they heard or thought they heard upon the stair his footstep the suspended word died on my lips we all grew pale the babe at my bosom was hushed with fear if it thought it heard its father near and my two wild boys would near my knee cling cowed and cowering fearfully ill tell thee truth i loved another his name in my ear was ever ringing his form to my brain was ever clinging yet if some stranger breathed that name my lips turned white and my heart beat fast my nights were once haunted by dreams of flame my days were dim in the shadow cast by the memory of the same day and night day and night he was my breath and life and light for three short years which soon were passed on the fourth my gentle mother led me to the shrine to be his sworn bride eternally and now we stood on the altar stair when my father came from a distant land and with a loud and fearful cry rushed between us suddenly i saw the stream of his thin gray hair i saw his lean and lifted hand and heard his words and live oh god wherefore do i live hold hold he cried i tell thee tis her brother thy mother boy beneath the sod of yon churchyard rests in her shroud so cold i am now weak and pale and old we were once dear to one another i and that corpse thou art our child then with a laugh both long and wild the youth upon the pavement fell they found him dead all looked on me the spasms of my despair to see but i was calm i went away i was clammycold like clay i did not weep i did not speak but day by day week after week i walked about like a corpse alive alas sweet friend you must believe this heart is stone it did not break my father lived a little while but all might see that he was dying he smiled with such a woeful smile when he was in the churchyard lying among the worms we grew quite poor so that no one would give us bread my mother looked at me and said faint words of cheer which only meant that she could die and be content so i went forth from the same church door to another husbands bed and this was he who died at last when weeks and months and years had passed through which i firmly did fulfil my duties a devoted wife with the stern step of vanquished will walking beneath the night of life whose hours extinguished like slow rain falling for ever pain by pain the very hope of deaths dear rest which since the heart within my breast of natural life was dispossessed its strange sustainer there had been when flowers were dead and grass was green upon my mothers grave that mother whom to outlive and cheer and make my wan eyes glitter for her sake was my vowed task the single care which once gave life to my despair when she was a thing that did not stir and the crawling worms were cradling her to a sleep more deep and so more sweet than a babys rocked on its nurses knee i lived a living pulse then beat beneath my heart that awakened me what was this pulse so warm and free alas i knew it could not be my own dull blood twas like a thought of liquid love that spread and wrought under my bosom and in my brain and crept with the blood through every vein and hour by hour day after day the wonder could not charm away but laid in sleep my wakeful pain until i knew it was a child and then i wept for long long years these frozen eyes had shed no tears but now twas the season fair and mild when april has wept itself to may i sate through the sweet sunny day by my window bowered round with leaves and down my cheeks the quick tears fell like twinkling raindrops from the eaves when warm spring showers are passing oer o helen none can ever tell the joy it was to weep once more i wept to think how hard it were to kill my babe and take from it the sense of light and the warm air and my own fond and tender care and love and smiles ere i knew yet that these for it might as for me be the masks of a grinning mockery and haply i would dream twere sweet to feed it from my faded breast or mark my own hearts restless beat rock it to its untroubled rest and watch the growing soul beneath dawn in faint smiles and hear its breath half interrupted by calm sighs and search the depth of its fair eyes for long departed memories and so i lived till that sweet load was lightened darkly forward flowed the stream of years and on it bore two shapes of gladness to my sight two other babes delightful more in my lost souls abandoned night than their own country ships may be sailing towards wrecked mariners who cling to the rock of a wintry sea for each as it came brought soothing tears and a loosening warmth as each one lay sucking the sullen milk away about my frozen heart did play and weaned it oh how painfully as they themselves were weaned each one from that sweet food even from the thirst of death and nothingness and rest strange inmate of a living breast which all that i had undergone of grief and shame since she who first the gates of that dark refuge closed came to my sight and almost burst the seal of that lethean spring but these fair shadows interposed for all delights are shadows now and from my brain to my dull brow the heavy tears gather and flow i cannot speak oh let me weep the tears which fell from her wan eyes glimmered among the moonlight dew her deep hard sobs and heavy sighs their echoes in the darkness threw when she grew calm she thus did keep the tenor of her tale he died i know not how he was not old if age be numbered by its years but he was bowed and bent with fears pale with the quenchless thirst of gold which like fierce fever left him weak and his strait lip and bloated cheek were warped in spasms by hollow sneers and selfish cares with barren plough not age had lined his narrow brow and foul and cruel thoughts which feed upon the withering life within like vipers on some poisonous weed whether his ill were death or sin none knew until he died indeed and then men owned they were the same seven days within my chamber lay that corse and my babes made holiday at last i told them what is death the eldest with a kind of shame came to my knees with silent breath and sate awestricken at my feet and soon the others left their play and sate there too it is unmeet to shed on the brief flower of youth the withering knowledge of the grave from me remorse then wrung that truth i could not bear the joy which gave too just a response to mine own in vain i dared not feign a groan and in their artless looks i saw between the mists of fear and awe that my own thought was theirs and they expressed it not in words but said each in its heart how every day will pass in happy work and play now he is dead and gone away after the funeral all our kin assembled and the will was read my friend i tell thee even the dead have strength their putrid shrouds within to blast and torture those who live still fear the living but a corse is merciless and power doth give to such pale tyrants half the spoil he rends from those who groan and toil because they blush not with remorse among their crawling worms behold i have no child my tale grows old with grief and staggers let it reach the limits of my feeble speech and languidly at length recline on the brink of its own grave and mine thou knowest what a thing is poverty among the fallen on evil days tis crime and fear and infamy and houseless want in frozen ways wandering ungarmented and pain and worse than all that inward stain foul selfcontempt which drowns in sneers youths starlight smile and makes its tears first like hot gall then dry for ever and well thou knowest a mother never could doom her children to this ill and well he knew the same the will imported that if eer again i sought my children to behold or in my birthplace did remain beyond three days whose hours were told they should inherit nought and he to whom next came their patrimony a sallow lawyer cruel and cold aye watched me as the will was read with eyes askance which sought to see the secrets of my agony and with close lips and anxious brow stood canvassing still to and fro the chance of my resolve and all the dead mans caution just did call for in that killing lie twas said she is adulterous and doth hold in secret that the christian creed is false and therefore is much need that i should have a care to save my children from eternal fire friend he was sheltered by the grave and therefore dared to be a liar in truth the indian on the pyre of her dead husband half consumed as well might there be false as i to those abhorred embraces doomed far worse than fires brief agony as to the christian creed if true or false i never questioned it i took it as the vulgar do nor my vexed soul had leisure yet to doubt the things men say or deem that they are other than they seem all present who those crimes did hear in feigned or actual scorn and fear men women children slunk away whispering with selfcontented pride which half suspects its own base lie i spoke to none nor did abide but silently i went my way nor noticed i where joyously sate my two younger babes at play in the courtyard through which i passed but went with footsteps firm and fast till i came to the brink of the ocean green and there a woman with gray hairs who had my mothers servant been kneeling with many tears and prayers made me accept a purse of gold half of the earnings she had kept to refuge her when weak and old with woe which never sleeps or slept i wander now tis a vain thought but on yon alp whose snowy head mid the azure air is islanded we see it oer the flood of cloud which sunrise from its eastern caves drives wrinkling into golden waves hung with its precipices proud from that gray stone where first we met there now who knows the dead feel nought should be my grave for he who yet is my souls soul once said twere sweet mid stars and lightnings to abide and winds and lulling snows that beat with their soft flakes the mountain wide where weary meteor lamps repose and languid storms their pinions close and all things strong and bright and pure and ever during aye endure who knows if one were buried there but these things might our spirits make amid the allsurrounding air their own eternity partake then twas a wild and playful saying at which i laughed or seemed to laugh they were his words now heed my praying and let them be my epitaph thy memory for a term may be my monument wilt remember me i know thou wilt and canst forgive whilst in this erring world to live my soul disdained not that i thought its lying forms were worthy aught and much less thee helen o speak not so but come to me and pour thy woe into this heart full though it be ay overflowing with its own i thought that grief had severed me from all beside who weep and groan its likeness upon earth to be its express image but thou art more wretched sweet we will not part henceforth if death be not division if so the dead feel no contrition but wilt thou hear since last we parted all that has left me broken hearted rosalind yes speak the faintest stars are scarcely shorn of their thin beams by that delusive morn which sinks again in darkness like the light of early love soon lost in total night helen alas italian winds are mild but my bosom is cold wintry cold when the warm air weaves among the fresh leaves soft music my poor brain is wild and i am weak like a nursling child though my soul with grief is gray and old rosalind weep not at thine own words though they must make me weep what is thy tale helen i fear twill shake thy gentle heart with tears thou well rememberest when we met no more and though i dwelt with lionel that friendless caution pierced me sore with grief a wound my spirit bore indignantly but when he died with him lay dead both hope and pride alas all hope is buried now but then men dreamed the aged earth was labouring in that mighty birth which many a poet and a sage has aye foreseen the happy age when truth and love shall dwell below among the works and ways of men which on this world not power but will even now is wanting to fulfil among mankind what thence befell of strife how vain is known too well when libertys dear paean fell mid murderous howls to lionel though of great wealth and lineage high yet through those dungeon walls there came thy thrilling light o liberty and as the meteors midnight flame startles the dreamer sunlike truth flashed on his visionary youth and filled him not with love but faith and hope and courage mute in death for love and life in him were twins born at one birth in every other first life then love its course begins though they be children of one mother and so through this dark world they fleet divided till in death they meet but he loved all things ever then he passed amid the strife of men and stood at the throne of armed power pleading for a world of woe secure as one on a rockbuilt tower oer the wrecks which the surge trails to and fro mid the passions wild of human kind he stood like a spirit calming them for it was said his words could bind like music the lulled crowd and stem that torrent of unquiet dream which mortals truth and reason deem but is revenge and fear and pride joyous he was and hope and peace on all who heard him did abide raining like dew from his sweet talk as where the evening star may walk along the brink of the gloomy seas liquid mists of splendour quiver his very gestures touched to tears the unpersuaded tyrant never so moved before his presence stung the torturers with their victims pain and none knew how and through their ears the subtle witchcraft of his tongue unlocked the hearts of those who keep gold the worlds bond of slavery men wondered and some sneered to see one sow what he could never reap for he is rich they said and young and might drink from the depths of luxury if he seeks fame fame never crowned the champion of a trampled creed if he seeks power power is enthroned mid ancient rights and wrongs to feed which hungry wolves with praise and spoil those who would sit near power must toil and such there sitting all may see what seeks he all that others seek he casts away like a vile weed which the sea casts unreturningly that poor and hungry men should break the laws which wreak them toil and scorn we understand but lionel we know is rich and nobly born so wondered they yet all men loved young lionel though few approved all but the priests whose hatred fell like the unseen blight of a smiling day the withering honey dew which clings under the bright green buds of may whilst they unfold their emerald wings for he made verses wild and queer on the strange creeds priests hold so dear because they bring them land and gold of devils and saints and all such gear he made tales which whoso heard or read would laugh till he were almost dead so this grew a proverb dont get old till lionels banquet in hell you hear and then you will laugh yourself young again so the priests hated him and he repaid their hate with cheerful glee ah smiles and joyance quickly died for public hope grew pale and dim in an altered time and tide and in its wasting withered him as a summer flower that blows too soon droops in the smile of the waning moon when it scatters through an april night the frozen dews of wrinkling blight none now hoped more gray power was seated safely on her ancestral throne and faith the python undefeated even to its bloodstained steps dragged on her foul and wounded train and men were trampled and deceived again and words and shows again could bind the wailing tribes of human kind in scorn and famine fire and blood raged round the raging multitude to fields remote by tyrants sent to be the scorned instrument with which they drag from mines of gore the chains their slaves yet ever wore and in the streets men met each other and by old altars and in halls and smiled again at festivals but each man found in his hearts brother cold cheer for all though half deceived the outworn creeds again believed and the same round anew began which the weary world yet ever ran many then wept not tears but gall within their hearts like drops which fall wasting the fountainstone away and in that dark and evil day did all desires and thoughts that claim mens care ambition friendship fame love hope though hope was now despair indue the colours of this change as from the allsurrounding air the earth takes hues obscure and strange when storm and earthquake linger there and so my friend it then befell to many most to lionel whose hope was like the life of youth within him and when dead became a spirit of unresting flame which goaded him in his distress over the worlds vast wilderness three years he left his native land and on the fourth when he returned none knew him he was stricken deep with some disease of mind and turned into aught unlike lionel on him on whom did he pause in sleep serenest smiles were wont to keep and did he wake a winged band of bright persuasions which had fed on his sweet lips and liquid eyes kept their swift pinions half outspread to do on men his least command on him whom once twas paradise even to behold now misery lay in his own heart twas merciless to all things else none may express its innocence and tenderness twas said that he had refuge sought in love from his unquiet thought in distant lands and been deceived by some strange show for there were found blotted with tears as those relieved by their own words are wont to do these mournful verses on the ground by all who read them blotted too how am i changed my hopes were once like fire i loved and i believed that life was love how am i lost on wings of swift desire among heavens winds my spirit once did move i slept and silver dreams did aye inspire my liquid sleep i woke and did approve all nature to my heart and thought to make a paradise of earth for one sweet sake i love but i believe in love no more i feel desire but hope not o from sleep most vainly must my weary brain implore its long lost flattery now i wake to weep and sit through the long day gnawing the core of my bitter heart and like a miser keep since none in what i feel take pain or pleasure to my own soul its selfconsuming treasure he dwelt beside me near the sea and oft in evening did we meet when the waves beneath the starlight flee oer the yellow sands with silver feet and talked our talk was sad and sweet till slowly from his mien there passed the desolation which it spoke and smiles as when the lightnings blast has parched some heavendelighting oak the next spring shows leaves pale and rare but like flowers delicate and fair on its rent boughs again arrayed his countenance in tender light his words grew subtile fire which made the air his hearers breathed delight his motions like the winds were free which bend the bright grass gracefully then fade away in circlets faint and winged hope on which upborne his soul seemed hovering in his eyes like some bright spirit newly born floating amid the sunny skies sprang forth from his rent heart anew yet oer his talk and looks and mien tempering their loveliness too keen past woe its shadow backward threw till like an exhalation spread from flowers half drunk with evening dew they did become infectious sweet and subtle mists of sense and thought which wrapped us soon when we might meet almost from our own looks and aught the wild world holds and so his mind was healed while mine grew sick with fear for ever now his health declined like some frail bark which cannot bear the impulse of an altered wind though prosperous and my heart grew full mid its new joy of a new care for his cheek became not pale but fair as roseoershadowed lilies are and soon his deep and sunny hair in this alone less beautiful like grass in tombs grew wild and rare the blood in his translucent veins beat not like animal life but love seemed now its sullen springs to move when life had failed and all its pains and sudden sleep would seize him oft like death so calm but that a tear his pointed eyelashes between would gather in the light serene of smiles whose lustre bright and soft beneath lay undulating there his breath was like inconstant flame as eagerly it went and came and i hung oer him in his sleep till like an image in the lake which rains disturb my tears would break the shadow of that slumber deep then he would bid me not to weep and say with flattery false yet sweet that death and he could never meet if i would never part with him and so we loved and did unite all that in us was yet divided for when he said that many a rite by men to bind but once provided could not be shared by him and me or they would kill him in their glee i shuddered and then laughing said we will have rites our faith to bind but our church shall be the starry night our altar the grassy earth outspread and our priest the muttering wind twas sunset as i spoke one star had scarce burst forth when from afar the ministers of misrule sent seized upon lionel and bore his chained limbs to a dreary tower in the midst of a city vast and wide for he they said from his mind had bent against their gods keen blasphemy for which though his soul must roasted be in hells red lakes immortally yet even on earth must he abide the vengeance of their slaves a trial i think men call it what avail are prayers and tears which chase denial from the fierce savage nursed in hate what the knit soul that pleading and pale makes wan the quivering cheek which late it painted with its own delight we were divided as i could i stilled the tingling of my blood and followed him in their despite as a widow follows pale and wild the murderers and corse of her only child and when we came to the prison door and i prayed to share his dungeon floor with prayers which rarely have been spurned and when men drove me forth and i stared with blank frenzy on the sky a farewell look of love he turned half calming me then gazed awhile as if thro that black and massy pile and thro the crowd around him there and thro the dense and murky air and the thronged streets he did espy what poets know and prophesy and said with voice that made them shiver and clung like music in my brain and which the mute walls spoke again prolonging it with deepened strain fear not the tyrants shall rule for ever or the priests of the bloody faith they stand on the brink of that mighty river whose waves they have tainted with death it is fed from the depths of a thousand dells around them it foams and rages and swells and their swords and their sceptres i floating see like wrecks in the surge of eternity i dwelt beside the prison gate and the strange crowd that out and in passed some no doubt with mine own fate might have fretted me with its ceaseless din but the fever of care was louder within soon but too late in penitence or fear his foes released him thence i saw his thin and languid form as leaning on the jailors arm whose hardened eyes grew moist the while to meet his mute and faded smile and hear his words of kind farewell he tottered forth from his damp cell many had never wept before from whom fast tears then gushed and fell many will relent no more who sobbed like infants then aye all who thronged the prisons stony hall the rulers or the slaves of law felt with a new surprise and awe that they were human till strong shame made them again become the same the prison bloodhounds huge and grim from human looks the infection caught and fondly crouched and fawned on him and men have heard the prisoners say who in their rotting dungeons lay that from that hour throughout one day the fierce despair and hate which kept their trampled bosoms almost slept where like twin vultures they hung feeding on each hearts wound wide torn and bleeding because their jailors rule they thought grew merciful like a parents sway i know not how but we were free and lionel sate alone with me as the carriage drove thro the streets apace and we looked upon each others face and the blood in our fingers intertwined ran like the thoughts of a single mind as the swift emotions went and came thro the veins of each united frame so thro the long long streets we passed of the millionpeopled city vast which is that desert where each one seeks his mate yet is alone beloved and sought and mourned of none until the clear blue sky was seen and the grassy meadows bright and green and then i sunk in his embrace enclosing there a mighty space of love and so we travelled on by woods and fields of yellow flowers and towns and villages and towers day after day of happy hours it was the azure time of june when the skies are deep in the stainless noon and the warm and fitful breezes shake the fresh green leaves of the hedgerow briar and there were odours then to make the very breath we did respire a liquid element whereon our spirits like delighted things that walk the air on subtle wings floated and mingled far away mid the warm winds of the sunny day and when the evening star came forth above the curve of the new bent moon and light and sound ebbed from the earth like the tide of the full and the weary sea to the depths of its own tranquillity our natures to its own repose did the earths breathless sleep attune like flowers which on each other close their languid leaves when daylights gone we lay till new emotions came which seemed to make each mortal frame one soul of interwoven flame a life in life a second birth in worlds diviner far than earth which like two strains of harmony that mingle in the silent sky then slowly disunite passed by and left the tenderness of tears a soft oblivion of all fears a sweet sleep so we travelled on till we came to the home of lionel among the mountains wild and lone beside the hoary western sea which near the verge of the echoing shore the massy forest shadowed oer the ancient steward with hair all hoar as we alighted wept to see his master changed so fearfully and the old mans sobs did waken me from my dream of unremaining gladness the truth flashed oer me like quick madness when i looked and saw that there was death on lionel yet day by day he lived till fear grew hope and faith and in my soul i dared to say nothing so bright can pass away death is dark and foul and dull but he is o how beautiful yet day by day he grew more weak and his sweet voice when he might speak which neer was loud became more low and the light which flashed through his waxen cheek grew faint as the roselike hues which flow from sunset oer the alpine snow and death seemed not like death in him for the spirit of life oer every limb lingered a mist of sense and thought when the summer wind faint odours brought from mountain flowers even as it passed his cheek would change as the noonday sea which the dying breeze sweeps fitfully if but a cloud the sky oercast you might see his colour come and go and the softest strain of music made sweet smiles yet sad arise and fade amid the dew of his tender eyes and the breath with intermitting flow made his pale lips quiver and part you might hear the beatings of his heart quick but not strong and with my tresses when oft he playfully would bind in the bowers of mossy lonelinesses his neck and win me so to mingle in the sweet depth of woven caresses and our faint limbs were intertwined alas the unquiet life did tingle from mine own heart through every vein like a captive in dreams of liberty who beats the walls of his stony cell but his it seemed already free like the shadow of fire surrounding me on my faint eyes and limbs did dwell that spirit as it passed till soon as a frail cloud wandering oer the moon beneath its light invisible is seen when it folds its gray wings again to alight on midnights dusky plain i lived and saw and the gathering soul passed from beneath that strong control and i fell on a life which was sick with fear of all the woe that now i bear amid a bloomless myrtle wood on a green and seagirt promontory not far from where we dwelt there stood in record of a sweet sad story an altar and a temple bright circled by steps and oer the gate was sculptured to fidelity and in the shrine an image sate all veiled but there was seen the light of smiles which faintly could express a mingled pain and tenderness through that ethereal drapery the left hand held the head the right beyond the veil beneath the skin you might see the nerves quivering within was forcing the point of a barbed dart into its sideconvulsing heart an unskilled hand yet one informed with genius had the marble warmed with that pathetic life this tale it told a dog had from the sea when the tide was raging fearfully dragged lionels mother weak and pale then died beside her on the sand and she that temple thence had planned but it was lionels own hand had wrought the image each new moon that lady did in this lone fane the rites of a religion sweet whose god was in her heart and brain the seasons loveliest flowers were strewn on the marble floor beneath her feet and she brought crowns of seabuds white whose odour is so sweet and faint and weeds like branching chrysolite woven in devices fine and quaint and tears from her brown eyes did stain the altar need but look upon that dying statue fair and wan if tears should cease to weep again and rare arabian odours came through the myrtle copses steaming thence from the hissing frankincense whose smoke woolwhite as ocean foam hung in dense flocks beneath the dome that ivory dome whose azure night with golden stars like heaven was bright oer the split cedars pointed flame and the ladys harp would kindle there the melody of an old air softer than sleep the villagers mixed their religion up with hers and as they listened round shed tears one eve he led me to this fane daylight on its last purple cloud was lingering gray and soon her strain the nightingale began now loud climbing in circles the windless sky now dying music suddenly tis scattered in a thousand notes and now to the hushed ear it floats like field smells known in infancy then failing soothes the air again we sate within that temple lone pavilioned round with parian stone his mothers harp stood near and oft i had awakened music soft amid its wires the nightingale was pausing in her heaventaught tale now drain the cup said lionel which the poetbird has crowned so well with the wine of her bright and liquid song heardst thou not sweet words among that heavenresounding minstrelsy heardst thou not that those who die awake in a world of ecstasy that love when limbs are interwoven and sleep when the night of life is cloven and thought to the worlds dim boundaries clinging and music when one beloved is singing is death let us drain right joyously the cup which the sweet bird fills for me he paused and to my lips he bent his own like spirit his words went through all my limbs with the speed of fire and his keen eyes glittering through mine filled me with the flame divine which in their orbs was burning far like the light of an unmeasured star in the sky of midnight dark and deep yes twas his soul that did inspire sounds which my skill could neer awaken and first i felt my fingers sweep the harp and a long quivering cry burst from my lips in symphony the dusk and solid air was shaken as swift and swifter the notes came from my touch that wandered like quick flame and from my bosom labouring with some unutterable thing the awful sound of my own voice made my faint lips tremble in some mood of wordless thought lionel stood so pale that even beside his cheek the snowy column from its shade caught whiteness yet his countenance raised upward burned with radiance of spiritpiercing joy whose light like the moon struggling through the night of whirlwindrifted clouds did break with beams that might not be confined i paused but soon his gestures kindled new power as by the moving wind the waves are lifted and my song to low soft notes now changed and dwindled and from the twinkling wires among my languid fingers drew and flung circles of lifedissolving sound yet faint in aery rings they bound my lionel who as every strain grew fainter but more sweet his mien sunk with the sound relaxedly and slowly now he turned to me as slowly faded from his face that awful joy with looks serene he was soon drawn to my embrace and my wild song then died away in murmurs words i dare not say we mixed and on his lips mine fed till they methought felt still and cold what is it with thee love i said no word no look no motion yes there was a change but spare to guess nor let that moments hope be told i looked and knew that he was dead and fell as the eagle on the plain falls when life deserts her brain and the mortal lightning is veiled again o that i were now dead but such did they not love demand too much those dying murmurs he forbade o that i once again were mad and yet dear rosalind not so for i would live to share thy woe sweet boy did i forget thee too alas we know not what we do when we speak words no memory more is in my mind of that sea shore madness came on me and a troop of misty shapes did seem to sit beside me on a vessels poop and the clear north wind was driving it then i heard strange tongues and saw strange flowers and the stars methought grew unlike ours and the azure sky and the stormless sea made me believe that i had died and waked in a world which was to me drear hell though heaven to all beside then a dead sleep fell on my mind whilst animal life many long years had rescued from a chasm of tears and when i woke i wept to find that the same lady bright and wise with silver locks and quick brown eyes the mother of my lionel had tended me in my distress and died some months before nor less wonder but far more peace and joy brought in that hour my lovely boy for through that trance my soul had well the impress of thy being kept and if i waked or if i slept no doubt though memory faithless be thy image ever dwelt on me and thus o lionel like thee is our sweet child tis sure most strange i knew not of so great a change as that which gave him birth who now is all the solace of my woe that lionel great wealth had left by will to me and that of all the ready lies of law bereft my child and me might well befall but let me think not of the scorn which from the meanest i have borne when for my childs beloved sake i mixed with slaves to vindicate the very laws themselves do make let me not say scorn is my fate lest i be proud suffering the same with those who live in deathless fame she ceased lo where red morning thro the woods is burning oer the dew said rosalind and with these words they rose and towards the flood of the blue lake beneath the leaves now wind with equal steps and fingers intertwined thence to a lonely dwelling where the shore is shadowed with steep rocks and cypresses cleave with their dark green cones the silent skies and with their shadows the clear depths below and where a little terrace from its bowers of blooming myrtle and faint lemonflowers scatters its sensedissolving fragrance oer the liquid marble of the windless lake and where the aged forests limbs look hoar under the leaves which their green garments make they come tis helens home and clean and white like one which tyrants spare on our own land in some such solitude its casements bright shone through their vineleaves in the morning sun and even within twas scarce like italy and when she saw how all things there were planned as in an english home dim memory disturbed poor rosalind she stood as one whose mind is where his body cannot be till helen led her where her child yet slept and said observe that brow was lionels those lips were his and so he ever kept one arm in sleep pillowing his head with it you cannot see his eyes they are two wells of liquid love let us not wake him yet but rosalind could bear no more and wept a shower of burning tears which fell upon his face and so his opening lashes shone with tears unlike his own as he did leap in sudden wonder from his innocent sleep so rosalind and helen lived together thenceforth changed in all else yet friends again such as they were when oer the mountain heather they wandered in their youth through sun and rain and after many years for human things change even like the ocean and the wind her daughter was restored to rosalind and in their circle thence some visitings of joy mid their new calm would intervene a lovely child she was of looks serene and motions which oer things indifferent shed the grace and gentleness from whence they came and helens boy grew with her and they fed from the same flowers of thought until each mind like springs which mingle in one flood became and in their union soon their parents saw the shadow of the peace denied to them and rosalind for when the living stem is cankered in its heart the tree must fall died ere her time and with deep grief and awe the pale survivors followed her remains beyond the region of dissolving rains up the cold mountain she was wont to call her tomb and on chiavennas precipice they raised a pyramid of lasting ice whose polished sides ere day had yet begun caught the first glow of the unrisen sun the last when it had sunk and thro the night the charioteers of arctos wheeled round its glittering point as seen from helens home whose sad inhabitants each year would come with willing steps climbing that rugged height and hang long locks of hair and garlands bound with amaranth flowers which in the climes despite filled the frore air with unaccustomed light such flowers as in the wintry memory bloom of one friend left adorned that frozen tomb helen whose spirit was of softer mould whose sufferings too were less death slowlier led into the peace of his dominion cold she died among her kindred being old and know that if love die not in the dead as in the living none of mortal kind are blest as now helen and rosalind notes from therefrom thee edition fellran edition

rescuerescued edition see editors note note by mrs shelley rosalind and helen was begun at marlow and thrown aside till i found it and at my request it was completed shelley had no care for any of his poems that did not emanate from the depths of his mind and develop some high or abstruse truth when he does touch on human life and the human heart no pictures can be more faithful more delicate more subtle or more pathetic he never mentioned love but he shed a grace borrowed from his own nature that scarcely any other poet has bestowed on that passion when he spoke of it as the law of life which inasmuch as we rebel against we err and injure ourselves and others he promulgated that which he considered an irrefragable truth in his eyes it was the essence of our being and all woe and pain arose from the war made against it by selfishness or insensibility or mistake by reverting in his mind to this first principle he discovered the source of many emotions and could disclose the secrets of all hearts and his delineations of passion and emotion touch the finest chords of our nature rosalind and helen was finished during the summer of while we were at the baths of lucca julian and maddalo a conversation composed at este after shelleys first visit to venice autumn first published in the posthumous poems london edition mrs shelley shelleys original intention had been to print the poem in

at the end of the volume preface the meadows with fresh streams the bees with thyme the goats with the green leaves of budding spring are saturated not nor love with tears virgils gallus count maddalo is a venetian nobleman of ancient family and of great fortune who without mixing much in the society of his countrymen resides chiefly at his magnificent palace in that city he is a person of the most consummate genius and capable if he would direct his energies to such an end of becoming the redeemer of his degraded country but it is his weakness to be proud he derives from a comparison of his own extraordinary mind with the dwarfish intellects that surround him an intense apprehension of the nothingness of human life his passions and his powers are incomparably greater than those of other men and instead of the latter having been employed in curbing the former they have mutually lent each other strength his ambition preys upon itself for want of objects which it can consider worthy of exertion i say that maddalo is proud because i can find no other word to express the concentred and impatient feelings which consume him but it is on his own hopes and affections only that he seems to trample for in social life no human being can be more gentle patient and unassuming than maddalo he is cheerful frank and witty his more serious conversation is a sort of intoxication men are held by it as by a spell he has travelled much and there is an inexpressible charm in his relation of his adventures in different countries julian is an englishman of good family passionately attached to those philosophical notions which assert the power of man over his own mind and the immense improvements of which by the extinction of certain moral superstitions human society may be yet susceptible without concealing the evil in the world he is for ever speculating how good may be made superior he is a complete infidel and a scoffer at all things reputed holy and maddalo takes a wicked pleasure in drawing out his taunts against religion what maddalo thinks on these matters is not exactly known julian in spite of his heterodox opinions is conjectured by his friends to possess some good qualities how far this is possible the pious reader will determine julian is rather serious of the maniac i can give no information he seems by his own account to have been disappointed in love he was evidently a very cultivated and amiable person when in his right senses his story told at length might be like many other stories of the same kind the unconnected exclamations of his agony will perhaps be found a sufficient comment for the text of every heart i rode one evening with count maddalo upon the bank of land which breaks the flow of adria towards venice a bare strand of hillocks heaped from evershifting sand matted with thistles and amphibious weeds such as from earths embrace the salt ooze breeds is this an uninhabited seaside which the lone fisher when his nets are dried abandons and no other object breaks the waste but one dwarf tree and some few stakes broken and unrepaired and the tide makes a narrow space of level sand thereon where twas our wont to ride while day went down this ride was my delight i love all waste and solitary places where we taste the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remembered friend i love to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripped to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth harmonising with solitude and sent into our hearts aereal merriment so as we rode we talked and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingered not but flew from brain to brain such glee was ours charged with light memories of remembered hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argued against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side the sense that he was greater than his kind had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light meanwhile the sun paused ere it should alight over the horizon of the mountains oh how beautiful is sunset when the glow of heaven descends upon a land like thee thou paradise of exiles italy thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then just where we had dismounted the counts men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood which lay between the city and the shore paved with the image of the skythe hoar and aery alps towards the north appeared through mist an heavensustaining bulwark reared between the east and west and half the sky was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paused in his descent among the manyfolded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peaked isles and then as if the earth and sea had been dissolved into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent ere it fade said my companion i will show you soon a better station so oer the lagune we glided and from that funereal bark i leaned and saw the city and could mark how from their many isles in evenings gleam its temples and its palaces did seem like fabrics of enchantment piled to heaven i was about to speak when we are even now at the point i meant said maddalo and bade the gondolieri cease to row look julian on the west and listen well if you hear not a deep and heavy bell i looked and saw between us and the sun a building on an island such a one as age to age might add for uses vile a windowless deformed and dreary pile and on the top an open tower where hung a bell which in the radiance swayed and swung we could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue the broad sun sunk behind it and it tolled in strong and black relief what we behold shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower said maddalo and ever at this hour those who may cross the water hear that bell which calls the maniacs each one from his cell to vespers as much skill as need to pray in thanks or hope for their dark lot have they to their stern maker i replied o ho you talk as in years past said maddalo tis strange men change not you were ever still among christs flock a perilous infidel a wolf for the meek lambs if you cant swim beware of providence i looked on him but the gay smile had faded in his eye and such he cried is our mortality and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heavenillumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below round the rent heart and pray as madmen do for what they know not till the night of death as sunset that strange vision severeth our memory from itself and us from all we sought and yet were baffled i recall the sense of what he said although i mar the force of his expressions the broad star of day meanwhile had sunk behind the hill and the black bell became invisible and the red tower looked gray and all between the churches ships and palaces were seen huddled in gloom into the purple sea the orange hues of heaven sunk silently we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyes oh speak not of her eyes which seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered salutations past the word you spoke last night might well have cast a darkness on my spirit if man be the passive thing you say i should not see much harm in the religions and old saws tho i may never own such leaden laws which break a teachless nature to the yoke mine is another faith thus much i spoke and noting he replied not added see this lovely child blithe innocent and free she spends a happy time with little care while we to such sick thoughts subjected are as came on you last night it is our will that thus enchains us to permitted ill we might be otherwise we might be all we dream of happy high majestical where is the love beauty and truth we seek but in our mind and if we were not weak should we be less in deed than in desire ay if we were not weak and we aspire how vainly to be strong said maddalo you talk utopia it remains to know i then rejoined and those who try may find how strong the chains are which our spirit bind brittle perchance as strawwe are assured much may be conquered much may be endured of what degrades and crushes us we know that we have power over ourselves to do and suffer what we know not till we try but something nobler than to live and die so taught those kings of old philosophy who reigned before religion made men blind and those who suffer with their suffering kind yet feel their faith religion my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutationtight as far as words go i knew one like you who to this city came some months ago with whom i argued in this sort and he is now gone mad and so he answered me poor fellow but if you would like to go well visit him and his wild talk will show how vain are such aspiring theories i hope to prove the induction otherwise and that a want of that true theory still which seeks a soul of goodness in things ill or in himself or others has thus bowed his being there are some by nature proud who patient in all else demand but this to love and be beloved with gentleness and being scorned what wonder if they die some living death this is not destiny but mans own wilful ill as thus i spoke servants announced the gondola and we through the fastfalling rain and highwrought sea sailed to the island where the madhouse stands we disembarked the clap of tortured hands fierce yells and howlings and lamentings keen and laughter where complaint had merrier been moans shrieks and curses and blaspheming prayers accosted us we climbed the oozy stairs into an old courtyard i heard on high then fragments of most touching melody but looking up saw not the singer there through the black bars in the tempestuous air i saw like weeds on a wrecked palace growing long tangled locks flung wildly forth and flowing of those who on a sudden were beguiled into strange silence and looked forth and smiled hearing sweet sounds then i methinks there were a cure of these with patience and kind care if music can thus movebut what is he whom we seek here of his sad history i know but this said maddalo he came to venice a dejected man and fame said he was wealthy or he had been so some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe but he was ever talking in such sort as you do far more sadly he seemed hurt even as a man with his peculiar wrong to hear but of the oppression of the strong or those absurd deceits i think with you in some respects you know which carry through the excellent impostors of this earth when they outface detection he had worth poor fellow but a humorist in his way alas what drove him mad i cannot say a lady came with him from france and when she left him and returned he wandered then about yon lonely isles of desert sand till he grew wild he had no cash or land remaining the police had brought him here some fancy took him and he would not bear removal so i fitted up for him those rooms beside the sea to please his whim and sent him busts and books and urns for flowers which had adorned his life in happier hours and instruments of music you may guess a stranger could do little more or less for one so gentle and unfortunate and those are his sweet strains which charm the weight from madmens chains and make this hell appear a heaven of sacred silence hushed to hear nay this was kind of you he had no claim as the world says none but the very same which i on all mankind were i as he fallen to such deep reverse his melody is interrupted now we hear the din of madmen shriek on shriek again begin let us now visit him after this strain he ever communes with himself again and sees nor hears not any having said these words we called the keeper and he led to an apartment opening on the sea there the poor wretch was sitting mournfully near a piano his pale fingers twined one with the other and the ooze and wind rushed through an open casement and did sway his hair and starred it with the brackish spray his head was leaning on a music book and he was muttering and his lean limbs shook his lips were pressed against a folded leaf in hue too beautiful for health and grief smiled in their motions as they lay apart as one who wrought from his own fervid heart the eloquence of passion soon he raised his sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed and spoke sometimes as one who wrote and thought his words might move some heart that heeded not if sent to distant lands and then as one reproaching deeds never to be undone with wondering selfcompassion then his speech was lost in grief and then his words came each unmodulated cold expressionless but that from one jarred accent you might guess it was despair made them so uniform and all the while the loud and gusty storm hissed through the window and we stood behind stealing his accents from the envious wind unseen i yet remember what he said distinctly such impression his words made month after month he cried to bear this load and as a jade urged by the whip and goad to drag life on which like a heavy chain lengthens behind with many a link of pain and not to speak my grief o not to dare to give a human voice to my despair but live and move and wretched thing smile on as if i never went aside to groan and wear this mask of falsehood even to those who are most dear not for my own repose alas no scorn or pain or hate could be so heavy as that falsehood is to me but that i cannot bear more altered faces than needs must be more changed and cold embraces more misery disappointment and mistrust to own me for their fatherwould the dust were covered in upon my body now that the life ceased to toil within my brow and then these thoughts would at the least be fled let us not fear such pain can vex the dead what power delights to torture us i know that to myself i do not wholly owe what now i suffer though in part i may alas none strewed sweet flowers upon the way where wandering heedlessly i met pale pain my shadow which will leave me not again if i have erred there was no joy in error but pain and insult and unrest and terror i have not as some do bought penitence with pleasure and a dark yet sweet offence for then if love and tenderness and truth had overlived hopes momentary youth my creed should have redeemed me from repenting but loathed scorn and outrage unrelenting met love excited by far other seeming until the end was gainedas one from dreaming of sweetest peace i woke and found my state such as it is o thou my spirits mate who for thou art compassionate and wise wouldst pity me from thy most gentle eyes if this sad writing thou shouldst ever see my secret groans must be unheard by thee thou wouldst weep tears bitter as blood to know thy lost friends incommunicable woe ye few by whom my nature has been weighed in friendship let me not that name degrade by placing on your hearts the secret load which crushes mine to dust there is one road to peace and that is truth which follow ye love sometimes leads astray to misery yet think not though subdued and i may well say that i am subdued that the full hell within me would infect the untainted breast of sacred nature with its own unrest as some perverted beings think to find in scorn or hate a medicine for the mind which scorn or hate have wounded o how vain the dagger heals not but may rend again believe that i am ever still the same in creed as in resolve and what may tame my heart must leave the understanding free or all would sink in this keen agony nor dream that i will join the vulgar cry or with my silence sanction tyranny or seek a moments shelter from my pain in any madness which the world calls gain ambition or revenge or thoughts as stern as those which make me what i am or turn to avarice or misanthropy or lust heap on me soon o grave thy welcome dust till then the dungeon may demand its prey and poverty and shame may meet and say halting beside me on the public way that lovedevoted youth is ours lets sit beside him he may live some six months yet or the red scaffold as our country bends may ask some willing victim or ye friends may fall under some sorrow which this heart or hand may share or vanquish or avert i am prepared in truth with no proud joy to do or suffer aught as when a boy i did devote to justice and to love my nature worthless now i must remove a veil from my pent mind tis torn aside o pallid as deaths dedicated bride thou mockery which art sitting by my side am i not wan like thee at the graves call i haste invited to thy weddingball to greet the ghastly paramour for whom thou hast deserted meand made the tomb thy bridal bedbut i beside your feet will lie and watch ye from my windingsheet thuswide awake tho deadyet stay o stay go not so soon i know not what i say hear but my reasonsi am mad i fear my fancy is oerwroughtthou art not here pale art thou tis most truebut thou art gone thy work is finishedi am left alone nay was it i who wooed thee to this breast which like a serpent thou envenomest as in repayment of the warmth it lent didst thou not seek me for thine own content did not thy love awaken mine i thought that thou wert she who said you kiss me not ever i fear you do not love me now in truth i loved even to my overthrow her who would fain forget these words but they cling to her mind and cannot pass away you say that i am proud that when i speak my lip is tortured with the wrongs which break the spirit it expressesnever one humbled himself before as i have done even the instinctive worm on which we tread turns though it wound not then with prostrate head sinks in the dusk and writhes like me and dies no wears a living death of agonies as the slow shadows of the pointed grass mark the eternal periods his pangs pass slow evermoving making moments be as mine seem each an immortality that you had never seen me never heard my voice and more than all had neer endured the deep pollution of my loathed embrace that your eyes neer had lied love in my face that like some maniac monk i had torn out the nerves of manhood by their bleeding root with mine own quivering fingers so that neer our hearts had for a moment mingled there to disunite in horror these were not with thee like some suppressed and hideous thought which flits athwart our musings but can find no rest within a pure and gentle mind thou sealedst them with many a bare broad word and searedst my memory oer them for i heard and can forget notthey were ministered one after one those curses mix them up like selfdestroying poisons in one cup and they will make one blessing which thou neer didst imprecate for on me death it were a cruel punishment for one most cruel if such can love to make that love the fuel of the minds hell hate scorn remorse despair but me whose heart a strangers tear might wear as waterdrops the sandy fountainstone who loved and pitied all things and could moan for woes which others hear not and could see the absent with the glance of phantasy and with the poor and trampled sit and weep following the captive to his dungeon deep me who am as a nerve oer which do creep the else unfelt oppressions of this earth and was to thee the flame upon thy hearth when all beside was cold that thou on me shouldst rain these plagues of blistering agony such curses are from lips once eloquent with loves too partial praise let none relent who intend deeds too dreadful for a name henceforth if an example for the same they seekfor thou on me lookedst so and so and didst speak thusand thusi live to show how much men bear and die not thou wilt tell with the grimace of hate how horrible it was to meet my love when thine grew less thou wilt admire how i could eer address such features to loves workthis taunt though true for indeed nature nor in form nor hue bestowed on me her choicest workmanship shall not be thy defencefor since thy lip met mine first years long past since thine eye kindled with soft fire under mine i have not dwindled nor changed in mind or body or in aught but as love changes what it loveth not after long years and many trials how vain are words i thought never to speak again not even in secret not to mine own heart but from my lips the unwilling accents start and from my pen the words flow as i write dazzling my eyes with scalding tearsmy sight is dim to see that charactered in vain on this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain and eats into itblotting all things fair and wise and good which time had written there those who inflict must suffer for they see the work of their own hearts and this must be our chastisement or recompense o child i would that thine were like to be more mild for both our wretched sakesfor thine the most who feelest already all that thou hast lost without the power to wish it thine again and as slow years pass a funereal train each with the ghost of some lost hope or friend following it like its shadow wilt thou bend no thought on my dead memory alas love fear me notagainst thee i would not move a finger in despite do i not live that thou mayst have less bitter cause to grieve i give thee tears for scorn and love for hate and that thy lot may be less desolate than his on whom thou tramplest i refrain from that sweet sleep which medicines all pain then when thou speakest of me never say he could forgive not here i cast away all human passions all revenge all pride i think speak act no ill i do but hide under these words like embers every spark of that which has consumed me quick and dark the grave is yawningas its roof shall cover my limbs with dust and worms under and over so let oblivion hide this griefthe air closes upon my accents as despair upon my heart let death upon despair he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we wept without shame in his society i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human naturethen we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalos yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not but in the light of allbeholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned him and how much more might be his woe we guessed not he had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lostit were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong they learn in suffering what they teach in song if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venice for to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea and then the town is silent one may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair which were twinborn with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country i might sit in maddalos great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within me twas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no trace but what i now designed made for long years impression on my mind the following morning urged by my affairs i left bright venice after many years and many changes i returned the name of venice and its aspect was the same but maddalo was travelling far away among the mountains of armenia his dog was dead his child had now become a woman such as it has been my doom to meet with few a wonder of this earth where there is little of transcendent worth like one of shakespeares women kindly she and with a manner beyond courtesy received her fathers friend and when i asked of the lorn maniac she her memory tasked and told as she had heard the mournful tale that the poor sufferers health began to fail two years from my departure but that then the lady who had left him came again her mien had been imperious but she now looked meek perhaps remorse had brought her low her coming made him better and they stayed together at my fathers for i played as i remember with the ladys shawl i might be six years old but after all she left himwhy her heart must have been tough how did it end and was not this enough they met they parted child is there no more something within that interval which bore the stamp of why they parted how they met yet if thine aged eyes disdain to wet those wrinkled cheeks with youths remembered tears ask me no more but let the silent years be closed and cered over their memory as yon mute marble where their corpses lie i urged and questioned still she told me how all happened but the cold world shall not know cancelled fragments of julian and maddalo what think you the dead are why dust and clay what should they be tis the last hour of day look on the west how beautiful it is vaulted with radiant vapours the deep bliss of that unutterable light has made the edges of that cloud fade into a hue like some harmonious thought wasting itself on that which it had wrought till it dies and between the light hues of the tender pure serene and infinite tranquillity of heaven ay beautiful but when not perhaps the only comfort which remains is the unheeded clanking of my chains the

rendering it eligible that we should remain a few weeks in the neighbourhood of that city he accepted the offer of lord byron who lent him the use of a villa he rented near este and he sent for his family from lucca to join him i capuccini was a villa built on the site of a capuchin convent demolished when the french suppressed religious houses it was situated on the very overhanging brow of a low hill at the foot of a range of higher ones the house was cheerful and pleasant a vinetrellised walk a pergola as it is called in italian led from the halldoor to a summerhouse at the end of the garden which shelley made his study and in which he began the prometheus and here also as he mentions in a letter he wrote julian and maddalo a slight ravine with a road in its depth divided the garden from the hill on which stood the ruins of the ancient castle of este whose dark massive wall gave forth an echo and from whose ruined crevices owls and bats flitted forth at night as the crescent moon sunk behind the black and heavy battlements we looked from the garden over the wide plain of lombardy bounded to the west by the far apennines while to the east the horizon was lost in misty distance after the picturesque but limited view of mountain ravine and chestnutwood at the baths of lucca there was something infinitely gratifying to the eye in the wide range of prospect commanded by our new abode our first misfortune of the kind from which we soon suffered even more severely happened here our little girl an infant in whose small features i fancied that i traced great resemblance to her father showed symptoms of suffering from the heat of the climate teething increased her illness and danger we were at este and when we became alarmed hastened to venice for the best advice when we arrived at fusina we found that we had forgotten our passport and the soldiers on duty attempted to prevent our crossing the laguna but they could not resist shelleys impetuosity at such a moment we had scarcely arrived at venice before life fled from the little sufferer and we returned to este to weep her loss after a few weeks spent in this retreat which was interspersed by visits to venice we proceeded southward prometheus unbound a lyrical drama in four acts audisne haec amphiarae sub terram abdite composed at este september october act at rome marchapril acts at

and the text as edited by mrs shelley in the poetical works st and nd editions the reader should consult the notes on the play at the end of the volume preface the greek tragic writers in selecting as their subject any portion of their national history or mythology employed in their treatment of it a certain arbitrary discretion they by no means conceived themselves bound to adhere to the common interpretation or to imitate in story as in title their rivals and predecessors such a system would have amounted to a resignation of those claims to preference over their competitors which incited the composition the agamemnonian story was exhibited on the athenian theatre with as many variations as dramas i have presumed to employ a similar license the prometheus unbound of aeschylus supposed the reconciliation of jupiter with his victim as the price of the disclosure of the danger threatened to his empire by the consummation of his marriage with thetis thetis according to this view of the subject was given in marriage to peleus and prometheus by the permission of jupiter delivered from his captivity by hercules had i framed my story on this model i should have done no more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of aeschylus an ambition which if my preference to this mode of treating the subject had incited me to cherish the recollection of the high comparison such an attempt would challenge might well abate but in truth i was averse from a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling the champion with the oppressor of mankind the moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of prometheus would be annihilated if we could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perfidious adversary the only imaginary being resembling in any degree prometheus is satan and prometheus is in my judgement a more poetical character than satan because in addition to courage and majesty and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition envy revenge and a desire for personal aggrandisement which in the hero of paradise lost interfere with the interest the character of satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure in the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse but prometheus is as it were the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends this poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla among the flowery glades and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air the bright blue sky of rome and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication were the inspiration of this drama the imagery which i have employed will be found in many instances to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind or from those external actions by which they are expressed this is unusual in modern poetry although dante and shakespeare are full of instances of the same kind dante indeed more than any other poet and with greater success but the greek poets as writers to whom no resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown were in the habitual use of this power and it is the study of their works since a higher merit would probably be denied me to which i am willing that my readers should impute this singularity one word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition for such has been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular and indeed more deservedly popular than mine it is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in the foremost ranks of our own can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects it is true that not the spirit of their genius but the forms in which it has manifested itself are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition of the minds among which they have been produced thus a number of writers possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleged they imitate because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind the peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which distinguishes the modern literature of england has not been as a general power the product of the imitation of any particular writer the mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change if england were divided into forty republics each equal in population and extent to athens there is no reason to suppose but that under institutions not more perfect than those of athens each would produce philosophers and poets equal to those who if we except shakespeare have never been surpassed we owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the christian religion we owe milton to the progress and development of the same spirit the sacred milton was let it ever be remembered a republican and a bold inquirer into morals and religion the great writers of our own age are we have reason to suppose the companions and forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement it the cloud of mind is discharging its collected lightning and the equilibrium between institutions and opinions is now restoring or is about to be restored as to imitation poetry is a mimetic art it creates but it creates by combination and representation poetical abstractions are beautiful and new not because the portions of which they are composed had no previous existence in the mind of man or in nature but because the whole produced by their combination has some intelligible and beautiful analogy with those sources of emotion and thought and with the contemporary condition of them one great poet is a masterpiece of nature which another not only ought to study but must study he might as wisely and as easily determine that his mind should no longer be the mirror of all that is lovely in the visible universe as exclude from his contemplation the beautiful which exists in the writings of a great contemporary the pretence of doing it would be a presumption in any but the greatest the effect even in him would be strained unnatural and ineffectual a poet is the combined product of such internal powers as modify the nature of others and of such external influences as excite and sustain these powers he is not one but both every mans mind is in this respect modified by all the objects of nature and art by every word and every suggestion which he ever admitted to act upon his consciousness it is the mirror upon which all forms are reflected and in which they compose one form poets not otherwise than philosophers painters sculptors and musicians are in one sense the creators and in another the creations of their age from this subjection the loftiest do not escape there is a similarity between homer and hesiod between aeschylus and euripides between virgil and horace between dante and petrarch between shakespeare and fletcher between dryden and pope each has a generic resemblance under which their specific distinctions are arranged if this similarity be the result of imitation i am willing to confess that i have imitated let this opportunity be conceded to me of acknowledging that i have what a scotch philosopher characteristically terms a passion for reforming the world what passion incited him to write and publish his book he omits to explain for my part i had rather be damned with plato and lord bacon than go to heaven with paley and malthus but it is a mistake to suppose that i dedicate my poetical compositions solely to the direct enforcement of reform or that i consider them in any degree as containing a reasoned system on the theory of human life didactic poetry is my abhorrence nothing can be equally well expressed in prose that is not tedious and supererogatory in verse my purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarise the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence aware that until the mind can love and admire and trust and hope and endure reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust although they would bear the harvest of his happiness should i live to accomplish what i purpose that is produce a systematical history of what appear to me to be the genuine elements of human society let not the advocates of injustice and superstition flatter themselves that i should take aeschylus rather than plato as my model the having spoken of myself with unaffected freedom will need little apology with the candid and let the uncandid consider that they injure me less than their own hearts and minds by misrepresentation whatever talents a person may possess to amuse and instruct others be they ever so inconsiderable he is yet bound to exert them if his attempt be ineffectual let the punishment of an unaccomplished purpose have been sufficient let none trouble themselves to heap the dust of oblivion upon his efforts the pile they raise will betray his grave which might otherwise have been unknown dramatis personae prometheus demogorgon jupiter the

things are still alas how heavily this quiet morning weighs upon my heart though i should dream i could even sleep with grief if slumber were denied not i would fain be what it is my destiny to be the saviour and the strength of suffering man or sink into the original gulf of things there is no agony and no solace left earth can console heaven can torment no more panthea hast thou forgotten one who watches thee the cold dark night and never sleeps but when the shadow of thy spirit falls on her prometheus i said all hope was vain but love thou lovest panthea deeply in truth but the eastern star looks white and asia waits in that far indian vale the scene of her sad exile rugged once and desolate and frozen like this ravine but now invested with fair flowers and herbs and haunted by sweet airs and sounds which flow among the woods and waters from the aether of her transforming presence which would fade if it were mingled not with thine farewell end of act act scene morning a lovely vale in the indian caucasus asia alone asia from all the blasts of heaven thou hast descended yes like a spirit like a thought which makes unwonted tears throng to the horny eyes and beatings haunt the desolated heart which should have learnt repose thou hast descended cradled in tempests thou dost wake o spring o child of many winds as suddenly thou comest as the memory of a dream which now is sad because it hath been sweet like genius or like joy which riseth up as from the earth clothing with golden clouds the desert of our life this is the season this the day the hour at sunrise thou shouldst come sweet sister mine too long desired too long delaying come how like deathworms the wingless moments crawl the point of one white star is quivering still deep in the orange light of widening morn beyond the purple mountains through a chasm of winddivided mist the darker lake reflects it now it wanes it gleams again as the waves fade and as the burning threads of woven cloud unravel in pale air tis lost and through yon peaks of cloudlike snow the roseate sunlight quivers hear i not the aeolian music of her seagreen plumes winnowing the crimson dawn panthea enters i feel i see those eyes which burn through smiles that fade in tears like stars half quenched in mists of silver dew beloved and most beautiful who wearest the shadow of that soul by which i live how late thou art the sphered sun had climbed the sea my heart was sick with hope before the printless air felt thy belated plumes panthea pardon great sister but my wings were faint with the delight of a remembered dream as are the noontide plumes of summer winds satiate with sweet flowers i was wont to sleep peacefully and awake refreshed and calm before the sacred titans fall and thy unhappy love had made through use and pity both love and woe familiar to my heart as they had grown to thine erewhile i slept under the glaucous caverns of old ocean within dim bowers of green and purple moss our young iones soft and milky arms locked then as now behind my dark moist hair while my shut eyes and cheek were pressed within the folded depth of her lifebreathing bosom but not as now since i am made the wind which fails beneath the music that i bear of thy most wordless converse since dissolved into the sense with which love talks my rest was troubled and yet sweet my waking hours too full of care and pain asia lift up thine eyes and let me read thy dream panthea as i have said with our seasister at his feet i slept the mountain mists condensing at our voice under the moon had spread their snowy flakes from the keen ice shielding our linked sleep then two dreams came one i remember not but in the other his pale woundworn limbs fell from prometheus and the azure night grew radiant with the glory of that form which lives unchanged within and his voice fell like music which makes giddy the dim brain faint with intoxication of keen joy sister of her whose footsteps pave the world with loveliness more fair than aught but her whose shadow thou art lift thine eyes on me i lifted them the overpowering light of that immortal shape was shadowed oer by love which from his soft and flowing limbs and passionparted lips and keen faint eyes steamed forth like vaporous fire an atmosphere which wrapped me in its alldissolving power as the warm ether of the morning sun wraps ere it drinks some cloud of wandering dew i saw not heard not moved not only felt his presence flow and mingle through my blood till it became his life and his grew mine and i was thus absorbed until it passed and like the vapours when the sun sinks down gathering again in drops upon the pines and tremulous as they in the deep night my being was condensed and as the rays of thought were slowly gathered i could hear his voice whose accents lingered ere they died like footsteps of weak melody thy name among the many sounds alone i heard of what might be articulate though still i listened through the night when sound was none ione wakened then and said to me canst thou divine what troubles me tonight i always knew what i desired before nor ever found delight to wish in vain but now i cannot tell thee what i seek i know not something sweet since it is sweet even to desire it is thy sport false sister thou hast discovered some enchantment old whose spells have stolen my spirit as i slept and mingled it with thine for when just now we kissed i felt within thy parted lips the sweet air that sustained me and the warmth of the lifeblood for loss of which i faint quivered between our intertwining arms i answered not for the eastern star grew pale but fled to thee asia thou speakest but thy words are as the air i feel them not oh lift thine eyes that i may read his written soul panthea i lift them though they droop beneath the load of that they would express what canst thou see but thine own fairest shadow imaged there asia thine eyes are like the deep blue boundless heaven contracted to two circles underneath their long fine lashes dark far measureless orb within orb and line through line inwoven panthea why lookest thou as if a spirit passed asia there is a change beyond their inmost depth i see a shade a shape tis he arrayed in the soft light of his own smiles which spread like radiance from the cloudsurrounded moon prometheus it is thine depart not yet say not those smiles that we shall meet again within that bright pavilion which their beams shall build oer the waste world the dream is told what shape is that between us its rude hair roughens the wind that lifts it its

other dream asia it disappears panthea it passes now into my mind methought as we sate here the flowerinfolding buds burst on yon lightningblasted almond tree when swift from the white scythian wilderness a wind swept forth wrinkling the earth with frost i looked and all the blossoms were blown down but on each leaf was stamped as the blue bells of hyacinth tell apollos written grief o follow follow asia as you speak your words fill pause by pause my own forgotten sleep with shapes methought among these lawns together we wandered underneath the young gray dawn and multitudes of dense white fleecy clouds were wandering in thick flocks along the mountains shepherded by the slow unwilling wind and the white dew on the newbladed grass just piercing the dark earth hung silently and there was more which i remember not but on the shadows of the morning clouds athwart the purple mountain slope was written follow o follow as they vanished by and on each herb from which heavens dew had fallen the like was stamped as with a withering fire a wind arose among the pines it shook the clinging music from their boughs and then low sweet faint sounds like the farewell of ghosts were heard o follow follow follow me and then i said panthea look on me but in the depth of those beloved eyes still i saw follow follow note these b the echo follow follow panthea the crags this clear

ebbing wind echoes oh follow follow through the caverns hollow as the song floats thou pursue by the woodland noontide dew by the forests lakes and fountains through the manyfolded mountains to the

voices fade away scene a forest intermingled with rocks and caverns asia and panthea pass into it two young fauns are sitting on a rock listening semichorus of spirits the path through which that lovely twain have passed by cedar pine and yew and each dark tree that ever grew is curtained out from heavens wide blue nor sun nor moon nor wind nor rain can pierce its interwoven bowers nor aught save where some cloud of dew drifted along the earthcreeping breeze between the trunks of the hoar trees hangs each a pearl in the pale flowers of the green laurel blown anew and bends and then fades silently one frail and fair anemone or when some star of many a one that climbs and wanders through steep night has found the cleft through which alone beams fall from high those depths upon ere it is borne away away by the swift heavens that cannot stay it scatters drops of golden light like lines of rain that neer unite and the gloom divine is all around and underneath is the mossy ground semichorus there the voluptuous nightingales are awake through all the broad noonday when one with bliss or sadness fails and through the windless ivyboughs sick with sweet love droops dying away on its mates musicpanting bosom another from the swinging blossom watching to catch the languid close of the last strain then lifts on high the wings of the weak melody till some new strain of feeling bear the song and all the woods are mute when there is heard through the dim air the rush of wings and rising there like many a lakesurrounded flute sounds overflow the listeners brain so sweet that joy is almost pain note surrounded b edition surrounding semichorus there those enchanted eddies play of echoes musictongued which draw by demogorgons mighty law with melting rapture or sweet awe all

soft emotion attracts impels them those who saw say from the breathing earth behind there steams a plumeuplifting wind which drives them on their path while they believe their own swift wings and feet

we haunt within the least frequented caves and closest coverts and we know these wilds yet never meet them though we hear them oft where may they hide themselves second faun tis hard to tell i have heard those more skilled in spirits say the bubbles which the enchantment of the sun sucks from the pale faint waterflowers that pave the oozy bottom of clear lakes and pools are the pavilions where such dwell and float under the green and golden atmosphere which noontide kindles through the woven leaves and when these burst and the thin fiery air the which they breathed within those lucent domes ascends to flow like meteors through the night they ride on them and rein their headlong speed and bow their burning crests and glide in fire under the waters of the earth again first faun if such live thus have others other lives under pink blossoms or within the bells of meadow flowers or folded violets deep or on their dying odours when they die or in the sunlight of the sphered dew note on

from the links of the great chain of things to every thought within the mind of man sway and drag heavily and each one reels under the load towards the pit of death abandoned hope and love that turns

wind or sun has withered them and semivital worms but he refused the birthright of their being knowledge power the skill which wields the elements the thought which pierces this dim universe like light selfempire and the majesty of love for thirst of which they fainted then prometheus gave wisdom which is strength to jupiter and with this law alone let man be free clothed him with the dominion of wide heaven to know nor faith nor love nor law to be omnipotent but friendless is to reign and jove now reigned for on the race of man first famine and then toil and then disease strife wounds and ghastly death unseen before fell and the unseasonable seasons drove with alternating shafts of frost and fire their shelterless pale tribes to mountain caves and in their desert hearts fierce wants he sent and mad disquietudes and shadows idle of unreal good which levied mutual war so ruining the lair wherein they raged prometheus saw and waked the legioned hopes which sleep within folded elysian flowers nepenthe moly amaranth fadeless blooms that they might hide with thin and rainbow wings the shape of death and love he sent to bind the disunited tendrils of that vine which bears the wine of life the human heart and he tamed fire which like some beast of prey most terrible but lovely played beneath the frown of man and tortured to his will iron and gold the slaves and signs of power and gems and poisons and all subtlest forms hidden beneath the mountains and the waves he gave man speech and speech created thought which is the measure of the universe and science struck the thrones of earth and heaven which shook but fell not and the harmonious mind poured itself forth in allprophetic song and music lifted up the listening spirit until it walked exempt from mortal care godlike oer the clear billows of sweet sound and human hands first mimicked and then mocked with moulded limbs more lovely than its own the human form till marble grew divine and mothers gazing drank the love men see reflected in their race behold and perish he told the hidden power of herbs and springs and disease drank and slept death grew like sleep he taught the implicated orbits woven of the widewandering stars and how the sun changes his lair and by what secret spell the pale moon is transformed when her broad eye gazes not on the interlunar sea he taught to rule as life directs the limbs the tempestwinged chariots of the ocean and the celt knew the indian cities then were built and through their snowlike columns flowed the warm winds and the azure ether shone and the blue sea and shadowy hills were seen such the alleviations of his state prometheus gave to man for which he hangs withering in destined pain but who rains down evil the immedicable plague which while man looks on his creation like a god and sees that it is glorious drives him on the wreck of his own will the scorn of earth the outcast the abandoned the alone not jove while yet his frown shook heaven ay when his adversary from adamantine chains cursed him he trembled like a slave declare who is his master is he too a slave note rains b edition reigns demogorgon all spirits are enslaved which serve things evil

snow or silver or long diamond spires hang downward raining forth a doubtful light and there is heard the evermoving air whispering without from tree to tree and birds and bees and all around are

what can hide man from mutability and if ye sigh then i will smile and thou ione shalt chant fragments of seamusic until i weep when ye shall smile away the tears she brought which yet were sweet to

in anguish whilst thy pain made my heart mad and those who did inhale it became mad too and built a temple there and spoke and were oracular and lured the erring nations round to mutual war and faithless faith such as jove kept with thee which breath now rises as amongst tall weeds a violets exhalation and it fills with a serener light and crimson air intense yet soft the rocks and woods around it feeds the quick growth of the serpent vine and the dark linked ivy tangling wild and budding blown or odourfaded blooms which star the winds with points of coloured light as they rain through them and bright golden globes of fruit suspended in their own green heaven and through their veined leaves and amber stems the flowers whose purple and translucid bowls stand ever mantling with aereal dew the drink of spirits and it circles round like the soft waving wings of noonday dreams inspiring calm and happy thoughts like mine now thou art thus restored this cave is thine arise appear a spirit rises in the likeness of a winged child this is my torchbearer who let his lamp out in old time with gazing on eyes from which he kindled it anew with love which is as fire sweet daughter mine for such is that within thine own run wayward and guide this company beyond the peak of bacchic nysa maenadhaunted mountain and beyond indus and its tribute rivers trampling the torrent streams and glassy lakes with feet unwet unwearied undelaying and up the green ravine across the vale beside the windless and crystalline pool where ever lies on unerasing waves the image of a temple built above distinct with column arch and architrave and palmlike capital and overwrought and populous with most living imagery praxitelean shapes whose marble smiles fill the hushed air with everlasting love it is deserted now but once it bore thy name prometheus there the emulous youths bore to thy honour through the divine gloom the lamp which was thine emblem even as those who bear the untransmitted torch of hope into the grave across the night of life as thou hast borne it most triumphantly to this far goal of time depart farewell beside that temple is the destined cave note with most b most with scene a forest in the background a cave prometheus asia panthea ione and the spirit of the earth ione sister it is not earthly how it glides under the leaves how on its head there burns a light like a green star whose emerald beams are twined with its fair hair how as it moves the splendour drops in flakes upon the grass knowest thou it panthea it is the delicate spirit that guides the earth through heaven from afar the populous constellations call that light the loveliest of the planets and sometimes it floats along the spray of the salt sea or makes its chariot of a foggy cloud or walks through fields or cities while men sleep or oer the mountain tops or down the rivers or through the green waste wilderness as now wondering at all it sees before jove reigned it loved our sister asia and it came each leisure hour to drink the liquid light out of her eyes for which it said it thirsted as one bit by a dipsas and with her it made its childish confidence and told her all it had known or seen for it saw much yet idly reasoned what it saw and called her for whence it sprung it knew not nor do i mother dear mother the spirit of the earth running to asia mother dearest mother may i then talk with thee as i was wont may i then hide my eyes in thy soft arms after thy looks have made them tired of joy may i then play beside thee the long noons when work is none in the bright silent air asia i love thee gentlest being and henceforth can cherish thee unenvied speak i pray thy simple talk once solaced now delights spirit of the earth mother i am grown wiser though a child cannot be wise like thee within this day and happier too happier and wiser both thou knowest that toads and snakes and loathly worms and venomous and malicious beasts and boughs that bore ill berries in the woods were ever an hindrance to my walks oer the green world and that among the haunts of humankind hardfeatured men or with proud angry looks or cold staid gait or false and hollow smiles or the dull sneer of selfloved ignorance or other such foul masks with which ill thoughts hide that fair being whom we spirits call man and women too ugliest of all things evil though fair even in a world where thou art fair when good and kind free and sincere like thee when false or frowning made me sick at heart to pass them though they slept and i unseen well my path lately lay through a great city into the woody hills surrounding it a sentinel was sleeping at the gate when there was heard a sound so loud it shook the towers amid the moonlight yet more sweet than any voice but thine sweetest of all a long long sound as it would never end and all the inhabitants leaped suddenly out of their rest and gathered in the streets looking in wonder up to heaven while yet the music pealed along i hid myself within a fountain in the public square where i lay like the reflex of the moon seen in a wave under green leaves and soon those ugly human shapes and visages of which i spoke as having wrought me pain passed floating through the air and fading still into the winds that scattered them and those from whom they passed seemed mild and lovely forms after some foul disguise had fallen and all were somewhat changed and after brief surprise and greetings of delighted wonder all went to their sleep again and when the dawn came wouldst thou think that toads and snakes and efts could eer be beautiful yet so they were and that with little change of shape or hue all things had put their evil nature off i cannot tell my joy when oer a lake upon a drooping bough with nightshade twined i saw two azure halcyons clinging downward and thinning one bright bunch of amber berries with quick long beaks and in the deep there lay those lovely forms imaged as in a sky so with my thoughts full of these happy changes we meet again the happiest change of all asia and never will we part till thy chaste sister who guides the frozen and inconstant moon will look on thy more warm and equal light till her heart thaw like flakes of april snow and love thee spirit of the earth what as asia loves prometheus asia peace wanton thou art yet not old enough think ye by gazing on each others eyes to multiply your lovely selves and fill with sphered fires the interlunar air spirit of the earth nay mother while my sister trims her lamp tis hard i should go darkling asia listen look the spirit of the hour enters prometheus we feel what thou hast heard and seen yet speak spirit of the hour soon as the sound had ceased whose thunder filled the abysses of the sky and the wide earth there was a change the impalpable thin air and the allcircling sunlight were transformed as if the sense of love dissolved in them had folded itself round the sphered world my vision then grew clear and i could see into the mysteries of the universe dizzy as with delight i floated down winnowing the lightsome air with languid plumes my coursers sought their birthplace in the sun where they henceforth will live exempt from toil pasturing flowers of vegetable fire and where my moonlike car will stand within a temple gazed upon by phidian forms of thee and asia and the earth and me and you fair nymphs looking the love we feel in memory of the tidings it has borne beneath a dome fretted with graven flowers poised on twelve columns of resplendent stone and open to the bright and liquid sky yoked to it by an amphisbaenic snake the likeness of those winged steeds will mock the flight from which they find repose alas whither has wandered now my partial tongue when all remains untold which ye would hear as i have said i floated to the earth it was as it is still the pain of bliss to move to breathe to be i wandering went among the haunts and dwellings of mankind and first was disappointed not to see such mighty change as i had felt within expressed in outward things but soon i looked and behold thrones were kingless and men walked one with the other even as spirits do none fawned none trampled hate disdain or fear selflove or selfcontempt on human brows no more inscribed as oer the gate of hell all hope abandon ye who enter here none frowned none trembled none with eager fear gazed on anothers eye of cold command until the subject of a tyrants will became worse fate the abject of his own which spurred him like an outspent horse to death none wrought his lips in truthentangling lines which smiled the lie his tongue disdained to speak none with firm sneer trod out in his own heart the sparks of love and hope till there remained those bitter ashes a soul selfconsumed and the wretch crept a vampire among men infecting all with his own hideous ill none talked that common false cold hollow talk which makes the heart deny the yes it breathes yet question that unmeant hypocrisy with such a selfmistrust as has no name and women too frank beautiful and kind as the free heaven which rains fresh light and dew on the wide earth past gentle radiant forms from customs evil taint exempt and pure speaking the wisdom once they could not think looking emotions once they feared to feel and changed to all which once they dared not be yet being now made earth like heaven nor pride nor jealousy nor envy nor ill shame the bitterest of those drops of treasured gall spoiled the sweet taste of the nepenthe love thrones altars judgementseats and prisons wherein and beside which by wretched men were borne sceptres tiaras swords and chains and tomes of reasoned wrong glozed on by ignorance were like those monstrous and barbaric shapes the ghosts of a nomoreremembered fame which from their unworn obelisks look forth in triumph oer the palaces and tombs of those who were their conquerors mouldering round these imaged to the pride of kings and priests a dark yet mighty faith a power as wide as is the world it wasted and are now but an astonishment even so the tools and emblems of its last captivity amid the dwellings of the peopled earth stand not oerthrown but unregarded now and those foul shapes abhorred by god and man which under many a name and many a form strange savage ghastly dark and execrable were jupiter the tyrant of the world and which the nations panicstricken served with blood and hearts broken by long hope and love dragged to his altars soiled and garlandless and slain among mens unreclaiming tears flattering the thing they feared which fear was hate frown mouldering fast oer their abandoned shrines the painted veil by those who were called life which mimicked as with colours idly spread all men believed and hoped is torn aside the loathsome mask has fallen the man remains sceptreless free uncircumscribed but man equal unclassed tribeless and nationless exempt from awe worship degree the king over himself just gentle wise but man passionless no yet free from guilt or pain which were for his will made or suffered them nor yet exempt though ruling them like slaves from chance and death and mutability the

visions of strange radiance float upon the oceanlike enchantment of strong sound which flows intenser keener deeper yet under the ground and through the windless air ione i see a chariot like that thinnest boat in which the mother of the months is borne by ebbing light into her western cave when she upsprings from interlunar dreams oer which is curved an orblike canopy of gentle darkness and the hills and woods distinctly seen through that dusk aery veil regard like shapes in an enchanters glass its wheels are solid clouds azure and gold such as the genii of the thunderstorm pile on the floor of the illumined sea when the sun rushes under it they roll and move and grow as with an inward wind within it sits a winged infant white its countenance like the whiteness of bright snow its plumes are as feathers of sunny frost its limbs gleam white through the windflowing folds of its white robe woof of ethereal pearl its hair is white the brightness of white light scattered in strings yet its two eyes are heavens of liquid darkness which the deity within seems pouring as a storm is poured from jagged clouds out of their arrowy lashes tempering the cold and radiant air around with fire that is not brightness in its hand it sways a quivering moonbeam from whose point a guiding power directs the chariots prow over its wheeled clouds which as they roll over the grass and flowers

health would be improved by a milder climate he suffered very much during the winter previous to his emigration and this decided his vacillating purpose in december he had written from marlow to a friend saying my health has been materially worse my feelings at intervals are of a deadly and torpid kind or awakened to such a state of unnatural and keen excitement that only to instance the organ of sight i find the very blades of grass and the boughs of distant trees present themselves to me with microscopic distinctness towards evening i sink into a state of lethargy and inanimation and often remain for hours on the sofa between sleep and waking a prey to the most painful irritability of thought such with little intermission is my condition the hours devoted to study are selected with vigilant caution from among these periods of endurance it is not for this that i think of travelling to italy even if i knew that italy would relieve me but i have experienced a decisive pulmonary attack and although at present it has passed away without any considerable vestige of its existence yet this symptom sufficiently shows the true nature of my disease to be consumptive it is to my advantage that this malady is in its nature slow and if one is sufficiently alive to its advances is susceptible of cure from a warm climate in the event of its assuming any decided shape it would be my duty to go to italy without delay it is not mere health but life that i should seek and that not for my own sake i feel i am capable of trampling on all such weakness but for the sake of those to whom my life may be a source of happiness utility security and honour and to some of whom my death might be all that is the reverse in almost every respect his journey to italy was advantageous he left behind friends to whom he was attached but cares of a thousand kinds many springing from his lavish generosity crowded round him in his native country and except the society of one or two friends he had no compensation the climate caused him to consume half his existence in helpless suffering his dearest pleasure the free enjoyment of the scenes of nature was marred by the same circumstance he went direct to italy avoiding even paris and did not make any pause till he arrived at milan the first aspect of italy enchanted shelley it seemed a garden of delight placed beneath a clearer and brighter heaven than any he had lived under before he wrote long descriptive letters during the first year of his residence in italy which as compositions are the most beautiful in the world and show how truly he appreciated and studied the wonders of nature and art in that divine land the poetical spirit within him speedily revived with all the power and with more than all the beauty of his first attempts he meditated three subjects as the groundwork for lyrical dramas one was the story of tasso of this a slight fragment of a song of tasso remains the other was one founded on the book of job which he never abandoned in idea but of which no trace remains among his papers the third was the prometheus unbound the greek tragedians were now his most familiar companions in his wanderings and the sublime majesty of aeschylus filled him with wonder and delight the father of greek tragedy does not possess the pathos of sophocles nor the variety and tenderness of euripides the interest on which he founds his dramas is often elevated above human vicissitudes into the mighty passions and throes of gods and demigods such fascinated the abstract imagination of shelley we spent a month at milan visiting the lake of como during that interval thence we passed in succession to pisa leghorn the baths of lucca venice este rome naples and back again to rome whither we returned early in march during all this time shelley meditated the subject of his drama and wrote portions of it other poems were composed during this interval and while at the bagni di lucca he translated platos symposium but though he diversified his studies his thoughts centred in the prometheus at last when at rome during a bright and beautiful spring he gave up his whole time to the composition the spot selected for his study was as he mentions in his preface the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla these are little known to the ordinary visitor at rome he describes them in a letter with that poetry and delicacy and truth of description which render his narrated impressions of scenery of unequalled beauty and interest at first he completed the drama in three acts it was not till several months after when at florence that he conceived that a fourth act a sort of hymn of rejoicing in the fulfilment of the prophecies with regard to prometheus ought to be added to complete the composition the prominent feature of shelleys theory of the destiny of the human species was that evil is not inherent in the system of the creation but an accident that might be expelled this also forms a portion of christianity god made earth and man perfect till he by his fall brought death into the world and all our woe shelley believed that mankind had only to will that there should be no evil and there would be none it is not my part in these notes to notice the arguments that have been urged against this opinion but to mention the fact that he entertained it and was indeed attached to it with fervent enthusiasm that man could be so perfectionized as to be able to expel evil from his own nature and from the greater part of the creation was the cardinal point of his system and the subject he loved best to dwell on was the image of one warring with the evil principle oppressed not only by it but by all even the good who were deluded into considering evil a necessary portion of humanity a victim full of fortitude and hope and the spirit of triumph emanating from a reliance in the ultimate omnipotence of good such he had depicted in his last poem when he made laon the enemy and the victim of tyrants he now took a more idealized image of the same subject he followed certain classical authorities in figuring saturn as the good principle jupiter the usurping evil one and prometheus as the regenerator who unable to bring mankind back to primitive innocence used knowledge as a weapon to defeat evil by leading mankind beyond the state wherein they are sinless through ignorance to that in which they are virtuous through wisdom jupiter punished the temerity of the titan by chaining him to a rock of caucasus and causing a vulture to devour his stillrenewed heart there was a prophecy afloat in heaven portending the fall of jove the secret of averting which was known only to prometheus and the god offered freedom from torture on condition of its being communicated to him according to the mythological story this referred to the offspring of thetis who was destined to be greater than his father prometheus at last bought pardon for his crime of enriching mankind with his gifts by revealing the prophecy hercules killed the vulture and set him free and thetis was married to peleus the father of achilles shelley adapted the catastrophe of this story to his peculiar views the son greater than his father born of the nuptials of jupiter and thetis was to dethrone evil and bring back a happier reign than that of saturn prometheus defies the power of his enemy and endures centuries of torture till the hour arrives when jove blind to the real event but darkly guessing that some great good to himself will flow espouses thetis at the moment the primal power of the world drives him from his usurped throne and strength in the person of hercules liberates humanity typified in prometheus from the tortures generated by evil done or suffered asia one of the oceanides is the wife of prometheus she was according to other mythological interpretations the same as venus and nature when the benefactor of mankind is liberated nature resumes the beauty of her prime and is united to her husband the emblem of the human race in perfect and happy union in the fourth act the poet gives further scope to his imagination and idealizes the forms of creation such as we know them instead of such as they appeared to the greeks maternal earth the mighty parent is superseded by the spirit of the earth the guide of our planet through the realms of sky while his fair and weaker companion and attendant the spirit of the moon receives bliss from the annihilation of evil in the superior sphere shelley develops more particularly in the lyrics of this drama his abstruse and imaginative theories with regard to the creation it requires a mind as subtle and penetrating as his own to understand the mystic meanings scattered throughout the poem they elude the ordinary reader by their abstraction and delicacy of distinction but they are far from vague it was his design to write prose metaphysical essays on the nature of man which would have served to explain much of what is obscure in his poetry a few scattered fragments of observations and remarks alone remain he considered these philosophical views of mind and nature to be instinct with the intensest spirit of poetry more popular poets clothe the ideal with familiar and sensible imagery shelley loved to idealize the real to gift the mechanism of the material universe with a soul and a voice and to bestow such also on the most delicate and abstract emotions and thoughts of the mind sophocles was his great master in this species of imagery i find in one of his manuscript books some remarks on a line in the oedipus tyrannus which show at once the critical subtlety of shelleys mind and explain his apprehension of those minute and remote distinctions of feeling whether relative to external nature or the living beings which surround us which he pronounces in the letter quoted in the note to the revolt of islam to comprehend all that is sublime in man in the greek shakespeare sophocles we find the image pollas d odous elthonta phrontidos planois a line of almost unfathomable depth of poetry yet how simple are the images in which it is arrayed coming to many ways in the wanderings of careful thought if the words odous and planois had not been used the line might have been explained in a metaphorical instead of an absolute sense as we say ways and means and wanderings for error and confusion but they meant literally paths or roads such as we tread with our feet and wanderings such as a man makes when he loses himself in a desert or roams from city to city as oedipus the speaker of this verse was destined to wander blind and asking charity what a picture does this line suggest of the mind as a wilderness of intricate paths wide as the universe which is here made its symbol a world within a world which he who seeks some knowledge with respect to what he ought to do searches throughout as he would search the external universe for some valued thing which was hidden from him upon its surface in reading shelleys poetry we often find similar verses resembling but not imitating the greek in this species of imagery for though he adopted the style he gifted it with that originality of form and colouring which sprung from his own genius in the prometheus unbound shelley fulfils the promise quoted from a letter in the note on the revolt of islam while correcting the proofsheets of that poem it struck me that the poet had indulged in an exaggerated view of the evils of restored despotism which however injurious and degrading were less openly sanguinary than the triumph of anarchy such as it appeared in france at the close of the last century but at this time a book scenes of spanish life translated by lieutenant crawford from the german of dr huber of rostock fell into my hands the account of the triumph of the priests and the serviles after the french invasion of spain in bears a strong and frightful resemblance to some of the descriptions of the massacre of the patriots in the revolt of islam the tone of the composition is calmer and more majestic the poetry more perfect as a whole and the imagination displayed at once more pleasingly beautiful and more varied and daring the description of the hours as they are seen in the cave of demogorgon is an instance of this it fills the mind as the most charming picture we long to see an artist at work to bring to our view the cars drawn by rainbowwinged steeds which trample the dim winds in each there stands a wildeyed charioteer urging their flight some look behind as fiends pursued them there and yet i see no shapes but the keen stars others with burning eyes lean forth and drink with eager lips the wind of their own speed as if the thing they loved fled on before and now even now they clasped it their bright locks stream like a comets flashing hair they all sweep onward through the whole poem there reigns a sort of calm and holy spirit of love it soothes the tortured and is hope to the expectant till the prophecy is fulfilled and love untainted by any evil becomes the law of the world england had been rendered a painful residence to shelley as much by the sort of persecution with which in those days all men of liberal opinions were visited and by the injustice he had lately endured in the court of chancery as by the symptoms of disease which made him regard a visit to italy as necessary to prolong his life an exile and strongly impressed with the feeling that the majority of his countrymen regarded him with sentiments of aversion such as his own heart could experience towards none he sheltered himself from such disgusting and painful thoughts in the calm retreats of poetry and built up a world of his own with the more pleasure since he hoped to induce some one or two to believe that the earth might become such did mankind themselves consent the charm of the roman climate helped to clothe his thoughts in greater beauty than they had ever worn before and as he wandered among the ruins made one with nature in their decay or gazed on the praxitelean shapes that throng the vatican the capitol and the palaces of rome his soul imbibed forms of loveliness which became a portion of itself there are many passages in the prometheus which show the intense delight he received from such studies and give back the impression with a beauty of poetical description peculiarly his own he felt this as a poet must feel when he satisfies himself by the result of his labours and he wrote from rome my prometheus unbound is just finished and in a month or two i shall send it it is a drama with characters and mechanism of a kind yet unattempted and i think the execution is better than any of my former attempts i may mention for the information of the more critical reader that the verbal alterations in this edition of prometheus are made from a list of errata written by shelley himself the cenci a tragedy in five acts composed at rome and near leghorn villa valsovano mayaugust published spring by c j ollier london this edition of two hundred and fifty copies was printed in italy because writes shelley to peacock september it costs with all duties and freightage about half what it would cost in london a table of errata in mrs shelleys handwriting is printed by forman in the shelley library page a second edition published by ollier in ch reynell printer embodies the corrections indicated in this table no manuscript of the cenci is known to exist our text follows that of the

part that of the editio princeps of dedication to leigh hunt esq mv dear friend i inscribe with your name from a distant country and after an absence whose months have seemed years this the latest of my literary efforts those writings which i have hitherto published have been little else than visions which impersonate my own apprehensions of the beautiful and the just i can also perceive in them the literary defects incidental to youth and impatience they are dreams of what ought to be or may be the drama which i now present to you is a sad reality i lay aside the presumptuous attitude of an instructor and am content to paint with such colours as my own heart furnishes that which has been had i known a person more highly endowed than yourself with all that it becomes a man to possess i had solicited for this work the ornament of his name one more gentle honourable innocent and brave one of more exalted toleration for all who do and think evil and yet himself more free from evil one who knows better how to receive and how to confer a benefit though he must ever confer far more than he can receive one of simpler and in the highest sense of the word of purer life and manners i never knew and i had already been fortunate in friendships when your name was added to the list in that patient and irreconcilable enmity with domestic and political tyranny and imposture which the tenor of your life has illustrated and which had i health and talents should illustrate mine let us comforting each other in our task live and die all happiness attend you your affectionate friend percy b shelley rome may the cenci preface a manuscript was communicated to me during my travels in italy which was copied from the archives of the cenci palace at rome and contains a detailed account of the horrors which ended in the extinction of one of the noblest and richest families of that city during the pontificate of clement viii in the year the story is that an old man having spent his life in debauchery and wickedness conceived at length an implacable hatred towards his children which showed itself towards one daughter under the form of an incestuous passion aggravated by every circumstance of cruelty and violence this daughter after long and vain attempts to escape from what she considered a perpetual contamination both of body and mind at length plotted with her motherinlaw and brother to murder their common tyrant the young maiden who was urged to this tremendous deed by an impulse which overpowered its horror was evidently a most gentle and amiable being a creature formed to adorn and be admired and thus violently thwarted from her nature by the necessity of circumstance and opinion the deed was quickly discovered and in spite of the most earnest prayers made to the pope by the highest persons in rome the criminals were put to death the old man had during his life repeatedly bought his pardon from the pope for capital crimes of the most enormous and unspeakable kind at the price of a hundred thousand crowns the death therefore of his victims can scarcely be accounted for by the love of justice the pope among other motives for severity probably felt that whoever killed the count cenci deprived his treasury of a certain and copious source of revenue the papal government formerly took the most extraordinary precautions against the publicity of facts which offer so tragical a demonstration of its own wickedness and weakness so that the communication of the manuscript had become until very lately a matter of some difficulty such a story if told so as to present to the reader all the feelings of those who once acted it their hopes and fears their confidences and misgivings their various interests passions and opinions acting upon and with each other yet all conspiring to one tremendous end would be as a light to make apparent some of the most dark and secret caverns of the human heart on my arrival at rome i found that the story of the cenci was a subject not to be mentioned in italian society without awakening a deep and breathless interest and that the feelings of the company never failed to incline to a romantic pity for the wrongs and a passionate exculpation of the horrible deed to which they urged her who has been mingled two centuries with the common dust all ranks of people knew the outlines of this history and participated in the overwhelming interest which it seems to have the magic of exciting in the human heart i had a copy of guidos picture of beatrice which is preserved in the colonna palace and my servant instantly recognized it as the portrait of la cenci this national and universal interest which the story produces and has produced for two centuries and among all ranks of people in a great city where the imagination is kept for ever active and awake first suggested to me the conception of its fitness for a dramatic purpose in fact it is a tragedy which has already received from its capacity of awakening and sustaining the sympathy of men approbation and success nothing remained as i imagined but to clothe it to the apprehensions of my countrymen in such language and action as would bring it home to their hearts the deepest and the sublimest tragic compositions king lear and the two plays in which the tale of oedipus is told were stories which already existed in tradition as matters of popular belief and interest before shakspeare and sophocles made them familiar to the sympathy of all succeeding generations of mankind this story of the cenci is indeed eminently fearful and monstrous anything like a dry exhibition of it on the stage would be insupportable the person who would treat such a subject must increase the ideal and diminish the actual horror of the events so that the pleasure which arises from the poetry which exists in these tempestuous sufferings and crimes may mitigate the pain of the contemplation of the moral deformity from which they spring there must also be nothing attempted to make the exhibition subservient to what is vulgarly termed a moral purpose the highest moral purpose aimed at in the highest species of the drama is the teaching the human heart through its sympathies and antipathies the knowledge of itself in proportion to the possession of which knowledge every human being is wise just sincere tolerant and kind if dogmas can do more it is well but a drama is no fit place for the enforcement of them undoubtedly no person can be truly dishonoured by the act of another and the fit return to make to the most enormous injuries is kindness and forbearance and a resolution to convert the injurer from his dark passions by peace and love revenge retaliation atonement are pernicious mistakes if beatrice had thought in this manner she would have been wiser and better but she would never have been a tragic character the few whom such an exhibition would have interested could never have been sufficiently interested for a dramatic purpose from the want of finding sympathy in their interest among the mass who surround them it is in the restless and anatomizing casuistry with which men seek the justification of beatrice yet feel that she has done what needs justification it is in the superstitious horror with which they contemplate alike her wrongs and their revenge that the dramatic character of what she did and suffered consists i have endeavoured as nearly as possible to represent the characters as they probably were and have sought to avoid the error of making them actuated by my own conceptions of right or wrong false or true thus under a thin veil converting names and actions of the sixteenth century into cold impersonations of my own mind they are represented as catholics and as catholics deeply tinged with religion to a protestant apprehension there will appear something unnatural in the earnest and perpetual sentiment of the relations between god and men which pervade the tragedy of the cenci it will especially be startled at the combination of an undoubting persuasion of the truth of the popular religion with a cool and determined perseverance in enormous guilt but religion in italy is not as in protestant countries a cloak to be worn on particular days or a passport which those who do not wish to be railed at carry with them to exhibit or a gloomy passion for penetrating the impenetrable mysteries of our being which terrifies its possessor at the darkness of the abyss to the brink of which it has conducted him religion coexists as it were in the mind of an italian catholic with a faith in that of which all men have the most certain knowledge it is interwoven with the whole fabric of life it is adoration faith submission penitence blind admiration not a rule for moral conduct it has no necessary connection with any one virtue the most atrocious villain may be rigidly devout and without any shock to established faith confess himself to be so religion pervades intensely the whole frame of society and is according to the temper of the mind which it inhabits a passion a persuasion an excuse a refuge never a check cenci himself built a chapel in the court of his palace and dedicated it to st thomas the apostle and established masses for the peace of his soul thus in the first scene of the fourth act lucretias design in exposing herself to the consequences of an expostulation with cenci after having administered the opiate was to induce him by a feigned tale to confess himself before death this being esteemed by catholics as essential to salvation and she only relinquishes her purpose when she perceives that her perseverance would expose beatrice to new outrages i have avoided with great care in writing this play the introduction of what is commonly called mere poetry and i imagine there will scarcely be found a detached simile or a single isolated description unless beatrices description of the chasm appointed for her fathers murder should be judged to be of that nature an idea in this speech was suggested by a most sublime passage in el purgaterio de san patricio of calderon the only plagiarism which i have intentionally committed in the whole piece in a dramatic composition the imagery and the passion should interpenetrate one another the former being reserved simply for the full development and illustration of the latter imagination is as the immortal god which should assume flesh for the redemption of mortal passion it is thus that the most remote and the most familiar imagery may alike be fit for dramatic purposes when employed in the illustration of strong feeling which raises what is low and levels to the apprehension that which is lofty casting over all the shadow of its own greatness in other respects i have written more carelessly that is without an overfastidious and learned choice of words in this respect i entirely agree with those modern critics who assert that in order to move men to true sympathy we must use the familiar language of men and that our great ancestors the ancient english poets are the writers a study of whom might incite us to do that for our own age which they have done for theirs but it must be the real language of men in general and not that of any particular class to whose society the writer happens to belong so much for what i have attempted i need not be assured that success is a very different matter particularly for one whose attention has but newly been awakened to the study of dramatic literature i endeavoured whilst at rome to observe such monuments of this story as might be accessible to a stranger the portrait of beatrice at the colonna palace is admirable as a work of art it was taken by guido during her confinement in prison but it is most interesting as a just representation of one of the loveliest specimens of the workmanship of nature there is a fixed and pale composure upon the features she seems sad and stricken down in spirit yet the despair thus expressed is lightened by the patience of gentleness her head is bound with folds of white drapery from which the yellow strings of her golden hair escape and fall about her neck the moulding of her face is exquisitely delicate the eyebrows are distinct and arched the lips have that permanent meaning of imagination and sensibility which suffering has not repressed and which it seems as if death scarcely could extinguish her forehead is large and clear her eyes which we are told were remarkable for their vivacity are swollen with weeping and lustreless but beautifully tender and serene in the whole mien there is a simplicity and dignity which united with her exquisite loveliness and deep sorrow are inexpressibly pathetic beatrice cenci appears to have been one of those rare persons in whom energy and gentleness dwell together without destroying one another her nature was simple and profound the crimes and miseries in which she was an actor and a sufferer are as the mask and the mantle in which circumstances clothed her for her impersonation on the scene of the world the cenci palace is of great extent and though in part modernized there yet remains a vast and gloomy pile of feudal architecture in the same state as during the dreadful scenes which are the subject of this tragedy the palace is situated in an obscure corner of rome near the quarter of the jews and from the upper windows you see the immense ruins of mount palatine half hidden under their profuse overgrowth of trees there is a court in one part of the palace perhaps that in which cenci built the chapel to st thomas supported by granite columns and adorned with antique friezes of fine workmanship and built up according to the ancient italian fashion with balcony over balcony of openwork one of the gates of the palace formed of immense stones and leading through a passage dark and lofty and opening into gloomy subterranean chambers struck me particularly of the castle of petrella i could obtain no further information than that which is to be found in the manuscript the cenci a tragedy in five acts dramatis personae count francesco cenci giacomo bernardo his sons cardinal camillo prince colonna orsino a prelate savella the popes legate olimpio marzio assassins andrea servant to cenci nobles judges guards servants lucretia wife of cenci and stepmother of his children beatrice his daughter the scene lies principally in rome but changes during the fourth act to petrella a castle among the apulian apennines time during the pontificate of clement viii act scene an apartment in the cenci palace enter count cenci and cardinal camillo camillo that matter of the murder is hushed up if you consent to yield his holiness your fief that lies beyond the pincian gate it needed all my interest in the conclave to bend him to this point he said that you bought perilous impunity with your gold that crimes like yours if once or twice compounded enriched the church and respited from hell an erring soul which might repent and live but that the glory and the interest of the high throne he fills little consist with making it a daily mart of guilt as manifold and hideous as the deeds which you scarce hide from mens revolted eyes cenci the third of my possessions let it go ay i once heard the nephew of the pope had sent his architect to view the ground meaning to build a villa on my vines the next time i compounded with his uncle i little thought he should outwit me so henceforth no witness not the lamp shall see that which the vassal threatened to divulge whose throat is choked with dust for his reward the deed he saw could not have rated higher than his most worthless life it angers me respited me from hell so may the devil respite their souls from heaven no doubt pope clement and his most charitable nephews pray that the apostle peter and the saints will grant for their sake that i long enjoy strength wealth and pride and lust and length of days wherein to act the deeds which are the stewards of their revenue but much yet remains to which they show no title camillo oh count cenci so much that thou mightst honourably live and reconcile thyself with thine own heart and with thy god and with the offended world how hideously look deeds of lust and blood through those snow white and venerable hairs your children should be sitting round you now but that you fear to read upon their looks the shame and misery you have written there where is your wife where is your gentle daughter methinks her sweet looks which make all things else beauteous and glad might kill the fiend within you why is she barred from all society but her own strange and uncomplaining wrongs talk with me count you know i mean you well i stood beside your dark and fiery youth watching its bold and bad career as men watch meteors but it vanished not i marked your desperate and remorseless manhood now do i behold you in dishonoured age charged with a thousand unrepented crimes yet i have ever hoped you would amend and in that hope have saved your life three times cenci for which aldobrandino owes you now my fief beyond the pincian cardinal one thing i pray you recollect henceforth and so we shall converse with less restraint a man you knew spoke of my wife and daughter he was accustomed to frequent my house so the next day his wife and daughter came and asked if i had seen him and i smiled i think they never saw him any more camillo thou execrable man beware cenci of thee nay this is idle we should know each other as to my character for what men call crime seeing i please my senses as i list and vindicate that right with force or guile it is a public matter and i care not if i discuss it with you i may speak alike to you and my own conscious heart for you give out that you have half reformed me therefore strong vanity will keep you silent if fear should not both will i do not doubt all men delight in sensual luxury all men enjoy revenge and most exult over the tortures they can never feel flattering their secret peace with others pain but i delight in nothing else i love the sight of agony and the sense of joy when this shall be anothers and that mine and i have no remorse and little fear which are i think the checks of other men this mood has grown upon me until now any design my captious fancy makes the picture of its wish and it forms none but such as men like you would start to know is as my natural food and rest debarred until it be accomplished camillo art thou not most miserable cenci why miserable no i am what your theologians call hardened which they must be in impudence so to revile a mans peculiar taste true i was happier than i am while yet manhood remained to act the thing i thought while lust was sweeter than revenge and now invention palls ay we must all grow old and but that there remains a deed to act whose horror might make sharp an appetite duller than mine id do i know not what when i was young i thought of nothing else but pleasure and i fed on honey sweets men by st thomas cannot live like bees and i grew tired yet till i killed a foe and heard his groans and heard his childrens groans knew i not what delight was else on earth which now delights me little i the rather look on such pangs as terror ill conceals the dry fixed eyeball the pale quivering lip which tell me that the spirit weeps within tears bitterer than the bloody sweat of christ i rarely kill the body which preserves like a strong prison the soul within my power wherein i feed it with the breath of fear for hourly pain note and but that edition but that editions camillo hells most abandoned fiend did never in the drunkenness of guilt speak to his heart as now you speak to me i thank my god that i believe you not enter andrea andrea my lord a gentleman from salamanca would speak with you cenci bid him attend me in the grand

husbandry or gold the old mans sword falls from my withered hand but yesterday there came an order from the pope to make fourfold provision for my cursed sons whom i had sent from rome to salamanca hoping some accident might cut them off and meaning if i could to starve them there i pray thee god send some quick death upon them bernardo and my wife could not be worse if dead and damned then as to beatrice looking around him suspiciously i think they cannot hear me at that door what if they should and yet i need not speak though the heart triumphs with itself in words o thou most silent air

cenci palace enter beatrice and orsino as in conversation beatrice pervert not truth orsino you remember where we held that conversation nay we see the spot even from this cypress two long years are past since on an april midnight underneath the moonlight ruins of mount palatine i did confess to you my secret mind orsino you said you loved me then beatrice you are a priest speak to me not of love orsino i may obtain the dispensation of the pope to marry because i am a priest do you believe your image as the hunter some struck deer follows me not whether i wake or sleep beatrice as i have said speak to me not of love had you a dispensation i have not nor will i leave this home of misery whilst my poor bernard and that gentle lady to whom i owe life and these virtuous thoughts must suffer what i still have strength to share alas orsino all the love that once i felt for you is turned to bitter pain ours was a youthful contract which you first broke by assuming vows no pope will loose and thus i love you still but holily even as a sister or a spirit might and so i swear a cold fidelity and it is well perhaps we shall not marry you have a sly equivocating vein that suits me not ah wretched that i am where shall i turn even now you look on me as you were not my friend and as if you discovered that i thought so with false smiles making my true suspicion seem your wrong ah no forgive me sorrow makes me seem sterner than else my nature might have been i have a weight of melancholy thoughts and they forebode but what can they forebode worse than i now endure note and thus editions and yet edition orsino all will be well is the petition yet prepared you know my zeal for all you wish sweet beatrice doubt not but i will use my utmost skill so that the pope attend to your complaint beatrice your zeal for all i wish ah me you are cold your utmost skillspeak but one word aside alas weak and deserted creature that i am here i stand bickering with my only friend to orsino this night my father gives a sumptuous feast orsino he has heard some happy news from salamanca from my brothers there and with this outward show of love he mocks his inward hate tis bold hypocrisy for he would gladlier celebrate their deaths which i have heard him pray for on his knees great god that such a father should be mine but there is mighty preparation made and all our kin the cenci will be there and all the chief nobility of rome and he has bidden me and my pale mother attire ourselves in festival array poor lady she expects some happy change in his dark spirit from this act i none at supper i will give you the petition till when farewell orsino farewell exit beatrice i know the pope will neer absolve me from my priestly vow but by absolving me from the revenue of many a wealthy see and beatrice i think to win thee at an easier rate nor shall he read her eloquent petition he might bestow her on some poor relation of his sixth cousin as he did her sister and i should be debarred from all access then as to what she suffers from her father in all this there is much exaggeration old men are testy and will have their way a man may stab his enemy or his vassal and live a free life as to wine or women and with a peevish temper may return to a dull home and rate his wife and children daughters and wives call this foul tyranny i shall be well content if on my conscience there rest no heavier sin than what they suffer from the devices of my love a net from which he shall escape not yet i fear her subtle mind her aweinspiring gaze whose beams anatomize me

the antelopes eye if she escape me note vassal edition slave edition exit scene a magnificent hall in the cenci palace a banquet enter cenci lucretia beatrice orsino camillo nobles cenci welcome my friends and kinsmen welcome ye princes and cardinals pillars of the church whose presence honours our festivity i have too long lived like an anchorite and in my absence from your merry meetings an evil word is gone abroad of me but i do hope that you my noble friends when you have shared the entertainment here and heard the pious cause for which tis given and we have pledged a health or two together will think me flesh and blood as well as you sinful indeed for adam made all so but tenderhearted meek and pitiful first guest in truth my lord you seem too light of heart too sprightly and companionable a man to act the deeds that rumour pins on you to his companion i never saw such blithe and open cheer in any eye second guest some most desired event in which we all demand a common joy has brought us hither let us hear it count cenci it is indeed a most desired event if when a parent from a parents heart lifts from this earth to the great father of all a prayer both when he lays him down to sleep and when he rises up from dreaming it one supplication one desire one hope that he would grant a wish for his two sons even all that he demands in their regard and suddenly beyond his dearest hope it is accomplished he should then rejoice and call his friends and kinsmen to a feast and task their love to grace his merriment then honour me thus far for i am he beatrice to lucretia great god how horrible some dreadful ill must have befallen my brothers lucretia fear not child he speaks too frankly beatrice ah my blood runs cold i fear that wicked laughter round his eye which wrinkles up the skin even to the hair cenci here are the letters brought from salamanca beatrice read them to your mother god i thank thee in one night didst thou perform by ways inscrutable the thing i sought my disobedient and rebellious sons are dead why dead what means this change of cheer you hear me not i tell you they are dead and they will need no food or raiment more the tapers that did light them the dark way are their last cost the pope i think will not expect i should maintain them in their coffins rejoice with me my heart is wondrous glad lucretia sinks half fainting beatrice supports her beatrice it is not true dear lady pray look up had it been true there is a god in heaven he would not live to boast of such a boon unnatural man thou knowest that it is false cenci ay as the word of god whom here i call to witness that i speak the sober truth and whose most favouring providence was shown even in the manner of their deaths for rocco was kneeling at the mass with sixteen others when the church fell and crushed him to a mummy the rest escaped unhurt cristofano was stabbed in error by a jealous man whilst she he loved was sleeping with his rival all in the selfsame hour of the same night which shows that heaven has special care of me i beg those friends who love me that they mark the day a feast upon their calendars it was the twentyseventh of december ay read the letters if you doubt my oath the assembly appears confused several of the guests rise first guest oh horrible i will depart second guest and i third guest no stay i do believe it is some jest though faith tis mocking us somewhat too solemnly i think his son has married the infanta or found a mine of gold in el dorado tis but to season some such news stay stay i see tis only raillery by his smile cenci filling a bowl of wine and lifting it up oh thou bright wine whose purple splendour leaps and bubbles gaily in this golden bowl under the lamplight as my spirits do to hear the death of my accursed sons could i believe thou wert their mingled blood then would i taste thee like a sacrament and pledge with thee the mighty devil in hell who if a fathers curses as men say climb with swift wings after their childrens souls and drag them from the very throne of heaven now triumphs in my triumph but thou art superfluous i have drunken deep of joy and i will taste no other wine tonight here andrea bear the bowl around a guest rising thou wretch will none among this noble company check the abandoned villain camillo for gods sake let me dismiss the guests you are insane some ill will come of this second guest seize silence him first guest i will third guest and i cenci addressing those who rise with a threatening gesture who moves who speaks turning to the company tis nothing enjoy yourselves beware for my revenge is as the sealed commission of a king that kills and none dare name the murderer the banquet is broken up several of the guests are departing beatrice i do entreat you go not noble guests what although tyranny and impious hate stand sheltered by a fathers hoary hair what if tis he who clothed us in these limbs who tortures them and triumphs what if we the desolate and the dead were his own flesh his children and his wife whom he is bound to love and shelter shall we therefore find no refuge in this merciless wide world o think what deep wrongs must have blotted out first love then reverence in a childs prone mind till it thus vanquish shame and fear o think i have borne much and kissed the sacred hand which crushed us to the earth and thought its stroke was perhaps some paternal chastisement have excused much doubted and when no doubt remained have sought by patience love and tears to soften him and when this could not be i have knelt down through the long sleepless nights and lifted up to god the father of all passionate prayers and when these were not heard i have still borne until i meet you here princes and kinsmen at this hideous feast given at my brothers deaths two yet remain his wife remains and i whom if ye save not ye may soon share such merriment again as fathers make over their childrens graves o prince colonna thou art our near kinsman cardinal thou art the popes chamberlain camillo thou art chief justiciary take us away cenci he has been conversing with camillo during the first part of beatrices speech he hears the conclusion and now advances i hope my good friends here will think of their own daughters or perhaps of their own throats before they lend an ear to this wild girl beatrice not noticing the words of cenci dare no one look on me none answer can one tyrant overbear the sense of many best and wisest men or is it that i sue not in some form of scrupulous law that ye deny my suit o god that i were buried with my brothers and that the flowers of this departed spring were fading on my grave and that my father were celebrating now one feast for all note no edition not edition camillo a bitter wish

company but ill must come of ill frown not on me haste hide thyself lest with avenging looks my brothers ghosts should hunt thee from thy seat cover thy face from every living eye and start if thou but hear a human step seek out some dark and silent corner there bow thy white head before offended god and we will kneel around and fervently pray that he pity both ourselves and thee cenci my friends i do lament this insane girl has spoilt the mirth of our festivity good night farewell i will not make you longer spectators of our dull domestic quarrels another time exeunt all but cenci and beatrice my brain is swimming round give me a bowl of wine to beatrice thou painted viper beast that thou art fair and yet terrible i know a charm shall make thee meek and tame now get thee from my sight exit beatrice here andrea fill up this goblet with greek wine i said i would not drink this evening but i must for strange to say i feel my spirits fail with thinking what i have decreed to do

drink the charm works well it must be done it shall be done i swear exit end of act act scene an apartment in the cenci palace enter lucretia and bernardo lucretia weep not my gentle boy he struck but me who have borne deeper wrongs in truth if he had killed me he had done a kinder deed o god almighty do thou look upon us we have no other friend but only thee yet weep not though i love you as my

on others but he smiles on me even as he did after the feast last night enter a servant almighty god how merciful thou art tis but orsinos servant well what news servant my master bids me say the holy father has sent back your petition thus unopened giving a paper and he demands at what hour twere secure to visit you again lucretia at the ave mary exit servant so daughter our last hope has failed ah me how pale you look you tremble and you stand wrapped in some fixed and fearful meditation as if one thought were over strong for you your eyes have a chill glare o dearest child are you gone mad if not pray speak to me beatrice you see i am not mad i speak to you lucretia you talked of something that your father did after that dreadful feast could it be worse than when he smiled and cried my sons are dead and every one looked in his neighbours face to see if others were as white as he at the first word he spoke i felt the blood rush to my heart and fell into a trance and when it passed i sat all weak and wild whilst you alone stood up and with strong words checked his unnatural pride and i could see the devil was rebuked that lives in him until this hour thus you have ever stood between us and your fathers moody wrath like a protecting presence your firm mind has been our only refuge and defence what can have thus subdued it what can now have given you that cold melancholy look succeeding to your unaccustomed fear beatrice what is it that you say i was just thinking twere better not to struggle any more men like my father have been dark and bloody yet never oh before worse comes of it twere wise to die it ends in that at last lucretia oh talk not so dear child tell me at once what did your father do or say to you he stayed not after that accursed feast one moment in your chamber speak to me bernardo oh sister sister prithee speak to us beatrice speaking very slowly with a forced calmness it was one word mother one little word one look one smile wildly oh he has trampled me under his feet and made the blood stream down my pallid cheeks and he has given us all ditchwater and the feverstricken flesh of buffaloes and bade us eat or starve and we have eaten he has made me look on my beloved bernardo when the rust of heavy chains has gangrened his sweet limbs and i have never yet despaired but now what could i say recovering herself ah no tis nothing new the sufferings we all share have made me wild he only struck and cursed me as he passed he said he looked he did nothing at all beyond his wont yet it disordered me alas i am forgetful of my duty i should preserve my senses for your sake lucretia nay beatrice have courage my sweet girl if any one despairs it should be i who loved him once and now must live with him till god in pity call for him or me for you may like your sister find some husband and smile years hence with children round your knees whilst i then dead and all this hideous coil shall be remembered only as a dream beatrice talk not to me dear lady of a husband did you not nurse me when my mother died did you not shield me and that dearest boy and had we any other friend but you in infancy with gentle words and looks to win our father not to murder us and shall i now desert you may the ghost of my dead mother plead against my soul if i abandon her who filled the place she left with more even than a mothers love bernardo and i am of my sisters mind indeed i would not leave you in this wretchedness even though the pope should make me free to live in some blithe place like others of my age with sports and delicate food and the fresh air oh never think that i will leave you mother lucretia my dear dear children enter cenci suddenly cenci what beatrice here come hither she shrinks back and covers her face nay hide not your face tis fair look up why yesternight you dared to look with disobedient insolence upon me bending a stern and an inquiring brow on what i meant whilst i then sought to hide that which i came to tell you but in vain beatrice wildly staggering towards the door oh that the earth would gape hide me o god cenci then it was i whose inarticulate words fell from my lips and who with tottering steps fled from your presence as you now from mine stay i command you from this day and hour never again i think with fearless eye and brow superior and unaltered cheek and that lip made for tenderness or scorn shalt thou strike dumb the meanest of mankind me least of all now get thee to thy chamber thou too loathed image of thy cursed mother to bernardo thy milky meek face makes me sick with hate exeunt beatrice and bernardo aside so much has passed between us as must make me bold her fearful tis an awful thing to touch such mischief as i now conceive so men sit shivering on the dewy bank and try the chill stream with their feet once in how the delighted spirit pants for joy lucretia advancing timidly towards him o husband pray forgive poor beatrice she meant not any ill cenci nor you perhaps nor that young imp whom you have taught by rote parricide with his alphabet nor giacomo nor those two most unnatural sons who stirred enmity up against me with the pope whom in one night merciful god cut off innocent lambs they thought not any ill you were not here conspiring you said nothing of how i might be dungeoned as a madman or be condemned to death for some offence and you would be the witnesses this failing how just it were to hire assassins or put sudden poison in my evening drink or smother me when overcome by wine seeing we had no other judge but god and he had sentenced me and there were none but you to be the executioners of his decree enregistered in heaven oh no you said not this lucretia so help me god i never thought the things you charge me with cenci if you dare to speak that wicked lie again ill kill you what it was not by your counsel that beatrice disturbed the feast last night you did not hope to stir some enemies against me and escape and laugh to scorn what every nerve of you now trembles at you judged that men were bolder than they are few dare to stand between their grave and me lucretia look not so dreadfully by my salvation i knew not aught that beatrice designed nor do i think she designed any thing until she heard you talk of her dead brothers cenci blaspheming liar you are damned for this but i will take you where you may persuade the stones you tread on to deliver you for men shall there be none but those who dare all things not question that which i command on wednesday next i shall set out you know that savage rock the castle of petrella tis safely walled and moated round about its dungeons underground and its thick towers never told tales though they have heard and seen what might make dumb things speak why do you linger make speediest preparation for the journey exit lucretia the allbeholding sun yet shines i hear a busy stir of men about the streets i see the bright sky through the window panes it is a garish broad and peering day loud light suspicious full of eyes and ears and every little corner nook and hole is penetrated with the insolent light come darkness yet what is the day to me and wherefore should i wish for night who do a deed which shall confound both night and day tis she shall grope through a bewildering mist of horror if there be a sun in heaven she shall not dare to look upon its beams nor feel its warmth let her then wish for night the act i think shall soon extinguish all for me i bear a darker deadlier gloom than the earths shade or interlunar air or constellations quenched in murkiest cloud in which i walk secure and unbeheld towards my purpose would that it were done exit scene a chamber in the vatican enter camillo and giacomo in conversation camillo there is an obsolete and doubtful law by which you might obtain a bare provision of food and clothing giacomo nothing more alas bare must be the provision which strict law awards and aged sullen avarice pays why did my father not apprentice me to some mechanic trade i should have then been trained in no highborn necessities which i could meet not by my daily toil the eldest son of a rich nobleman is heir to all his incapacities he has wide wants and narrow powers if you cardinal camillo were reduced at once from thricedriven beds of down and delicate food an hundred servants and six palaces to that which nature doth indeed require camillo nay there is reason in your plea twere hard giacomo tis hard for a firm man to bear but i have a dear wife a lady of high birth whose dowry in ill hour i lent my father without a bond or witness to the deed and children who inherit her fine senses the fairest creatures in this breathing world and she and they reproach me not cardinal do you not think the pope would interpose and stretch authority beyond the law camillo though your peculiar case is hard i know the pope will not divert the course of law after that impious feast the other night i spoke with him and urged him then to check your fathers cruel hand he frowned and said children are disobedient and they sting their fathers hearts to madness and despair requiting years of care with contumely i pity the count cenci from my heart his outraged love perhaps awakened hate and thus he is exasperated to ill in the great war between the old and young i who have white hairs and a tottering body will keep at least blameless neutrality enter orsino you my good lord orsino heard those words orsino what words giacomo alas repeat them not again there then is no redress for me at least none but that which i may achieve myself since i am driven to the brink but say my innocent sister and my only brother are dying underneath my fathers eye the memorable torturers of this land galeaz visconti borgia ezzelin never inflicted on their meanest slave what these endure shall they have no protection camillo why if they would petition to the pope i see not how he could refuse it yet he holds it of most dangerous example in aught to weaken the paternal power being as twere the shadow of his own i pray you now excuse me i have business that will not bear delay exit camillo giacomo but you orsino have the petition wherefore not present it orsino i have presented it and backed it with my earnest prayers and urgent interest it was returned unanswered i doubt not but that the strange and execrable deeds alleged in it in truth they might well baffle any belief have turned the popes displeasure upon the accusers from the criminal so i should guess from what camillo said giacomo my friend that palacewalking devil gold has whispered silence to his holiness and we are left as scorpions ringed with fire what should we do but strike ourselves to death for he who is our murderous persecutor is shielded by a fathers holy name or i would stops abruptly orsino what fear not to speak your thought words are but holy as the deeds they cover a priest who has forsworn the god he serves a judge who makes truth weep at his decree a friend who should weave counsel as i now but as the mantle of some selfish guile a father who is all a tyrant seems were the profaner for his sacred name note makes truth edition makes the truth editions giacomo ask me not what i think the unwilling brain feigns often what it would not and we trust imagination with such fantasies as the tongue dares not fashion into words which have no words their horror makes them dim to the minds eye my heart denies itself to think what you demand orsino but a friends bosom is as the inmost cave of our own mind where we sit shut from the wide gaze of day and from the allcommunicating air you look what i suspected giacomo spare me now i am as one lost in a midnight wood who dares not ask some harmless passenger the path across the wilderness lest he as my thoughts are should be a murderer i know you are my friend and all i dare speak to my soul that will i trust with thee but now my heart is heavy and would take lone counsel from a night of sleepless care pardon me that i say farewell farewell i would that to my own suspected self i could address a word so full of peace orsino farewell be your thoughts better or more bold exit giacomo i had disposed the cardinal camillo to feed his hope with cold encouragement it fortunately serves my close designs that tis a trick of this same family to analyse their own and other minds such selfanatomy shall teach the will dangerous secrets for it tempts our powers knowing what must be thought and may be done into the depth of darkest purposes so cenci fell into the pit even i since beatrice unveiled me to myself and made me shrink from what i cannot shun show a poor figure to my own esteem to which i grow half reconciled ill do as little mischief as i can that thought shall fee the accuser conscience after a pause now what harm if cenci should be murdered yet if murdered wherefore by me and what if i could take the profit yet omit the sin and peril in such an action of all earthly things i fear a man whose blows outspeed his words and such is cenci and while cenci lives his daughters dowry were a secret grave if a priest wins her oh fair beatrice would that i loved thee not or loving thee could but despise danger and gold and all that frowns between my wish and its effect or smiles beyond it there is no escape her bright form kneels beside me at the altar and follows me to the resort of men and fills my slumber with tumultuous dreams so when i wake my blood seems liquid fire and if i strike my damp and dizzy head my hot palm scorches it her very name but spoken by a stranger makes my heart sicken and pant and thus unprofitably i clasp the phantom of unfelt delights till weak imagination half possesses the selfcreated shadow yet much longer will i not nurse this life of feverous hours from the unravelled hopes of giacomo i must work out my own dear purposes i see as from a tower the end of all her father dead her brother bound to me by a dark secret surer than the grave her mother scared and unexpostulating from the dread manner of her wish achieved and she once more take courage my faint heart what dares a friendless maiden matched with thee i have such foresight as assures success some unbeheld divinity doth ever when dread events are near stir up mens minds to black suggestions and he prospers best not who becomes the instrument of ill but who can flatter the dark spirit that makes its empire and its prey of other hearts till it become his slaveas i will do exit end of act act scene an apartment in the cenci palace lucretia to her enter beatrice beatrice she enters staggering and speaks wildly reach me that handkerchief my brain is hurt my eyes are full of blood just wipe them for me i see but indistinctly lucretia my sweet child you have no wound tis only a cold dew that starts from your dear brow alas alas what has befallen beatrice how comes this hair undone its wandering strings must be what blind me so and yet i tied it fast oh horrible the pavement sinks under my feet the walls spin round i see a woman weeping there and standing calm and motionless whilst i slide giddily as the world reelsmy god the beautiful blue heaven is flecked with blood the sunshine on the floor is black the air is changed to vapours such as the dead breathe in charnel pits pah i am choked there creeps a clinging black contaminating mist about metis substantial heavy thick i cannot pluck it from me for it glues my fingers and my limbs to one another and eats into my sinews and dissolves my flesh to a pollution poisoning the subtle pure and inmost spirit of life my god i never knew what the mad felt before for i am mad beyond all doubt more wildly no i am dead these putrefying limbs shut round and sepulchre the panting soul which would burst forth into the wandering air a pause what hideous thought was that i had even now tis gone and yet its burthen remains here oer these dull eyesupon this weary heart o world o life o day o misery lucretia what ails thee my poor child she answers not her spirit apprehends the sense of pain but not its cause suffering has dried away the source from which it sprung beatrice franticly like parricide misery has killed its father yet its father never like mineo god what thing am i lucretia my dearest child what has your father done beatrice doubtfully who art thou questioner i have no father aside she is the madhouse nurse who tends on me it is a piteous office to lucretia in a slow subdued voice do you know i thought i was that wretched beatrice men speak of whom her father sometimes hales from hall to hall by the entangled hair at others pens up naked in damp cells where scaly reptiles crawl and starves her there till she will eat strange flesh this woful story so did i overact in my sick dreams that i imaginedno it cannot be horrible things have been in this wide world prodigious mixtures and confusions strange of good and ill and worse have been conceived than ever there was found a heart to do but never fancy imaged such a deed as pauses suddenly recollecting herself who art thou swear to me ere i die with fearful expectation that indeed thou art not what thou seemestmother lucretia oh my sweet child know you beatrice yet speak it not for then if this be truth that other too must be a truth a firm enduring truth linked with each lasting circumstance of life never to change never to pass away why so it is this is the cenci palace thou art lucretia i am beatrice i have talked some wild words but will no more mother come near me from this point of time i am her voice dies away faintly lucretia alas what has befallen thee child what has thy father done beatrice what have i done am i not innocent is it my crime that one with white hair and imperious brow who tortured me from my forgotten years as parents only dare should call himself my father yet should be oh what am i what name what place what memory shall be mine what retrospects outliving even despair lucretia he is a violent tyrant surely child we know that death alone can make us free his death or ours but what can he have done of deadlier outrage or worse injury thou art unlike thyself thine eyes shoot forth a wandering and strange spirit speak to me unlock those pallid hands whose fingers twine with one another beatrice tis the restless life tortured within them if i try to speak i shall go mad ay something must be done what yet i know notsomething which shall make the thing that i have suffered but a shadow in the dread lightning which avenges it brief rapid irreversible destroying the consequence of what it cannot cure some such thing is to be endured or done when i know what i shall be still and calm and never anything will move me more but now o blood which art my fathers blood circling through these contaminated veins if thou poured forth on the polluted earth could wash away the crime and punishment by which i sufferno that cannot be many might doubt there were a god above who sees and permits evil and so die that faith no agony shall obscure in me lucretia it must indeed have been some bitter wrong yet what i dare not guess oh my lost child hide not in proud impenetrable grief thy sufferings from my fear beatrice i hide them not what are the words which yon would have me speak i who can feign no image in my mind of that which has transformed me i whose thought is like a ghost shrouded and folded up in its own formless horror of all words that minister to mortal intercourse which wouldst thou hear for there is none to tell my misery if another ever knew aught like to it she died as i will die and left it as i must without a name death death our law and our religion call thee a punishment and a rewardoh which have i deserved lucretia the peace of innocence till in your season you be called to heaven whateer you may have suffered you have done no evil death must be the punishment of crime or the reward of trampling down the thorns which god has strewed upon the path which leads to immortality beatrice ay death the punishment of crime i pray thee god let me not be bewildered while i judge if i must live day after day and keep these limbs the unworthy temple of thy spirit as a foul den from which what thou abhorrest may mock thee unavengedit shall not be selfmurderno that might be no escape for thy decree yawns like a hell between our will and it o in this mortal world there is no vindication and no law which can adjudge and execute the doom of that through which i suffer enter orsino she approaches him solemnly welcome friend i have to tell you that since last we met i have endured a wrong so great and strange that neither life nor death can give me rest ask me not what it is for there are deeds which have no form sufferings which have no tongue note nor edition or editions st orsino and what is he who has thus injured you beatrice the man they call my father a dread name orsino it cannot be beatrice what it can be or not forbear to think it is and it has been advise me how it shall not be again i thought to die but a religious awe restrains me and the dread lest death itself might be no refuge from the consciousness of what is yet unexpiated oh speak orsino accuse him of the deed and let the law avenge thee beatrice oh icehearted counsellor if i could find a word that might make known the crime of my destroyer and that done my tongue should like a knife tear out the secret which cankers my hearts core ay lay all bare so that my unpolluted fame should be with vilest gossips a stale mouthed story a mock a byword an astonishment if this were done which never shall be done think of the offenders gold his dreaded hate and the strange horror of the accusers tale baffling belief and overpowering speech scarce whispered unimaginable wrapped in hideous hintsoh most assured redress orsino you will endure it then beatrice endure orsino it seems your counsel is small profit turns from him and speaks half to herself ay all must be suddenly resolved and done what is this undistinguishable mist of thoughts which rise like shadow after shadow darkening each other orsino should the offender live triumph in his misdeed and make by use his crime whateer it is dreadful no doubt thine element until thou mayest become utterly lost subdued even to the hue of that which thou permittest beatrice to herself mighty death thou doublevisaged shadow only judge rightfullest arbiter she retires absorbed in thought lucretia if the lightning of god has eer descended to avenge orsino blaspheme not his high providence commits its glory on this earth and their own wrongs into the hands of men if they neglect to punish crime lucretia but if one like this wretch should mock with gold opinion law and power if there be no appeal to that which makes the guiltiest tremble if because our wrongs for that they are unnatural strange and monstrous exceed all measure of belief o god if for the very reasons which should make redress most swift and sure our injurer triumphs and we the victims bear worse punishment than that appointed for their torturer orsino think not but that there is redress where there is wrong so we be bold enough to seize it lucretia how if there were any way to make all sure i know notbut i think it might be good to orsino why his late outrage to beatrice for it is such as i but faintly guess as makes remorse dishonour and leaves her only one duty how she may avenge you but one refuge from ills ill endured me but one counsel lucretia for we cannot hope that aid or retribution or resource will arise thence where every other one might find them with less need beatrice advances orsino then beatrice peace orsino and honoured lady while i speak i pray that you put off as garments overworn forbearance and respect remorse and fear and all the fit restraints of daily life which have been borne from childhood but which now would be a mockery to my holier plea as i have said i have endured a wrong which though it be expressionless is such as asks atonement both for what is past and lest i be reserved day after day to load with crimes an overburthened soul and bewhat ye can dream not i have prayed to god and i have talked with my own heart and have unravelled my entangled will and have at length determined what is right art thou my friend orsino false or true pledge thy salvation ere i speak orsino i swear to dedicate my cunning and my strength my silence and whatever else is mine to thy commands lucretia you think we should devise his death beatrice and execute what is devised and suddenly we must be brief and bold orsino and yet most cautious lucretia for the jealous laws would punish us with death and infamy for that which it became themselves to do beatrice be cautious as ye may but prompt orsino what are the means orsino i know two dull fierce outlaws who think mans spirit as a worms and they would trample out for any slight caprice the meanest or the noblest life this mood is marketable here in rome they sell what we now want lucretia tomorrow before dawn cenci will take us to that lonely rock petrella in the apulian apennines if he arrive there beatrice he must not arrive orsino will it be dark before you reach the tower lucretia the sun will scarce be set beatrice but i remember two miles on this side of the fort the road crosses a deep ravine tis rough and narrow and winds with short turns down the precipice and in its depth there is a mighty rock which has from unimaginable years sustained itself with terror and with toil over a gulf and with the agony with which it clings seems slowly coming down even as a wretched soul hour after hour clings to the mass of life yet clinging leans and leaning makes more dark the dread abyss in which it fears to fall beneath this crag huge as despair as if in weariness the melancholy mountain yawnsbelow you hear but see not an impetuous torrent raging among the caverns and a bridge crosses the chasm and high above there grow with intersecting trunks from crag to crag cedars and yews and pines whose tangled hair is matted in one solid roof of shade by the dark ivys twine at noonday here tis twilight and at sunset blackest night orsino before you reach that bridge make some excuse for spurring on your mules or loitering until beatrice what sound is that lucretia hark no it cannot be a servants step it must be cenci unexpectedly returnedmake some excuse for being here beatrice to orsino as she goes out that step we hear approach must never pass the bridge of which we spoke exeunt lucretia and beatrice orsino what shall i do cenci must find me here and i must bear the imperious inquisition of his looks as to what brought me hither let me mask mine own in some inane and vacant smile enter giacomo in a hurried manner how have you ventured hither know you then that cenci is from home note hither edition thither edition giacomo i sought him here and now must wait till he returns orsino great god weigh you the danger of this rashness giacomo ay does my destroyer know his danger we are now no more as once parent and child but man to man the oppressor to the oppressed the slanderer to the slandered foe to foe he has cast nature off which was his shield and nature casts him off who is her shame and i spurn both is it a fathers throat which i will shake and say i ask not gold i ask not happy years nor memories of tranquil childhood nor homesheltered love though all these hast thou torn from me and more but only my fair fame only one hoard of peace which i thought hidden from thy hate under the penury heaped on me by thee or i willgod can understand and pardon why should i speak with man orsino be calm dear friend giacomo well i will calmly tell you what he did this old francesco cenci as you know borrowed the dowry of my wife from me and then denied the loan and left me so in poverty the which i sought to mend by holding a poor office in the state it had been promised to me and already i bought new clothing for my ragged babes and my wife smiled and my heart knew repose when cencis intercession as i found conferred this office on a wretch whom thus he paid for vilest service i returned with this ill news and we sate sad together solacing our despondency with tears of such affection and unbroken faith as temper lifes worst bitterness when he as he is wont came to upbraid and curse mocking our poverty and telling us such was gods scourge for disobedient sons and then that i might strike him dumb with shame i spoke of my wifes dowry but he coined a brief yet specious tale how i had wasted the sum in secret riot and he saw my wife was touched and he went smiling forth and when i knew the impression he had made and felt my wife insult with silent scorn my ardent truth and look averse and cold i went forth too but soon returned again yet not so soon but that my wife had taught my children her harsh thoughts and they all cried give us clothes father give us better food what you in one night squander were enough for months i looked and saw that home was hell and to that hell will i return no more until mine enemy has rendered up atonement or as he gave life to me i will reversing natures law orsino trust me the compensation which thou seekest here will be denied giacomo thenare you not my friend did you not hint at the alternative upon the brink of which you see i stand the other day when we conversed together my wrongs were then less that word parricide although i am resolved haunts me like fear orsino it must be fear itself for the bare word is hollow mockery mark how wisest god draws to one point the threads of a just doom so sanctifying it what you devise is as it were accomplished giacomo is he dead orsino his grave is ready know that since we met cenci has done an outrage to his daughter giacomo what outrage orsino that she speaks not but you may conceive such half conjectures as i do from her fixed paleness and the lofty grief of her stern brow bent on the idle air and her severe unmodulated voice drowning both tenderness and dread and last from this that whilst her stepmother and i bewildered in our horror talked together with obscure hints both selfmisunderstood and darkly guessing stumbling in our talk over the truth and yet to its revenge she interrupted us and with a look which told before she spoke it he must die giacomo it is enough my doubts are well appeased there is a higher reason for the act than mine there is a holier judge than me a more unblamed avenger beatrice who in the gentleness of thy sweet youth hast never trodden on a worm or bruised a living flower but thou hast pitied it with needless tears fair sister thou in whom men wondered how such loveliness and wisdom did not destroy each other is there made ravage of thee o heart i ask no more justification shall i wait orsino till he return and stab him at the door orsino not so some accident might interpose to rescue him from what is now most sure and you are unprovided where to fly how to excuse or to conceal nay listen all is contrived success is so assured that enter beatrice beatrice tis my brothers voice you know me not giacomo my sister my lost sister beatrice lost indeed i see orsino has talked with you and that you conjecture things too horrible to speak yet far less than the truth now stay not he might return yet kiss me i shall know that then thou hast consented to his death farewell farewell let piety to god brotherly love justice and clemency and all things that make tender hardest hearts make thine hard brother answer notfarewell exeunt severally scene a mean apartment in giacomos house giacomo alone giacomo tis midnight and orsino comes not yet thunder and the sound of a storm what can the everlasting elements feel with a worm like man if so the shaft of mercywinged lightning would not fall on stones and trees my wife and children sleep they are now living in unmeaning dreams but i must wake still doubting if that deed be just which is most necessary o thou unreplenished lamp whose narrow fire is shaken by the wind and on whose edge devouring darkness hovers thou small flame which as a dying pulse rises and falls still flickerest up and down how very soon did i not feed thee wouldst thou fail and be as thou hadst never been so wastes and sinks even now perhaps the life that kindled mine but that no power can fill with vital oil that broken lamp of flesh ha tis the blood which fed these veins that ebbs till all is cold it is the form that moulded mine that sinks into the white and yellow spasms of death it is the soul by which mine was arrayed in gods immortal likeness which now stands naked before heavens judgement seat a bell strikes one two the hours crawl on and when my hairs are white my son will then perhaps be waiting thus tortured between just hate and vain remorse chiding the tardy messenger of news like those which i expect i almost wish he be not dead although my wrongs are great yettis orsinos step enter orsino speak orsino i am come to say he has escaped giacomo escaped orsino and safe within petrella he passed by the spot appointed for the deed an hour too soon giacomo are we the fools of such contingencies and do we waste in blind misgivings thus the hours when we should act then wind and thunder which seemed to howl his knell is the loud laughter with which heaven mocks our weakness i henceforth will neer repent of aught designed or done but my repentance orsino see the lamp is out giacomo if no remorse is ours when the dim air has drank this innocent flame why should we quail when cencis life that light by which ill spirits see the worst deeds they prompt shall sink for ever no i am hardened orsino why what need of this who feared the pale intrusion of remorse in a just deed although our first plan failed doubt not but he will soon be laid to rest but light the lamp let us not talk i the dark giacomo lighting the lamp and yet once quenched i cannot thus relume my fathers life do you not think his ghost might plead that argument with god orsino once gone you cannot now recall your sisters peace your own extinguished years of youth and hope nor your wifes bitter words nor all the taunts which from the prosperous weak misfortune takes nor your dead mother nor giacomo o speak no more i am resolved although this very hand must quench the life that animated it orsino there is no need of that listen you know olimpio the castellan of petrella in old colonnas time him whom your father degraded from his post and marzio that desperate wretch whom he deprived last year of a reward of blood well earned and due giacomo i knew olimpio and they say he hated old cenci so that in his silent rage his lips grew white only to see him pass of marzio i know nothing orsino marzios hate matches olimpios i have sent these men but in your name and as at your request to talk with beatrice and lucretia giacomo only to talk orsino the moments which even now pass onward to tomorrows midnight hour may memorize their flight with death ere then they must have talked and may perhaps have done and made an end giacomo listen what sound is that orsino the housedog moans and the beams crack nought else giacomo it is my wife complaining in her sleep i doubt not she is saying bitter things of me and all my children round her dreaming that i deny them sustenance orsino whilst he who truly took it from them and who fills their hungry rest with bitterness now sleeps lapped in bad pleasures and triumphantly mocks thee in visions of successful hate too like the truth of day giacomo if eer he wakes again i will not trust to hireling hands orsino why that were well i must be gone goodnight when next we meet may all be done note may all be done giacomo and all edition giacomo may all be done and all edition giacomo and all forgotten oh that i had never been exeunt end of act act scene an apartment in the castle of petrella enter cenci cenci she

might i not drag her by the golden hair stamp on her keep her sleepless till her brain be overworn tame her with chains and famine less would suffice yet so to leave undone what i most seek no tis her stubborn will which by its own consent shall stoop as low as that which drags it down enter lucretia thou loathed wretch hide thee from my abhorrence fly begone yet stay bid beatrice come hither note not now edition now not edition lucretia oh husband i pray for thine own wretched sake heed what thou dost a man who walks like thee through crimes and through the danger of his crimes each hour may stumble oer a sudden grave and thou art old thy hairs are hoary gray as thou wouldst save thyself from death and hell pity thy daughter give her to some friend in marriage so that she may tempt thee not to hatred or worse thoughts if worse there be cenci what like her sister who has found a home to mock my hate from with prosperity strange ruin shall destroy both her and thee and all that yet remain my death may be rapid her destiny outspeeds it go bid her come hither and before my mood be changed lest i should drag her by the hair lucretia she sent me to thee husband at thy presence she fell as thou dost know into a trance and in that trance she heard a voice which said cenci must die let him confess himself even now the accusing angel waits to hear if god to punish his enormous crimes harden his dying heart cenci why such things are no doubt divine revealings may be made tis plain i have been favoured from above for when i cursed my sons they died ayso as to the right or wrong thats talkrepentance repentance is an easy moments work and more depends on god than me wellwell i must give up the greater point which was to poison and corrupt her soul a pause lucretia approaches anxiously and then shrinks back as he speaks one two ayrocco and cristofano my curse strangled and giacomo i think will find life a worse hell than that beyond the grave beatrice shall if there be skill in hate die in despair blaspheming to bernardo he is so innocent i will bequeath the memory of these deeds and make his youth the sepulchre of hope where evil thoughts shall grow like weeds on a neglected tomb when all is done out in the wide campagna i will pile up my silver and my gold my costly robes paintings and tapestries my parchments and all records of my wealth and make a bonfire in my joy and leave of my possessions nothing but my name which shall be an inheritance to strip its wearer bare as infamy that done my soul which is a scourge will i resign into the hands of him who wielded it be it for its own punishment or theirs he will not ask it of me till the lash be broken in its last and deepest wound until its hate be all inflicted yet lest death outspeed my purpose let me make short work and sure going lucretia stops him oh stay it was a feint she had no vision and she heard no voice i said it but to awe thee cenci that is well vile palterer with the sacred truth of god be thy soul choked with that blaspheming lie for beatrice worse terrors are in store to bend her to my will lucretia oh to what will what cruel sufferings more than she has known

and my deep imprecation may it be a hideous likeness of herself that as from a distorting mirror she may see her image mixed with what she most abhors smiling upon her from her nursing breast and that the child may from its infancy grow day by day more wicked and deformed turning her mothers love to misery and that both she and it may live until it shall repay her care and pain with hate or what may else be more unnatural so he may hunt her through the clamorous scoffs of the loud world to a dishonoured grave shall i revoke this curse go bid her come before my words are chronicled in heaven exit lucretia i do not feel as if i were a man but like a fiend appointed to chastise the offences of some unremembered world my blood is running up and down my veins a fearful pleasure makes it prick

kill her soul cenci she would not come tis well i can do both first take what i demand and then extort concession to thy chamber fly ere i spurn thee and beware this night that thou cross not my footsteps it were safer to come between the tiger and his prey exit lucretia it must be late mine eyes grow weary dim with unaccustomed heaviness of sleep conscience oh thou most insolent of lies they say that sleep that healing dew of heaven steeps not in balm the foldings of the brain which thinks thee an impostor i will go first to belie thee with an hour of rest which will be deep and calm i feel and then o multitudinous hell the fiends will shake thine arches with the laughter of their joy there shall be lamentation heard in heaven as oer an angel fallen and upon earth all good shall

the fact o horrible tis all discovered beatrice mother what is done wisely is done well be bold as thou art just tis like a truant child to fear that others know what thou hast done even from thine own strong consciousness and thus write on unsteady eyes and altered cheeks all thou wouldst hide be faithful to thyself and fear no other witness but thy fear for if as cannot be some circumstance should rise in accusation we can blind suspicion with such cheap astonishment or overbear it with such guiltless pride as murderers cannot feign the deed is done and what may follow now regards not me

an interest in his death bernardo alas i can name none who had not and those most who most lament that such a deed is done my mother and my sister and myself savella tis strange there were clear marks of violence i found the old mans body in the moonlight hanging beneath the window of his chamber among the branches of a pine he could not have fallen there for all his limbs lay heaped and effortless

words are bold and rash savella i do arrest all present in the name of the popes holiness you must to rome lucretia o not to rome indeed we are not guilty beatrice guilty who dares talk of guilt my lord i am more innocent of parricide than is a child born fatherlessdear mother your gentleness and patience are no shield for this keenjudging world this twoedged lie which seems but is not what will human laws rather will ye who are their ministers bar all access to retribution first and then when heaven doth interpose to do what ye neglect arming familiar things to the redress of an unwonted crime make ye the victims who demanded it culprits tis ye are culprits that poor wretch who stands so pale and trembling and amazed if it be true he murdered cenci was a sword in the right hand of justest god wherefore should i have wielded it unless the crimes which mortal tongue dare never name god therefore scruples to avenge savella you own that you desired his death beatrice it would have been a crime no less than his if for one moment that fierce desire had faded in my heart tis true i did believe and hope and pray ay i even knewfor god is wise and just that some strange sudden death hung over him tis true that this did happen and most true there was no other rest for me on earth no other hope in heavennow what of this savella strange thoughts beget strange deeds and here are both i judge thee not beatrice and yet if you arrest me you are the judge and executioner of that which is the life of life the breath of accusation kills an innocent name and leaves for lame acquittal the poor life which is a mask without it tis most false that i am guilty of foul parricide although i must rejoice for justest cause that other hands have sent my fathers soul to ask the mercy he denied to me now leave us free stain not a noble house with vague surmises of rejected crime add to our sufferings and your own neglect no heavier sum let them have been enough leave us the wreck we have

lean on me collect your wandering thoughts my lord as soon as you have taken some refreshment and had all such examinations made upon the spot as may be necessary to the full understanding of this matter we shall be ready mother will you come lucretia ha they will bind us to the rack and wrest selfaccusation from our agony will giacomo be there orsino marzio all present all confronted all demanding each from the others countenance the thing which is in every heart o misery she faints and is borne out savella she faints an ill appearance this beatrice my lord she knows not yet the uses of the world she fears that power is as a beast which grasps and loosens not a snake whose look transmutes all things to guilt which is its nutriment she cannot know how well the supine slaves of blind authority read the truth of things when written on a brow of guilelessness she sees not yet triumphant innocence stand at the judgementseat of mortal man a judge and an accuser of the wrong

thus quickly come to end o that the vain remorse which must chastise crimes done had but as loud a voice to warn as its keen sting is mortal to avenge o that the hour when present had cast off the mantle of its mystery and shown the ghastly form with which it now returns when its scared game is roused cheering the hounds of conscience to their prey alas alas it was a wicked thought a piteous deed to kill an old and hoaryheaded father orsino it has turned out unluckily in truth giacomo to violate the sacred doors of sleep to cheat kind nature of the placid death which she prepares for overwearied age to drag from heaven an unrepentant soul which might have quenched in reconciling prayers a life of burning crimes orsino you cannot say i urged you to the deed giacomo o had i never found in thy smooth and ready countenance the mirror of my darkest thoughts hadst thou never with hints and questions made me look upon the monster of my thought until it grew familiar to desire orsino tis thus men cast the blame of their unprosperous acts upon the abettors of their own resolve or anything but their weak guilty selves and yet confess the truth it is the peril in which you stand that gives you this pale sickness of penitence confess tis fear disguised from its own shame that takes the mantle now of thin remorse what if we yet were safe giacomo how can that be already beatrice lucretia and the murderer are in prison i doubt not officers are whilst we speak sent to arrest us orsino i have all prepared for instant flight we can escape even now so we take fleet

ministered upon by fiends avenging such a nameless wrong as turns black parricide to piety whilst we for basest endsi fear orsino while i consider all your words and looks comparing them with your proposal now that you must be a villain for what end could you engage in such a perilous crime training me on with hints and signs and smiles even to this gulf thou art no liar no thou art a lie traitor and murderer coward and slave but no defend thyself drawing let the sword speak what the indignant tongue disdains to brand thee with orsino put up your weapon is it the desperation of your fear makes you thus rash and sudden with a friend now ruined for your sake if honest anger have moved you know that what i just proposed was but to try you as for me i think thankless affection led me to this point from which if my firm temper could repent i cannot now recede even whilst we speak the ministers of justice wait below they grant me these brief moments now if you have any word of melancholy comfort to speak to your pale wife twere best to pass out at the postern and avoid them so note a friend edition your friend edition giacomo o generous friend how canst thou pardon me would that my life could purchase thine orsino that wish now comes a day too late haste fare thee well hearst thou not steps along the corridor exit giacomo im sorry for it but the guards are waiting at his own gate and such was my contrivance that i might rid me both of him and them i thought to act a solemn comedy upon the painted scene of this new world and to attain my own peculiar ends by some such plot of mingled good and ill as others weave but there arose a power which grasped and snapped the threads of my device and turned it to a net of ruinha a shout is heard is that my name i hear proclaimed abroad but i will pass wrapped in a vile disguise rags on my back and a false innocence upon my face through the misdeeming crowd which judges by what seems tis easy then for a new name and for a country new and a new life fashioned on old desires to change the honours of abandoned rome and these must be the masks of that within which must remain unalteredoh i fear that what is past will never let me rest why when none else is conscious but myself of my misdeeds should my own hearts contempt trouble me have i not the power to fly my own reproaches shall i be the slave ofwhat a word

is dragged from sufferings which might shake the sternest heart and bade to answer not as he believes but as those may suspect or do desire whose questions thence suggest their own reply and that in peril of such hideous torments as merciful god spares even the damned speak now the thing you surely know which is that you if your fine frame were stretched upon that wheel and you were told confess that you did poison your little nephew that fair blueeyed child who was the lodestar of your life and though all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief yet you would say i confess anything and beg from your tormentors like that slave the refuge of dishonourable death i pray thee cardinal that thou assert my innocence camillo much moved what shall we think my lords shame on these tears i thought the heart was frozen which is their fountain i would pledge my soul that she is guiltless judge yet she must be tortured camillo i would as soon have tortured mine own nephew if he now lived he would be just her age his hair too was her colour and

living men to kill the innocent marzio i am marzio thy fathers vassal beatrice fix thine eyes on mine answer to what i ask turning to the judges i prithee mark his countenance unlike bold calumny which sometimes dares not speak the thing it looks he dares not look the thing he speaks but bends his gaze on the blind earth to marzio what wilt thou say that i did murder my own father marzio oh spare me my brain swims roundi cannot speak it was that horrid torture forced the truth take me away let her not look on me i am a guilty miserable wretch i have said all i know now let me die

twoedged instrument of my misdeed this man this bloody knife with my own name engraven on the heft lying unsheathed amid a world of foes for my own death that with such horrible need for deepest silence i should have neglected so trivial a precaution as the making his tomb the keeper of a secret written on a thiefs memory what is his poor life what are a thousand lives a parricide had trampled them like dust and see he lives turning to marzio and thou marzio oh spare me speak to me no more that stern yet piteous look those solemn tones wound worse than torture to the judges i have told it all for pitys sake lead me away to death camillo guards lead him nearer the lady beatrice he shrinks from her regard like autumns leaf from the keen breath of the serenest north beatrice o thou who tremblest on the giddy verge of life and death pause ere thou answerest me so mayst thou answer god with less dismay what evil have we done thee i alas have lived but on this earth a few sad years and so my lot was ordered that a father first turned the moments of awakening life to drops each poisoning youths sweet hope and then stabbed with one blow my everlasting soul and my untainted fame and even that peace which sleeps within the core of the hearts heart but the wound was not mortal so my hate became the only worship i could lift to our great father who in pity and love armed thee as thou dost say to cut him off and thus his wrong becomes my accusation and art thou the accuser if thou hopest mercy in heaven show justice upon earth worse than a bloody hand is a hard heart if thou hast done murders made thy lifes path over the trampled laws of god and man rush not before thy judge and say my maker i have done this and more for there was one who was most pure and innocent on earth and because she endured what never any guilty or innocent endured before because her wrongs could not be told not thought because thy hand at length did rescue her i with my words killed her and all her kin think i adjure you what it is to slay the reverence living in the minds of men towards our ancient house and stainless fame think what it is to strangle infant pity cradled in the belief of guileless looks till it become a crime to suffer think what tis to blot with infamy and blood all that which shows like innocence and is hear me great god i swear most innocent so

knot ay that does well and yours i see is coming down how often have we done this for one another now we shall not do it any more my lord we are quite ready well tis very well the end note on the cenci by mrs shelley the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lot or than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twentysix at which he wrote the cenci on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and followingup a story or plot he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation the subject he had suggested for a tragedy was charles i and he had written to me remember remember charles i i have been already imagining how you would conduct some scenes the second volume of st leon begins with this proud and true sentiment there is nothing which the human mind can conceive which it may not execute shakespeare was only a human being these words were written in while we were in lombardy when he little thought how soon a work of his own would prove a proud comment on the passage he quoted when in rome in a friend put into our hands the old manuscript account of the story of the cenci we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story shelleys imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depths his richly gifted mind we suffered a severe affliction in rome by the loss of our eldest child who was of such beauty and promise as to cause him deservedly to be the idol of our hearts we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of that fair blueeyed child who was the lodestar of your life and say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about halfway between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the waterwheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became waterspouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio shelley wished the cenci to be acted he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad fillingup of the inferior parts while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss oneil several times she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cencis worst crime every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in words the nearest allusion to it being that portion of cencis curse beginning that if she have a child etc i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on this that as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss oneil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play it it would tear my nerves to pieces and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor the play was accordingly sent to mr harris he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss oneil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl the fifth act is a masterpiece it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heartreaching eloquence every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul the mask of anarchy written on the occasion of the massacre at

and more authoritative as i lay asleep in italy there came a voice from over the sea and with great power it forth led me to walk in the visions of poesy i met murder on the way he had a mask like castlereagh very smooth he looked yet grim seven bloodhounds followed him all were fat and well they might be in admirable plight for one by one and two by two he tossed them human hearts to chew which from his wide cloak he drew next came fraud and he had on like eldon an ermined gown his big tears for he wept well turned to millstones as they fell and the little children who round his feet played to and fro thinking every tear a gem had their brains knocked out by them clothed with the bible as with light and the shadows of the night like sidmouth next hypocrisy on a crocodile rode by and many more destructions played in this ghastly masquerade all disguised even to the eyes like bishops lawyers peers or spies last came anarchy he rode on a white horse splashed with blood he was pale even to the lips like death in the apocalypse and he wore a kingly crown and in his grasp a sceptre shone on his brow this mark i saw i am god and king and law with a pace stately and fast over english land he passed trampling to a mire of blood the adoring multitude and a mighty troop around with their trampling shook the ground waving each a bloody sword for the service of their lord and with glorious triumph they rode through england proud and gay drunk as with intoxication of the wine of desolation oer fields and towns from sea to sea passed the pageant swift and free tearing up and trampling down till they came to london town and each dweller panicstricken felt his heart with terror sicken hearing the tempestuous cry of the triumph of anarchy for with pomp to meet him came clothed in arms like blood and flame the hired murderers who did sing thou art god and law and king we have waited weak and lone for thy coming mighty one our purses are empty our swords are cold give us glory and blood and gold lawyers and priests a motley crowd to the earth their pale brows bowed like a bad prayer not over loud whispering thou art law and god then all cried with one accord thou art king and god and lord anarchy to thee we bow be thy name made holy now and anarchy the skeleton bowed and grinned to every one as well as if his education had cost ten millions to the nation for he knew the palaces of our kings were rightly his his the sceptre crown and globe and the goldinwoven robe so he sent his slaves before to seize upon the bank and tower and was proceeding with intent to meet his pensioned parliament when one fled past a maniac maid and her name was hope she said but she looked more like despair and she cried out in the air my father time is weak and gray with waiting for a better day see how idiotlike he stands fumbling with his palsied hands he has had child after child and the dust of death is piled over every one but me misery oh misery then she lay down in the street right before the horses feet expecting with a patient eye murder fraud and anarchy when between her and her foes a mist a light an image rose small at first and weak and frail like the vapour of a vale till as clouds grow on the blast like towercrowned giants striding fast and glare with lightnings as they fly and speak in thunder to the sky it grew a shape arrayed in mail brighter than the vipers scale and upborne on wings whose grain was as the light of sunny rain on its helm seen far away a planet like the mornings lay and those plumes its light rained through like a shower of crimson dew with step as soft as wind it passed oer the heads of men so fast that they knew the presence there and looked but all was empty air as flowers beneath mays footstep waken as stars from nights loose hair are shaken as waves arise when loud winds call thoughts sprung whereer that step did fall and the prostrate multitude looked and ankledeep in blood hope that maiden most serene was walking with a quiet mien and anarchy the ghastly birth lay dead earth upon the earth the horse of death tameless as wind fled and with his hoofs did grind to dust the murderers thronged behind a rushing light of clouds and splendour a sense awakening and yet tender was heard and felt and at its close these words of joy and fear arose as if their own indignant earth which gave the sons of england birth had felt their blood upon her brow and shuddering with a mothers throe had turned every drop of blood by which her face had been bedewed to an accent unwithstood as if her heart had cried aloud men of england heirs of glory heroes of unwritten story nurslings of one mighty mother hopes of her and one another rise like lions after slumber in unvanquishable number shake your chains to earth like dew which in sleep had fallen on you ye are many they are few what is freedom ye can tell that which slavery is too well for its very name has grown to an echo of your own tis to work and have such pay as just keeps life from day to day in your limbs as in a cell for the tyrants use to dwell so that ye for them are made loom and plough and sword and spade with or without your own will bent to their defence and nourishment tis to see your children weak with their mothers pine and peak when the winter winds are bleak they are dying whilst i speak tis to hunger for such diet as the rich man in his riot casts to the fat dogs that lie surfeiting beneath his eye tis to let the ghost of gold take from toil a thousandfold more than eer its substance could in the tyrannies of old paper coin that forgery of the titledeeds which ye hold to something of the worth of the inheritance of earth tis to be a slave in soul and to hold no strong control over your own wills but be all that others make of ye and at length when ye complain with a murmur weak and vain tis to see the tyrants crew ride over your wives and you blood is on the grass like dew then it is to feel revenge fiercely thirsting to exchange blood for blood and wrong for wrong do not thus when ye are strong birds find rest in narrow nest when weary of their winged quest beasts find fare in woody lair when storm and snow are in the air asses swine have litter spread and with fitting food are fed all things have a home but one thou oh englishman hast none this is slavery savage men or wild beasts within a den would endure not as ye do but such ills they never knew what art thou freedom o could slaves answer from their living graves this demand tyrants would flee like a dreams dim imagery thou art not as impostors say a shadow soon to pass away a superstition and a name echoing from the cave of fame for the labourer thou art bread and a comely table spread from his daily labour come in a neat and happy home thou art clothes and fire and food for the trampled multitude no in countries that are free such starvation cannot be as in england now we see to the rich thou art a check when his foot is on the neck of his victim thou dost make that he treads upon a snake thou art justice neer for gold may thy righteous laws be sold as laws are in england thou shieldst alike the high and low thou art wisdom freemen never dream that god will damn for ever all who think those things untrue of which priests make such ado thou art peace never by thee would blood and treasure wasted be as tyrants wasted them when all leagued to quench thy flame in gaul what if english toil and blood was poured forth even as a flood it availed oh liberty to dim but not extinguish thee thou art love the rich have kissed thy feet and like him following christ give their substance to the free and through the rough world follow thee or turn their wealth to arms and make war for thy beloved sake on wealth and war and fraud whence they drew the power which is their prey science poetry and thought are thy lamps they make the lot of the dwellers in a cot so serene they curse it not spirit patience gentleness all that can adorn and bless art thou let deeds not words express thine exceeding loveliness let a great assembly be of the fearless and the free on some spot of english ground where the plains stretch wide around let the blue sky overhead the green earth on which ye tread all that must eternal be witness the solemnity from the corners uttermost of the bounds of english coast from every hut village and town where those who live and suffer moan for others misery or their own from the workhouse and the prison where pale as corpses newly risen women children young and old groan for pain and weep for cold from the haunts of daily life where is waged the daily strife with common wants and common cares which sows the human heart with tares lastly from the palaces where the murmur of distress echoes like the distant sound of a wind alive around those prison halls of wealth and fashion where some few feel such compassion for those who groan and toil and wail as must make their brethren pale ye who suffer woes untold or to feel or to behold your lost country bought and sold with a price of blood and gold let a vast assembly be and with great solemnity declare with measured words that ye are as god has made ye free be your strong and simple words keen to wound as sharpened swords and wide as targes let them be with their shade to cover ye let the tyrants pour around with a quick and startling sound like the loosening of a sea troops of armed emblazonry let the charged artillery drive till the dead air seems alive with the clash of clanging wheels and the tramp of horses heels let the fixed bayonet gleam with sharp desire to wet its bright point in english blood looking keen as one for food let the horsemens scimitars wheel and flash like sphereless stars thirsting to eclipse their burning in a sea of death and mourning stand ye calm and resolute like a forest close and mute with folded arms and looks which are weapons of unvanquished war and let panic who outspeeds the career of armed steeds pass a disregarded shade through your phalanx undismayed let the laws of your own land good or ill between ye stand hand to hand and foot to foot arbiters of the dispute the old laws of england they whose reverend heads with age are gray children of a wiser day and whose solemn voice must be thine own echo liberty on those who first should violate such sacred heralds in their state rest the blood that must ensue and it will not rest on you and if then the tyrants dare let them ride among you there slash and stab and maim and hew what they like that let them do with folded arms and steady eyes and little fear and less surprise look upon them as they slay till their rage has died away then they will return with shame to the place from which they came and the blood thus shed will speak in hot blushes on their cheek every woman in the land will point at them as they stand they will hardly dare to greet their acquaintance in the street and the bold true warriors who have hugged danger in wars will turn to those who would be free ashamed of such base company and that slaughter to the nation shall steam up like inspiration eloquent oracular a volcano heard afar and these words shall then become like oppressions thundered doom ringing through each heart and brain heard again again again rise like lions after slumber in unvanquishable number

stay edition in wars wise manuscript hunt manuscript edition in the wars editions note on the mask of anarchy by mrs shelley though shelleys first eager desire to excite his countrymen to resist openly the oppressions existent during the good old times had faded with early youth still his warmest sympathies were for the people he was a republican and loved a democracy he looked on all human beings as inheriting an equal right to possess the dearest privileges of our nature the necessaries of life when fairly earned by labour and intellectual instruction his hatred of any despotism that looked upon the people as not to be consulted or protected from want and ignorance was intense he was residing near leghorn at villa valsovano writing the cenci when the news of the manchester massacre reached us it roused in him violent emotions of indignation and compassion the great truth that the many if accordant and resolute could control the few as was shown some years after made him long to teach his injured countrymen how to resist inspired by these feelings he wrote the mask of anarchy which he sent to his friend leigh hunt to be inserted in the examiner of which he was then the editor i did not insert it leigh hunt writes in his valuable and interesting preface to this poem when he printed it in because i thought that the public at large had not become sufficiently discerning to do justice to the sincerity and kindheartedness of the spirit that walked in this flaming robe of verse days of outrage have passed away and with them the exasperation that would cause such an appeal to the many to be injurious without being aware of them they at one time acted on his suggestions and gained the day but they rose when human life was respected by the minister in power such was not the case during the administration which excited shelleys abhorrence the poem was written for the people and is therefore in a more popular tone than usual portions strike as abrupt and unpolished but many stanzas are all his own i heard him repeat and admired those beginning my father time is old and gray before i knew to what poem they were to belong but the most touching passage is that which describes the blessed effects of liberty it might make a patriot of any man whose heart was not wholly closed against his humbler fellowcreatures peter bell the third by miching mallecho esq is it a party in a parlour crammed just as they on earth were crammed some sipping punch some sipping tea but as you by their faces see all silent and all damned peter bell by w wordsworth ophelia what means this my lord hamlet marry this is miching mallecho it means mischief shakespeare composed at florence october and forwarded to hunt november to be published by c j ollier without the authors name ultimately printed by mrs shelley in the second edition of the poetical works a skit by john hamilton reynolds peter bell a lyrical ballad had already appeared april a few days before the publication of wordsworths peter bell a tale these productions were reviewed in leigh hunts examiner april may and to the entertainment derived from his perusal of hunts criticisms the composition of shelleys peter bell the third is chiefly owing dedication to thomas brown esq the younger hf dear tom allow me to request you to introduce mr peter bell to the respectable family of the fudges although he may fall short of those very considerable personages in the more active properties which characterize the rat and the apostate i suspect that even you their historian will confess that he surpasses them in the more peculiarly legitimate qualification of intolerable dulness you know mr examiner hunt well it was he who presented me to two of the mr bells my intimacy with the younger mr bell naturally sprung from this introduction to his brothers and in presenting him to you i have the satisfaction of being able to assure you that he is considerably the dullest of the three there is this particular advantage in an acquaintance with any one of the peter bells that if you know one peter bell you know three peter bells they are not one but three not three but one an awful mystery which after having caused torrents of blood and having been hymned by groans enough to deafen the music of the spheres is at length illustrated to the satisfaction of all parties in the theological world by the nature of mr peter bell peter is a polyhedric peter or a peter with many sides he changes colours like a chameleon and his coat like a snake he is a proteus of a peter he was at first sublime pathetic impressive profound then dull then prosy and dull and now dull oh so very dull it is an ultralegitimate dulness you will perceive that it is not necessary to consider hell and the devil as supernatural machinery the whole scene of my epic is in this world which is so peter informed us before his conversion to white obi the world of all of us and where we find our happiness or not at all let me observe that i have spent six or seven days in composing this sublime piece the orb of my moonlike genius has made the fourth part of its revolution round the dull earth which you inhabit driving you mad while it has retained its calmness and its splendour and i have been fitting this its last phase to occupy a permanent station in the literature of my country your works indeed dear tom sell better but mine are far superior the public is no judge posterity sets all to rights allow me to observe that so much has been written of peter bell that the present history can be considered only like the iliad as a continuation of that series of cyclic poems which have already been candidates for bestowing immortality upon at the same time that they receive it from his character and adventures in this point of view i have violated no rule of syntax in beginning my composition with a conjunction the full stop which closes the poem continued by me being like the full stops at the end of the iliad and odyssey a full stop of a very qualified import hoping that the immortality which you have given to the fudges you will receive from them and in the firm expectation that when london shall be an habitation of bitterns when st pauls and westminster abbey shall stand shapeless and nameless ruins in the midst of an unpeopled marsh when the piers of waterloo bridge shall become the nuclei of islets of reeds and osiers and cast the jagged shadows of their broken arches on the solitary stream some transatlantic commentator will be weighing in the scales of some new and now unimagined system of criticism the respective merits of the bells and the fudges and their historians i remain dear tom yours sincerely miching mallecho december ps pray excuse the date of place so soon as the profits of the publication come in i mean to hire lodgings in a more respectable street prologue peter bells one two and three oer the wide world wandering be first the antenatal peter wrapped in weeds of the same metre the solongpredestined raiment clothed in which to walk his way meant the second peter whose ambition is to link the proposition as the mean of two extremes this was learned from aldrics themes shielding from the guilt of schism the orthodoxal syllogism the first peter he who was like the shadow in the glass of the second yet unripe his substantial antitype then came peter bell the second who henceforward must be reckoned the body of a double soul and that portion of the whole without which the rest would seem ends of a disjointed dream and the third is he who has oer the grave been forced to pass to the other side which is go and try else just like this peter bell the first was peter smugger milder softer neater like the soul before it is born from that world into this the next peter bell was he predevote like you and me to good or evil as may come his was the severer doom for he was an evil cotter and a polygamic potter and the last is peter bell damned since our first parents fell damned eternally to hell surely he deserves it well notes aldrics ie aldrichs a spelling adopted here by woodberry the oldest scholiasts read a dodecagamic potter this is at once more descriptive and more megalophonous but the alliteration of the text had captivated the vulgar ear of the herd of later commentators shelleys note part death and peter bell when he had been with freshimported hellfire warmed grew serious from his dress and mien twas very plainly to be seen peter was quite reformed his eyes turned up his mouth turned down his accent caught a nasal twang he oiled his hair there might be heard the grace of god in every word which peter said or sang but peter now grew old and had an ill no doctor could unravel his torments almost drove him mad some said it was a fever bad some swore it was the gravel his holy friends then came about and with long preaching and persuasion convinced the patient that without the smallest shadow of a doubt he was predestined to damnation they said thy name is peter bell thy skin is of a brimstone hue alive or dead ay sick or well the one god made to rhyme with hell the other i think rhymes with you then peter set up such a yell the nurse who with some water gruel was climbing up the stairs as well as her old legs could climb them fell and broke them both the fall was cruel the parson from the casement lept into the lake of windermere and many an eel though no adept in gods right reason for it kept gnawing his kidneys half a year and all the rest rushed through the door and tumbled over one another and broke their skulls upon the floor meanwhile sat peter bell and swore and cursed his father and his mother and raved of god and sin and death blaspheming like an infidel and said that with his clenched teeth hed seize the earth from underneath and drag it with him down to hell as he was speaking came a spasm and wrenched his gnashing teeth asunder like one who sees a strange phantasm he lay there was a silent chasm between his upper jaw and under and yellow death lay on his face and a fixed smile that was not human told as i understand the case that he was gone to the wrong place i heard all this from the old woman then there came down from langdale pike a cloud with lightning wind and hail it swept over the mountains like an ocean and i heard it strike the woods and crags of grasmere vale and i saw the black storm come nearer minute after minute its thunder made the cataracts dumb with hiss and clash and hollow hum it neared as if the devil was in it the devil was in it he had bought peter for halfacrown and when the storm which bore him vanished nought that in the house that storm had caught was ever seen again the gaping neighbours came next day they found all vanished from the shore the bible whence he used to pray half scorched under a hencoop lay smashed glass and nothing more part the devil the devil i safely can aver has neither hoof nor tail nor sting nor is he as some sages swear a spirit neither here nor there in nothing yet in everything he is what we are for sometimes the devil is a gentleman at others a bard bartering rhymes for sack a statesman spinning crimes a swindler living as he can a thief who cometh in the night with whole boots and net pantaloons like some one whom it were not right to mention or the luckless wight from whom he steals nine silver spoons but in this case he did appear like a slopmerchant from wapping and with smug face and eye severe on every side did perk and peer till he saw peter dead or napping he had on an upper benjamin for he was of the driving schism in the which he wrapped his skin from the storm he travelled in for fear of rheumatism he called the ghost out of the corse it was exceedingly like peter only its voice was hollow and hoarse it had a queerish look of course its dress too was a little neater the devil knew not his name and lot peter knew not that he was bell each had an upper stream of thought which made all seem as it was not fitting itself to all things well peter thought he had parents dear brothers sisters cousins cronies in the fens of lincolnshire he perhaps had found them there had he gone and boldly shown his solemn phiz in his own village where he thought oft when a boy hed clomb the orchard walls to pillage the produce of his neighbours tillage with marvellous pride and joy and the devil thought he had mid the misery and confusion of an unjust war just made a fortune by the gainful trade of giving soldiers rations bad the world is full of strange delusion that he had a mansion planned in a square like grosvenor square that he was aping fashion and that he now came to westmoreland to see what was romantic there and all this though quite ideal ready at a breath to vanish was a state not more unreal than the peace he could not feel or the care he could not banish after a little conversation the devil told peter if he chose hed bring him to the world of fashion by giving him a situation in his own service and new clothes and peter bowed quite pleased and proud and after waiting some few days for a new livery dirty yellow turned up with black the wretched fellow was bowled to hell in the devils chaise part hell hell is a city much like london a populous and a smoky city there are all sorts of people undone and there is little or no fun done small justice shown and still less pity there is a castles and a canning a cobbett and a castlereagh all sorts of caitiff corpses planning all sorts of cozening for trepanning corpses less corrupt than they there is a who has lost his wits or sold them none knows which he walks about a double ghost and though as thin as fraud almost ever grows more grim and rich there is a chancery court a king a manufacturing mob a set of thieves who by themselves are sent similar thieves to represent an army and a public debt which last is a scheme of paper money and means being

a heaven in which faith they live and die thus as in a town plaguestricken each man be he sound or no must indifferently sicken as when day begins to thicken none knows a pigeon from a crow so good

grosvenor square a footman in the devils service and the misjudging world would swear that every man in service there to virtue would prefer vice but peter though now damned was not what peter was before damnation men oftentimes prepare a lot which ere it finds them is not what suits with their genuine station all things that peter saw and felt had a peculiar aspect to him and when they came within the belt of his own nature seemed to melt like cloud to cloud into him and so the outward world uniting to that within him he became considerably uninviting to those who meditation slighting were moulded in a different frame and he scorned them and they scorned him and he scorned all they did and they did all that men of their own trim are wont to do to please their whim drinking lying swearing play such were his fellowservants thus his virtue like our own was built too much on that indignant fuss hypocrite pride stirs up in us to bully one anothers guilt he had a mind which was somehow at once circumference and centre of all he might or feel or know nothing went ever out although something did ever enter he had as much imagination as a pintpot he never could fancy another situation from which to dart his contemplation than that wherein he stood yet his was individual mind and new created all he saw in a new manner and refined those new creations and combined them by a masterspirits law thus though unimaginative an apprehension clear intense of his minds work had made alive the things it wrought on i believe wakening a sort of thought in sense but from the first twas peters drift to be a kind of moral eunuch he touched the hem of natures shift felt faint and never dared uplift the closest allconcealing tunic she laughed the while with an arch smile and kissed

scottish peasant boy his errors prove it knew my joy more learned friend than you boeca bacciata non perde ventura anzi rinnuova come fa la luna so thought boccaccio whose sweet words might cure a male prude like you from what you now endure a lowtide in soul like a stagnant laguna then peter rubbed his eyes severe and smoothed his spacious forehead down with his broad palm twixt love and fear he looked as he no doubt felt queer and in his dream sate down the devil was no uncommon creature a leadenwitted thief just huddled out of the dross and scum of nature a toadlike lump of limb and feature with mind and heart and fancy muddled he was that heavy dull cold thing the spirit of evil well may be a drone too base to have a sting who gluts and grimes his lazy wing and calls lust luxury now he was quite the kind of wight round whom collect at a fixed aera venison turtle hock and claret good cheer and those who come to share it and best east indian madeira it was his fancy to invite men of science wit and learning who came to lend each other light he proudly thought that his golds might had set those spirits burning and men of learning science wit considered him as you and i think of some rotten tree and sit lounging and dining under it exposed to the wide sky and all the while with loose fat smile the willing wretch sat winking there believing twas his power that made that jovial scene and that all paid homage to his unnoticed chair though to be sure this place was hell he was the devil and all they what though the claret circled well and wit like ocean rose and fell were damned eternally part grace among the guests who often stayed till the devils petitssoupers a man there came fair as a maid and peter noted what he said standing behind his masters chair he was a mighty poet and a subtlesouled psychologist all things he seemed to understand of old or new of sea or land but his own mind which was a mist this was a man who might have turned hell into heaven and so in gladness a heaven unto himself have earned but he in shadows undiscerned trusted and damned himself to madness he spoke of poetry and how divine it was a light a love a spirit which like wind doth blow as it listeth to and fro a dew rained down from god above a power which comes and goes like dream and which none can ever trace heavens light on earth truths brightest beam and when he ceased there lay the gleam of those words upon his face now peter when he heard such talk would heedless of a broken pate stand like a man asleep or balk some wishing guest of knife or fork or drop and break his masters plate at night he oft would start and wake like a lover and began in a wild measure songs to make on moor and glen and rocky lake and on the heart of man and on the universal sky and the wide earths bosom green and the sweet strange mystery of what beyond these things may lie and yet remain unseen for in his thought he visited the spots in which ere dead and damned he his wayward life had led yet knew not whence the thoughts were fed which thus his fancy crammed and these obscure remembrances stirred such harmony in peter that whensoever he should please he could speak of rocks and trees in poetic metre for though it was without a sense of memory yet he remembered well many a ditch and quickset fence of lakes he had intelligence he knew something of heath and fell he had also dim recollections of pedlars tramping on their rounds milkpans and pails and odd collections of saws and proverbs and reflections old parsons make in buryinggrounds but peters verse was clear and came announcing from the frozen hearth of a cold age that none might tame the soul of that diviner flame it augured to the earth like gentle rains on the dry plains making that green which late was gray or like the sudden moon that stains some gloomy chambers windowpanes with a broad light like day for language was in peters hand like clay while he was yet a potter and he made songs for all the land sweet both to feel and understand as pipkins late to mountain cotter and mr the bookseller gave twenty pounds for some then scorning a footmans yellow coat to wear peter too proud of heart i fear instantly gave the devil warning whereat the devil took offence and swore in his soul a great oath then that for his damned impertinence hed bring him to a proper sense of what was due to gentlemen part damnation o that mine enemy had written a book cried job a fearful curse if to the arab as the briton twas galling to be criticbitten the devil to peter wished no worse when peters next new book found vent the devil to all the first reviews a copy of it slyly sent with fivepound note as compliment and this short notice pray abuse then seriatim month and quarter appeared such mad tirades one said peter seduced mrs foys daughter then drowned the mother in ullswater the last thing as he went to bed another let him shave his head wheres dr willis or is he joking

blackguard scoundrel fool hellfire is twenty times too good for you by that last book of yours we think youve double damned yourself to scorn we warned you whilst yet on the brink you stood from your black name will shrink the babe that is unborn all these reviews the devil made up in a parcel which he had safely to peters house conveyed for carriage tenpence peter paid untied them read them went half mad what cried he this is my reward for nights of thought and days of toil do poets but to be abhorred by men of whom they never heard consume their spirits oil what have i done to them and who is mrs foy tis very cruel to speak of me and betty so adultery god defend me oh ive half a mind to fight a duel or cried he a grave look collecting is it my genius like the moon sets those who stand her face inspecting that face within their brain reflecting like a crazed bellchime out of tune for peter did not know the town but thought as country readers do for half a guinea or a crown he bought oblivion or renown from gods own voice in a review all peter did on this occasion was writing some sad stuff in prose it is a dangerous invasion when poets criticize their station is to delight not pose the devil then sent to leipsic fair for borns translation of kants book a world of words tail foremost where right wrong false true and foul and fair as in a lotterywheel are shook five thousand crammed octavo pages of german psychologics he who his furor verborum assuages thereon deserves just seven months wages more than will eer be due to me i looked on them nine several days and then i saw that they were bad a friend too spoke in their dispraise he never read them with amaze i found sir william drummond had when the book came the devil sent it to p verbovale esquire with a brief note of compliment by that nights carlisle mail it went and set his soul on fire fire which ex luce praebens fumum made him beyond the bottom see of truths clear well when i and you maam go as we shall do subter humum we may know more than he now peter ran to seed in soul into a walking paradox for he was neither part nor whole nor good nor bad nor knave nor fool among the woods and rocks furious he rode where late he ran lashing and spurring his tame hobby turned to a formal puritan a solemn and unsexual man he half believed white obi this steed in vision he would ride high trotting over nineinch bridges with flibbertigibbet imp of pride mocking and mowing by his side a madbrained goblin for a guide over cornfields gates and hedges after these ghastly rides he came home to his heart and found from thence much stolen of its accustomed flame his thoughts grew weak drowsy and lame of their intelligence to peters view all seemed one hue he was no whig he was no tory no deist and no christian he he got so subtle that to be nothing was all his glory one single point in his belief from his organization sprung the heartenrooted faith the chief ear in his doctrines blighted sheaf that happiness is wrong so thought calvin and dominic so think their fierce successors who even now would neither stint nor stick our flesh from off our bones to pick if they might do their do his morals thus were undermined the old peter the hard old potter was born anew within his mind he grew dull harsh sly unrefined as when he tramped beside the otter in the death hues of agony lambently flashing from a fish now peter felt amused to see shades like a rainbows rise and flee mixed with a certain hungry wish so in his countrys dying face he looked and lovely as she lay seeking in vain his last embrace wailing her own abandoned case with hardened sneer he turned away and coolly to his own soul said do you not think that we might make a poem on her when shes dead or no a thought is in my head her shroud for a new sheet ill take my wife wants one let who will bury this mangled corpse and i and you my dearest soul will then make merry as the prince regent did with sherry ay and at last desert me too and so his soul would not be gay but moaned within him like a fawn moaning within a cave it lay wounded and wasting day by day till all its life of life was gone as troubled skies stain waters clear the storm in peters heart and mind now made his verses dark and queer they were the ghosts of what they were shaking dim graveclothes in the wind for he now raved enormous folly of baptisms sundayschools and graves twould make george colman melancholy to have heard him like a male molly chanting those stupid staves yet the reviews who heaped abuse on peter while he wrote for freedom so soon as in his song they spy the folly which soothes tyranny praise him for those who feed em he was a man too great to scan a planet lost in truths keen rays his virtue awful and prodigious he was the most sublime religious pureminded poet of these days as soon as he read that cried peter eureka i have found the way to make a better thing of metre than eer was made by living creature up to this blessed day then peter wrote odes to the devil in one of which he meekly said may carnage and slaughter thy niece and thy daughter may rapine and famine thy gorge ever cramming glut thee with living and dead may death and damnation and consternation flit up from hell with pure intent slash them at manchester glasgow leeds and chester drench all with blood from avon to trent let thy bodyguard yeomen hew down babes and women and laugh with bold triumph till heaven be rent when moloch in jewry munched children with fury it was thou devil dining with pure intent part double damnation the devil now knew his proper cue soon as he read the ode he drove to his friend lord macmurderchouses a man of interest in both houses and said for money or for love pray find some cure or sinecure to feed from the superfluous taxes a friend of ours a poet fewer have fluttered tamer to the lure than he his lordship stands and racks his stupid brains while one might count as many beads as he had boroughs at length replies from his mean front like one who rubs out an account smoothing away the unmeaning furrows it happens fortunately dear sir i can i hope i need require no pledge from you that he will stir in our affairs like oliver that hell be worthy of his hire these words exchanged the news sent off to peter home the devil hied took to his bed he had no cough no doctor meat and drink enough yet that same night he died the devils corpse was leaded down his decent heirs enjoyed his pelf mourningcoaches many a one followed his hearse along the town where was the devil himself when peter heard of his promotion his eyes grew like two stars for bliss there was a bow of sleek devotion engendering in his back each motion seemed a lords shoe to kiss he hired a house bought plate and made a genteel drive up to his door with sifted gravel neatly laid as if defying all who said peter was ever poor but a disease soon struck into the very life and soul of peter he walked about slept had the hue of health upon his cheeks and few dug better none a heartier eater and yet a strange and horrid curse clung upon peter night and day month after month the thing grew worse and deadlier than in this my verse i can find strength to say peter was dull he was at first dull oh so dull so very dull whether he talked wrote or rehearsed still with this dulness was he cursed dull beyond all conception dull no one could read his books no mortal but a few natural friends would hear him the parson came not near his portal his state was like that of the immortal described by swift no man could bear him his sister wife and children yawned with a long slow and drear ennui all human patience far beyond their hopes of heaven each would have pawned anywhere else to be but in his verse and in his prose the essence of his dulness was concentred and compressed so close twould have made guatimozin doze on his red gridiron of brass a printers boy folding those pages fell slumbrously upon one side like those famed seven who slept three ages to wakeful frenzys vigil rages as opiates were the same applied even the reviewers who were hired to do the work of his reviewing with adamantine nerves grew tired gaping and torpid they retired to dream of what they should be doing and worse and worse the drowsy curse yawned in him till it grew a pest a wide contagious atmosphere creeping like cold through all things near a power to infect and to infest his servantmaids and dogs grew dull his kitten late a sportive elf the woods and lakes so beautiful of dim stupidity were full all grew dull as peters self the earth under his feet the springs which lived within it a quick life the air the winds of many wings that fan it with new murmurings were dead to their harmonious strife the birds and beasts within the wood the insects and each creeping thing were now a silent multitude loves work was left unwrought no brood near peters house took wing and every neighbouring cottager stupidly yawned upon the other no jackass brayed no little cur cocked up his ears no man would stir to save a dying mother yet all from that charmed district went but some halfidiot and halfknave who rather than pay any rent would live with marvellous content over his fathers grave no bailiff dared within that space for fear of the dull charm to enter a man would bear upon his face for fifteen months in any case the yawn of such a venture seven miles above below around this pest of dulness holds its sway a ghastly life without a sound to peters soul the spell is bound how should it ever pass away notes to those who have not duly appreciated the distinction between whale and russia oil this attribute might rather seem to belong to the dandy than the evangelic

how unconquerable cause with the principles of legitimate murder whilst the other only makes a bad one ridiculous and odious if either peter or cobbett should see this note each will feel more indignation at being compared to the other than at any censure implied in the moral perversion laid to their charge shelleys note note on peter bell the third by mrs shelley in this new edition i have added peter bell the third a critique on wordsworths peter bell reached us at leghorn which amused shelley exceedingly and suggested this poem i need scarcely observe that nothing personal to the author of peter bell is intended in this poem no man ever admired wordsworths poetry more he read it perpetually and taught others to appreciate its beauties this poem is like all others written by shelley ideal he conceived the idealism of a poet a man of lofty and creative genius quitting the glorious calling of discovering and announcing the beautiful and good to support and propagate ignorant prejudices and pernicious errors imparting to the unenlightened not that ardour for truth and spirit of toleration which shelley looked on as the sources of the moral improvement and happiness of mankind but false and injurious opinions that evil was good and that ignorance and force were the best allies of purity and virtue his idea was that a man gifted even as transcendently as the author of peter bell with the highest qualities of genius must if he fostered such errors be infected with dulness this poem was written as a warning not as a narration of the reality he was unacquainted personally with wordsworth or with coleridge to whom he alludes in the fifth part of the poem and therefore i repeat his poem is purely ideal it contains something of criticism on the compositions of those great poets but nothing injurious to the men themselves no poem contains more of shelleys peculiar views with regard to the errors into which many of the wisest have fallen and the pernicious effects of certain opinions on society much of it is beautifully written and though like the burlesque drama of swellfoot it must be looked on as a plaything it has so much merit and poetry so much of himself in it that it cannot fail to interest greatly and by right belongs to the world for whose instruction and benefit it was written letter to maria gisborne composed during

mulberry leaves his winding sheet and cradle ever weaves so i a thing whom moralists call worm sit spinning still round this decaying form from the fine threads of rare and subtle thought no net of words in garish colours wrought to catch the idle buzzers of the day but a soft cell where when that fades away memory may clothe in wings my living name and feed it with the asphodels of fame which in those hearts which must remember me grow making love an immortality whoever should behold me now i wist would think i were a mighty mechanist bent with sublime archimedean art to breathe a soul into the iron heart of some machine portentous or strange gin which by the force of figured spells might win its way over the sea and sport therein for round the walls are hung dread engines such as

some interest for the debt they owed to jesus christ for their salvation by giving a faint foretaste of damnation to shakespeare sidney spenser and the rest who made our land an island of the blest when lamplike spain who now relumes her fire on freedoms hearth grew dim with empire with thumbscrews wheels with tooth and spike and jag which fishers found under the utmost crag of cornwall and the stormencompassed isles where to the sky the rude sea rarely smiles unless in treacherous wrath as on the morn when the exulting elements in scorn satiated with destroyed destruction lay sleeping in beauty on their mangled prey as panthers sleep and other strange and dread magical forms the brick floor overspread proteus transformed to metal did not make more figures or more strange nor did he take such shapes of unintelligible brass or heap himself in such a horrid mass of tin and iron not to be understood and forms of unimaginable wood to puzzle tubal cain and all his brood great screws and cones and wheels and grooved blocks the elements of what will stand the shocks of wave and wind and time upon the table more knacks and quips there be than i am able to catalogize in this verse of mine a pretty bowl of wood not full of wine but quicksilver that dew which the gnomes drink when at their subterranean toil they swink pledging the demons of the earthquake who reply to them in lava cry halloo and call out to the cities oer their head roofs towers and shrines the dying and the dead crash through the chinks of earth and then all quaff another rouse and hold their sides and laugh this quicksilver no gnome has drunk within the walnut bowl it lies veined and thin in colour like the wake of light that stains the tuscan deep when from the moist moon rains the inmost shower of its white fire the breeze is still blue heaven smiles over the pale seas and in this bowl of quicksilver for i yield to the impulse of an infancy outlasting manhood i have made to float a rude idealism of a paper boat a hollow screw with cogs henry will know the thing i mean and laugh at me if so he fears not i should do more mischief next lie bills and calculations much perplexed with steamboats frigates and machinery quaint traced over them in blue and yellow paint then comes a range of mathematical instruments for plans nautical and statical a heap of rosin a queer broken glass with ink in it a china cup that was what it will never be again i think a thing from which sweet lips were wont to drink the liquor doctors rail at and which i will quaff in spite of them and when we die well toss up who died first of drinking tea and cry out heads or tails whereer we be near that a dusty paintbox some odd hooks a halfburnt match an ivory block three books where conic sections spherics logarithms to great laplace from saunderson and sims lie heaped in their harmonious disarray of figures disentangle them who may baron de totts memoirs beside them lie and some odd volumes of old chemistry near those a most inexplicable thing with lead in the middle im conjecturing how to make henry understand but no ill leave as spenser says with many mo this secret in the pregnant womb of time too vast a matter for so weak a rhyme and here like some weird archimage sit i plotting dark spells and devilish enginery the selfimpelling steamwheels of the mind which pump up oaths from clergymen and grind the gentle spirit of our meek reviews into a powdery foam of salt abuse ruffling the ocean of their selfcontent i sit and smile or sigh as is my bent but not for them libeccio rushes round with an inconstant and an idle sound i heed him more than them the thundersmoke is gathering on the mountains like a cloak folded athwart their shoulders broad and bare the ripe corn under the undulating air undulates like an ocean and the vines are trembling wide in all their trellised lines the murmur of the awakening sea doth fill the empty pauses of the blast the hill looks hoary through the white electric rain and from the glens beyond in sullen strain the interrupted thunder howls above one chasm of heaven smiles like the eye of love on the unquiet world while such things are how could one worth your friendship heed the war of worms the shriek of the worlds carrion jays their censure or their wonder or their praise you are not here the quaint witch memory sees in vacant chairs your absent images and points where once you sat and now should be but are not i demand if ever we shall meet as then we met and she replies veiling in awe her secondsighted eyes i know the past alone but summon home my sister hope she speaks of all to come but i an old diviner who knew well every false verse of that sweet oracle turned to the sad enchantress once again and sought a respite from my gentle pain in citing every passage oer and oer of our communion how on the seashore we watched the ocean and the sky together under the roof of blue italian weather how i ran home through last years thunderstorm and felt the transverse lightning linger warm upon my cheek and how we often made feasts for each other where good will outweighed the frugal luxury of our country cheer as well it might were it less firm and clear than ours must ever be and how we spun a shroud of talk to hide us from the sun of this familiar life which seems to be but is not or is but quaint mockery of all we would believe and sadly blame the jarring and inexplicable frame of this wrong world and then anatomize the purposes and thoughts of men whose eyes were closed in distant years or widely guess the issue of the earths great business when we shall be as we no longer are like babbling gossips safe who hear the war of winds and sigh but tremble not or how you listened to some interrupted flow of visionary rhyme in joy and pain struck from the inmost fountains of my brain with little skill perhaps or how we sought those deepest wells of passion or of thought wrought by wise poets in the waste of years staining their sacred waters with our tears quenching a thirst ever to be renewed or how i wisest lady then endued the language of a land which now is free and winged with thoughts of truth and majesty flits round the tyrants sceptre like a cloud and bursts the peopled prisons and cries aloud my name is legion that majestic tongue which calderon over the desert flung of ages and of nations and which found an echo in our hearts and with the sound startled oblivion thou wert then to me as is a nurse when inarticulately a child would talk as its grown parents do if living winds the rapid clouds pursue if hawks chase doves through the aethereal way huntsmen the innocent deer and beasts their prey why should not we rouse with the spirits blast out of the forest of the pathless past these recollected pleasures you are now in london that great sea whose ebb and flow at once is deaf and loud and on the shore vomits its wrecks and still howls on for more yet in its depth what treasures you will see that which was godwin greater none than he though fallen and fallen on evil times to stand among the spirits of our age and land before the dread tribunal of to come the foremost while rebuke cowers pale and dumb you will see coleridge he who sits obscure in the exceeding lustre and the pure intense irradiation of a mind which with its own internal lightning blind flags wearily through darkness and despair a cloudencircled meteor of the air a hooded eagle among blinking owls you will see hunt one of those happy souls which are the salt of the earth and without whom this world would smell like what it is a tomb who is what others seem his room no doubt is still adorned with many a cast from shout with graceful flowers tastefully placed about and coronals of bay from ribbons hung and brighter wreaths in neat disorder flung the gifts of the most learned among some dozens of female friends sistersinlaw and cousins and there is he with his eternal puns which beat the dullest brain for smiles like duns thundering for money at a poets door alas it is no use to say im poor or oft in graver mood when he will look things wiser than were ever read in book except in shakespeares wisest tenderness you will see hogg and i cannot express his virtues though i know that they are great because he locks then barricades the gate within which they inhabit of his wit and wisdom youll cry out when you are bit he is a pearl within an oyster shell one of the richest of the deep and there is english peacock with his mountain fair turned into a flamingo that shy bird that gleams i the indian air have you not heard when a man marries dies or turns hindoo his best friends hear no more of him but you will see him and will like him too i hope with the milkwhite snowdonian antelope matched with this cameleopard his fine wit makes such a wound the knife is lost in it a strain too learned for a shallow age too wise for selfish bigots let his page which charms the chosen spirits of the time fold itself up for the serener clime of years to come and find its recompense in that just expectation wit and sense virtue and human knowledge all that might make this dull world a business of delight are all combined in horace smith and these with some exceptions which i need not tease your patience by descanting on are all you and i know in london i recall my thoughts and bid you look upon the night as water does a sponge so the moonlight fills the void hollow universal air what see you unpavilioned heaven is fair whether the moon into her chamber gone leaves midnight to the golden stars or wan climbs with diminished beams the azure steep or whether clouds sail oer the inverse deep piloted by the manywandering blast and the rare stars rush through them dim and fast all this is beautiful in every land but what see you beside a shabby stand of hackney coaches a brick house or wall fencing some lonely court white with the scrawl of our unhappy politics or worse a wretched woman reeling by whose curse mixed with the watchmans partner of her trade you must accept in place of serenade or yellowhaired pollonia murmuring to henry some unutterable thing i see a chaos of green leaves and fruit built round dark caverns even to the root of the living stems that feed them in whose bowers there sleep in their dark dew the folded flowers beyond the surface of the unsickled corn trembles not in the slumbering air and borne in circles quaint and everchanging dance like winged stars the fireflies flash and glance pale in the open moonshine but each one under the dark trees seems a little sun a meteor tamed a fixed star gone astray from the silver regions of the milky way afar the contadinos song is heard rude but made sweet by distance and a bird which cannot be the nightingale and yet i know none else that sings so sweet as it at this late hour and then all is still now italy or london which you will next winter you must pass with me ill have my house by that time turned into a grave of dead despondence and lowthoughted care and all the dreams which our tormentors are oh that hunt hogg peacock and smith were there with everything belonging to them fair we will have books spanish italian greek and ask one week to make another week as like his father as im unlike mine which is not his fault as you may divine though we eat little flesh and drink no wine yet lets be merry well have tea and toast custards for supper and an endless host of syllabubs and jellies and mincepies and other such ladylike luxuries

those cruel twins whom at one birth incestuous change bore to her father time error and truth had hunted from the earth all those bright natures which adorned its prime and left us nothing to believe in worth the pains of putting into learned rhyme a ladywitch there lived on atlas mountain within a cavern by a secret fountain her mother was one of the atlantides the allbeholding sun had neer beholden in his wide voyage oer continents and seas so fair a creature as she lay enfolden in the warm shadow of her loveliness he kissed her with his beams and made all golden the chamber of gray rock in which she lay she in that dream of joy dissolved away tis said she first was changed into a vapour and then into a cloud such clouds as flit like splendourwinged moths about a taper round the red west when the sun dies in it and then into a meteor such as caper on hilltops when the moon is in a fit then into one of those mysterious stars which hide themselves between the earth and mars ten times the mother of the months had bent her bow beside the foldingstar and bidden with that bright sign the billows to indent the seadeserted sand like children chidden at her command they ever came and went since in that cave a dewy splendour hidden took shape and motion with the living form of this embodied power the cave grew warm a lovely lady garmented in light from her own beauty deep her eyes as are two openings of unfathomable night seen through a temples cloven roof her hair dark the dim brain whirls dizzy with delight picturing her form her soft smiles shone afar and her low voice was heard like love and drew all living things towards this wonder new and first the spotted cameleopard came and then the wise and fearless elephant then the sly serpent in the golden flame of his own volumes intervolved all gaunt and sanguine beasts her gentle looks made tame they drank before her at her sacred fount and every beast of beating heart grew bold such gentleness and power even to behold the brinded lioness led forth her young that she might teach them how they should forego their inborn thirst of death the pard unstrung his sinews at her feet and sought to know with looks whose motions spoke without a tongue how he might be as gentle as the doe the magic circle of her voice and eyes all savage natures did imparadise and old silenus shaking a green stick of lilies and the woodgods in a crew came blithe as in the olive copses thick cicadae are drunk with the noonday dew and dryope and faunus followed quick teasing the god to sing them something new till in this cave they found the lady lone sitting upon a seat of emerald stone and universal pan tis said was there and though none saw him through the adamant of the deep mountains through the trackless air and through those living spirits like a want he passed out of his everlasting lair where the quick heart of the great world doth pant and felt that wondrous lady all alone and she felt him upon her emerald throne and every nymph of stream and spreading tree and every shepherdess of oceans flocks who drives her white waves over the green sea and ocean with the brine on his gray locks and quaint priapus with his company all came much wondering how the enwombed rocks could have brought forth so beautiful a birth her love subdued their wonder and their mirth the herdsmen and the mountain maidens came and the rude kings of pastoral garamant their spirits shook within them as a flame stirred by the air under a cavern gaunt pigmies and polyphemes by many a name centaurs and satyrs and such shapes as haunt wet clefts and lumps neither alive nor dead dogheaded bosomeyed and birdfooted for she was beautiful her beauty made the bright world dim and everything beside seemed like the fleeting image of a shade no thought of living spirit could abide which to her looks had ever been betrayed on any object in the world so wide on any hope within the circling skies but on her form and in her inmost eyes which when the lady knew she took her spindle and twined three threads of fleecy mist and three long lines of light such as the dawn may kindle the clouds and waves and mountains with and she as many starbeams ere their lamps could dwindle in the belated moon wound skilfully and with these threads a subtle veil she wove a shadow for the splendour of her love the deep recesses of her odorous dwelling were stored with magic treasures sounds of air which had the power all spirits of compelling folded in cells of crystal silence there such as we hear in youth and think the feeling will never die yet ere we are aware the feeling and the sound are fled and gone and the regret they leave remains alone and there lay visions swift and sweet and quaint each in its thin sheath like a chrysalis some eager to burst forth some weak and faint with the soft burthen of intensest bliss it was its work to bear to many a saint whose heart adores the shrine which holiest is even loves and others white green gray and black and of all shapes and each was at her beck and odours in a kind of aviary of everblooming edentrees she kept clipped in a floating net a lovesick fairy had woven from dewbeams while the moon yet slept as bats at the wired window of a dairy they beat their vans and each was an adept when loosed and missioned making wings of winds to stir sweet thoughts or sad in destined minds and liquors clear and sweet whose healthful might could medicine the sick soul to happy sleep and change eternal death into a night of glorious dreams or if eyes needs must weep could make their tears all wonder and delight she in her crystal vials did closely keep if men could drink of those clear vials tis said the living were not envied of the dead her cave was stored with scrolls of strange device the works of some saturnian archimage which taught the expiations at whose price men from the gods might win that happy age too lightly lost redeeming native vice and which might quench the earthconsuming rage of gold and blood till men should live and move harmonious as the sacred stars above and how all things that seem untameable not to be checked and not to be confined obey the spells of wisdoms wizard skill time earth and fire the ocean and the wind and all their shapes and mans imperial will and other scrolls whose writings did unbind the inmost lore of love let the profane tremble to ask what secrets they contain and wondrous works of substances unknown to which the enchantment of her fathers power had changed those ragged blocks of savage stone were heaped in the recesses of her bower carved lamps and chalices and vials which shone in their own golden beams each like a flower out of whose depth a firefly shakes his light under a cypress in a starless night at first she lived alone in this wild home and her own thoughts were each a minister clothing themselves or with the ocean foam or with the wind or with the speed of fire to work whatever purposes might come into her mind such power her mighty sire had girt them with whether to fly or run through all the regions which he shines upon the oceannymphs and hamadryades oreads and naiads with long weedy locks offered to do her bidding through the seas under the earth and in the hollow rocks and far beneath the matted roots of trees and in the gnarled heart of stubborn oaks so they might live for ever in the light of her sweet presence each a satellite this may not be the wizard maid replied the fountains where the naiades bedew their shining hair at length are drained and dried the solid oaks forget their strength and strew their latest leaf upon the mountains wide the boundless ocean like a drop of dew will be consumed the stubborn centre must be scattered like a cloud of summer dust and ye with them will perish one by one if i must sigh to think that this shall be if i must weep when the surviving sun shall smile on your decay oh ask not me to love you till your little race is run i cannot die as ye must over me your leaves shall glance the streams in which ye dwell shall be my paths henceforth and so farewell she spoke and wept the dark and azure well sparkled beneath the shower of her bright tears and every little circlet where they fell flung to the cavernroof inconstant spheres and intertangled lines of light a knell of sobbing voices came upon her ears from those departing forms oer the serene of the white streams and of the forest green all day the wizard lady sate aloof spelling out scrolls of dread antiquity under the caverns fountainlighted roof or broidering the pictured poesy of some high tale upon her growing woof which the sweet splendour of her smiles could dye in hues outshining heaven and ever she added some grace to the wrought poesy while on her hearth lay blazing many a piece of sandal wood rare gums and cinnamon men scarcely know how beautiful fire is each flame of it is as a precious stone dissolved in evermoving light and this belongs to each and all who gaze upon the witch beheld it not for in her hand she held a woof that dimmed the burning brand this lady never slept but lay in trance all night within the fountain as in sleep its emerald crags glowed in her beautys glance through the green splendour of the water deep she saw the constellations reel and dance like fireflies and withal did ever keep the tenour of her contemplations calm with open eyes closed feet and folded palm and when the whirlwinds and the clouds descended from the white pinnacles of that cold hill she passed at dewfall to a space extended where in a lawn of flowering asphodel amid a wood of pines and cedars blended there yawned an inextinguishable well of crimson fire full even to the brim and overflowing all the margin trim within the which she lay when the fierce war of wintry winds shook that innocuous liquor in many a mimic moon and bearded star oer woods and lawns the serpent heard it flicker in sleep and dreaming still he crept afar and when the windless snow descended thicker than autumn leaves she watched it as it came melt on the surface of the level flame she had a boat which some say vulcan wrought for venus as the chariot of her star but it was found too feeble to be fraught with all the ardours in that sphere which are and so she sold it and apollo bought and gave it to this daughter from a car changed to the fairest and the lightest boat which ever upon mortal stream did float and others say that when but three hours old the firstborn love out of his cradle lept and clove dun chaos with his wings of gold and like a horticultural adept stole a strange seed and wrapped it up in mould and sowed it in his mothers star and kept watering it all the summer with sweet dew and with his wings fanning it as it grew the plant grew strong and green the snowy flower fell and the long and gourdlike fruit began to turn the light and dew by inward power to its own substance woven tracery ran of light firm texture ribbed and branching oer the solid rind like a leafs veined fan of which love scooped this boat and with soft motion piloted it round the circumfluous ocean this boat she moored upon her fount and lit a living spirit within all its frame breathing the soul of swiftness into it couched on the fountain like a panther tame one of the twain at evans feet that sit or as on vestas sceptre a swift flame or on blind homers heart a winged thought in joyous expectation lay the boat then by strange art she kneaded fire and snow together tempering the repugnant mass with liquid love all things together grow through which the harmony of love can pass and a fair shape out of her hands did flow a living image which did far surpass in beauty that bright shape of vital stone which drew the heart out of pygmalion a sexless thing it was and in its growth it seemed to have developed no defect of either sex yet all the grace of both in gentleness and strength its limbs were decked the bosom swelled lightly with its full youth the countenance was such as might select some artist that his skill should never die imaging forth such perfect purity from its smooth shoulders hung two rapid wings fit to have borne it to the seventh sphere tipped with the speed of liquid lightenings dyed in the ardours of the atmosphere she led her creature to the boiling springs where the light boat was moored and said sit here and pointed to the prow and took her seat beside the rudder with opposing feet and down the streams which clove those mountains vast around their inland islets and amid the pantherpeopled forests whose shade cast darkness and odours and a pleasure hid in melancholy gloom the pinnace passed by many a starsurrounded pyramid of icy crag cleaving the purple sky and caverns yawning round unfathomably the silver noon into that winding dell with slanted gleam athwart the forest tops tempered like golden evening feebly fell a green and glowing light like that which drops from folded lilies in which glowworms dwell when earth over her face nights mantle wraps between the severed mountains lay on high over the stream a narrow rift of sky and ever as she went the image lay with folded wings and unawakened eyes and oer its gentle countenance did play the busy dreams as thick as summer flies chasing the rapid smiles that would not stay and drinking the warm tears and the sweet sighs inhaling which with busy murmur vain they had aroused from that full heart and brain and ever down the prone vale like a cloud upon a stream of wind the pinnace went now lingering on the pools in which abode the calm and darkness of the deep content in which they paused now oer the shallow road of white and dancing waters all besprent with sand and polished pebbles mortal boat in such a shallow rapid could not float and down the earthquaking cataracts which shiver their snowlike waters into golden air or under chasms unfathomable ever sepulchre them till in their rage they tear a subterranean portal for the river it fled the circling sunbows did upbear its fall down the hoar precipice of spray lighting it far upon its lampless way and when the wizard lady would ascend the labyrinths of some manywinding vale which to the inmost mountain upward tend she called hermaphroditus and the pale and heavy hue which slumber could extend over its lips and eyes as on the gale a rapid shadow from a slope of grass into the darkness of the stream did pass and it unfurled its heavencoloured pinions with stars of fire spotting the stream below and from above into the suns dominions flinging a glory like the golden glow in which spring clothes her emeraldwinged minions all interwoven with fine feathery snow and moonlight splendour of intensest rime with which frost paints the pines in winter time and then it winnowed the elysian air which ever hung about that lady bright with its aethereal vans and speeding there like a star up the torrent of the night or a swift eagle in the morning glare breasting the whirlwind with impetuous flight the pinnace oared by those enchanted wings clove the fierce streams towards their upper springs the water flashed like sunlight by the prow of a noonwandering meteor flung to heaven the still air seemed as if its waves did flow in tempest down the mountains loosely driven the ladys radiant hair streamed to and fro beneath the billows having vainly striven indignant and impetuous roared to feel the swift and steady motion of the keel or when the weary moon was in the wane or in the noon of interlunar night the ladywitch in visions could not chain her spirit but sailed forth under the light of shooting stars and bade extend amain its stormoutspeeding wings the hermaphrodite she to the austral waters took her way beyond the fabulous thamondocana where like a meadow which no scythe has shaven which rain could never bend or whirlblast shake with the antarctic constellations paven canopus and his crew lay the austral lake there she would build herself a windless haven out of the clouds whose moving turrets make the bastions of the storm when through the sky the spirits of the tempest thundered by a haven beneath whose translucent floor the tremulous stars sparkled unfathomably and around which the solid vapours hoar based on the level waters to the sky lifted their dreadful crags and like a shore of wintry mountains inaccessibly hemmed in with rifts and precipices gray and hanging crags many a cove and bay and whilst the outer lake beneath the lash of the winds scourge foamed like a wounded thing and the incessant hail with stony clash ploughed up the waters and the flagging wing of the roused cormorant in the lightning flash looked like the wreck of some windwandering fragment of inky thundersmoke this haven was as a gem to copy heaven engraven on which that lady played her many pranks circling the image of a shooting star even as a tiger on hydaspes banks outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are in her light boat and many quips and cranks she played upon the water till the car of the late moon like a sick matron wan to journey from the misty east began and then she called out of the hollow turrets of those high clouds white golden and vermilion the armies of her ministering spirits in mighty legions million after million they came each troop emblazoning its merits on meteor flags and many a proud pavilion of the intertexture of the atmosphere they pitched upon the plain of the calm mere they framed the imperial tent of their great queen of woven exhalations underlaid with lambent lightningfire as may be seen a dome of thin and open ivory inlaid with crimson silk cressets from the serene hung there and on the water for her tread a tapestry of fleecelike mist was strewn dyed in the beams of the ascending moon and on a throne oerlaid with starlight caught upon those wandering isles of aery dew which highest shoals of mountain shipwreck not she sate and heard all that had happened new between the earth and moon since they had brought the last intelligence and now she grew pale as that moon lost in the watery night and now she wept and now she laughed outright these were tame pleasures she would often climb the steepest ladder of the crudded rack up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime and like arion on the dolphins back ride singing through the shoreless air ofttime following the serpent lightnings winding track she ran upon the platforms of the wind and laughed to bear the fireballs roar behind and sometimes to those streams of upper air which whirl the earth in its diurnal round she would ascend and win the spirits there to let her join their chorus mortals found that on those days the sky was calm and fair and mystic snatches of harmonious sound wandered upon the earth whereer she passed and happy thoughts of hope too sweet to last but her choice sport was in the hours of sleep to glide adown old nilus where he threads egypt and aethiopia from the steep of utmost axume until he spreads like a calm flock of silverfleeced sheep his waters on the plain and crested heads of cities and proud temples gleam amid and many a vapourbelted pyramid by moeris and the mareotid lakes strewn with faint blooms like bridal chamber floors where naked boys bridling tame watersnakes or charioteering ghastly alligators had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes of those huge forms within the brazen doors of the great labyrinth slept both boy and beast tired with the pomp of their osirian feast and where within the surface of the river the shadows of the massy temples lie and never are erased but tremble ever like things which every cloud can doom to die through lotuspaven canals and wheresoever the works of man pierced that serenest sky with tombs and towers and fanes twas her delight to wander in the shadow of the night with motion like the spirit of that wind whose soft step deepens slumber her light feet passed through the peopled haunts of humankind scattering sweet visions from her presence sweet through fane and palacecourt and labyrinth mined with many a dark and subterranean street under the nile through chambers high and deep she passed observing mortals in their sleep a pleasure sweet doubtless it was to see mortals subdued in all the shapes of sleep here lay two sister twins in infancy there a lone youth who in his dreams did weep within two lovers linked innocently in their loose locks which over both did creep like ivy from one stem and there lay calm old age with snowbright hair and folded palm but other troubled forms of sleep she saw not to be mirrored in a holy song distortions foul of supernatural awe and pale imaginings of visioned wrong and all the code of customs lawless law written upon the brows of old and young this said the wizard maiden is the strife which stirs the liquid surface of mans life and little did the sight disturb her soul we the weak mariners of that wide lake whereer its shores extend or billows roll our course unpiloted and starless make oer its wild surface to an unknown goal but she in the calm depths her way could take where in bright bowers immortal forms abide beneath the weltering of the restless tide and she saw princes couched under the glow of sunlike gems and round each templecourt in dormitories ranged row after row she saw the priests asleep all of one sort for all were educated to be so the peasants in their huts and in the port the sailors she saw cradled on the waves and the dead lulled within their dreamless graves and all the forms in which those spirits lay were to her sight like the diaphanous veils in which those sweet ladies oft array their delicate limbs who would conceal from us only their scorn of all concealment they move in the light of their own beauty thus but these and all now lay with sleep upon them and little thought a witch was looking on them she all those human figures breathing there beheld as living spirits to her eyes the naked beauty of the soul lay bare and often through a rude and worn disguise she saw the inner form most bright and fair and then she had a charm of strange device which murmured on mute lips with tender tone could make that spirit mingle with her own alas aurora what wouldst thou have given for such a charm when tithon became gray or how much venus of thy silver heaven wouldst thou have yielded ere proserpina had half oh why not all the debt forgiven which dear adonis had been doomed to pay to any witch who would have taught you it the heliad doth not know its value yet tis said in after times her spirit free knew what love was and felt itself alone but holy dian could not chaster be before she stooped to kiss endymion than now this lady like a sexless bee tasting all blossoms and confined to none among those mortal forms the wizardmaiden passed with an eye serene and heart unladen to those she saw most beautiful she gave strange panacea in a crystal bowl they drank in their deep sleep of that sweet wave and lived thenceforward as if some control mightier than life were in them and the grave of such when death oppressed the weary soul was as a green and overarching bower lit by the gems of many a starry flower for on the night when they were buried she restored the embalmers ruining and shook the light out of the funeral lamps to be a mimic day within that deathy nook and she unwound the woven imagery of second childhoods swaddling bands and took the coffin its last cradle from its niche and threw it with contempt into a ditch and there the body lay age after age mute breathing beating warm and undecaying like one asleep in a green hermitage with gentle smiles about its eyelids playing and living in its dreams beyond the rage of death or life while they were still arraying in liveries ever new the rapid blind and fleeting generations of mankind and she would write strange dreams upon the brain of those who were less beautiful and make all harsh and crooked purposes more vain than in the desert is the serpents wake which the sand covers all his evil gain the miser in such dreams would rise and shake into a beggars lap the lying scribe would his own lies betray without a bribe the priests would write an explanation full translating hieroglyphics into greek how the god apis really was a bull and nothing more and bid the herald stick the same against the temple doors and pull the old cant down they licensed all to speak whateer they thought of hawks and cats and geese by pastoral letters to each diocese the king would dress an ape up in his crown and robes and seat him on his glorious seat and on the right hand of the sunlike throne would place a gaudy mockbird to repeat the chatterings of the monkey every one of the prone courtiers crawled to kiss the feet of their great emperor when the morning came and kissed alas how many kiss the same the soldiers dreamed that they were blacksmiths and walked out of quarters in somnambulism round the red anvils you might see them stand like cyclopses in vulcans sooty abysm beating their swords to ploughshares in a band the gaolers sent those of the liberal schism free through the streets of memphis much i wis to the annoyance of king amasis and timid lovers who had been so coy they hardly knew whether they loved or not would rise out of their rest and take sweet joy to the fulfilment of their inmost thought and when next day the maiden and the boy met one another both like sinners caught blushed at the thing which each believed was done only in fancy till the tenth moon shone and then the witch would let them take no ill of many thousand schemes which lovers find the witch found one and so they took their fill of happiness in marriage warm and kind friends who by practice of some envious skill were torn apart a wide wound mind from mind she did unite again with visions clear of deep affection and of truth sincere these were the pranks she played among the cities of mortal men and what she did to sprites and gods entangling them in her sweet ditties to do her will and show their subtle sleights i will

baths of san giuliano four miles from pisa these baths were of great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability we made several excursions in the neighbourhood the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrino a mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tastes wildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him even now i believe that i was in the right shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following alas this is not what i thought life was i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of othersand when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hate a woful mass i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes these are the materials which form the witch of atlas it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered and his fancy coloured during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved oedipus tyrannus or swellfoot the tyrant a tragedy in two acts translated from the original doric choose reform or civil war when through thy streets instead of hare with dogs a consortqueen shall hunt a king with hogs riding on the ionian minotaur begun at the baths of san giuliano near pisa august published anonymously by j johnston cheapside imprint cf seyfang on a threat of prosecution the publisher surrendered the whole impression seven copies the total number sold excepted oedipus does not appear in the first edition of the poetical works but it was included by mrs shelley in the second edition of that year our text is that of the editio princeps save in three places where the reading of edition will be found in the notes advertisement this tragedy is one of a triad or system of three plays an arrangement according to which the greeks were accustomed to connect their dramatic representations elucidating the wonderful and appalling fortunes of the swellfoot dynasty it was evidently written by some learned theban and from its characteristic dulness apparently before the duties on the importation of attic salt had been repealed by the boeotarchs the tenderness with which he treats the pigs proves him to have been a sus boeotiae possibly epicuri de grege porcus for as the poet observes a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind no liberty has been taken with the translation of this remarkable piece of antiquity except the suppressing a seditious and blasphemous chorus of the pigs and bulls at the last act the work hoydipouse or more properly oedipus has been rendered literally swellfoot without its having been conceived necessary to determine whether a swelling of the hind or the fore feet of the swinish monarch is particularly indicated should the remaining portions of this tragedy be found entitled swellfoot in angaria and charite the translator might be tempted to give them to the reading public dramatis personae tyrant swellfoot king of thebes iona taurina his queen mammon

order with bare tusks and wrinkled snouts presented to the foe bore her in triumph to the public sty what is still worse some sows upon the ground have given the apeguards apples nuts and gin and they all whisk their tails aloft and cry long live iona down with swellfoot purganax hark the swine without long live iona down with swellfoot dakry i went to the garret of the swineherds tower which overlooks the sty and made a long harangue all words to the assembled swine of delicacy mercy judgement law morals and precedents and purity adultery destitution and divorce piety faith and state necessity and how i loved the queen and then i wept with the pathos of my own eloquence and every tear turned to a millstone which brained many a gaping pig and there was made a slough of blood and brains upon the place greased with the pounded bacon round and round the millstones rolled ploughing the pavement up and hurling suckingpigs into the air with dust and stones enter mammon mammon i wonder that gray wizards like you should be so beardless in their schemes it had been but a point of policy to keep iona and the swine apart divide and rule but ye have made a junction between two parties who will govern you but for my art behold this bag it is the poison bag of that green spider huge on which our spies skulked in ovation through the streets of thebes when they were paved with dead a bane so much the deadlier fills it now as calumny is worse than death for here the gadflys venom fifty times distilled is mingled with the vomit of the leech in due proportion and black ratsbane which that very rat who like the pontic tyrant nurtures himself on poison dare not touch all is sealed up with the broad seal of fraud who is the devils lord high chancellor and over it the primate of all hell murmured this pious baptism be thou called the green bag and this power and grace be thine that thy contents on whomsoever poured turn innocence to guilt and gentlest looks to savage foul and fierce deformity let all baptized by thy infernal dew be called adulterer drunkard liar wretch no name left out which orthodoxy loves court journal or legitimate review be they called tyrant beast fool glutton lover of other wives and husbands than their own the heaviest sin on this side of the alps wither they to a ghastly caricature of what was human let not man or beast behold

dread majesty only desires to see the colour of it mammon now with a little common sense my lords only undoing all that has been done yet so as it may seem we but confirm it our victory is assured we must entice her majesty from the sty and make the pigs believe that the contents of the green bag are the true test of guilt or innocence and that if she be guilty twill transform her to manifest deformity like guilt if innocent she will become transfigured into an angel such as they say she is and they will see her flying through the air so bright that she will dim the noonday sun showering down blessings in the shape of comfits this trust a priest is just the sort of thing swine will believe ill wager you will see them climbing upon the thatch of their low sties with pieces of smoked glass to watch her sail among the clouds and some will hold the flaps of one anothers ears between their teeth to catch the coming hail of comfits in you purganax who have the gift o the gab make them a solemn speech to this effect i go to put in readiness the feast kept to the honour of our goddess famine where for more glory let the ceremony take place of the uglification of the queen dakry to

burthens the glorious constitution of these sties subsists and shall subsist the leanpig rates grow with the growing populace of swine the taxes that true source of piggishness how can i find a more appropriate term to include religion morals peace and plenty and all that fit boeotia as a nation to teach the other nations how to live increase with piggishness itself and still does the revenue that great spring of all the patronage and pensions and bypayments which freeborn pigs regard with jealous eyes diminish till at length by glorious steps all the lands produce will be merged in taxes and the revenue will amount to nothing the failure of a foreign market for sausages bristles and bloodpuddings and such home manufactures is but partial and that the population of the pigs instead of hogwash has been fed on straw and water is a fact which is you know that is it is a statenecessity temporary of course those impious pigs who by frequent squeaks have dared impugn the settled swellfoot system or to make irreverent mockery of the genuflexions inculcated by the archpriest have been whipped into a loyal and an orthodox whine things being in this happy state the queen iona note landslands edition a loud cry from the pigs she is innocent most innocent purganax that is the very thing that i was saying gentlemen swine the queen iona being most innocent no doubt returns to thebes and the lean sows and bears collect about her wishing to make her think that we believe i mean those more substantial pigs who swill rich hogwash while the others mouth damp straw that she is guilty thus the leanpig faction seeks to obtain that hogwash which has been your immemorial right and which i will maintain you in to the last drop of a boar interrupting him what does any one accuse her of purganax why no one makes any positive accusation but there were hints dropped and so the privy wizards conceived that it became them to advise his majesty to investigate their truth not for his own sake he could be content to let his wife play any pranks she pleased if by that sufferance he could please the pigs but then he fears the morals of the swine the sows especially and what effect it might produce upon the purity and religion of the rising generation of suckingpigs if it could be suspected that queen iona a pause first boar well go on we long to hear what she can possibly have done purganax why it is hinted that a certain bull thus much is known the milkwhite bulls that feed beside clitumnus and the crystal lakes of the cisalpine mountains in fresh dews of lotusgrass and blossoming asphodel sleeking their silken hair and with sweet breath loading the morning winds until they faint with living fragrance are so beautiful well i say nothing but europa rode on such a one from asia into crete and the enamoured sea grew calm beneath his gliding beauty and pasiphae ionas grandmother but she is innocent and that both you and i and all assert first boar most

liquor which if sprinkled oer a woman guilty of we all know what makes her so hideous till she finds one blind she never can commit the like again if innocent she will turn into an angel and rain down blessings in the shape of comfits as she flies up to heaven now my proposal is to convert her sacred majesty into an angel as i am sure we shall do by pouring on her head this mystic water showing the bag i know that she is innocent i wish only to prove her so to all the world first boar excellent just and noble purganax second boar how glorious it will be to see her majesty flying above our heads her petticoats streaming like like like third boar anything purganax oh no but like a standard of an admirals ship or like the banner of a conquering host or like a cloud dyed in the dying day unravelled on the blast from a white mountain or like a meteor or a warsteeds mane or waterfall from a dizzy precipice scattered upon the wind first boar or a cows tail second boar or anything as the learned boar observed purganax gentlemen boars i move a resolution that her most sacred majesty should be invited to attend the feast of famine and to receive upon her chaste white body dews of apotheosis from this bag a great confusion is heard of the pigs out of doors which communicates itself to those within during the first strophe the doors of the sty are staved in and a number of

countenance changes she snatches it from his hand with a loud laugh of triumph and empties it over swellfoot and his whole court who are instantly changed into a number of filthy and ugly animals and rush out of the temple the image of famine then arises with a tremendous sound the pigs begin scrambling for the loaves and are trjpped up by the skulls all those who eat the loaves are turned into

recorded in august shelley begins swellfoot the tyrant suggested by the pigs at the fair of san giuliano this was the period of queen carolines landing in england and the struggles made by george iv to get rid of her claims which failing lord castlereagh placed the green bag on the table of the house of commons demanding in the kings name that an enquiry should be instituted into his wifes conduct these circumstances were the theme of all conversation among the english we were then at the baths of san giuliano a friend came to visit us on the day when a fair was held in the square beneath our windows shelley read to us his ode to liberty and was riotously accompanied by the grunting of a quantity of pigs brought for sale to the fair he compared it to the chorus of frogs in the satiric drama of aristophanes and it being an hour of merriment and one ludicrous association suggesting another he imagined a politicalsatirical drama on the circumstances of the day to which the pigs would serve as chorus and swellfoot was begun when finished it was transmitted to england printed and published anonymously but stifled at the very dawn of its existence by the society for the suppression of vice who threatened to prosecute it if not immediately withdrawn the friend who had taken the trouble of bringing it out of course did not think it worth the annoyance and expense of a contest and it was laid aside hesitation of whether it would do honour to shelley prevented my publishing it at first but i cannot bring myself to keep back anything he ever wrote for each word is fraught with the peculiar views and sentiments which he believed to be beneficial to the human race and the bright light of poetry irradiates every thought the world has a right to the entire compositions of such a man for it does not live and thrive by the outworn lesson of the dullard or the hypocrite but by the original free thoughts of men of genius who aspire to pluck bright truth from the palefaced moon or dive into the bottom of the deep where fathomline would never touch the ground and pluck up drowned truth even those who may dissent from his opinions will consider that he was a man of genius and that the world will take more interest in his slightest word than in the waters of lethe which are so eagerly prescribed as medicinal for all its wrongs and woe this drama however must not be judged for more than was meant it is a mere plaything of the imagination which even may not excite smiles among many who will not see wit in those combinations of thought which were full of the ridiculous to the author but like everything he wrote it breathes that deep sympathy for the sorrows of humanity and indignation against its oppressors which make it worthy of his name epipsychidion verses addressed to the noble and unfortunate lady emilia v now imprisoned in the convent of lanima amante si slancia fuori del creato e si crea nell infinito un mondo tutto per essa diverso assai da questo oscuro e pauroso baratro her own words epipsychidion was composed at pisa january february and published without the authors name in the following summer by c j ollier

less complete of the preface advertisement a version in ink and pencil much cancelled of the last eighty lines of the poem and some additional lines which did not appear in print examination of the shelley manuscripts in the bodleian library by cd locock oxford clarendon press page this draft the writing of which is extraordinarily confused and illegible has been carefully deciphered and printed by mr locock in the volume named above our text follows that of the editio princeps advertisement the writer of the following lines died at florence as he was preparing for a voyage to one of the wildest of the sporades which he had bought and where he had fitted up the ruins of an old building and where it was his hope to have realised a scheme of life suited perhaps to that happier and better world of which he is now an inhabitant but hardly practicable in this his life was singular less on account of the romantic vicissitudes which diversified it than the ideal tinge which it received from his own character and feelings the present poem like the vita nuova of dante is sufficiently intelligible to a certain class of readers without a matteroffact history of the circumstances to which it relates and to a certain other class it must ever remain incomprehensible from a defect of a common organ of perception for the ideas of which it treats not but that gran vergogna sarebbe a colui che rimasse cosa sotto veste di figura o di colore rettorico e domandato non sapesse denudare le sue parole da cotal veste in guisa che avessero verace intendimento the present poem appears to have been intended by the writer as the dedication to some longer one the stanza on the opposite page is almost a literal translation from dantes famous canzone voi ch intendendo il terzo ciel movete etc the presumptuous application of the concluding lines to his own composition will raise a smile at the expense of my unfortunate friend be it a smile not of contempt but pity s ie the nine lines which follow beginning my song i fear etc ed my song i fear that thou wilt find but few who fitly shalt conceive thy reasoning of such hard matter dost thou entertain whence if by misadventure chance should bring thee to base company as chance may do quite unaware of what thou dost contain i prithee comfort thy sweet self again my last delight tell them that they are dull and bid them own that thou art beautiful epipsychidion sweet spirit sister of that orphan one whose empire is the name thou weepest on in my hearts temple i suspend to thee these votive wreaths of withered memory poor captive bird who from thy narrow cage pourest such music that it might assuage the rugged hearts of those who prisoned thee were they not deaf to all sweet melody this song shall be thy rose its petals pale are dead indeed my adored nightingale but soft and fragrant is the faded blossom and it has no thorn left to wound thy bosom high spiritwinged heart who dost for ever beat thine unfeeling bars with vain endeavour till those bright plumes of thought in which arrayed it oversoared this low and worldly shade lie shattered and thy panting wounded breast stains with dear blood its unmaternal nest i weep vain tears blood would less bitter be yet poured forth gladlier could it profit thee seraph of heaven too gentle to be human veiling beneath that radiant form of woman all that is insupportable in thee of light and love and immortality sweet benediction in the eternal curse veiled glory of this lampless universe thou moon beyond the clouds thou living form among the dead thou star above the storm thou wonder and thou beauty and thou terror thou harmony of natures art thou mirror in whom as in the splendour of the sun all shapes look glorious which thou gazest on ay even the dim words which obscure thee now flash lightninglike with unaccustomed glow i pray thee that thou blot from this sad song all of its much mortality and wrong with those clear drops which start like sacred dew from the twin lights thy sweet soul darkens through weeping till sorrow becomes ecstasy then smile on it so that it may not die i never thought before my death to see youths vision thus made perfect emily i love thee though the world by no thin name will hide that love from its unvalued shame would we two had been twins of the same mother or that the name my heart lent to another could be a sisters bond for her and thee blending two beams of one eternity yet were one lawful and the other true these names though dear could paint not as is due how beyond refuge i am thine ah me i am not thine i am a part of thee sweet lamp my mothlike muse has burned its wings or like a dying swan who soars and sings young love should teach time in his own gray style all that thou art art thou not void of guile a lovely soul formed to be blessed and bless a well of sealed and secret happiness whose waters like blithe light and music are vanquishing dissonance and gloom a star which moves not in the moving heavens alone a smile amid dark frowns a gentle tone amid rude voices a beloved light a solitude a refuge a delight a lute which those whom love has taught to play make music on to soothe the roughest day and lull fond grief asleep a buried treasure a cradle of young thoughts of wingless pleasure a violetshrouded grave of woe i measure the world of fancies seeking one like thee and find alas mine own infirmity she met me stranger upon lifes rough way and lured me towards sweet death as night by day winter by spring or sorrow by swift hope led into light life peace an antelope in the suspended impulse of its lightness were less aethereally light the brightness of her divinest presence trembles through her limbs as underneath a cloud of dew embodied in the windless heaven of june amid the splendourwinged stars the moon burns inextinguishably beautiful and from her lips as from a hyacinth full of honeydew a liquid murmur drops killing the sense with passion sweet as stops of planetary music heard in trance in her mild lights the starry spirits dance the sunbeams of those wells which ever leap under the lightnings of the soul too deep for the brief fathomline of thought or sense the glory of her being issuing thence stains the dead blank cold air with a warm shade of unentangled intermixture made by love of light and motion one intense diffusion one serene omnipresence whose flowing outlines mingle in their flowing around her cheeks and utmost fingers glowing with the unintermitted blood which there quivers as in a fleece of snowlike air the crimson pulse of living morning quiver continuously prolonged and ending never till they are lost and in that beauty furled which penetrates and clasps and fills the world scarce visible from extreme loveliness warm fragrance seems to fall from her light dress and her loose hair and where some heavy tress the air of her own speed has disentwined the sweetness seems to satiate the faint wind and in the soul a wild odour is felt beyond the sense like fiery dews that melt into the bosom of a frozen bud see where she stands a mortal shape indued with love and life and light and deity and motion which may change but cannot die an image of some bright eternity a shadow of some golden dream a splendour leaving the third sphere pilotless a tender reflection of the eternal moon of love under whose motions lifes dull billows move a metaphor of spring and youth and morning a vision like incarnate april warning with smiles and tears frost the anatomy into his summer grave ah woe is me what have i dared where am i lifted how shall i descend and perish not i know that love makes all things equal i have heard by mine own heart this joyous truth averred the spirit of the worm beneath the sod in love and worship blends itself with god spouse sister angel pilot of the fate whose course has been so starless o too late beloved o too soon adored by me for in the fields of immortality my spirit should at first have worshipped thine a divine presence in a place divine or should have moved beside it on this earth a shadow of that substance from its birth but not as now i love thee yes i feel that on the fountain of my heart a seal is set to keep its waters pure and bright for thee since in those tears thou hast delight we are we not formed as notes of music are for one another though dissimilar such difference without discord as can make those sweetest sounds in which all spirits shake as trembling leaves in a continuous air thy wisdom speaks in me and bids me dare beacon the rocks on which high hearts are wrecked i never was attached to that great sect whose doctrine is that each one should select out of the crowd a mistress or a friend and all the rest though fair and wise commend to cold oblivion though it is in the code of modern morals and the beaten road which those poor slaves with weary footsteps tread who travel to their home among the dead by the broad highway of the world and so with one chained friend perhaps a jealous foe the dreariest and the longest journey go true love in this differs from gold and clay that to divide is not to take away love is like understanding that grows bright gazing on many truths tis like thy light imagination which from earth and sky and from the depths of human fantasy as from a thousand prisms and mirrors fills the universe with glorious beams and kills error the worm with many a sunlike arrow of its reverberated lightning narrow the heart that loves the brain that contemplates the life that wears the spirit that creates one object and one form and builds thereby a sepulchre for its eternity mind from its object differs most in this evil from good misery from happiness the baser from the nobler the impure and frail from what is clear and must endure if you divide suffering and dross you may diminish till it is consumed away if you divide pleasure and love and thought each part exceeds the whole and we know not how much while any yet remains unshared of pleasure may be gained of sorrow spared this truth is that deep well whence sages draw the unenvied light of hope the eternal law by which those live to whom this world of life is as a garden ravaged and whose strife tills for the promise of a later birth the wilderness of this elysian earth there was a being whom my spirit oft met on its visioned wanderings far aloft in the clear golden prime of my youths dawn upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn amid the enchanted mountains and the caves of divine sleep and on the airlike waves of wonderlevel dream whose tremulous floor paved her light steps on an imagined shore under the gray beak of some promontory she met me robed in such exceeding glory that i beheld her not in solitudes her voice came to me through the whispering woods and from the fountains and the odours deep of flowers which like lips murmuring in their sleep of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there breathed but of her to the enamoured air and from the breezes whether low or loud and from the rain of every passing cloud and from the singing of the summerbirds and from all sounds all silence in the words of antique verse and high romance in form sound colour in whatever checks that storm which with the shattered present chokes the past and in that best philosophy whose taste makes this cold common hell our life a doom as glorious as a fiery martyrdom her spirit was the harmony of truth then from the caverns of my dreamy youth i sprang as one sandalled with plumes of fire and towards the lodestar of my one desire i flitted like a dizzy moth whose flight is as a dead leafs in the owlet light when it would seek in hespers setting sphere a radiant death a fiery sepulchre as if it were a lamp of earthly flame but she whom prayers or tears then could not tame passed like a god throned on a winged planet whose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it into the dreary cone of our lifes shade and as a man with mighty loss dismayed i would have followed though the grave between yawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen when a voice said o thou of hearts the weakest the phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest then i where the worlds echo answered where and in that silence and in my despair i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectations breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me there one whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poison flame out of her looks into my vitals came and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honeydew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray oer a young brow they hid its unblown prime with ruins of unseasonable time in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought and some were fair but beauty dies away others were wise but honeyed words betray and one was true oh why not true to me then as a hunted deer that could not flee i turned upon my thoughts and stood at bay wounded and weak and panting the cold day trembled for pity of my strife and pain when like a noonday dawn there shone again deliverance one stood on my path who seemed as like the glorious shape which i had d reamed as is the moon whose changes ever run into themselves to the eternal sun the cold chaste moon the queen of heavens bright isles who makes all beautiful on which she smiles that wandering shrine of soft yet icy flame which ever is transformed yet still the same and warms not but illumines young and fair as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning oer endymion and i was laid asleep spirit and limb and all my being became bright or dim as the moons image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew and cried away he is not of our crew i wept and though it be a dream i weep what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept oer those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell into a death of ice immovable and then what earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words conceal if not each word would be the key of staunchless tears weep not for me at length into the obscure forest came the vision i had sought through grief and shame athwart that wintry wilderness of thorns flashed from her motion splendour like the morns and from her presence life was radiated through the gray earth and branches bare and dead so that her way was paved and roofed above with flowers as soft as thoughts of budding love and music from her respiration spread like light all other sounds were penetrated by the small still sweet spirit of that sound so that the savage winds hung mute around and odours warm and fresh fell from her hair dissolving the dull cold in the frore air soft as an incarnation of the sun when light is changed to love this glorious one floated into the cavern where i lay and called my spirit and the dreaming clay was lifted by the thing that dreamed below as smoke by fire and in her beautys glow i stood and felt the dawn of my long night was penetrating me with living light i knew it was the vision veiled from me so many years that it was emily twin spheres of light who rule this passive earth this world of loves this me and into birth awaken all its fruits and flowers and dart magnetic might into its central heart and lift its billows and its mists and guide by everlasting laws each wind and tide to its fit cloud and its appointed cave and lull its storms each in the craggy grave which was its cradle luring to faint bowers the armies of the rainbowwinged showers and as those married lights which from the towers of heaven look forth and fold the wandering globe in liquid sleep and splendour as a robe and all their manymingled influence blend if equal yet unlike to one sweet end so ye bright regents with alternate sway govern my sphere of being night and day thou not disdaining even a borrowed might thou not eclipsing a remoter light and through the shadow of the seasons three from spring to autumns sere maturity light it into the winter of the tomb where it may ripen to a brighter bloom thou too o comet beautiful and fierce who drew the heart of this frail universe towards thine own till wrecked in that convulsion alternating attraction and repulsion thine went astray and that was rent in twain oh float into our azure heaven again be there loves foldingstar at thy return the living sun will feed thee from its urn of golden fire the moon will veil her horn in thy last smiles adoring even and morn will worship thee with incense of calm breath and lights and shadows as the star of death and birth is worshipped by those sisters wild called hope and fear upon the heart are piled their offerings of this sacrifice divine a world shall be the altar lady mine scorn not these flowers of thought the fading birth which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth whose fruit made perfect by thy sunny eyes will be as of the trees of paradise the day is come and thou wilt fly with me to whatsoeer of dull mortality is mine remain a vestal sister still to the intense the deep the imperishable not mine but me henceforth be thou united even as a bride delighting and delighted the hour is come the destined star has risen which shall descend upon a vacant prison the walls are high the gates are strong thick set the sentinels but true love never yet was thus constrained it overleaps all fence like lightning with invisible violence piercing its continents like heavens free breath which he who grasps can hold not liker death who rides upon a thought and makes his way through temple tower and palace and the array of arms more strength has love than he or they for it can burst his charnel and make free the limbs in chains the heart in agony the soul in dust and chaos emily a ship is floating in the harbour now a wind is hovering oer the mountains brow there is a path on the seas azure floor no keel has ever ploughed that path before the halcyons brood around the foamless isles the treacherous ocean has forsworn its wiles the merry mariners are bold and free say my hearts sister wilt thou sail with me our bark is as an albatross whose nest is a far eden of the purple east and we between her wings will sit while night and day and storm and calm pursue their flight our ministers along the boundless sea treading each others heels unheededly it is an isle under ionian skies beautiful as a wreck of paradise and for the harbours are not safe and good this land would have remained a solitude but for some pastoral people native there who from the elysian clear and golden air draw the last spirit of the age of gold simple and spirited innocent and bold the blue aegean girds this chosen home with everchanging sound and light and foam kissing the sifted sands and caverns hoar and all the winds wandering along the shore undulate with the undulating tide there are thick woods where sylvan forms abide and many a fountain rivulet and pond as clear as elemental diamond or serene morning air and far beyond the mossy tracks made by the goats and deer which the rough shepherd treads but once a year pierce into glades caverns and bowers and halls built round with ivy which the waterfalls illumining with sound that never fails accompany the noonday nightingales and all the place is peopled with sweet airs the light clear element which the isle wears is heavy with the scent of lemonflowers which floats like mist laden with unseen showers and falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep and from the moss violets and jonquils peep and dart their arrowy odour through the brain till you might faint with that delicious pain and every motion odour beam and tone with that deep music is in unison which is a soul within the soul they seem like echoes of an antenatal dream it is an isle twixt heaven air earth and sea cradled and hung in clear tranquillity bright as that wandering eden lucifer washed by the soft blue oceans of young air it is a favoured place famine or blight pestilence war and earthquake never light upon its mountainpeaks blind vultures they sail onward far upon their fatal way the winged storms chanting their thunderpsalm to other lands leave azure chasms of calm over this isle or weep themselves in dew from which its fields and woods ever renew their green and golden immortality and from the sea there rise and from the sky there fall clear exhalations soft and bright veil after veil each hiding some delight which sun or moon or zephyr draw aside till the isles beauty like a naked bride glowing at once with love and loveliness blushes and trembles at its own excess yet like a buried lamp a soul no less burns in the heart of this delicious isle an atom of th eternal whose own smile unfolds itself and may be felt not seen oer the gray rocks blue waves and forests green filling their bare and void interstices but the chief marvel of the wilderness is a lone dwelling built by whom or how none of the rustic islandpeople know tis not a tower of strength though with its height it overtops the woods but for delight some wise and tender oceanking ere crime had been invented in the worlds young prime reared it a wonder of that simple time an envy of the isles a pleasurehouse made sacred to his sister and his spouse it scarce seems now a wreck of human art but as it were titanic in the heart of earth having assumed its form then grown out of the mountains from the living stone lifting itself in caverns light and high for all the antique and learned imagery has been erased and in the place of it the ivy and the wildvine interknit the volumes of their manytwining stems parasite flowers illume with dewy gems the lampless halls and when they fade the sky peeps through their winterwoof of tracery with moonlight patches or star atoms keen or fragments of the days intense serene working mosaic on their parian floors and day and night aloof from the high towers and terraces the earth and ocean seem to sleep in one anothers arms and dream of waves flowers clouds woods rocks and all that we read in their smiles and call reality this isle and house are mine and i have vowed thee to be lady of the solitude and i have fitted up some chambers there looking towards the golden eastern air and level with the living winds which flow like waves above the living waves below i have sent books and music there and all those instruments with which high spirits call the future from its cradle and the past out of its grave and make the present last in thoughts and joys which sleep but cannot die folded within their own eternity our simple life wants little and true taste hires not the pale drudge luxury to waste the scene it would adorn and therefore still nature with all her children haunts the hill the ringdove in the embowering ivy yet keeps up her lovelament and the owls flit round the evening tower and the young stars glance between the quick bats in their twilight dance the spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight before our gate and the slow silent night is measured by the pants of their calm sleep be this our home in life and when years heap their withered hours like leaves on our decay let us become the overhanging day the living soul of this elysian isle conscious inseparable one meanwhile we two will rise and sit and walk together under the roof of blue ionian weather and wander in the meadows or ascend the mossy mountains where the blue heavens bend with lightest winds to touch their paramour or linger where the pebblepaven shore under the quick faint kisses of the sea trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy possessing and possessed by all that is within that calm circumference of bliss and by each other till to love and live be one or at the noontide hour arrive where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep the moonlight of the expired night asleep through which the awakened day can never peep a veil for our seclusion close as nights where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights sleep the fresh dew of languid love the rain whose drops quench kisses till they burn again and we will talk until thoughts melody become too sweet for utterance and it die in words to live again in looks which dart with thrilling tone into the voiceless heart harmonizing silence without a sound our breath shall intermix our bosoms bound and our veins beat together and our lips with other eloquence than words eclipse the soul that burns between them and the wells which boil under our beings inmost cells the fountains of our deepest life shall be confused in passions golden purity as mountainsprings under the morning sun we shall become the same we shall be one spirit within two frames oh wherefore two one passion in twinhearts which grows and grew till like two meteors of expanding flame those spheres instinct with it become the same touch mingle are transfigured ever still burning yet ever inconsumable in one anothers substance finding food like flames too pure and light and unimbued to nourish their bright lives with baser prey which point to heaven and cannot pass away one hope within two wills one will beneath two overshadowing minds one life one death one heaven one hell one immortality and one annihilation woe is me the winged words on which my soul would pierce into the height of loves rare universe are chains of lead around its flight of fire i pant i sink i tremble i expire weak verses go kneel at your sovereigns feet and say we are the masters of thy slave what wouldest thou with us and ours and thine then call your

intimacy at florence brief indeed but sufficiently long to render the catastrophe by which it terminated one of the most painful events of his life the literary merit of the poem in question may not be considerable but worse verses are printed every day he was an accomplished amiable person but his error was thuntos on un thunta phronein his fate is an additional proof that the tree of knowledge is not that of life he had framed to himself certain opinions founded no doubt upon the truth of things but built up to a babel height they fell by their own weight the thoughts that were his architects became unintelligible one to the other as men upon whom confusion of tongues has fallen these verses seem to have been written as a sort of dedication of some work to have been presented to the person whom they address but his papers afford no trace of such a work the circumstances to which they the poem allude may easily be understood by those to whom the spirit of the poem itself is

looking youth to whom he shewed an attachment so singular excessive an attachment as to give rise to the suspicion that she was a woman at his death this suspicion was confirmedobject speedily found a refuge both from the taunts of the brute multitude and from theof her grief in the same grave that contained her lover he had bought one of the sporades fitted up a saracenic castle which accident had preserved in some repair with simple elegance it was his intention to dedicate the remainder of his life to undisturbed intercourse with his companions these verses apparently were intended as a dedication of a longer poem or series of poems preface the writer of these lines died at florence in january while he was preparing for one wildest of the of the sporades where he bought fitted up the ruins of some old building his life was singular less on account of the romantic vicissitudes which diversified it than the ideal tinge which they received from his own character feelings the verses

ever to remain incomprehensible it was evidently intended to be prefixed to a longer poem or series of poems but among his papers there are no traces of such a collection passages of the poem or connected therewith here my dear friend is a new book for you i have already dedicated two to other friends one female and one male what you are is a thing that i must veil what can this be to those who praise or rail i never was attached to that great sect whose doctrine is that each one should select out of the world a mistress or a friend and all the rest though fair and wise commend to cold oblivion though tis in the code of modern morals and the beaten road which those poor slaves with weary footsteps tread who travel to their home among the dead by the broad highway of the world and so with one sad friend and many a jealous foe the dreariest and the longest journey go free love has this different from gold and clay that to divide is not to take away like ocean which the general north wind breaks into ten thousand waves and each one makes a mirror of the moon like some great glass which did distort whatever form might pass dashed into fragments by a playful child which then reflects its eyes and forehead mild giving for one which it could neer express a thousand images of loveliness if i were one whom the loud world held wise i should disdain to quote authorities in commendation of this kind of love why there is first the god in heaven above who wrote a book called nature tis to be reviewed i hear in the next quarterly and socrates the jesus christ of greece and jesus christ himself did never cease to urge all living things to love each other and to forgive their mutual faults and smother the devil of disunion in their souls i love you listen o embodied ray of the great brightness i must pass away while you remain and these light words must be tokens by which you may remember me start not the thing you are is unbetrayed if you are human and if but the shade of some sublimer spirit and as to friend or mistress tis a form perhaps i wish you were one some declare you a familiar spirit as you are others with a more inhuman hint that though not my wife you are a woman what is the colour of your eyes and hair why if you were a lady it were fair the world should know but as i am afraid the quarterly would bait you if betrayed and if as it will be sport to see them stumble over all sorts of scandals hear them mumble their litany of curses some guess right and others swear youre a hermaphrodite like that sweet marble monster of both sexes which looks so sweet and gentle that it vexes the very soul that the soul is gone which lifted from her limbs the veil of stone it is a sweet thing friendship a dear balm a happy and auspicious bird of calm which rides oer lifes ever tumultuous ocean a god that broods oer chaos in commotion a flower which fresh as lapland roses are lifts its bold head into the worlds frore air and blooms most radiantly

gloom a star which moves not mid the moving heavens alone a smile among dark frowns a gentle tone among rude voices a beloved light a solitude a refuge a delight if i had but a friend why i have three even by my own confession there may be some more for what i know for tis my mind to call my friends all who are wise and kind and these heaven knows at best are very few but none can ever be more dear than you why should they be my muse has lost her wings or like a dying swan who soars and sings i should describe you in heroic style but as it is are you not void of guile a lovely soul formed to be blessed and bless a well of sealed and secret happiness a lute which those whom love has taught to play make music on to cheer the roughest day and enchant sadness till it sleeps to the oblivion

into the bosom of the earth and rise again and in our death and birth and through our restless life take as from heaven hues which are not our own but which are given and then withdrawn and with inconstant glance flash from the spirit to the countenance there is a power a love a joy a god which makes in mortal hearts its brief abode a pythian exhalation which inspires love only love a wind which oer the wires of the souls giant harp there is a mood which language faints beneath you feel it striding as almighty death his bloodless steed and what is that most brief and bright delight which rushes through the touch and through the sight and stands before the spirits inmost throne a naked seraph none hath ever known its birth is darkness and its growth desire untameable and fleet and fierce as fire not to be touched but to be felt alone it fills the world with gloryand is gone it floats with rainbow pinions oer the stream of life which flows like a dream into the light of morning to the grave as to an ocean what is that joy which serene infancy perceives not as the hours content them by each in a chain of blossoms yet enjoys the shapes of this new world in giant toys wrought by the busy ever new remembrance borrows fancys glass to show these forms more sincere than now they are than then perhaps they were when everything familiar seemed to be wonderful and the immortality of this great world which all things must inherit was felt as one with the awakening spirit unconscious of itself and of the strange distinctions which in its proceeding change it feels

pharmakon ekphugen odan moschus epitaph bion it is my intention to subjoin to the london edition of this poem a criticism upon the claims of its lamented object to be classed among the writers of the highest genius who have adorned our age my known repugnance to the narrow principles of taste on which several of his earlier compositions were modelled prove at least that i am an impartial judge i consider the fragment of hyperion as second to nothing that was ever produced by a writer of the same years john keats died at rome of a consumption in his twentyfourth year on the of and was buried in the romantic and lonely cemetery of the protestants in that city under the pyramid which is the tomb of cestius and the massy walls and towers now mouldering and desolate which formed the circuit of ancient rome the cemetery is an open space among the ruins covered in winter with violets and daisies it might make one in love with death to think that one should be buried in so sweet a place the genius of the lamented person to whose memory i have dedicated these unworthy verses was not less delicate and fragile than it was beautiful and where cankerworms abound what wonder if its young flower was blighted in the bud the savage criticism on his endymion which appeared in the quarterly review produced the most violent effect on his susceptible mind the agitation thus originated ended in the rupture of a bloodvessel in the lungs a rapid consumption ensued and the succeeding acknowledgements from more candid critics of the true greatness of his powers were ineffectual to heal the wound thus wantonly inflicted it may be well said that these wretched men know not what they do they scatter their insults and their slanders without heed as to whether the poisoned shaft lights on a heart made callous by many blows or one like keatss composed of more penetrable stuff one of their associates is to my knowledge a most base and unprincipled calumniator as to endymion was it a poem whatever might be its defects to be treated contemptuously by those who had celebrated with various degrees of complacency and panegyric paris and woman and a syrian tale and mrs lefanu and mr barrett and mr howard payne and a long list of the illustrious obscure are these the men who in their venal good nature presumed to draw a parallel between the reverend mr milman and lord byron what gnat did they strain at here after having swallowed all those camels against what woman taken in adultery dares the foremost of these literary prostitutes to cast his opprobrious stone miserable man you one of the meanest have wantonly defaced one of the noblest specimens of the workmanship of god nor shall it be your excuse that murderer as you are you have spoken daggers but used none the circumstances of the closing scene of poor keatss life were not made known to me until the elegy was ready for the press i am given to understand that the wound which his sensitive spirit had received from the criticism of endymion was exasperated by the bitter sense of unrequited benefits the poor fellow seems to have been hooted from the stage of life no less by those on whom he had wasted the promise of his genius than those on whom he had lavished his fortune and his care he was accompanied to rome and attended in his last illness by mr severn a young artist of the highest promise who i have been informed almost risked his own life and sacrificed every prospect to unwearied attendance upon his dying friend had i known these circumstances before the completion of my poem i should have been tempted to add my feeble tribute of applause to the more solid recompense which the virtuous man finds in the recollection of his own motives mr severn can dispense with a reward from such stuff as dreams are made of his conduct is a golden augury of the success of his future career may the unextinguished spirit of his illustrious friend animate the creations of his pencil and plead against oblivion for his name adonais i weep for adonais he is dead o weep for adonais though our tears thaw not the frost which binds so dear a head and thou sad hour selected from all years to mourn our loss rouse thy obscure compeers and teach them thine own sorrow say with me died adonais till the future dares forget the past his fate and fame shall be an echo and a light unto eternity where wert thou mighty mother when he lay when thy son lay pierced by the shaft which flies in darkness where was lorn urania when adonais died with veiled eyes mid listening echoes in her paradise she sate while one with soft enamoured breath rekindled all the fading melodies with which like flowers that mock the corse beneath he had adorned and hid the coming bulk of death oh weep for adonais he is dead wake melancholy mother wake and weep yet wherefore quench within their burning bed thy fiery tears and let thy loud heart keep like his a mute and uncomplaining sleep for he is gone where all things wise and fair descend oh dream not that the amorous deep will yet restore him to the vital air death feeds on his mute voice and laughs at our despair most musical of mourners weep again lament anew urania he died who was the sire of an immortal strain blind old and lonely when his countrys pride the priest the slave and the liberticide trampled and mocked with many a loathed rite of lust and blood he went unterrified into the gulf of death but his clear sprite yet reigns oer earth the third among the sons of light most musical of mourners weep anew not all to that bright station dared to climb and happier they their happiness who knew whose tapers yet burn through that night of time in which suns perished others more sublime struck by the envious wrath of man or god have sunk extinct in their refulgent prime and some yet live treading the thorny road which leads through toil and hate to fames serene abode but now thy youngest dearest one has perished the nursling of thy widowhood who grew like a pale flower by some sad maiden cherished and fed with truelove tears instead of dew most musical of mourners weep anew thy extreme hope the loveliest and the last the bloom whose petals nipped before they blew died on the promise of the fruit is waste the broken lily lies the storm is overpast to that high capital where kingly death keeps his pale court in beauty and decay he came and bought with price of purest breath a grave among the eternal come away haste while the vault of blue italian day is yet his fitting charnelroof while still he lies as if in dewy sleep he lay awake him not surely he takes his fill of deep and liquid rest forgetful of all ill he will awake no more oh never more within the twilight chamber spreads apace the shadow of white death and at the door invisible corruption waits to trace his extreme way to her dim dwellingplace the eternal hunger sits but pity and awe soothe her pale rage nor dares she to deface so fair a prey till darkness and the law of change shall oer his sleep the mortal curtain draw oh weep for adonais the quick dreams the passionwinged ministers of thought who were his flocks whom near the living streams of his young spirit he fed and whom he taught the love which was its music wander not wander no more from kindling brain to brain but droop there whence they sprung and mourn their lot round the cold heart where after their sweet pain they neer will gather strength or find a home again and one with trembling hands clasps his cold head and fans him with her moonlight wings and cries our love our hope our sorrow is not dead see on the silken fringe of his faint eyes like dew upon a sleeping flower there lies a tear some dream has loosened from his brain lost angel of a ruined paradise she knew not twas her own as with no stain she faded like a cloud which had outwept its rain one from a lucid urn of starry dew washed his light limbs as if embalming them another clipped her profuse locks and threw the wreath upon him like an anadem which frozen tears instead of pearls begem another in her wilful grief would break her bow and winged reeds as if to stem a greater loss with one which was more weak and dull the barbed fire against his frozen cheek another splendour on his mouth alit that mouth whence it was wont to draw the breath which gave it strength to pierce the guarded wit and pass into the panting heart beneath with lightning and with music the damp death quenched its caress upon his icy lips and as a dying meteor stains a wreath of moonlight vapour which the cold night clips it flushed through his pale limbs and passed to its eclipse and others camedesires and adorations winged persuasions and veiled destinies splendours and glooms and glimmering incarnations of hopes and fears and twilight phantasies and sorrow with her family of sighs and pleasure blind with tears led by the gleam of her own dying smile instead of eyes came in slow pomp the moving pomp might seem like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream all he had loved and moulded into thought from shape and hue and odour and sweet sound lamented adonais morning sought her eastern watchtower and her hair unbound wet with the tears which should adorn the ground dimmed the aereal eyes that kindle day afar the melancholy thunder moaned pale ocean in unquiet slumber lay and the wild winds flew round sobbing in their dismay lost echo sits amid the voiceless mountains and feeds her grief with his remembered lay and will no more reply to winds or fountains or amorous birds perched on the young green spray or herdsmans horn or bell at closing day since she can mimic not his lips more dear than those for whose disdain she pined away into a shadow of all sounds a drear murmur between their songs is all the woodmen hear grief made the young spring wild and she threw down her kindling buds as if she autumn were or they dead leaves since her delight is flown for whom should she have waked the sullen year to phoebus was not hyacinth so dear nor to himself narcissus as to both thou adonais wan they stand and sere amid the faint companions of their youth with dew all turned to tears odour to sighing ruth thy spirits sister the lorn nightingale mourns not her mate with such melodious pain not so the eagle who like thee could scale heaven and could nourish in the suns domain her mighty youth with morning doth complain soaring and screaming round her empty nest as albion wails for thee the curse of cain light on his head who pierced thy innocent breast and scared the angel soul that was its earthly guest ah woe is me winter is come and gone but grief returns with the revolving year the airs and streams renew their joyous tone the ants the bees the swallows reappear fresh leaves and flowers deck the dead seasons bier the amorous birds now pair in every brake and build their mossy homes in field and brere and the green lizard and the golden snake like unimprisoned flames out of their trance awake through wood and stream and field and hill and ocean a quickening life from the earths heart has burst as it has ever done with change and motion from the great morning of the world when first god dawned on chaos in its stream immersed the lamps of heaven flash with a softer light all baser things pant with lifes sacred thirst diffuse themselves and spend in loves delight the beauty and the joy of their renewed might the leprous corpse touched by this spirit tender exhales itself in flowers of gentle breath like incarnations of the stars when splendour is changed to fragrance they illumine death and mock the merry worm that wakes beneath nought we know dies shall that alone which knows be as a sword consumed before the sheath by sightless lightning the intense atom glows a moment then is quenched in a most cold repose alas that all we loved of him should be but for our grief as if it had not been and grief itself be mortal woe is me whence are we and why are we of what scene the actors or spectators great and mean meet massed in death who lends what life must borrow as long as skies are blue and fields are green evening must usher night night urge the morrow month follow month with woe and year wake year to sorrow he will awake no more oh never more wake thou cried misery childless mother rise out of thy sleep and slake in thy hearts core a wound more fierce than his with tears and sighs and all the dreams that watched uranias eyes and all the echoes whom their sisters song had held in holy silence cried arise swift as a thought by the snake memory stung from her ambrosial rest the fading splendour sprung she rose like an autumnal night that springs out of the east and follows wild and drear the golden day which on eternal wings even as a ghost abandoning a bier had left the earth a corpse sorrow and fear so struck so roused so rapped urania so saddened round her like an atmosphere of stormy mist so swept her on her way even to the mournful place where adonais lay out of her secret paradise she sped through camps and cities rough with stone and steel and human hearts which to her aery tread yielding not wounded the invisible palms of her tender feet whereer they fell and barbed tongues and thoughts more sharp than they rent the soft form they never could repel whose sacred blood like the young tears of may paved with eternal flowers that undeserving way in the deathchamber for a moment death shamed by the presence of that living might blushed to annihilation and the breath revisited those lips and lifes pale light flashed through those limbs so late her dear delight leave me not wild and drear and comfortless as silent lightning leaves the starless night leave me not cried urania her distress roused death death rose and smiled and met her vain caress stay yet awhile speak to me once again kiss me so long but as a kiss may live and in my heartless breast and burning brain that word that kiss shall all thoughts else survive with food of saddest memory kept alive now thou art dead as if it were a part of thee my adonais i would give all that i am to be as thou now art but i am chained to time and cannot thence depart o gentle child beautiful as thou wert why didst thou leave the trodden paths of men too soon and with weak hands though mighty heart dare the unpastured dragon in his den defenceless as thou wert oh where was then wisdom the mirrored shield or scorn the spear or hadst thou waited the full cycle when thy spirit should have filled its crescent sphere the monsters of lifes waste had fled from thee like deer the herded wolves bold only to pursue the obscene ravens clamorous oer the dead the vultures to the conquerors banner true who feed where desolation first has fed and whose wings rain contagion how they fled when like apollo from his golden bow the pythian of the age one arrow sped and smiled the spoilers tempt no second blow they fawn on the proud feet that spurn them lying low the sun comes forth and many reptiles spawn he sets and each ephemeral insect then is gathered into death without a dawn and the immortal stars awake again so is it in the world of living men a godlike mind soars forth in its delight making earth bare and veiling heaven and when it sinks the swarms that dimmed or shared its light leave to its kindred lamps the spirits awful night thus ceased she and the mountain shepherds came their garlands sere their magic mantles rent the pilgrim of eternity whose fame over his living head like heaven is bent an early but enduring monument came veiling all the lightnings of his song in sorrow from her wilds ierne sent the sweetest lyrist of her saddest wrong and love taught grief to fall like music from his tongue midst others of less note came one frail form a phantom among men companionless as the last cloud of an expiring storm whose thunder is its knell he as i guess had gazed on natures naked loveliness actaeonlike and now he fled astray with feeble steps oer the worlds wilderness and his own thoughts along that rugged way pursued like raging hounds their father and their prey a pardlike spirit beautiful and swift a love in desolation masked a power girt round with weakness it can scarce uplift the weight of the superincumbent hour it is a dying lamp a falling shower a breaking billow even whilst we speak is it not broken on the withering flower the killing sun smiles brightly on a cheek the life can burn in blood even while the heart may break his head was bound with pansies overblown and faded violets white and pied and blue and a light spear topped with a cypress cone round whose rude shaft dark ivytresses grew yet dripping with the forests noonday dew vibrated as the everbeating heart shook the weak hand that grasped it of that crew he came the last neglected and apart a herdabandoned deer struck by the hunters dart all stood aloof and at his partial moan smiled through their tears well knew that gentle band who in anothers fate now wept his own as in the accents of an unknown land he sung new sorrow sad urania scanned the strangers mien and murmured who art thou he answered not but with a sudden hand made bare his branded and ensanguined brow which was like cains or christs oh that it should be so what softer voice is hushed over the dead athwart what brow is that dark mantle thrown what form leans sadly oer the white deathbed in mockery of monumental stone the heavy heart heaving without a moan if it be he who gentlest of the wise taught soothed loved honoured the departed one let me not vex with inharmonious sighs the silence of that hearts accepted sacrifice our adonais has drunk poison oh what deaf and viperous murderer could crown lifes early cup with such a draught of woe the nameless worm would now itself disown it felt yet could escape the magic tone whose prelude held all envy hate and wrong but what was howling in one breast alone silent with expectation of the song whose masters hand is cold whose silver lyre unstrung live thou whose infamy is not thy fame live fear no heavier chastisement from me thou noteless blot on a remembered name but be thyself and know thyself to be and ever at thy season be thou free to spill the venom when thy fangs oerflow remorse and selfcontempt shall cling to thee hot shame shall burn upon thy secret brow and like a beaten hound tremble thou shalt as now nor let us weep that our delight is fled far from these carrion kites that scream below he wakes or sleeps with the enduring dead thou canst not soar where he is sitting now dust to the dust but the pure spirit shall flow back to the burning fountain whence it came a portion of the eternal which must glow through time and change unquenchably the same whilst thy cold embers choke the sordid hearth of shame peace peace he is not dead he doth not sleep he hath awakened from the dream of life tis we who lost in stormy visions keep with phantoms an unprofitable strife and in mad trance strike with our spirits knife invulnerable nothings we decay like corpses in a charnel fear and grief convulse us and consume us day by day and cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay he has outsoared the shadow of our night envy and calumny and hate and pain and that unrest which men miscall delight can touch him not and torture not again from the contagion of the worlds slow stain he is secure and now can never mourn a heart grown cold a head grown gray in vain nor when the spirits self has ceased to burn with sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn he lives he wakes tis death is dead not he mourn not for adonais thou young dawn turn all thy dew to splendour for from thee the spirit thou lamentest is not gone ye caverns and ye forests cease to moan cease ye faint flowers and fountains and thou air which like a mourning veil thy scarf hadst thrown oer the abandoned earth now leave it bare even to the joyous stars which smile on its despair he is made one with nature there is heard his voice in all her music from the moan of thunder to the song of nights sweet bird he is a presence to be felt and known in darkness and in light from herb and stone spreading itself whereer that power may move which has withdrawn his being to its own which wields the world with neverwearied love sustains it from beneath and kindles it above he is a portion of the loveliness which once he made more lovely he doth bear his part while the one spirits plastic stress sweeps through the dull dense world compelling there all new successions to the forms they wear torturing th unwilling dross that checks its flight to its own likeness as each mass may bear and bursting in its beauty and its might from trees and beasts and men into the heavens light the splendours of the firmament of time may be eclipsed but are extinguished not like stars to their appointed height they climb and death is a low mist which cannot blot the brightness it may veil when lofty thought lifts a young heart above its mortal lair and love and life contend in it for what shall be its earthly doom the dead live there and move like winds of light on dark and stormy air the inheritors of unfulfilled renown rose from their thrones built beyond mortal thought far in the unapparent chatterton rose pale his solemn agony had not yet faded from him sidney as he fought and as he fell and as he lived and loved sublimely mild a spirit without spot arose and lucan by his death approved oblivion as they rose shrank like a thing reproved and many more whose names on earth are dark but whose transmitted effluence cannot die so long as fire outlives the parent spark rose robed in dazzling immortality thou art become as one of us they cry it was for thee yon kingless sphere has long swung blind in unascended majesty silent alone amid a heaven of song assume thy winged throne thou vesper of our throng who mourns for adonais oh come forth fond wretch and know thyself and him aright clasp with thy panting soul the pendulous earth as from a centre dart thy spirits light beyond all worlds until its spacious might satiate the void circumference then shrink even to a point within our day and night and keep thy heart light lest it make thee sink when hope has kindled hope and lured thee to the brink or go to rome which is the sepulchre oh not of him but of our joy tis nought that ages empires and religions there lie buried in the ravage they have wrought for such as he can lend they borrow not glory from those who made the world their prey and he is gathered to the kings of thought who waged contention with their times decay and of the past are all that cannot pass away go thou to rome at once the paradise the grave the city and the wilderness and where its wrecks like shattered mountains rise and flowering weeds and fragrant copses dress the bones of desolations nakedness pass till the spirit of the spot shall lead thy footsteps to a slope of green access where like an infants smile over the dead a light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread and gray walls moulder round on which dull time feeds like slow fire upon a hoary brand and one keen pyramid with wedge sublime pavilioning the dust of him who planned this refuge for his memory doth stand like flame transformed to marble and beneath a field is spread on which a newer band have pitched in heavens smile their camp of death welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguished breath here pause these graves are all too young as yet to have outgrown the sorrow which consigned its charge to each and if the seal is set here on one fountain of a mourning mind break it not thou too surely shalt thou find thine own well full if thou returnest home of tears and gall from the worlds bitter wind seek shelter in the shadow of the tomb what adonais is why fear we to become the one remains the many change and pass heavens light forever shines earths shadows fly life like a dome of manycoloured glass stains the white radiance of eternity until death tramples it to fragments die if thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek follow where all is fled romes azure sky flowers ruins statues music words are weak the glory they transfuse with fitting truth to speak why linger why turn back why shrink my heart thy hopes are gone before from all things here they have departed thou shouldst now depart a light is passed from the revolving year and man and woman and what still is dear attracts to crush repels to make thee wither the soft sky smiles the low wind whispers near tis adonais calls oh hasten thither no more let life divide what death can join together that light whose smile kindles the universe that beauty in which all things work and move that benediction which the eclipsing curse of birth can quench not that sustaining love which through the web of being blindly wove by man and beast and earth and air and sea burns bright or dim as each are mirrors of the fire for which all thirst now beams on me consuming the last clouds of cold mortality the breath whose might i have invoked in song descends on me my spirits bark is driven far from the shore far from the trembling throng whose sails were never to the tempest given the massy earth and sphered skies are riven i am borne darkly fearfully afar whilst burning

compositions and publications simply as the instruments of that sympathy between myself and others which the ardent and unbounded love i cherished for my kind incited me to acquire i expected all sorts of stupidity and insolent contempt from those these compositions excepting the tragedy of the cenci which was written rather to try my powers than to unburthen my full heart are

some rare exceptions are a most stupid and malignant race as a bankrupt thief turns thieftaker in despair so an unsuccessful author turns critic but a young spirit panting for fame doubtful of its powers and certain only of its aspirations is ill qualified to assign its true value to the sneer of this world he knows not that such stuff as this is of the abortive and monstrous births which time consumes as fast as it produces he sees the truth and falsehood the merits and demerits of his case inextricably entangledno personal offence should have drawn from me this public comment upon such

skull to crack and will take a deal of killing i do not know much of mr hazlitt but i knew personally but little of keats but on the news of his situation i wrote to him suggesting the propriety of trying the italian climate and inviting him to join me unfortunately he did not allow me passages of the poem and ever as he went he swept a lyre of unaccustomed shape and strings now like the of impetuous fire which shakes the forest with its murmurings now like the rush of the aereal wings of the enamoured wind among the treen whispering unimaginable things and dying on the streams of dew serene which feed the unmown meads with everduring green and the green paradise which western waves embosom in their everwailing sweep talking of freedom to their tongueless caves or to the spirits

looks whose soft smiles to his dark and nightlike eyes were as the clear and everliving brooks are to the obscure fountains whence they rise showing how pure they are a paradise of happy truth upon his forehead low lay making wisdom lovely in the guise of earthawakening morn upon the brow of stardeserted heaven while ocean gleams below his song though very sweet was low and faint a simple strain

lyrical drama mantis eim ezthlon agonun oedip colon hellas was composed at pisa in the autumn of and dispatched to london november it was published with the authors name by c j ollier in the spring of a transcript of the poem by edward williams is in the rowfant library ollier availed himself of shelleys permission to cancel certain passages in the notes he also struck out certain lines of the text these omissions were some of them restored in galignanis onevolume edition of coleridge shelley and keats paris and also by mrs shelley in the poetical works a passage in the preface suppressed by ollier was restored by mr buxton forman from a proof copy of hellas in his possession the prologue to hellas was edited by dr garnett in relics of shelley from the manuscripts at boscombe manor our text is that of the editio princeps corrected by a list of errata sent by shelley to ollier april the editors notes at the end of volume should be consulted to his excellency prince alexander mavrocordato late secretary for foreign affairs to the hospodar of wallachia the drama of hellas is inscribed as an imperfect token of the admiration sympathy and friendship of the author pisa november preface the poem of hellas written at the suggestion of the events of the moment is a mere improvise and derives its interest should it be found to possess any solely from the intense sympathy which the author feels with the cause he would celebrate the subject in its present state is insusceptible of being treated otherwise than lyrically and if i have called this poem a drama from the circumstance of its being composed in dialogue the licence is not greater than that which has been assumed by other poets who have called their productions epics only because they have been divided into twelve or twentyfour books the persae of aeschylus afforded me the first model of my conception although the decision of the glorious contest now waging in greece being yet suspended forbids a catastrophe parallel to the return of xerxes and the desolation of the persians i have therefore contented myself with exhibiting a series of lyric pictures and with having wrought upon the curtain of futurity which falls upon the unfinished scene such figures of indistinct and visionary delineation as suggest the final triumph of the greek cause as a portion of the cause of civilisation and social improvement the drama if drama it must be called is however so inartificial that i doubt whether if recited on the thespian waggon to an athenian village at the dionysiaca it would have obtained the prize of the goat i shall bear with equanimity any punishment greater than the loss of such a reward which the aristarchi of the hour may think fit to inflict the only goatsong which i have yet attempted has i confess in spite of the unfavourable nature of the subject received a greater and a more valuable portion of applause than i expected or than it deserved common fame is the only authority which i can allege for the details which form the basis of the poem and i must trespass upon the forgiveness of my readers for the display of newspaper erudition to which i have been reduced undoubtedly until the conclusion of the war it will be impossible to obtain an account of it sufficiently authentic for historical materials but poets have their privilege and it is unquestionable that actions of the most exalted courage have been performed by the greeks that they have gained more than one naval victory and that their defeat in wallachia was signalized by circumstances of heroism more glorious even than victory the apathy of the rulers of the civilised world to the astonishing circumstance of the descendants of that nation to which they owe their civilisation rising as it were from the ashes of their ruin is something perfectly inexplicable to a mere spectator of the shows of this mortal scene we are all greeks our laws our literature our religion our arts have their root in greece but for greece rome the instructor the conqueror or the metropolis of our ancestors would have spread no illumination with her arms and we might still have been savages and idolaters or what is worse might have arrived at such a stagnant and miserable state of social institution as china and japan possess the human form and the human mind attained to a perfection in greece which has impressed its image on those faultless productions whose very fragments are the despair of modern art and has propagated impulses which cannot cease through a thousand channels of manifest or imperceptible operation to ennoble and delight mankind until the extinction of the race the modern greek is the descendant of those glorious beings whom the imagination almost refuses to figure to itself as belonging to our kind and he inherits much of their sensibility their rapidity of conception their enthusiasm and their courage if in many instances he is degraded by moral and political slavery to the practice of the basest vices it engenders and that below the level of ordinary degradation let us reflect that the corruption of the best produces the worst and that habits which subsist only in relation to a peculiar state of social institution may be expected to cease as soon as that relation is dissolved in fact the greeks since the admirable novel of anastasius could have been a faithful picture of their manners have undergone most important changes the flower of their youth returning to their country from the universities of italy germany and france have communicated to their fellowcitizens the latest results of that social perfection of which their ancestors were the original source the university of chios contained before the breaking out of the revolution eight hundred students and among them several germans and americans the munificence and energy of many of the greek princes and merchants directed to the renovation of their country with a spirit and a wisdom which has few examples is above all praise the english permit their own oppressors to act according to their natural sympathy with the turkish tyrant and to brand upon their name the indelible blot of an alliance with the enemies of domestic happiness of christianity and civilisation russia desires to possess not to liberate greece and is contented to see the turks its natural enemies and the greeks its intended slaves enfeeble each other until one or both fall into its net the wise and generous policy of england would have consisted in establishing the independence of greece and in maintaining it both against russia and the turk but when was the oppressor generous or just should the english people ever become free they will reflect upon the part which those who presume to represent their will have played in the great drama of the revival of liberty with feelings which it would become them to anticipate this is the age of the war of the oppressed against the oppressors and every one of those ringleaders of the privileged gangs of murderers and swindlers called sovereigns look to each other for aid against the common enemy and suspend their mutual jealousies in the presence of a mightier fear of this holy alliance all the despots of the earth are virtual members but a new race has arisen throughout europe nursed in the abhorrence of the opinions which are its chains and she will continue to produce fresh generations to accomplish that destiny which tyrants foresee and dread this paragraph suppressed in by charles ollier was first restored in by mr buxton forman poetical works of p b s volume pages from a proof copy of hellas in his possession the spanish peninsula is already free france is tranquil in the enjoyment of a

chorus as true in their relation to the worship they superseded and that which in all probability they will supersede without considering their merits in a relation more universal the first stanza contrasts the immortality of the living and thinking beings which inhabit the planets and to use a common and inadequate phrase clothe themselves in matter with the transience of the noblest manifestations of the external world the concluding verses indicate a progressive state of more or loss exalted existence according to the degree of perfection which every distinct intelligence may have attained let it not be supposed that i mean to dogmatise upon a subject concerning which all men are equally ignorant or that i think the gordian knot of the origin of evil can be disentangled by that or any similar assertions the received hypothesis of a being resembling men in the moral attributes of his nature having called us out of nonexistence and after inflicting on us the misery of the commission of error should superadd that of the punishment and the privations consequent upon it still would remain inexplicable and incredible that there is a true solution of the riddle and that in our present state that solution is unattainable by us are propositions which may be regarded as equally certain meanwhile as it is the province of the poet to attach himself to those ideas which exalt and ennoble humanity let him be permitted to have conjectured the condition of that futurity towards which we are all impelled by an inextinguishable thirst for immortality until better arguments can be produced than sophisms which disgrace the cause this desire itself must remain the strongest and the only presumption that eternity is the inheritance of every thinking being no hoary priests after that patriarch l the greek patriarch after haying been compelled to fulminate an anathema against the insurgents was put to death by the turks fortunately the greeks have been taught that they cannot buy security by degradation and the turks though equally cruel are less cunning than the smoothfaced tyrants of europe as to the anathema his holiness might as well have thrown his mitre at mount

which ideas may be supposed to assume the force of sensations through the confusion of thought with the objects of thought and the excess of passion animating the creations of imagination it is a sort of natural magic susceptible of being exercised in a degree by any one who should have made himself master of the secret associations of anothers thoughts the chorus l the final chorus is indistinct and obscure as the event of the living drama whose arrival it foretells prophecies of wars and rumours of wars etc may safely be made by poet or prophet in any age but to anticipate however darkly a period of regeneration and happiness is a more hazardous exercise of the faculty which bards possess or feign it will remind the reader magno nec proximus intervallo of isaiah and virgil whose ardent

or the monstrous objects of the idolatry of china india the antarctic islands and the native tribes of america certainly have reigned over the understandings of men in conjunction or in succession during periods in which all we know of evil has been in a state of portentous and until the revival of learning and the arts perpetually increasing activity the grecian gods seem indeed to have been personally more innocent although it cannot be said that as far as temperance and chastity are concerned they gave so edifying an example as their successor the sublime human character of jesus christ was deformed by an imputed identification with a power who tempted betrayed and punished the innocent beings who were called into existence by his sole will and for the period of a thousand years the spirit of this most just wise and benevolent of men has been propitiated with myriads of hecatombs of those who approached the nearest to his innocence and wisdom sacrificed under every aggravation of atrocity and variety of torture the horrors of the mexican the peruvian and the indian superstitions are well known note on hellas by mrs shelley the south of europe was in a state of great political excitement at the beginning of the year the spanish revolution had been a signal to italy secrete societies were formed and when naples rose to declare the constitution the call was responded to from brundusium to the foot of the alps to crush these attempts to obtain liberty early in the austrians poured their armies into the peninsula at first their coming rather seemed to add energy and resolution to a people long enslaved the piedmontese asserted their freedom genoa threw off the yoke of the king of sardinia and as if in playful imitation the people of the little state of massa and carrara gave the conge to their sovereign and set up a republic tuscany alone was perfectly tranquil it was said that the austrian minister presented a list of sixty carbonari to the grand duke urging their imprisonment and the grand duke replied i do not know whether these sixty men are carbonari but i know if i imprison them i shall directly have sixty thousand start up but though the tuscans had no desire to disturb the paternal government beneath whose shelter they slumbered they regarded the progress of the various italian revolutions with intense interest and hatred for the austrian was warm in every bosom but they had slender hopes they knew that the neapolitans would offer no fit resistance to the regular german troops and that the overthrow of the constitution in naples would act as a decisive blow against all struggles for liberty in italy we have seen the rise and progress of reform but the holy alliance was alive and active in those days and few could dream of the peaceful triumph of liberty it seemed then that the armed assertion of freedom in the south of europe was the only hope of the liberals as if it prevailed the nations of the north would imitate the example happily the reverse has proved the fact the countries accustomed to the exercise of the privileges of freemen to a limited extent have extended and are extending these limits freedom and knowledge have now a chance of proceeding hand in hand and if it continue thus we may hope for the durability of both then as i have said in shelley as well as every other lover of liberty looked upon the struggles in spain and italy as decisive of the destinies of the world probably for centuries to come the interest he took in the progress of affairs was intense when genoa declared itself free his hopes were at their highest day after day he read the bulletins of the austrian army and sought eagerly to gather tokens of its defeat he heard of the revolt of genoa with emotions of transport his whole heart and soul were in the triumph of the cause we were living at pisa at that time and several wellinformed italians at the head of whom we may place the celebrated vacca were accustomed to seek for sympathy in their hopes from shelley they did not find such for the despair they too generally experienced founded on contempt for their southern countrymen while the fate of the progress of the austrian armies then invading naples was yet in suspense the news of another revolution filled him with exultation we had formed the acquaintance at pisa of several constantinopolitan greeks of the family of prince caradja formerly hospodar of wallachia who hearing that the bowstring the accustomed finale of his viceroyalty was on the road to him escaped with his treasures and took up his abode in tuscany among these was the gentleman to whom the drama of hellas is dedicated prince mavrocordato was warmed by those aspirations for the independence of his country which filled the hearts of many of his countrymen he often intimated the possibility of an insurrection in greece but we had no idea of its being so near at hand when on the st of april he called on shelley bringing the proclamation of his cousin prince ypsilanti and radiant with exultation and delight declared that henceforth greece would be free shelley had hymned the dawn of liberty in spain and naples in two odes dictated by the warmest enthusiasm he felt himself naturally impelled to decorate with poetry the uprise of the descendants of that people whose works he regarded with deep admiration and to adopt the vaticinatory character in prophesying their success hellas was written in a moment of enthusiasm it is curious to remark how well he overcomes the difficulty of forming a drama out of such scant materials his prophecies indeed came true in their general not their particular purport he did not foresee the death of lord londonderry which was to be the epoch of a change in english politics particularly as regarded foreign affairs nor that the navy of his country would fight for instead of against the greeks and by the battle of navarino secure their enfranchisement from the turks almost against reason as it appeared to him he resolved to believe that greece would prove triumphant and in this spirit auguring ultimate good yet grieving over the vicissitudes to be endured in the interval he composed his drama hellas was among the last of his compositions and is among the most beautiful the choruses are singularly imaginative and melodious in their versification there are some stanzas that beautifully exemplify shelleys peculiar style as for instance the assertion of the intellectual empire which must be for ever the inheritance of the country of homer sophocles and plato but greece and her foundations are built below the tide of war based on the crystalline sea of thought and its eternity and again that philosophical truth felicitously imaged forth revenge and wrong bring forth their kind the foul cubs like their parents are their den is in the guilty mind and conscience feeds them with despair the conclusion of the last chorus is among the most beautiful of his lyrics the imagery is distinct and majestic the prophecy such as poets love to dwell upon the regeneration of mankind and that regeneration reflecting back splendour on the foregone time from which it inherits so much of intellectual wealth and memory of past virtuous deeds as must render the possession of happiness and peace of tenfold value fragments of an unfinished drama published in part lines

mortal love for a while returns her passion but at length recalling the memory of her whom he left and who laments his loss he escapes from the enchanted island and returns to his lady his mode of

terror calming me as the loveliness of heaven soothes the unquiet sea and yet not so for he seemed stormy and would often seem a quenchless sun masked in portentous clouds for such his thoughts and even his actions were but he was not of them nor they of him but as they hid his splendour from the earth some said he was a man of blood and peril and steeped in bitter infamy to the lips more need

hills where rise the springs of india how didst thou pass the intervening sea lady if i be sure i am not dreaming now i should not doubt to say it was a dream methought a star came down from heaven and rested mid the plants of india which i had given a shelter from the frost within my chamber there the meteor lay panting forth light among the leaves and flowers as if it lived and was outworn with speed or that it loved and passion made the pulse of its bright life throb like an anxious heart till it diffused itself and all the chamber and walls seemed melted into emerald fire that burned not in the midst of which appeared a spirit like a child and laughed aloud a thrilling peal of such sweet merriment as made the blood tingle in my warm feet then bent over a vase and murmuring low unintelligible melodies placed something in the mould like melonseeds and slowly faded and in place of it a soft hand issued from the veil of fire holding a cup like a magnolia flower and poured upon the earth within the vase the element with which it overflowed brighter than morning light and purer than the water of the springs of himalah note suchdream omitted indian you waked not lady not until my dream became like a childs legend on the tideless sand which the first foam erases half and half leaves legible at length i rose and went visiting my flowers from pot to pot and thought to set new cuttings in the empty urns and when i came to that beside the lattice i saw two little darkgreen leaves lifting the light mould at their birth and then i halfremembered my forgotten dream and day by day green as a gourd in june the plant grew fresh and thick yet no one knew what plant it was its stem and tendrils seemed like emerald snakes mottled and diamonded with azure mail and streaks of woven silver and all the sheaths that folded the dark buds rose like the crest of cobradicapel until the golden eye of the bright flower through the dark lashes of those veined lids disencumbered of their silent sleep gazed like a star into the morning light its leaves were delicate you almost saw the pulses with which the purple velvet flower was fed to overflow and like a poets heart changing bright fancy to sweet sentiment changed half the light to fragrance it soon fell and to a green and dewy embryofruit left all its treasured beauty day by day i nursed the plant and on the double flute played to it on the sunny winter days soft melodies as sweet as april rain on silent leaves and sang those words in which passion makes echo taunt the sleeping strings and i would send tales of forgotten love late into the lone night and sing wild songs of maids deserted in the olden time and weep like a soft cloud in aprils bosom upon the sleeping eyelids of the plant so that perhaps it dreamed that spring was come and crept abroad into the moonlight air and loosened all its limbs as noon by noon the sun averted less his oblique beam indian and the plant died not in the frost lady it grew and went out of the lattice which i left half open for it trailing its quaint spires along the garden and across the lawn and down the slope of moss and through the tufts of wildflower roots and stumps of trees oergrown with simple lichens and old hoary stones on to the margin of the glassy pool even to a nook of unblown violets and liliesofthevalley yet unborn under a pine with ivy overgrown and theme its fruit lay like a sleeping lizard under the shadows but when spring indeed came to unswathe her infants and the lilies peeped from their bright green masks to wonder at this shape of autumn couched in their recess then it dilated and it grew until one half lay floating on the fountain wave whose pulse elapsed in unlike sympathies kept time among the snowy waterlily buds its shape was such as summer melody of the south wind in spicy vales might give to some light cloud bound from the golden dawn to fairy isles of evening and it seemed in hue and form that it had been a mirror of all the hues and forms around it and upon it pictured by the sunny beams which from the bright vibrations of the pool were thrown upon the rafters and the roof of boughs and leaves and on the pillared stems of the dark sylvan temple and reflections of every infant flower and star of moss and veined leaf in the azure odorous air and thus it lay in the elysian calm of its own beauty floating on the line which like a film in purest space divided the heaven beneath the water from the heaven above the clouds and every day i went watching its growth and wondering and as the day grew hot methought i saw a glassy vapour dancing on the pool and on it little quaint and filmy shapes with dizzy motion wheel and rise and fall like clouds of gnats with perfect lineaments o friend sleep was a

towards your native soil between the heavy vengeance of the church and scotland mark the consequence of warming this brood of northern vipers in your bosom the rabble instructed no doubt by london lindsay hume and false argyll for the waves never menace heaven until scourged by the winds invisible tyranny have in the very temple of the lord done outrage to his chosen ministers they scorn the liturgy of the holy church refuse to obey her canons and deny the apostolic power with which the spirit has filled its elect vessels even from him who held the keys with power to loose and bind to him who now pleads in this royal presence let ample powers and new instructions be sent to the high commissioners in scotland to death imprisonment and confiscation add torture add the ruin of the kindred of the offender add the brand of infamy add mutilation and if this suffice not unleash the sword and fire that in their thirst they may lick up that scum of schismatics i laugh at those weak rebels who desiring what we possess still prate of christian peace as if those dreadful arbitrating messengers which play the part of god twixt right and wrong should be let loose against the innocent sleep of templed cities and the smiling fields for some poor argument of policy which touches our own profit or our pride where it indeed were christian charity to turn the cheek even to the smiters hand and when our great redeemer when our god when he who gave accepted and retained himself in propitiation of our sins is scorned in his immediate ministry with hazard of the inestimable loss of all the truth and discipline which is salvation to the extremest generation of men innumerable they talk of peace such peace as canaan found let scotland now for by that christ who came to bring a sword not

encounter a desperate opposition inch by inch in every warehouse and on every farm have swallowed up the gross sum of the imposts so that though felt as a most grievous scourge upon the land they stand us in small stead as touches the receipt strafford tis a conclusion most arithmetical and thence you infer perhaps the assembling of a parliament now if a man should call his dearest enemies t sit in licensed judgement on his life his majesty might wisely take that course aside to cottington it is enough to expect from these lean imposts that they perform the office of a scourge without more profit aloud fines and confiscations and a forced loan from the refractory city will fill our coffers and the golden love of loyal gentlemen and noble friends for the worshipped father of our common country with contributions from the catholics will make rebellion pale in our excess be these the expedients until time and wisdom shall frame a settled state of government laud and weak expedients they have we not drained all till the which seemed a mine exhaustless strafford and the love which is if loyal hearts could turn their blood to gold laud both now grow barren and i speak it

he so much misbecome his throne as to impoverish those who most adorn and best defend it that you urge dear strafford inclines me rather queen to a parliament is this thy firmness and thou wilt preside over a knot of censurers to the unswearing of thy best resolves and choose the worst when the worst comes too soon plight not the worst before the worst must come oh wilt thou smile whilst our

lend power and power bring gold cottington meanwhile we must begin first where your grace leaves off gold must give power or laud i am not averse from the assembling of a parliament strong actions and

darkness fell from the awakened earth the smokeless altars of the mountain snows flamed above crimson clouds and at the birth of light the oceans orison arose to which the birds tempered their matin lay all flowers in field or forest which unclose their trembling eyelids to the kiss of day swinging their censers in the element with orient incense lit by the new ray burned slow and inconsumably and sent their odorous sighs up to the smiling air and in succession due did continent isle ocean and all things that in them wear the form and character of mortal mould rise as the sun their father rose to bear their portion of the toil which he of old took as his own and then imposed on them but i whom thoughts which must remain untold had kept as wakeful as the stars that gem the cone of night now they were laid asleep stretched my faint limbs beneath the hoary stem which an old chestnut flung athwart the steep of a green apennine before me fled the night behind me rose the day the deep was at my feet and heaven above my head when a strange trance over my fancy grew which was not slumber for the shade it spread was so transparent that the scene came through as clear as when a veil of light is drawn oer evening hills they glimmer and i knew that i had felt the freshness of that dawn bathe in the same cold dew my brow and hair and sate as thus upon that slope of lawn under the selfsame bough and heard as there the birds the fountains and the ocean hold sweet talk in music through the enamoured air and then a vision on my train was rolled as in that trance of wondrous thought i lay this was the tenour of my waking dream methought i sate beside a public way thick strewn with summer dust and a great stream of people there was hurrying to and fro numerous as gnats upon the evening gleam all hastening onward yet none seemed to know whither he went or whence he came or why he made one of the multitude and so was borne amid the crowd as through the sky one of the million leaves of summers bier old age and youth manhood and infancy mixed in one mighty torrent did appear some flying from the thing they feared and some seeking the object of anothers fear and others as with steps towards the tomb pored on the trodden worms that crawled beneath and others mournfully within the gloom of their own shadow walked and called it death and some fled from it as it were a ghost half fainting in the affliction of vain breath but more with motions which each other crossed pursued or shunned the shadows the clouds threw or birds within the noonday aether lost upon that path where flowers never grew and weary with vain toil and faint for thirst heard not the fountains whose melodious dew out of their mossy cells forever burst nor felt the breeze which from the forest told of grassy paths and woodlawns interspersed with overarching elms and caverns cold and violet banks where sweet dreams brood but they pursued their serious folly as of old and as i gazed methought that in the way the throng grew wilder as the woods of june when the south wind shakes the extinguished day and a cold glare intenser than the noon but icy cold obscured with blinding light the sun as he the stars like the young moon when on the sunlit limits of the night her white shell trembles amid crimson air and whilst the sleeping tempest gathers might doth as the herald of its coming bear the ghost of its dead mother whose dim form bends in dark aether from her infants chair so came a chariot on the silent storm of its own rushing splendour and a shape so sate within as one whom years deform beneath a dusky hood and double cape crouching within the shadow of a tomb and oer what seemed the head a cloudlike crape was bent a dun and faint aethereal gloom tempering the light upon the chariotbeam a janusvisaged shadow did assume the guidance of that wonderwinged team the shapes which drew it in thick lightenings were lost i heard alone on the airs soft stream the music of their evermoving wings all the four faces of that charioteer had their eyes banded little profit brings speed in the van and blindness in the rear nor then avail the beams that quench the sun or that with banded eyes could pierce the sphere of all that is has been or will be done so ill was the car guided but it passed with solemn speed majestically on the crowd gave way and i arose aghast or seemed to rise so mighty was the trance and saw like clouds upon the thunderblast the million with fierce song and maniac dance raging around such seemed the jubilee as when to greet some conquerors advance imperial rome poured forth her living sea from senatehouse and forum and theatre when upon the free had bound a yoke which soon they stooped to bear nor wanted here the just similitude of a triumphal pageant for whereer the chariot rolled a captive multitude was driven all those who had grown old in power or misery all who had their age subdued by action or by suffering and whose hour was drained to its last sand in weal or woe so that the trunk survived both fruit and flower all those whose fame or infamy must grow till the great winter lay the form and name of this green earth with them for ever low all but the sacred few who could not tame their spirits to the conquerors but as soon as they had touched the world with living flame fled back like eagles to their native noon or those who put aside the diadem of earthly thrones or gems were there of athens or jerusalem were neither mid the mighty captives seen nor mid the ribald crowd that followed them nor those who went before fierce and obscene the wild dance maddens in the van and those who lead it fleet as shadows on the green outspeed the chariot and without repose mix with each other in tempestuous measure to savage music wilder as it grows they tortured by their agonizing pleasure convulsed and on the rapid whirlwinds spun of that fierce spirit whose unholy leisure was soothed by mischief since the world begun throw back their heads and loose their streaming hair and in their dance round her who dims the sun maidens and youths fling their wild arms in air as their feet twinkle they recede and now bending within each others atmosphere kindle invisibly and as they glow like moths by light attracted and repelled oft to their bright destruction come and go till like two clouds into one vale impelled that shake the mountains when their lightnings mingle and die in rain the fiery band which held their natures snaps while the shock still may tingle one falls and then another in the path senseless nor is the desolation single yet ere i can say where the chariot hath passed over them nor other trace i find but as of foam after the oceans wrath is spent upon the desert shore behind old men and women foully disarrayed shake their gray hairs in the insulting wind and follow in the dance with limbs decayed seeking to reach the light which leaves them still farther behind and deeper in the shade but not the less with impotence of will they wheel though ghastly shadows interpose round them and round each other and fulfil their work and in the dust from whence they rose sink and corruption veils them as they lie and past in these performs what in those struck to the heart by this sad pageantry half to myself i said and what is this whose shape is that within the car and why i would have added is all here amiss but a voice answered life i turned and knew o heaven have mercy on such wretchedness that what i thought was an old root which grew to strange distortion out of the hill side was indeed one of those deluded crew and that the grass which methought hung so wide and white was but his thin discoloured hair and that the holes he vainly sought to hide were or had been eyes if thou canst forbear to join the dance which i had well forborne said the grim feature of my thought aware i will unfold that which to this deep scorn led me and my companions and relate the progress of the pageant since the morn if thirst of knowledge shall not then abate follow it thou even to the night but i am weary then like one who with the weight of his own words is staggered wearily he paused and ere he could resume i cried first who art thou before thy memory i feared loved hated suffered did and died and if the spark with which heaven lit my spirit had been with purer nutriment supplied corruption would not now thus much inherit of what was once rousseau nor this disguise stain that which ought to have disdained to wear it if i have been extinguished yet there rise a thousand beacons from the spark i bore and who are those chained to the car the wise the great the unforgotten they who wore mitres and helms and crowns or wreaths of light signs of thoughts empire over thought their lore taught them not this to know themselves their might could not repress the mystery within and for the morn of truth they feigned deep night caught them ere evening who is he with chin upon his breast and hands crossed on his chain the child of a fierce hour he sought to win the world and lost all that it did contain of greatness in its hope destroyed and more of fame and peace than virtues self can gain without the opportunity which bore him on its eagle pinions to the peak from which a thousand climbers have before fallen as napoleon fell i felt my cheek alter to see the shadow pass away whose grasp had left the giant world so weak that every pigmy kicked it as it lay and much i grieved to think how power and will in opposition rule our mortal day and why god made irreconcilable good and the means of good and for despair i half disdained mine eyes desire to fill with the spent vision of the times that were and scarce have ceased to be dost thou behold said my guide those spoilers spoiled voltaire frederick and paul catherine and leopold and hoary anarchs demagogues and sage names which the world thinks always old for in the battle life and they did wage she remained conqueror i was overcome by my own heart alone which neither age nor tears nor infamy nor now the tomb could temper to its object let them pass i cried the world and its mysterious doom is not so much more glorious than it was that i desire to worship those who drew new figures on its false and fragile glass as the old faded figures ever new rise on the bubble paint them as you may we have but thrown as those before us threw our shadows on it as it passed away but mark how chained to the triumphal chair the mighty phantoms of an elder day all that is mortal of great plato there expiates the joy and woe his master knew not the star that ruled his doom was far too fair and life where long that flower of heaven grew not conquered that heart by love which gold or pain or age or sloth or slavery could subdue not and near him walk the twain the tutor and his pupil whom dominion followed as tame as vulture in a chain the world was darkened beneath either pinion of him whom from the flock of conquerors fame singled out for her thunderbearing minion the other long outlived both woes and wars throned in the thoughts of men and still had kept the jealous key of truths eternal doors if bacons eagle spirit had not lept like lightning out of darkness he compelled the proteus shape of nature as it slept to wake and lead him to the caves that held the treasure of the secrets of its reign see the great bards of elder time who quelled the passions which they sung as by their strain may well be known their living melody tempers its own contagion to the vein of those who are infected with it i have suffered what i wrote or viler pain and so my words have seeds of misery even as the deeds of others not as theirs and then he pointed to a company midst whom i quickly recognized the heirs of caesars crime from him to constantine the anarch chiefs whose force and murderous snares had founded many a sceptrebearing line and spread the plague of gold and blood abroad and gregory and john and men divine who rose like shadows between man and god till that eclipse still hanging over heaven was worshipped by the world oer which they strode for the true sun it quenched their power was given but to destroy replied the leader i am one of those who have created even if it be but a world of agony whence camest thou and whither goest thou how did thy course begin i said and why mine eyes are sick of this perpetual flow of people and my heart sick of one sad thought speak whence i am i partly seem to know and how and by what paths i have been brought to this dread pass methinks even thou mayst guess why this should be my mind can compass not whither the conqueror hurries me still less but follow thou and from spectator turn actor or victim in this wretchedness and what thou wouldst be taught i then may learn from thee now listen in the april prime when all the foresttips began to burn with kindling green touched by the azure clime of the young season i was laid asleep under a mountain which from unknown time had yawned into a cavern high and deep and from it came a gentle rivulet whose water like clear air in its calm sweep bent the soft grass and kept for ever wet the stems of the sweet flowers and filled the grove with sounds which whoso hears must needs forget all pleasure and all pain all hate and love which they had known before that hour of rest a sleeping mother then would dream not of her only child who died upon the breast at eventide a king would mourn no more the crown of which his brows were dispossessed when the sun lingered oer his ocean floor to gild his rivals new prosperity thou wouldst forget thus vainly to deplore ills which if ills can find no cure from thee the thought of which no other sleep will quell nor other music blot from memory so sweet and deep is the oblivious spell and whether life had been before that sleep the heaven which i imagine or a hell like this harsh world in which i woke to weep i know not i arose and for a space the scene of woods and waters seemed to keep though it was now broad day a gentle trace of light diviner than the common sun sheds on the common earth and all the place was filled with magic sounds woven into one oblivious melody confusing sense amid the gliding waves and shadows dun and as i looked the bright omnipresence of morning through the orient cavern flowed and the suns image radiantly intense burned on the waters of the well that glowed like gold and threaded all the forests maze with winding paths of emerald fire there stood amid the sun as he amid the blaze of his own glory on the vibrating floor of the fountain paved with flashing rays a shape all light which with one hand did fling dew on the earth as if she were the dawn and the invisible rain did ever sing a silver music on the mossy lawn and still before me on the dusky grass iris her manycoloured scarf had drawn in her right hand she bore a crystal glass mantling with bright nepenthe the fierce splendour fell from her as she moved under the mass of the deep cavern and with palms so tender their tread broke not the mirror of its billow glided along the river and did bend her head under the dark boughs till like a willow her fair hair swept the bosom of the stream that whispered with delight to be its pillow as one enamoured is upborne in dream oer lilypaven lakes mid silver mist to wondrous music so this shape might seem partly to tread the waves with feet which kissed the dancing foam partly to glide along the air which roughened the moist amethyst or the faint morning beams that fell among the trees or the soft shadows of the trees and her feet ever to the ceaseless song of leaves and winds and waves and birds and bees and falling drops moved in a measure new yet sweet as on the summer evening breeze up from the lake a shape of golden dew between two rocks athwart the rising moon dances i the wind where never eagle flew and still her feet no less than the sweet tune to which they moved seemed as they moved to blot the thoughts of him who gazed on them and soon all that was seemed as if it had been not and all the gazers mind was strewn beneath her feet like embers and she thought by thought trampled its sparks into the dust of death as day upon the threshold of the east treads out the lamps of night until the breath of darkness reillumine even the least of heavens living eyes like day she came making the night a dream and ere she ceased to move as one between desire and shame suspended i said if as it doth seem thou comest from the realm without a name into this valley of perpetual dream show whence i came and where i am and why pass not away upon the passing stream arise and quench thy thirst was her reply and as a shut lily stricken by the wand of dewy mornings vital alchemy i rose and bending at her sweet command touched with faint lips the cup she raised and suddenly my brain became as sand where the first wave had more than half erased the track of deer on desert labrador whilst the wolf from which they fled amazed leaves his stamp visibly upon the shore until the second bursts so on my sight burst a new vision never seen before and the fair shape waned in the coming light as veil by veil the silent splendour drops from lucifer amid the chrysolite of sunrise ere it tinge the mountaintops and as the presence of that fairest planet although unseen is felt by one who hopes that his days path may end as he began it in that stars smile whose light is like the scent of a jonquil when evening breezes fan it or the soft note in which his dear lament the brescian shepherd breathes or the caress that turned his weary slumber to content so knew i in that lights severe excess the presence of that shape which on the stream moved as i moved along the wilderness more dimly than a dayappearing dream the host of a forgotten form of sleep a light of heaven whose halfextinguished beam through the sick day in which we wake to weep glimmers for ever sought for ever lost so did that shape its obscure tenour keep beside my path as silent as a ghost but the new vision and the cold bright car with solemn speed and stunning music crossed the forest and as if from some dread war triumphantly returning the loud million fiercely extolled the fortune of her star a moving arch of victory the vermilion and green and azure plumes of iris had built high over her windwinged pavilion and underneath aethereal glory clad the wilderness and far before her flew the tempest of the splendour which forbade shadow to fall from leaf and stone the crew seemed in that light like atomies to dance within a sunbeam some upon the new embroidery of flowers that did enhance the grassy vesture of the desert played forgetful of the chariots swift advance others stood gazing till within the shade of the great mountain its light left them dim others outspeeded it and others made circles around it like the clouds that swim round the high moon in a bright sea of air and more did follow with exulting hymn the chariot and the captives fettered there but all like bubbles on an eddying flood fell into the same track at last and were borne onward i among the multitude was swept me sweetest flowers delayed not long me not the shadow nor the solitude me not that falling streams lethean song me not the phantom of that early form which moved upon its motion but among the thickest billows of that living storm i plunged and bared my bosom to the clime of that cold light whose airs too soon deform before the chariot had begun to climb the opposing steep of that mysterious dell behold a wonder worthy of the rhyme of him who from the lowest depths of hell through every paradise and through all glory love led serene and who returned to tell the words of hate and awe the wondrous story how all things are transfigured except love for deaf as is a sea which wrath makes hoary the world can hear not the sweet notes that move the sphere whose light is melody to lovers a wonder worthy of his rhyme the grove grew dense with shadows to its inmost covers the earth was gray with phantoms and the air was peopled with dim forms as when there hovers a flock of vampirebats before the glare of the tropic sun bringing ere evening strange night upon some indian isle thus were phantoms diffused around and some did fling shadows of shadows yet unlike themselves behind them some like eaglets on the wing were lost in the white day others like elves danced in a thousand unimagined shapes upon the sunny streams and grassy shelves and others sate chattering like restless apes on vulgar hands some made a cradle of the ermined capes of kingly mantles some across the tiar of pontiffs sate like vultures others played under the crown which girt with empire a babys or an idiots brow and made their nests in it the old anatomies sate hatching their bare broods under the shade of daemon wings and laughed from their dead eyes to reassume the delegated power arrayed in which those worms did monarchize who made this earth their charnel others more humble like falcons sate upon the fist of common men and round their heads did soar or like small gnats and flies as thick as mist on evening marshes thronged about the brow of lawyers statesmen priest and theorist and others like discoloured flakes of snow on fairest bosoms and the sunniest hair fell and were melted by the youthful glow which they extinguished and like tears they were a veil to those from whose faint lids they rained in drops of sorrow i became aware of whence those forms proceeded which thus stained the track in which we moved after brief space from every form the beauty slowly waned from every firmest limb and fairest face the strength and freshness fell like dust and left the action and the shape without the grace of life the marble brow of youth was cleft with care and in those eyes where once hope shone desire like a lioness bereft of her last cub glared ere it died each one of that great crowd sent forth incessantly these shadows numerous as the dead leaves blown in autumn evening from a poplar tree each like himself and like each other were at first but some distorted seemed to be obscure clouds moulded by the casual air and of this stuff the cars creative ray wrought all the busy phantoms that were there as the sun shapes the clouds thus on the way mask after mask fell from the countenance and form of all and long before the day was old the joy which waked like heavens glance the sleepers in the oblivious valley died and some grew weary of the ghastly dance and fell as i have fallen by the wayside those soonest from whose forms most shadows passed and least of strength and beauty did abide then what is life i
