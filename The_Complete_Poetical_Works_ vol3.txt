this and the other hymns of homer exist among the boscombe manuscripts forman sing muse the son of maia and of jove the heraldchild king of arcadia and all its pastoral hills whom in sweet love having been interwoven modest may bore heavens dread supreme an antique grove shadowed the cavern where the lovers lay in the deep night unseen by gods or men and whitearmed juno slumbered sweetly then now when the joy of jove had its fulfilling and heavens tenth moon chronicled her relief she gave to light a babe all babes excelling a schemer subtle beyond all belief a shepherd of thin dreams a cowstealing a nightwatching and doorwaylaying thief who mongst the gods was soon about to thieve and other glorious actions to achieve the babe was born at the first peep of day he began playing on the lyre at noon and the same evening did he steal away apollos herds the fourth day of the moon on which him bore the venerable may from her immortal limbs he leaped full soon nor long could in the sacred cradle keep but out to seek apollos herds would creep out of the lofty cavern wandering he found a tortoise and cried out a treasure for mercury first made the tortoise sing the beast before the portal at his leisure the flowery herbage was depasturing moving his feet in a deliberate measure over the turf joves profitable son eying him laughed and laughing thus begun a useful godsend are you to me now king of the dance companion of the feast lovely in all your nature welcome you excellent plaything where sweet mountainbeast got you that speckled shell thus much i know you must come home with me and be my guest you will give joy to me and i will do all that is in my power to honour you better to be at home than out of door so come with me and though it has been said that you alive defend from magic power i know you will sing sweetly when youre dead thus having spoken the quaint infant bore lifting it from the grass on which it fed and grasping it in his delighted hold his treasured prize into the cavern old then scooping with a chisel of gray steel he bored the life and soul out of the beast not swifter a swift thought of woe or weal darts through the tumult of a human breast which thronging cares annoy not swifter wheel the flashes of its torture and unrest out of the dizzy eyes than maias son all that he did devise hath featly done and through the tortoises hard stony skin at proper distances small holes he made and fastened the cut stems of reeds within and with a piece of leather overlaid the open space and fixed the cubits in fitting the bridge to both and stretched oer all symphonious cords of sheepgut rhythmical when he had wrought the lovely instrument he tried the chords and made division meet preluding with the plectrum and there went up from beneath his hand a tumult sweet of mighty sounds and from his lips he sent a strain of unpremeditated wit joyous and wild and wanton such you may hear among revellers on a holiday he sung how jove and may of the bright sandal dallied in love not quite legitimate and his own birth still scoffing at the scandal and naming his own name did celebrate his mothers cave and servant maids he planned all in plastic verse her household stuff and state perennial pot trippet and brazen pan but singing he conceived another plan seized with a sudden fancy for fresh meat he in his sacred crib deposited the hollow lyre and from the cavern sweet rushed with great leaps up to the mountains head revolving in his mind some subtle feat of thievish craft such as a swindler might devise in the lone season of dun night lo the great sun under the oceans bed has driven steeds and chariot the child meanwhile strode oer the pierian mountains clothed in shadows where the immortal oxen of the god are pastured in the flowering unmown meadows and safely stalled in a remote abode the archer argicide elate and proud drove fifty from the herd lowing aloud he drove them wandering oer the sandy way but being ever mindful of his craft backward and forward drove he them astray so that the tracks which seemed before were aft his sandals then he threw to the ocean spray and for each foot he wrought a kind of raft of tamarisk and tamarisklike sprigs and bound them in a lump with withy twigs and on his feet he tied these sandals light the trail of whose wide leaves might not betray his track and then a selfsufficing wight like a man hastening on some distant way he from pierias mountain bent his flight but an old man perceived the infant pass down green onchestus heaped like beds with grass the old man stood dressing his sunny vine halloo old fellow with the crooked shoulder you grub those stumps before they will bear wine methinks even you must grow a little older attend i pray to this advice of mine as you would scape what might appal a bolder seeing see not and hearing hear not and if you have understanding understand so saying hermes roused the oxen vast oer shadowy mountain and resounding dell and flowerpaven plains great hermes passed till the black night divine which favouring fell around his steps grew gray and morning fast wakened the world to work and from her cell seastrewn the pallantean moon sublime into her watchtower just began to climb now to alpheus he had driven all the broadforeheaded oxen of the sun they came unwearied to the lofty stall and to the watertroughs which ever run through the fresh fields and when with rushgrass tall lotus and all sweet herbage every one had pastured been the great god made them move towards the stall in a collected drove a mighty pile of wood the god then heaped and having soon conceived the mystery of fire from two smooth laurel branches stripped the bark and rubbed them in his palms on high suddenly forth the burning vapour leaped and the divine child saw delightedly mercury first found out for human weal tinderbox matches fireirons flint and steel and fine dry logs and roots innumerous he gathered in a delve upon the ground and kindled them and instantaneous the strength of the fierce flame was breathed around and whilst the might of glorious vulcan thus wrapped the great pile with glare and roaring sound hermes dragged forth two heifers lowing loud close to the fire such might was in the god and on the earth upon their backs he threw the panting beasts and rolled them oer and oer and bored their lives out without more ado he cut up fat and flesh and down before the fire on spits of wood he placed the two toasting their flesh and ribs and all the gore pursed in the bowels and while this was done he stretched their hides over a craggy stone we mortals let an ox grow old and then cut it up after long consideration but joyousminded hermes from the glen drew the fat spoils to the more open station of a flat smooth space and portioned them and when he had by lot assigned to each a ration of the twelve gods his mind became aware of all the joys which in religion are for the sweet savour of the roasted meat tempted him though immortal natheless he checked his haughty will and did not eat though what it cost him words can scarce express and every wish to put such morsels sweet down his most sacred throat he did repress but soon within the lofty portalled stall he placed the fat and flesh and bones and all and every trace of the fresh butchery and cooking the god soon made disappear as if it all had vanished through the sky he burned the hoofs and horns and head and hair the insatiate fire devoured them hungrily and when he saw that everything was clear he quenched the coal and trampled the black dust and in the stream his bloody sandals tossed all night he worked in the serene moonshine but when the light of day was spread abroad he sought his natal mountainpeaks divine on his long wandering neither man nor god had met him since he killed apollos kine nor housedog had barked at him on his road now he obliquely through the keyhole passed like a thin mist or an autumnal blast right through the temple of the spacious cave he went with soft light feet as if his tread fell not on earth no sound their falling gave then to his cradle he crept quick and spread the swaddlingclothes about him and the knave lay playing with the covering of the bed with his left hand about his knees the right held his beloved tortoiselyre tight there he lay innocent as a newborn child as gossips say but though he was a god the goddess his fair mother unbeguiled knew all that he had done being abroad whence come you and from what adventure wild you cunning rogue and where have you abode all the long night clothed in your impudence what have you done since you departed hence apollo soon will pass within this gate and bind your tender body in a chain inextricably tight and fast as fate unless you can delude the god again even when within his arms ah runagate a pretty torment both for gods and men your father made when he made you dear mother replied sly hermes wherefore scold and bother as if i were like other babes as old and understood nothing of what is what and cared at all to hear my mother scold i in my subtle brain a scheme have got which whilst the sacred stars round heaven are rolled will profit you and me nor shall our lot be as you counsel without gifts or food to spend our lives in this obscure abode but we will leave this shadowpeopled cave and live among the gods and pass each day in high communion sharing what they have of profuse wealth and unexhausted prey and from the portion which my father gave to phoebus i will snatch my share away which if my father will not natheless i who am the king of robbers can but try and if latonas son should find me out ill countermine him by a deeper plan ill pierce the pythian templewalls though stout and sack the fane of everything i can caldrons and tripods of great worth no doubt each golden cup and polished brazen pan all the wrought tapestries and garments gay so they together talked meanwhile the day aethereal born arose out of the flood of flowing ocean bearing light to men apollo passed toward the sacred wood which from the inmost depths of its green glen echoes the voice of neptune and there stood on the same spot in green onchestus then that same old animal the vinedresser who was employed hedging his vineyard there latonas glorious son began i pray tell ancient hedger of onchestus green whether a drove of kine has passed this way all heifers with crooked horns for they have been stolen from the herd in high pieria where a black bull was fed apart between two woody mountains in a neighbouring glen and four fierce dogs watched there unanimous as men and what is strange the author of this theft has stolen the fatted heifers every one but the four dogs and the black bull are left stolen they were last night at set of sun of their soft beds and their sweet food bereft now tell me man born ere the world begun have you seen any one pass with the cows to whom the man of overhanging brows my friend it would require no common skill justly to speak of everything i see on various purposes of good or ill many pass by my vineyard and to me tis difficult to know the invisible thoughts which in all those many minds may be thus much alone i certainly can say i tilled these vines till the decline of day and then i thought i saw but dare not speak with certainty of such a wondrous thing a child who could not have been born a week those fairhorned cattle closely following and in his hand he held a polished stick and as on purpose he walked wavering from one side to the other of the road and with his face opposed the steps he trod apollo hearing this passed quickly on no winged omen could have shown more clear that the deceiver was his fathers son so the god wraps a purple atmosphere around his shoulders and like fire is gone to famous pylos seeking his kine there and found their track and his yet hardly cold and cried what wonder do mine eyes behold here are the footsteps of the horned herd turned back towards their fields of asphodel but these are not the tracks of beast or bird gray wolf or bear or lion of the dell or maned centaur sand was never stirred by man or woman thus inexplicable who with unwearied feet could eer impress the sand with such enormous vestiges that was most strange but this is stranger still thus having said phoebus impetuously sought high cyllenes forestcinctured hill and the deep cavern where dark shadows lie and where the ambrosial nymph with happy will bore the saturnians lovechild mercury and a delightful odour from the dew of the hill pastures at his coming flew and phoebus stooped under the craggy roof arched over the dark cavern maias child perceived that he came angry far aloof about the cows of which he had been beguiled and over him the fine and fragrant woof of his ambrosial swaddlingclothes he piled as among firebrands lies a burning spark covered beneath the ashes cold and dark there like an infant who had sucked his fill and now was newly washed and put to bed awake but courting sleep with weary will and gathered in a lump hands feet and head he lay and his beloved tortoise still he grasped and held under his shoulderblade phoebus the lovely mountaingoddess knew not less her subtle swindling baby who lay swathed in his sly wiles round every crook of the ample cavern for his kine apollo looked sharp and when he saw them not he took the glittering key and opened three great hollow recesses in the rock where many a nook was filled with the sweet food immortals swallow and mighty heaps of silver and of gold were piled within a wonder to behold and white and silver robes all overwrought with cunning workmanship of tracery sweet except among the gods there can be nought in the wide world to be compared with it latonas offspring after having sought his herds in every corner thus did greet great hermes little cradled rogue declare of my illustrious heifers where they are speak quickly or a quarrel between us must rise and the event will be that i shall hurl you into dismal tartarus in fiery gloom to dwell eternally nor shall your father nor your mother loose the bars of that black dungeon utterly you shall be cast out from the light of day to rule the ghosts of men unblessed as they to whom thus hermes slily answered son of great latona what a speech is this why come you here to ask me what is done with the wild oxen which it seems you miss i have not seen them nor from any one have heard a word of the whole business if you should promise an immense reward i could not tell more than you now have heard an oxstealer should be both tall and strong and i am but a little newborn thing who yet at least can think of nothing wrong my business is to suck and sleep and fling the cradleclothes about me all day long or half asleep hear my sweet mother sing and to be washed in water clean and warm and hushed and kissed and kept secure from harm o let not eer this quarrel be averred the astounded gods would laugh at you if eer you should allege a story so absurd as that a newborn infant forth could fare out of his home after a savage herd i was born yesterday my small feet are too tender for the roads so hard and rough and if you think that this is not enough i swear a great oath by my fathers head that i stole not your cows and that i know of no one else who might or could or did whatever things cows are i do not know for i have only heard the name this said he winked as fast as could be and his brow was wrinkled and a whistle loud gave he like one who hears some strange absurdity apollo gently smiled and said ay ay you cunning little rascal you will bore many a rich mans house and your array of thieves will lay their siege before his door silent as night in night and many a day in the wild glens rough shepherds will deplore that you or yours having an appetite met with their cattle comrade of the night and this among the gods shall be your gift to be considered as the lord of those who swindle housebreak sheepsteal and shoplift but now if you would not your last sleep doze crawl out thus saying phoebus did uplift the subtle infant in his swaddling clothes and in his arms according to his wont a scheme devised the illustrious argiphont and sneezed and shuddered phoebus on the grass him threw and whilst all that he had designed he did perform eager although to pass apollo darted from his mighty mind towards the subtle babe the following scoff do not imagine this will get you off you little swaddled child of jove and may and seized him by this omen i shall trace my noble herds and you shall lead the way cyllenian hermes from the grassy place like one in earnest haste to get away rose and with hands lifted towards his face round both his ears up from his shoulders drew his swaddling clothes and what mean you to do with me you unkind god said mercury is it about these cows you tease me so i wish the race of cows were perished i stole not your cows i do not even know what things cows are alas i well may sigh that since i came into this world of woe i should have ever heard the name of one but i appeal to the saturnians throne thus phoebus and the vagrant mercury talked without coming to an explanation with adverse purpose as for phoebus he sought not revenge but only information and hermes tried with lies and roguery to cheat apollo but when no evasion served for the cunning one his match had found he paced on first over the sandy ground he of the silver bow the child of jove followed behind till to their heavenly sire came both his children beautiful as love and from his equal balance did require a judgement in the cause wherein they strove oer odorous olympus and its snows a murmuring tumult as they came arose and from the folded depths of the great hill while hermes and apollo reverent stood before joves throne the indestructible immortals rushed in mighty multitude and whilst their seats in order due they fill the lofty thunderer in a careless mood to phoebus said whence drive you this sweet prey this heraldbaby born but yesterday a most important subject trifler this to lay before the gods nay father nay when you have understood the business say not that i alone am fond of prey i found this little boy in a recess under cyllenes mountains far away a manifest and most apparent thief a scandalmonger beyond all belief i never saw his like either in heaven or upon earth for knavery or craft out of the field my cattle yestereven by the low shore on which the loud sea laughed he right down to the riverford had driven and mere astonishment would make you daft to see the double kind of footsteps strange he has impressed wherever he did range the cattles track on the black dust full well is evident as if they went towards the place from which they came that asphodel meadow in which i feed my many herds his steps were most incomprehensible i know not how i can describe in words those tracks he could have gone along the sands neither upon his feet nor on his hands he must have had some other stranger mode of moving on those vestiges immense far as i traced them on the sandy road seemed like the trail of oaktoppings but thence no mark nor track denoting where they trod the hard ground gave but working at his fence a mortal hedger saw him as he passed to pylos with the cows in fiery haste i found that in the dark he quietly had sacrificed some cows and before light had thrown the ashes all dispersedly about the road then still as gloomy night had crept into his cradle either eye rubbing and cogitating some new sleight no eagle could have seen him as he lay hid in his cavern from the peering day i taxed him with the fact when he averred most solemnly that he did neither see nor even had in any manner heard of my lost cows whatever things cows be nor could he tell though offered a reward not even who could tell of them to me so speaking phoebus sate and hermes then addressed the supreme lord of gods and men great father you know clearly beforehand that all which i shall say to you is sooth i am a most veracious person and totally unacquainted with untruth at sunrise phoebus came but with no band of gods to bear him witness in great wrath to my abode seeking his heifers there and saying that i must show him where they are or he would hurl me down the dark abyss i know that every apollonian limb is clothed with speed and might and manliness as a green bank with flowers but unlike him i was born yesterday and you may guess he well knew this when he indulged the whim of bullying a poor little newborn thing that slept and never thought of cowdriving am i like a strong fellow who steals kine believe me dearest father such you are this driving of the herds is none of mine across my threshold did i wander neer so may i thrive i reverence the divine sun and the gods and i love you and care even for this hard accuser who must know i am as innocent as they or you i swear by these most gloriouslywrought portals it is you will allow an oath of might through which the multitude of the immortals pass and repass forever day and night devising schemes for the affairs of mortals i am guiltless and i will requite although mine enemy be great and strong his cruel threat do thou defend the young so speaking the cyllenian argiphont winked as if now his adversary was fitted and jupiter according to his wont laughed heartily to hear the subtlewitted infant give such a plausible account and every word a lie but he remitted judgement at present and his exhortation was to compose the affair by arbitration and they by mighty jupiter were bidden to go forth with a single purpose both neither the other chiding nor yet chidden and mercury with innocence and truth to lead the way and show where he had hidden the mighty heifers hermes nothing loth obeyed the aegisbearers will for he is able to persuade all easily these lovely children of heavens highest lord hastened to pylos and the pastures wide and lofty stalls by the alphean ford where wealth in the mute night is multiplied with silent growth whilst hermes drove the herd out of the stony cavern phoebus spied the hides of those the little babe had slain stretched on the precipice above the plain how was it possible then phoebus said that you a little child born yesterday a thing on mothers milk and kisses fed could two prodigious heifers ever flay even i myself may well hereafter dread your prowess offspring of cyllenian may when you grow strong and tall he spoke and bound stiff withy bands the infants wrists around he might as well have bound the oxen wild the withy bands though starkly interknit fell at the feet of the immortal child loosened by some device of his quick wit phoebus perceived himself again beguiled and stared while hermes sought some hole or pit looking askance and winking fast as thought where he might hide himself and not be caught sudden he changed his plan and with strange skill subdued the strong latonian by the might of winning music to his mightier will his left hand held the lyre and in his right the plectrum struck the chords unconquerable up from beneath his hand in circling flight the gathering music rose and sweet as love the penetrating notes did live and move within the heart of great apollo he listened with all his soul and laughed for pleasure close to his side stood harping fearlessly the unabashed boy and to the measure of the sweet lyre there followed loud and free his joyous voice for he unlocked the treasure of his deep song illustrating the birth of the bright gods and the dark desert earth and how to the immortals every one a portion was assigned of all that is but chief mnemosyne did maias son clothe in the light of his loud melodies and as each god was born or had begun he in their order due and fit degrees sung of his birth and being and did move apollo to unutterable love these words were winged with his swift delight you heiferstealing schemer well do you deserve that fifty oxen should requite such minstrelsies as i have heard even now comrade of feasts little contriving wight one of your secrets i would gladly know whether the glorious power you now show forth was folded up within you at your birth or whether mortal taught or god inspired the power of unpremeditated song many divinest sounds have i admired the olympian gods and mortal men among but such a strain of wondrous strange untired and soulawakening music sweet and strong yet did i never hear except from thee offspring of may impostor mercury what muse what skill what unimagined use what exercise of subtlest art has given thy songs such power for those who hear may choose from three the choicest of the gifts of heaven delight and love and sleep sweet sleep whose dews are sweeter than the balmy tears of even and i who speak this praise am that apollo whom the olympian muses ever follow and their delight is dance and the blithe noise of song and overflowing poesy and sweet even as desire the liquid voice of pipes that fills the clear air thrillingly but never did my inmost soul rejoice in this dear work of youthful revelry as now i wonder at thee son of jove thy harpings and thy song are soft as love now since thou hast although so very small science of arts so glorious thus i swear and let this cornel javelin keen and tall witness between us what i promise here that i will lead thee to the olympian hall honoured and mighty with thy mother dear and many glorious gifts in joy will give thee and even at the end will neer deceive thee to whom thus mercury with prudent speech wisely hast thou inquired of my skill i envy thee no thing i know to teach even this day for both in word and will i would be gentle with thee thou canst reach all things in thy wise spirit and thy sill is highest in heaven among the sons of jove who loves thee in the fulness of his love the counsellor supreme has given to thee divinest gifts out of the amplitude of his profuse exhaustless treasury by thee tis said the depths are understood of his far voice by thee the mystery of all oracular fates and the dread mood of the diviner is breathed up even i a child perceive thy might and majesty thou canst seek out and compass all that wit can find or teach yet since thou wilt come take the lyre be mine the glory giving it strike the sweet chords and sing aloud and wake thy joyous pleasure out of many a fit of tranced sound and with fleet fingers make thy liquidvoiced comrade talk with thee it can talk measured music eloquently then bear it boldly to the revel loud lovewakening dance or feast of solemn state a joy by night or day for those endowed with art and wisdom who interrogate it teaches babbling in delightful mood all things which make the spirit most elate soothing the mind with sweet familiar play chasing the heavy shadows of dismay to those who are unskilled in its sweet tongue though they should question most impetuously its hidden soul it gossips something wrong some senseless and impertinent reply but thou who art as wise as thou art strong canst compass all that thou desirest i present thee with this musicflowing shell knowing thou canst interrogate it well and let us two henceforth together feed on this green mountainslope and pastoral plain the herds in litigation they will breed quickly enough to recompense our pain if to the bulls and cows we take good heed and thou though somewhat over fond of gain grudge me not half the profit having spoke the shell he proffered and apollo took and gave him in return the glittering lash installing him as herdsman from the look of mercury then laughed a joyous flash and then apollo with the plectrum strook the chords and from beneath his hands a crash of mighty sounds rushed up whose music shook the soul with sweetness and like an adept his sweeter voice a just accordance kept the herd went wandering oer the divine mead whilst these most beautiful sons of jupiter won their swift way up to the snowy head of white olympus with the joyous lyre soothing their journey and their father dread gathered them both into familiar affection sweet and then and now and ever hermes must love him of the golden quiver to whom he gave the lyre that sweetly sounded which skilfully he held and played thereon he piped the while and far and wide rebounded the echo of his pipings every one of the olympians sat with joy astounded while he conceived another piece of fun one of his old tricks which the god of day perceiving said i fear thee son of may i fear thee and thy sly chameleon spirit lest thou should steal my lyre and crooked bow this glory and power thou dost from jove inherit to teach all craft upon the earth below thieves love and worship thee it is thy merit to make all mortal business ebb and flow by roguery now hermes if you dare by sacred styx a mighty oath to swear that you will never rob me you will do a thing extremely pleasing to my heart then mercury swore by the stygian dew that he would never steal his bow or dart or lay his hands on what to him was due or ever would employ his powerful art against his pythian fane then phoebus swore there was no god or man whom he loved more and i will give thee as a goodwill token the beautiful wand of wealth and happiness a perfect threeleaved rod of gold unbroken whose magic will thy footsteps ever bless and whatsoever by joves voice is spoken of earthly or divine from its recess it like a loving soul to thee will speak and more than this do thou forbear to seek for dearest child the divinations high which thou requirest tis unlawful ever that thou or any other deity should understand and vain were the endeavour for they are hidden in joves mind and i in trust of them have sworn that i would never betray the counsels of joves inmost will to any god the oath was terrible then goldenwanded brother ask me not to speak the fates by jupiter designed but be it mine to tell their various lot to the unnumbered tribes of humankind let good to these and ill to those be wrought as i dispense but he who comes consigned by voice and wings of perfect augury to my great shrine shall find avail in me him will i not deceive but will assist but he who comes relying on such birds as chatter vainly who would strain and twist the purpose of the gods with idle words and deems their knowledge light he shall have missed his road whilst i among my other hoards his gifts deposit yet o son of may i have another wondrous thing to say there are three fates three virgin sisters who rejoicing in their windoutspeeding wings their heads with flour snowed over white and new sit in a vale round which parnassus flings its circling skirts from these i have learned true vaticinations of remotest things my father cared not whilst they search out dooms they sit apart and feed on honeycombs they having eaten the fresh honey grow drunk with divine enthusiasm and utter with earnest willingness the truth they know but if deprived of that sweet food they mutter all plausible delusions these to you i give if you inquire they will not stutter delight your own soul with them any man you would instruct may profit if he can take these and the fierce oxen maias child oer many a horse and toilenduring mule oer jaggedjawed lions and the wild whitetusked boars oer all by field or pool of cattle which the mighty mother mild nourishes in her bosom thou shalt rule thou dost alone the veil from death uplift thou givest not yet this is a great gift thus king apollo loved the child of may in truth and jove covered their love with joy hermes with gods and men even from that day mingled and

selling all your store silenus i may you perish wretch ulysses if i speak false silenus cyclops i swear by neptune who begot thee by mighty triton and by nereus old calypso and the glaucous ocean

may those whom most i love my children perish wretchedly chorus there stop i saw him giving these things to the strangers if i speak false then may my father perish but do not thou wrong hospitality cyclops you lie i swear that he is juster far than rhadamanthus i trust more in him but let me ask whence have ye sailed o strangers who are you and what city nourished ye ulysses our race is ithacan having destroyed the town of troy the tempests of the sea have driven us on thy land o polypheme cyclops what have ye shared in the unenvied spoil of the false helen near scamanders stream ulysses the same having endured a woful toil cyclops oh basest expedition sailed ye not from greece to phrygia for one womans sake ulysses twas the gods work no mortal was in fault but o great offspring of the oceanking we pray thee and admonish thee with freedom that thou dost spare thy friends who visit thee and place no impious food within thy jaws for in the depths of greece we have upreared temples to thy great father which are all his homes the sacred bay of taenarus remains inviolate and each dim recess scooped high on the malean promontory and aery suniums silverveined crag which divine pallas keeps unprofaned ever the gerastian asylums and whateer within wide greece our enterprise has kept from phrygian contumely and in which you have a common care for you inhabit the skirts of grecian

upon oxenpiercing spits our limbs so fill your belly and your jaws priams wide land has widowed greece enough and weaponwinged murder leaped together enough of dead and wives are husbandless and ancient women and gray fathers wail their childless age if you should roast the rest and tis a bitter feast that you prepare where then would any turn yet be persuaded forgo the lust of your jawbone prefer pious humanity to wicked will many have bought too dear their evil joys silenus let me advise you do not spare a morsel of all his flesh if you should eat his tongue you would become most eloquent o cyclops cyclops wealth my good fellow is the wise mans god all other things are a pretence and boast what are my fathers ocean promontories the sacred rocks whereon he dwells to me stranger i laugh to scorn joves thunderbolt i know not that his strength is more than mine as to the rest i care not when he pours rain from above i have a close pavilion under this rock in which i lie supine feasting on a roast calf or some wild beast and drinking pans of milk and gloriously emulating the thunder of high heaven and when the thracian wind pours down the snow i wrap my body in the skins of beasts kindle a fire and bid the snow whirl on the earth by force whether it will or no bringing forth grass fattens my flocks and herds which to what other god but to myself and this great belly first of deities should i be bound to sacrifice i well know the wise mans only jupiter is this to eat and drink during his little day and give himself no care and as for those who complicate with laws the life of man i freely give them tears for their reward i will not cheat my soul of its delight or hesitate in dining upon you and that i may be quit of all demands these are my hospitable gifts fierce fire and yon ancestral caldron which oerbubbling shall finely cook your miserable flesh creep in ulysses ai ai i have escaped the trojan toils i have escaped the sea and now i fall under the cruel grasp of one impious man o pallas mistress goddess sprung from jove now now assist me mightier toils than troy are these i totter on the chasms of peril and thou who inhabitest the thrones of the bright stars look hospitable jove upon this outrage of thy deity otherwise be considered as no god chorus alone for your gaping gulf and your gullet wide the ravin is ready on every side the limbs of the strangers are cooked and done there is boiled meat and roast meat and meat from the coal you may chop it and tear it and gnash it for fun an hairy goatsskin contains the whole let me but escape and ferry me oer the stream of your wrath to a safer shore the cyclops aetnean is cruel and bold he murders the strangers that sit on his hearth and dreads no avengers to rise from the earth he roasts the men before they are cold he snatches them broiling from the coal and from the caldron pulls them whole and minces their flesh and gnaws their bone with his cursed teeth till all be gone farewell foul pavilion farewell rites of dread the cyclops vermilion with slaughter uncloying now feasts on the dead in the flesh of strangers joying note ravin rossetti spelt ravine in b editions ulysses o jupiter i saw within the cave horrible things deeds to be feigned in words but not to be believed as being done note not to be believed b not believed chorus what sawest thou the impious polypheme feasting upon your loved companions now ulysses selecting two the plumpest of the crowd he grasped them in his hands chorus unhappy man ulysses soon as we came into this craggy place kindling a fire he cast on the broad hearth the knotty limbs of an enormous oak three waggonloads at least and then he strewed upon the ground beside the red firelight his couch of pineleaves and he milked the cows and pouring forth the white milk filled a bowl three cubits wide and four in depth as much as would contain ten amphorae and bound it with ivy wreaths then placed upon the fire a brazen pot to boil and made red hot the points of spits not sharpened with the sickle but with a fruit tree bough and with the jaws of axes for aetnean slaughterings and when this godabandoned cook of hell had made all ready he seized two of us and killed them in a kind of measured manner for he flung one against the brazen rivets of the huge caldron and seized the other by the foots tendon and knocked out his brains upon the sharp edge of the craggy stone then peeled his flesh with a great cookingknife and put him down to roast the others limbs he chopped into the caldron to be boiled and i with the tears raining from my eyes stood near the cyclops ministering to him the rest in the recesses of the cave clung to the rock like bats bloodless with fear when he was filled with my companions flesh he threw himself upon the ground and sent a loathsome exhalation from his maw then a divine thought came to me i filled the cup of maron and i offered him to taste and said child of the ocean god behold what drink the vines of greece produce the exultation and the joy of bacchus he satiated with his unnatural food received it and at one draught drank it off and taking my hand praised me thou hast given a sweet draught after a sweet meal dear guest and i perceiving that it pleased him filled another cup well knowing that the wine would wound him soon and take a sure revenge and the charm fascinated him and i plied him cup after cup until the drink had warmed his entrails and he sang aloud in concert with my wailing fellowseamen a hideous discord and the cavern rung i have stolen out so that if you will you may achieve my safety and your own but say do you desire or not to fly this uncompanionable man and dwell as was your wont among the grecian nymphs within the fanes of your beloved god your father there within agrees to it but he is weak and overcome with wine and caught as if with birdlime by the cup he claps his wings and crows in doting joy you who are young escape with me and find

servitude chorus o sweeter far than is the music of an asian lyre would be the news of polypheme destroyed ulysses delighted with the bacchic drink he goes to call his brother cyclops who inhabit a village upon aetna not far off chorus i understand catching him when alone you think by some measure to dispatch him or thrust him from the precipice note by some measure with some measures b ulysses oh no nothing of that kind my device is subtle chorus how then i heard of old that thou wert wise ulysses i will dissuade him from this plan by saying it were unwise to give the cyclopses this precious drink which if enjoyed alone would make life sweeter for a longer time when vanquished by the bacchic power he sleeps there is a trunk of olive wood within whose point having made sharp with this good sword i will conceal in fire and when i see it is alight will fix it burning yet within the socket of the cyclops eye and melt it out with fire as when a man turns by its handle a great auger round fitting the framework of a ship with beams so will i in the cyclops fiery eye turn round the brand and dry the pupil up chorus joy i am mad with joy at your device ulysses and then with you my friends and the old man well load the hollow depth of our black ship and row with double strokes from this dread shore chorus may i as in libations to a god share in the blinding him with the red brand i would have some communion in his death ulysses doubtless the brand is a great brand to hold chorus oh i would lift an hundred waggonloads if like a wasps nest i could scoop the eye out of the detested cyclops ulysses silence now ye know the close device and when i call look ye obey the masters of the craft i will not save myself and leave behind my comrades in the cave i might escape

thou weepest not now weep never more they were already waked as wont drew nigh the allotted hour for food and in that hour each drew a presage from his dream when i heard locked beneath me of that

trees and flowers and undergrowth of odorous plants leave me the books you brought out of the house to me are ever best society and while with glorious festival and song antioch now celebrates the consecration of a proud temple to great jupiter and bears his image in loud jubilee to its new shrine i would consume what still lives of the dying day in studious thought far from the throng and turmoil you my friends go and enjoy the festival it will be worth your pains you may return for me when the sun seeks its grave among the billows which among dim gray clouds on the horizon dance like white plumes upon a hearse and here i shall expect you notes so transcr be worth the labour and return for me so hid among dim gray clouds on the horizon which dance like plumes transcr forman moscon i cannot bring my mind great as my haste to see the festival certainly is to leave you sir without just saying some three or four thousand words how is it possible that on a day of such festivity you can be content to come forth to a solitary country with three or four old books and turn your back on all this mirth notes thousand transcr hundred be content transcr bring your mind clarin my masters in the right there is not anything more tiresome than a procession day with troops and priests and dances and all that note and priests transcr of men moscon from first to last clarin you are a temporizing flatterer you praise not what you feel but what he does toadeater clarin you lie under a mistake for this is the most civil sort of lie that can be given to a mans face i now say what i think cyprian enough you foolish fellows puffed up with your own doting ignorance you always take the two sides of one question now go and as i said return for me when night falls veiling in its shadows wide this glorious fabric of the universe note doting ignorance transcr ignorance and pride moscon how happens it although you can maintain the folly of enjoying festivals that yet you go there clarin nay the consequence is clear who ever did what he advises others to do moscon would that my feet were wings so would i fly to livia exit clarin to speak truth livia is she who has surprised my heart but he is more than halfway there soho livia i come good sport livia soho exit cyprian now since i am alone let me examine the question which has long disturbed my mind with doubt since first i read in plinius the words of mystic import and deep sense in which he defines god my intellect can find no god with whom these marks and signs fitly agree it is a hidden truth which i must fathom cyprian reads the daemon dressed in a court dress enters note stage direction so transcr reads enter the devil as a fine gentleman daemon search even as thou wilt but thou shalt never find what i can hide cyprian what noise is that among the boughs who moves what art thou daemon tis a foreign gentleman even from this morning i have lost my way in this wild place and my poor horse at last quite overcome has stretched himself upon the enamelled tapestry of this mossy mountain and feeds and rests at the same time i was upon my way to antioch upon business of some importance but wrapped up in cares who is exempt from this inheritance i parted from my company and lost my way and lost my servants and my comrades cyprian tis singular that even within the sight of the high towers of antioch you could lose your way of all the avenues and green paths of this wild wood there is not one but leads as to its centre to the walls of antioch take which you will you cannot miss your road daemon and such is ignorance even in the sight of knowledge it can draw no profit from it but as it still is early and as i have no acquaintances in antioch being a stranger there i will even wait the few surviving hours of the day until the night shall conquer it i see both by your dress and by the books in which you find delight and company that you are a great student for my part i feel much sympathy in such pursuits note in transcr with cyprian have you studied much daemon no and yet i know enough not to be wholly ignorant cyprian pray sir what science may you know daemon many cyprian alas much pains must we expend on one alone and even then attain it not but you have the presumption to assert that you know many without study daemon and with truth for in the country whence i come the sciences require no learning they are known note come the sciencescome sciences cyprian oh would i were of that bright country for in this the more we study we the more discover our ignorance daemon it is so true that i had so much arrogance as to oppose the chair of the most high professorship and obtained many votes and though i lost the attempt was still more glorious than the failure could be dishonourable if you believe not let us refer it to dispute respecting that which you know the best and although i know not the opinion you maintain and though it be the true one i will take the contrary note the transcr wanting cyprian the offer gives me pleasure i am now debating with myself upon a passage of plinius and my mind is racked with doubt to understand and know who is the god of whom he speaks daemon it is a passage if i recollect it right couched in these words god is one supreme goodness one pure essence one substance and one sense all sight all hands cyprian tis true daemon what difficulty find you here cyprian i do not recognize among the gods the god defined by plinius if he must be supreme goodness even jupiter is not supremely good because we see his deeds are evil and his attributes tainted with mortal weakness in what manner can supreme goodness be consistent with the passions of humanity daemon the wisdom of the old world masked with the names of gods the attributes of nature and of man a sort of popular philosophy cyprian this reply will not satisfy me for such awe is due to the high name of god that ill should never be imputed then examining the question with more care it follows that the gods would always will that which is best were they supremely good how then does one will one thing one another and that you may not say that i allege poetical or philosophic learning consider the ambiguous responses of their oracular statues from two shrines two armies shall obtain the assurance of one victory is it not indisputable that two contending wills can never lead to the same end and being opposite if one be good is not the other evil evil in god is inconceivable but supreme goodness fails among the gods without their union note would transcr should daemon i deny your major these responses are means towards some end unfathomed by our intellectual beam they are the work of providence and more the battles loss may profit those who lose than victory advantage those who win cyprian that i admit and yet that god should not falsehood is incompatible with deity assure the victory it would be enough to have permitted the defeat if god be all sight god who had beheld the truth would not have given assurance of an end never to be accomplished thus although the deity may according to his attributes be well distinguished into persons yet even in the minutest circumstance his essence must be one note had transcr wanting daemon to attain the end the affections of the actors in the scene must have been thus influenced by his voice cyprian but for a purpose thus subordinate he might have employed genii good or evil a sort of spirits called so by the learned who roam about inspiring good or evil and from whose influence and existence we may well infer our immortality thus god might easily without descent to a gross falsehood in his proper person have moved the affections by this mediation to the just point note descent transcr descending daemon these trifling contradictions do not suffice to impugn the unity of the high gods in things of great importance they still appear unanimous consider that glorious fabric man his workmanship is stamped with one conception cyprian who made man must have methinks the advantage of the others if they are equal might they not have risen in opposition to the work and being all hands according to our author here have still destroyed even as the other made if equal in their power unequal only in opportunity which of the two will remain conqueror note unequal only transcr and only unequal daemon on impossible and false hypothesis there can be built no argument say what do you infer from this cyprian that there must be a mighty god of supreme goodness and of highest grace all sight all hands all truth infallible without an equal and without a rival the cause of all things and the effect of nothing one power one will one substance and one essence and in whatever persons one or two his attributes may be distinguished one sovereign power one solitary essence one cause of all cause note andquery ay they rise daemon how can i impugn so clear a consequence note all cause all things transcr cyprian do you regret my victory daemon who but regrets a check in rivalry of wit i could reply and urge new difficulties but will now depart for i hear steps of men approaching and it is time that i should now pursue my journey to the city cyprian go in peace daemon remain in peace since thus it profits him to study i will wrap his senses up in sweet oblivion of all thought but of a piece of excellent beauty and as i have power given me to wage enmity against justinas soul i will extract from one effect two vengeances aside and exit note stage direction so transcr exit cyprian i never met a more learned person let me now revolve this doubt again with careful mind he reads floro and lelio enter lelio here stop these toppling rocks and tangled boughs impenetrable by the noonday beam shall be sole witnesses of what we floro draw if there were words here is the place for deeds lelio thou needest not instruct me well i know that in the

and my vengeance floro from what rocks and desert cells enter moscon and clarin moscon run run for where we left my master i now hear the clash of swords notes i now hear transcr we hear lines of

antioch one of the noble race of the colalti the other son o the governor adventure and cast away on some slight cause no doubt two lives the honour of their country note race transcr men colalticolatti lelio cyprian although my high respect towards your person holds now my sword suspended thou canst not restore it to the slumber of the scabbard thou knowest more of science than the duel for when two men of honour take the field no counsel nor respect can make them friends but one must die in the dispute note of the transcr of its no counsel nor st edition no or no reasoning or transcr dispute transcr pursuit floro i pray that you depart hence with your people and leave us to finish what we have begun without advantage cyprian though you may imagine that i know little of the laws of duel which vanity and valour instituted you are in error by my birth i am held no less than yourselves to know the limits of honour and of infamy nor has study quenched the free spirit which first ordered them and thus to me as one well experienced in the false quicksands of the sea of honour you may refer the merits of the case and if i should perceive in your relation that either has the right to satisfaction from the other i give you my word of honour to leave you note well omit cj forman lelio under this condition then i will relate the cause and you will cede and must confess the impossibility of compromise for the same lady is beloved by floro and myself floro it seems much to me that the light of day should look upon that idol of my heart but he leave us to fight according to thy word cyprian permit one question further is the lady impossible to hope or not lelio she is so excellent that if the light of day should excite floros jealousy it were without just cause for even the light of day trembles to gaze on her cyprian would you for your part marry her floro such is my confidence cyprian and you lelio oh would that i could lift my hope so high for though she is extremely poor her virtue is her dowry cyprian and if you both would marry her is it not weak and vain culpable and unworthy thus beforehand to slur her honour what would the world say if one should slay the other and if she should afterwards espouse the murderer the rivals agree to refer their quarrel to cyprian who in consequence visits justina and becomes enamoured of her she disdains him and he retires to a solitary seashore scene cyprian o memory permit it not that the tyrant of my thought be another soul that still holds dominion oer the will that would refuse but can no more to bend to tremble and adore vain idolatry i saw and gazing became blind with error weak ambition which the awe of her presence bound to terror so beautiful she was and i between my love and jealousy am so convulsed with hope and fear unworthy as it may appear so bitter is the life i live that hear me hell i now would give to thy most detested spirit my soul for ever to inherit to suffer punishment and pine so this woman may be mine hearst thou hell dost thou reject it my soul is offered daemon unseen i accept it tempest with thunder and lightning cyprian what is this ye heavens for ever pure at once intensely radiant and obscure athwart the aethereal halls the lightnings arrow and the thunderballs the day affright as from the horizon round burst with earthquake sound in mighty torrents the electric fountains clouds quench the sun and thundersmoke strangles the air and fire eclipses heaven philosophy thou canst not even compel their causes underneath thy yoke from yonder clouds even to the waves below the fragments of a single ruin choke imaginations flight for on flakes of surge like feathers light the ashes of the desolation cast upon the gloomy blast tell of the footsteps of the storm and nearer see the melancholy form of a great ship the outcast of the sea drives miserably and it must fly the pity of the port or perish and its last and sole resort is its own raging enemy the terror of the thrilling cry was a fatal prophecy of coming death who hovers now upon that shattered prow that they who die not may be dying still and not alone the insane elements are populous with wild portents but that sad ship is as a miracle of sudden ruin for it drives so fast it seems as if it had arrayed its form with the headlong storm it strikes i almost feel the shock it stumbles on a jagged rock sparkles of blood on the white foam are cast a tempest all exclaim within we are all lost daemon within now from this plank will i pass to the land and thus fulfil my scheme cyprian as in contempt of the elemental rage a man comes forth in safety while the ships great form is in a watery eclipse obliterated from the oceans page and round its wreck the huge seamonsters sit a horrid conclave and the whistling wave is heaped over its carcase like a grave the daemon enters as escaped from the sea daemon aside it was essential to my purposes to wake a tumult on the sapphire ocean that in this unknown form i might at length wipe out the blot of the discomfiture sustained upon the mountain and assail with a new war the soul of cyprian forging the instruments of his destruction even from his love and from his wisdom o beloved earth dear mother in thy bosom i seek a refuge from the monster who precipitates itself upon me cyprian friend collect thyself and be the memory of thy late suffering and thy greatest sorrow but as a shadow of the past for nothing beneath the circle of the moon but flows and changes and can never know repose daemon and who art thou before whose feet my fate has prostrated me cyprian one who moved with pity would soothe its stings daemon oh that can never be no solace can my lasting sorrows find cyprian wherefore daemon because my happiness is lost yet i lament what has long ceased to be the object of desire or memory and my life is not life cyprian now since the fury of this earthquaking hurricane is still and the crystalline heaven has reassumed its windless calm so quickly that it seems as if its heavy wrath had been awakened only to overwhelm that vessel speak who art thou and whence comest thou daemon far more my coming hither cost than thou hast seen or i can tell among my misadventures this shipwreck is the least wilt thou hear cyprian speak daemon since thou desirest i will then unveil myself to thee for in myself i am a world of happiness and misery this i have lost and that i must lament forever in my attributes i stood so high and so heroically great in lineage so supreme and with a genius which penetrated with a glance the world beneath my feet that won by my high merit a king whom i may call the king of kings because all others tremble in their pride before the terrors of his countenance in his high palace roofed with brightest gems of living light call them the stars of heaven named me his counsellor but the high praise stung me with pride and envy and i rose in mighty competition to ascend his seat and place my foot triumphantly upon his subject thrones chastised i know the depth to which ambition falls too mad was the attempt and yet more mad were now repentance of the irrevocable deed therefore i chose this ruin with the glory of not to be subdued before the shame of reconciling me with him who reigns by coward cession nor was i alone nor am i now nor shall i be alone and there was hope and there may still be hope for many suffrages among his vassals hailed me their lord and king and many still are mine and many more perchance shall be thus vanquished though in fact victorious i left his seat of empire from mine eye shooting forth poisonous lightning while my words with inauspicious thunderings shook heaven proclaiming vengeance public as my wrong and imprecating on his prostrate slaves rapine and death and outrage then i sailed over the mighty fabric of the world a pirate ambushed in its pathless sands a lynx crouched watchfully among its caves and craggy shores and i have wandered over the expanse of these wide wildernesses in this great ship whose bulk is now dissolved in the light breathings of the invisible wind and which the sea has made a dustless ruin seeking ever a mountain through whose forests i seek a man whom i must now compel to keep his word with me i came arrayed in tempest and although my power could well bridle the forest winds in their career for other causes i forbore to soothe their fury to favonian gentleness i could and would not aside thus i wake in him a love of magic art let not this tempest nor the

billows from the deep up to the rocks and rocks and ocean onward with spheres which never sleep are hurried in eternal motion michael and tempests in contention roar from land to sea from sea to land and raging weave a chain of power which girds the earth as with a band a flashing desolation there flames before the thunders way but thy servants lord revere the gentle changes of thy day chorus of the three the angels draw strength from thy glance though no one comprehend thee may thy worlds unwithered countenance is bright as on creations day note raphael the sun sounds according to ancient custom in the song of emulation of his brotherspheres and its forewritten circle fulfils with a step of thunder its countenance gives the angels strength though no one can fathom it the incredible high works are excellent as at the first day gabriel and swift and inconceivably swift the adornment of earth winds itself round and exchanges paradiseclearness with deep dreadful night the sea foams

joy it bears yet all things far and all things near are vain to calm the deep emotions of his breast the lord though he now serves me in a cloud of error i will soon lead him forth to the clear day when trees look green full well the gardener knows that fruits and blooms will deck the coming year mephistopheles what will you bet now am sure of winning only observe you give me full permission to lead him softly on my path the lord as long as he shall live upon the earth so long is nothing unto thee forbidden man must err till he has ceased to struggle mephistopheles thanks and that is all i ask for willingly i never make acquaintance with the dead the full fresh cheeks of youth are food for me and if a corpse knocks i am not at home for i am like a cat i like to play a little with the

limits of its love and seize with sweet and melancholy thoughts the floating phantoms of its loveliness heaven closes the archangels exeunt mephistopheles from time to time i visit the old fellow and

are such as may not find comparison on earth behold the chariot of the fairy queen celestial coursers paw the unyielding air their filmy pennons at her word they furl and stop obedient to the reins of light these the queen of spells drew in she spread a charm around the spot and leaning graceful from the aethereal car long did she gaze and silently upon the slumbering maid oh not the visioned poet in his dreams when silvery clouds float through the wildered brain when every sight of lovely wild and grand astonishes enraptures elevates when fancy at a glance combines the wondrous and the beautiful so bright so fair so wild a shape hath ever yet beheld as that which reined the coursers of the air and poured the magic of her gaze upon the maidens sleep the broad and yellow moon shone dimly through her form that form of faultless symmetry the pearly and pellucid car moved not the moonlights line twas not an earthly pageant those who had looked upon the sight passing all human glory saw not the yellow moon saw not the mortal scene heard not the nightwinds rush heard not an earthly sound saw but the fairy pageant heard but the heavenly strains that filled the lonely dwelling the fairys frame was slight yon fibrous cloud that catches but the palest tinge of even and which the straining eye can hardly seize when melting into eastern twilights shadow were scarce so thin so slight but the fair star that gems the glittering coronet of morn sheds not a light so mild so powerful as that which bursting from the fairys form spread a purpureal halo round the scene yet with an undulating motion swayed to her outline gracefully from her celestial car the fairy queen descended and thrice she waved her wand circled with wreaths of amaranth her thin and misty form moved with the moving air and the clear silver tones as thus she spoke were such as are unheard by all but gifted ear fairy stars your balmiest influence shed elements your wrath suspend sleep ocean in the rocky bounds that circle thy domain let not a breath be seen to stir around yon grassgrown ruins height let even the restless gossamer sleep on the moveless air soul of ianthe thou judged alone worthy of the envied boon that waits the good and the sincere that waits those who have struggled and with resolute will vanquished earths pride and meanness burst the chains the icy chains of custom and have shone the daystars of their age soul of ianthe awake arise sudden arose ianthes soul it stood all beautiful in naked purity the perfect semblance of its bodily frame instinct with inexpressible beauty and grace each stain of earthliness had passed away it reassumed its native dignity and stood immortal amid ruin upon the couch the body lay wrapped in the depth of slumber its features were fixed and meaningless yet animal life was there and every organ yet performed its natural functions twas a sight of wonder to behold the body and soul the selfsame lineaments the same marks of identity were there yet oh how different one aspires to heaven pants for its sempiternal heritage and everchanging everrising still wantons in endless being the other for a time the unwilling sport of circumstance and passion struggles on fleets through its sad duration rapidly then like an useless and wornout machine rots perishes and passes fairy spirit who hast dived so deep spirit who hast soared so high thou the fearless thou the mild accept the boon thy worth hath earned ascend the car with me spirit do i dream is this new feeling but a visioned ghost of slumber if indeed i am a soul a free a disembodied soul speak again to me fairy i am the fairy mab to me tis given the wonders of the human world to keep the secrets of the immeasurable past in the unfailing consciences of men those stern unflattering chroniclers i find the future from the causes which arise in each event i gather not the sting which retributive memory implants in the hard bosom of the selfish man nor that ecstatic and exulting throb which virtues votary feels when he sums up the thoughts and actions of a wellspent day are unforeseen unregistered by me and it is yet permitted me to rend the veil of mortal frailty that the spirit clothed in its changeless purity may know how soonest to accomplish the great end for which it hath its being and may taste that peace which in the end all life will share this is the meed of virtue happy soul ascend the car with me the chains of earths immurement fell from ianthes spirit they shrank and brake like bandages of straw beneath a wakened giants strength she knew her glorious change and felt in apprehension uncontrolled new raptures opening round each daydream of her mortal life each frenzied vision of the slumbers that closed each wellspent day seemed now to meet reality the fairy and the soul proceeded the silver clouds disparted and as the car of magic they ascended again the speechless music swelled again the coursers of the air unfurled their azure pennons and the queen shaking the beamy reins bade them pursue their way the magic car moved on the night was fair and countless stars studded heavens dark blue vault just oer the eastern wave peeped the first faint smile of morn the magic car moved on from the celestial hoofs the atmosphere in flaming sparkles flew and where the burning wheels eddied above the mountains loftiest peak was traced a line of lightning now it flew far above a rock the utmost verge of earth the rival of the andes whose dark brow lowered oer the silver sea far far below the chariots path calm as a slumbering babe tremendous ocean lay the mirror of its stillness showed the pale and waning stars the chariots fiery track and the gray light of morn tinging those fleecy clouds that canopied the dawn seemed it that the chariots way lay through the midst of an immense concave radiant with million constellations tinged with shades of infinite colour and semicircled with a belt flashing incessant meteors the magic car moved on as they approached their goal the coursers seemed to gather speed the sea no longer was distinguished earth appeared a vast and shadowy sphere the suns unclouded orb rolled through the black concave its rays of rapid light parted around the chariots swifter course and fell like oceans feathery spray dashed from the boiling surge before a vessels prow the magic car moved on earths distant orb appeared the smallest light that twinkles in the heaven whilst round the chariots way innumerable systems rolled and countless spheres diffused an evervarying glory it was a sight of wonder some were horned like the crescent moon some shed a mild and silver beam like hesperus oer the western sea some dashed athwart with trains of flame like worlds to death and ruin driven some shone like suns and as the chariot passed eclipsed all other light spirit of nature here in this interminable wilderness of worlds at whose immensity even soaring fancy staggers here is thy fitting temple yet not the lightest leaf that quivers to the passing breeze is less instinct with thee yet not the meanest worm that lurks in graves and fattens on the dead less shares thy eternal breath spirit of nature thou imperishable as this scene here is thy fitting temple if solitude hath ever led thy steps to the wild oceans echoing shore and thou hast lingered there until the suns broad orb seemed resting on the burnished wave thou must have marked the lines of purple gold that motionless hung oer the sinking sphere thou must have marked the billowy clouds edged with intolerable radiancy towering like rocks of jet crowned with a diamond wreath and yet there is a moment when the suns highest point peeps like a star oer oceans western edge when those far clouds of feathery gold shaded with deepest purple gleam like islands on a dark blue sea then has thy fancy soared above the earth and furled its wearied wing within the fairys fane yet not the golden islands gleaming in yon flood of light nor the feathery curtains stretching oer the suns bright couch nor the burnished ocean waves paving that gorgeous dome so fair so wonderful a sight as mabs aethereal palace could afford yet likest evenings vault that faery hall as heaven low resting on the wave it spread its floors of flashing light its vast and azure dome its fertile golden islands floating on a silver sea whilst suns their mingling beamings darted through clouds of circumambient darkness and pearly battlements around looked oer the immense of heaven the magic car no longer moved the fairy and the spirit entered the hall of spells those golden clouds that rolled in glittering billows beneath the azure canopy with the aethereal footsteps trembled not the light and crimson mists floating to strains of thrilling melody through that unearthly dwelling yielded to every movement of the will upon their passive swell the spirit leaned and for the varied bliss that pressed around used not the glorious privilege of virtue and of wisdom spirit the fairy said and pointed to the gorgeous dome this is a wondrous sight and mocks all human grandeur but were it virtues only meed to dwell in a celestial palace all resigned to pleasurable impulses immured within the prison of itself the will of changeless nature would be unfulfilled learn to make others happy spirit come this is thine high reward the past shall rise thou shalt behold the present i will teach the secrets of the future the fairy and the spirit approached the overhanging battlement below lay stretched the universe there far as the remotest line that bounds imaginations flight countless and unending orbs in mazy motion intermingled yet still fulfilled immutably eternal natures law above below around the circling systems formed a wilderness of harmony each with undeviating aim in eloquent silence through the depths of space pursued its wondrous way there was a little light that twinkled in the misty distance none but a spirits eye might ken that rolling orb none but a spirits eye and in no other place but that celestial dwelling might behold each action of this earths inhabitants but matter space and time in those aereal mansions cease to act and allprevailing wisdom when it reaps the harvest of its excellence oerbounds those obstacles of which an earthly soul fears to attempt the conquest the fairy pointed to the earth the spirits intellectual eye its kindred beings recognized the thronging thousands to a passing view seemed like an anthills citizens how wonderful that even the passions prejudices interests that sway the meanest being the weak touch that moves the finest nerve and in one human brain causes the faintest thought becomes a link in the great chain of nature behold the fairy cried palmyras ruined palaces behold where grandeur frowned behold where pleasure smiled what now remains the memory of senselessness and shame what is immortal there nothing it stands to tell a melancholy tale to give an awful warning soon oblivion will steal silently the remnant of its fame monarchs and conquerors there proud oer prostrate millions trod the earthquakes of the human race like them forgotten when the ruin that marks their shock is past beside the eternal nile the pyramids have risen nile shall pursue his changeless way those pyramids shall fall yea not a stone shall stand to tell the spot whereon they stood their very site shall be forgotten as is their builders name behold yon sterile spot where now the wandering arabs tent flaps in the desertblast there once old salems haughty fane reared high to heaven its thousand golden domes and in the blushing face of day exposed its shameful glory oh many a widow many an orphan cursed the building of that fane and many a father worn out with toil and slavery implored the poor mans god to sweep it from the earth and spare his children the detested task of piling stone on stone and poisoning the choicest days of life to soothe a dotards vanity there an inhuman and uncultured race howled hideous praises to their demongod they rushed to war tore from the mothers womb the unborn child old age and infancy promiscuous perished their victorious arms left not a soul to breathe oh they were fiends but what was he who taught them that the god of nature and benevolence hath given a special sanction to the trade of blood his name and theirs are fading and the tales of this barbarian nation which imposture recites till terror credits are pursuing itself into forgetfulness where athens rome and sparta stood there is a moral desert now the mean and miserable huts the yet more wretched palaces contrasted with those ancient fanes now crumbling to oblivion the long and lonely colonnades through which the ghost of freedom stalks seem like a wellknown tune which in some dear scene we have loved to hear remembered now in sadness but oh how much more changed how gloomier is the contrast of human nature there where socrates expired a tyrants slave a coward and a fool spreads death around then shuddering meets his own where cicero and antoninus lived a cowled and hypocritical monk prays curses and deceives spirit ten thousand years have scarcely passed away since in the waste where now the savage drinks his enemys blood and aping europes sons wakes the unholy song of war arose a stately city metropolis of the western continent there now the mossy columnstone indented by times unrelaxing grasp which once appeared to brave all save its countrys ruin there the wide forest scene rude in the uncultivated loveliness of gardens long run wild seems to the unwilling sojourner whose steps chance in that desert has delayed thus to have stood since earth was what it is yet once it was the busiest haunt whither as to a common centre flocked strangers and ships and merchandise once peace and freedom blessed the cultivated plain but wealth that curse of man blighted the bud of its prosperity virtue and wisdom truth and liberty fled to return not until man shall know that they alone can give the bliss worthy a soul that claims its kindred with eternity theres not one atom of yon earth but once was living man nor the minutest drop of rain that hangeth in its thinnest cloud but flowed in human veins and from the burning plains where libyan monsters yell from the most gloomy glens of greenlands sunless clime to where the golden fields of fertile england spread their harvest to the day thou canst not find one spot whereon no city stood how strange is human pride i tell thee that those living things to whom the fragile blade of grass that springeth in the morn and perisheth ere noon is an unbounded world i tell thee that those viewless beings whose mansion is the smallest particle of the impassive atmosphere think feel and live like man that their affections and antipathies like his produce the laws ruling their moral state and the minutest throb that through their frame diffuses the slightest faintest motion is fixed and indispensable as the majestic laws that rule yon rolling orbs the fairy paused the spirit in ecstasy of admiration felt all knowledge of the past revived the events of old and wondrous times which dim tradition interruptedly teaches the credulous vulgar were unfolded in just perspective to the view yet dim from their infinitude the spirit seemed to stand high on an isolated pinnacle the flood of ages combating below the depth of the unbounded universe above and all around natures unchanging harmony fairy the spirit said and on the queen of spells fixed her aethereal eyes i thank thee thou hast given a boon which i will not resign and taught a lesson not to be unlearned i know the past and thence i will essay to glean a warning for the future so that man may profit by his errors and derive experience from his folly for when the power of imparting joy is equal to the will the human soul requires no other heaven mab turn thee surpassing spirit much yet remains unscanned thou knowest how great is man thou knowest his imbecility yet learn thou what he is yet learn the lofty destiny which restless time prepares for every living soul behold a gorgeous palace that amid yon populous city rears its thousand towers and seems itself a city gloomy troops of sentinels in stern and silent ranks encompass it around the dweller there cannot be free and happy hearest thou not the curses of the fatherless the groans of those who have no friend he passes on the king the wearer of a gilded chain that binds his soul to abjectness the fool whom courtiers nickname monarch whilst a slave even to the basest appetites that man heeds not the shriek of penury he smiles at the deep curses which the destitute mutter in secret and a sullen joy pervades his bloodless heart when thousands groan but for those morsels which his wantonness wastes in unjoyous revelry to save all that they love from famine when he hears the tale of horror to some readymade face of hypocritical assent he turns smothering the glow of shame that spite of him flushes his bloated cheek now to the meal of silence grandeur and excess he drags his palled unwilling appetite if gold gleaming around and numerous viands culled from every clime could force the loathing sense to overcome satiety if wealth the spring it draws from poisons not or vice unfeeling stubborn vice converteth not its food to deadliest venom then that king is happy and the peasant who fulfils his unforced task when he returns at even and by the blazing faggot meets again her welcome for whom all his toil is sped tastes not a sweeter meal behold him now stretched on the gorgeous couch his fevered brain reels dizzily awhile but ah too soon the slumber of intemperance subsides and conscience that undying serpent calls her venomous brood to their nocturnal task listen he speaks oh mark that frenzied eye oh mark that deadly visage king no cessation oh must this last for ever awful death i wish yet fear to clasp thee not one moment of dreamless sleep o dear and blessed peace why dost thou shroud thy vestal purity in penury and dungeons wherefore lurkest with danger death and solitude yet shunnst the palace i have built thee sacred peace oh visit me but once but pitying shed one drop of balm upon my withered soul the fairy vain man that palace is the virtuous heart and peace defileth not her snowy robes in such a shed as thine hark yet he mutters his slumbers are but varied agonies they prey like scorpions on the springs of life there needeth not the hell that bigots frame to punish those who err earth in itself contains at once the evil and the cure and allsufficing nature can chastise those who transgress her law she only knows how justly to proportion to the fault the punishment it merits is it strange that this poor wretch should pride him in his woe take pleasure in his abjectness and hug the scorpion that consumes him is it strange that placed on a conspicuous throne of thorns grasping an iron sceptre and immured within a splendid prison whose stern bounds shut him from all thats good or dear on earth his soul asserts not its humanity that mans mild nature rises not in war against a kings employ no tis not strange he like the vulgar thinks feels acts and lives just as his father did the unconquered powers of precedent and custom interpose between a king and virtue stranger yet to those who know not nature nor deduce the future from the present it may seem that not one slave who suffers from the crimes of this unnatural being not one wretch whose children famish and whose nuptial bed is earths unpitying bosom rears an arm to dash him from his throne those gilded flies that basking in the sunshine of a court fatten on its corruption what are they the drones of the community they feed on the mechanics labour the starved hind for them compels the stubborn glebe to yield its unshared harvests and yon squalid form leaner than fleshless misery that wastes a sunless life in the unwholesome mine drags out in labour a protracted death to glut their grandeur many faint with toil that few may know the cares and woe of sloth whence thinkst thou kings and parasites arose whence that unnatural line of drones who heap toil and unvanquishable penury on those who build their palaces and bring their daily bread from vice black loathsome vice from rapine madness treachery and wrong from all that genders misery and makes of earth this thorny wilderness from lust revenge and murderand when reasons voice loud as the voice of nature shall have waked the nations and mankind perceive that vice is discord war and misery that virtue is peace and happiness and harmony when mans maturer nature shall disdain the playthings of its childhood kingly glare will lose its power to dazzle its authority will silently pass by the gorgeous throne shall stand unnoticed in the regal hall fast falling to decay whilst falsehoods trade shall be as hateful and unprofitable as that of truth is now where is the fame which the vainglorious mighty of the earth seek to eternize oh the faintest sound from times light footfall the minutest wave that swells the flood of ages whelms in nothing the unsubstantial bubble ay today stern is the tyrants mandate red the gaze that flashes desolation strong the arm that scatters multitudes tomorrow comes that mandate is a thunderpeal that died in ages past that gaze a transient flash on which the midnight closed and on that arm the worm has made his meal the virtuous man who great in his humility as kings are little in their grandeur he who leads invincibly a life of resolute good and stands amid the silent dungeon depths more free and fearless than the trembling judge who clothed in venal power vainly strove to bind the impassive spirit when he falls his mild eye beams benevolence no more withered the hand outstretched but to relieve sunk reasons simple eloquence that rolled but to appal the guilty yes the grave hath quenched that eye and deaths relentless frost withered that arm but the unfading fame which virtue hangs upon its votarys tomb the deathless memory of that man whom kings call to their mind and tremble the remembrance with which the happy spirit contemplates its wellspent pilgrimage on earth shall never pass away nature rejects the monarch not the man the subject not the citizen for kings and subjects mutual foes forever play a losing game into each others hands whose stakes are vice and misery the man of virtuous soul commands not nor obeys power like a desolating pestilence pollutes whateer it touches and obedience bane of all genius virtue freedom truth makes slaves of men and of the human frame a mechanized automaton when nero high over flaming rome with savage joy lowered like a fiend drank with enraptured ear the shrieks of agonizing death beheld the frightful desolation spread and felt a newcreated sense within his soul thrill to the sight and vibrate to the sound thinkst thou his grandeur had not overcome the force of human kindness and when rome with one stern blow hurled not the tyrant down crushed not the arm red with her dearest blood had not submissive abjectness destroyed natures suggestions look on yonder earth the golden harvests spring the unfailing sun sheds light and life the fruits the flowers the trees arise in due succession all things speak peace harmony and love the universe in natures silent eloquence declares that all fulfil the works of love and joy all but the outcast man he fabricates the sword which stabs his peace he cherisheth the snakes that gnaw his heart he raiseth up the tyrant whose delight is in his woe whose sport is in his agony yon sun lights it the great alone yon silver beams sleep they less sweetly on the cottage thatch than on the dome of kings is mother earth a stepdame to her numerous sons who earn her unshared gifts with unremitting toil a mother only to those puling babes who nursed in ease and luxury make men the playthings of their babyhood and mar in selfimportant childishness that peace which men alone appreciate spirit of nature no the pure diffusion of thy essence throbs alike in every human heart thou aye erectest there thy throne of power unappealable thou art the judge beneath whose nod mans brief and frail authority is powerless as the wind that passeth idly by thine the tribunal which surpasseth the show of human justice as god surpasses man spirit of nature thou life of interminable multitudes soul of those mighty spheres whose changeless paths through heavens deep silence lie soul of that smallest being the dwelling of whose life is one faint april sungleam man like these passive things thy will unconsciously fulfilleth like theirs his age of endless peace which time is fast maturing will swiftly surely come and the unbounded frame which thou pervadest will be without a flaw marring its perfect symmetry how beautiful this night the balmiest sigh which vernal zephyrs breathe in evenings ear were discord to the speaking quietude that wraps this moveless scene heavens ebon vault studded with stars unutterably bright through which the moons unclouded grandeur rolls seems like a canopy which love had spread to curtain her sleeping world yon gentle hills robed in a garment of untrodden snow yon darksome rocks whence icicles depend so stainless that their white and glittering spires tinge not the moons pure beam yon castled steep whose banner hangeth oer the timeworn tower so idly that rapt fancy deemeth it a metaphor of peace all form a scene where musing solitude might love to lift her soul above this sphere of earthliness where silence undisturbed might watch alone so cold so bright so still the orb of day in southern climes oer oceans waveless field sinks sweetly smiling not the faintest breath steals oer the unruffled deep the clouds of eve reflect unmoved the lingering beam of day and vespers image on the western main is beautifully still tomorrow comes cloud upon cloud in dark and deepening mass roll oer the blackened waters the deep roar of distant thunder mutters awfully tempest unfolds its pinion oer the gloom that shrouds the boiling surge the pitiless fiend with all his winds and lightnings tracks his prey the torn deep yawns the vessel finds a grave beneath its jagged gulf ah whence yon glare that fires the arch of heaven that dark red smoke blotting the silver moon the stars are quenched in darkness and the pure and spangling snow gleams faintly through the gloom that gathers round hark to that roar whose swift and deafning peals in countless echoes through the mountains ring startling pale midnight on her starry throne now swells the intermingling din the jar frequent and frightful of the bursting bomb the falling beam the shriek the groan the shout the ceaseless clangour and the rush of men inebriate with rage loud and more loud the discord grows till pale death shuts the scene and oer the conqueror and the conquered draws his cold and bloody shroud of all the men whom days departing beam saw blooming there in proud and vigorous health of all the hearts that beat with anxious life at sunset there how few survive how few are beating now all is deep silence like the fearful calm that slumbers in the storms portentous pause save when the frantic wail of widowed love comes shuddering on the blast or the faint moan with which some soul bursts from the frame of clay wrapped round its struggling powers the gray morn dawns on the mournful scene the sulphurous smoke before the icy wind slow rolls away and the bright beams of frosty morning dance along the spangling snow there tracks of blood even to the forests depth and scattered arms and lifeless warriors whose hard lineaments deaths self could change not mark the dreadful path of the outsallying victors far behind black ashes note where their proud city stood within yon forest is a gloomy glen each tree which guards its darkness from the day waves oer a warriors tomb i see thee shrink surpassing spirit wert thou human else i see a shade of doubt and horror fleet across thy stainless features yet fear not this is no unconnected misery nor stands uncaused and irretrievable mans evil nature that apology which kings who rule and cowards who crouch set up for their unnumbered crimes sheds not the blood which desolates the discordwasted land from kings and priests and statesmen war arose whose safety is mans deep unbettered woe whose grandeur his debasement let the axe strike at the root the poisontree will fall and where its venomed exhalations spread ruin and death and woe where millions lay quenching the serpents famine and their bones bleaching unburied in the putrid blast a garden shall arise in loveliness surpassing fabled eden hath natures soul that formed this world so beautiful that spread earths lap with plenty and lifes smallest chord strung to unchanging unison that gave the happy birds their dwelling in the grove that yielded to the wanderers of the deep the lovely silence of the unfathomed main and filled the meanest worm that crawls in dust with spirit thought and love on man alone partial in causeless malice wantonly heaped ruin vice and slavery his soul blasted with withering curses placed afar the meteorhappiness that shuns his grasp but serving on the frightful gulf to glare rent wide beneath his footsteps nature no kings priests and statesmen blast the human flower even in its tender bud their influence darts like subtle poison through the bloodless veins of desolate society the child ere he can lisp his mothers sacred name swells with the unnatural pride of crime and lifts his babysword even in a heros mood this infantarm becomes the bloodiest scourge of devastated earth whilst specious names learned in soft childhoods unsuspecting hour serve as the sophisms with which manhood dims bright reasons ray and sanctifies the sword upraised to shed a brothers innocent blood let priestled slaves cease to proclaim that man inherits vice and misery when force and falsehood hang even oer the cradled babe stifling with rudest grasp all natural good ah to the strangersoul when first it peeps from its new tenement and looks abroad for happiness and sympathy how stern and desolate a tract is this wide world how withered all the buds of natural good no shade no shelter from the sweeping storms of pitiless power on its wretched frame poisoned perchance by the disease and woe heaped on the wretched parent whence it sprung by morals law and custom the pure winds of heaven that renovate the insect tribes may breathe not the untainting light of day may visit not its longings it is bound ere it has life yea all the chains are forged long ere its being all liberty and love and peace is torn from its defencelessness cursed from its birth even from its cradle doomed to abjectness and bondage throughout this varied and eternal world soul is the only element the block that for uncounted ages has remained the moveless pillar of a mountains weight is active living spirit every grain is sentient both in unity and part and the minutest atom comprehends a world of loves and hatreds these beget evil and good hence truth and falsehood spring hence will and thought and action all the germs of pain or pleasure sympathy or hate that variegate the eternal universe soul is not more polluted than the beams of heavens pure orb ere round their rapid lines the taint of earthborn atmospheres arise man is of soul and body formed for deeds of high resolve on fancys boldest wing to soar unwearied fearlessly to turn the keenest pangs to peacefulness and taste the joys which mingled sense and spirit yield or he is formed for abjectness and woe to grovel on the dunghill of his fears to shrink at every sound to quench the flame of natural love in sensualism to know that hour as blessed when on his worthless days the frozen hand of death shall set its seal yet fear the cure though hating the disease the one is man that shall hereafter be the other man as vice has made him now war is the statesmans game the priests delight the lawyers jest the hired assassins trade and to those royal murderers whose mean thrones are bought by crimes of treachery and gore the bread they eat the staff on which they lean guards garbed in bloodred livery surround their palaces participate the crimes that force defends and from a nations rage secure the crown which all the curses reach that famine frenzy woe and penury breathe these are the hired bravos who defend the tyrants throne the bullies of his fear these are the sinks and channels of worst vice the refuse of society the dregs of all that is most vile their cold hearts blend deceit with sternness ignorance with pride all that is mean and villanous with rage which hopelessness of good and selfcontempt alone might kindle they are decked in wealth honour and power then are sent abroad to do their work the pestilence that stalks in gloomy triumph through some eastern land is less destroying they cajole with gold and promises of fame the thoughtless youth already crushed with servitude he knows his wretchedness too late and cherishes repentance for his ruin when his doom is sealed in gold and blood those too the tyrant serve who skilled to snare the feet of justice in the toils of law stand ready to oppress the weaker still and right or wrong will vindicate for gold sneering at public virtue which beneath their pitiless tread lies torn and trampled where honour sits smiling at the sale of truth then grave and hoaryheaded hypocrites without a hope a passion or a love who through a life of luxury and lies have crept by flattery to the seats of power support the system whence their honours flow they have three words well tyrants know their use well pay them for the loan with usury torn from a bleeding world god hell and heaven a vengeful pitiless and almighty fiend whose mercy is a nickname for the rage of tameless tigers hungering for blood hell a red gulf of everlasting fire where poisonous and undying worms prolong eternal misery to those hapless slaves whose life has been a penance for its crimes and heaven a meed for those who dare belie their human nature quake believe and cringe before the mockeries of earthly power these tools the tyrant tempers to his work wields in his wrath and as he wills destroys omnipotent in wickedness the while youth springs age moulders manhood tamely does his bidding bribed by shortlived joys to lend force to the weakness of his trembling arm they rise they fall one generation comes yielding its harvest to destructions scythe it fades another blossoms yet behold red glows the tyrants stampmark on its bloom withering and cankering deep its passive prime he has invented lying words and modes empty and vain as his own coreless heart evasive meanings nothings of much sound to lure the heedless victim to the toils spread round the valley of its paradise look to thyself priest conqueror or prince whether thy trade is falsehood and thy lusts deep wallow in the earnings of the poor with whom thy master was or thou delightst in numbering oer the myriads of thy slain all misery weighing nothing in the scale against thy shortlived fame or thou dost load with cowardice and crime the groaning land a pompfed king look to thy wretched self ay art thou not the veriest slave that eer crawled on the loathing earth are not thy days days of unsatisfying listlessness dost thou not cry ere nights long rack is oer when will the morning come is not thy youth a vain and feverish dream of sensualism thy manhood blighted with unripe disease are not thy views of unregretted death drear comfortless and horrible thy mind is it not morbid as thy nerveless frame incapable of judgement hope or love and dost thou wish the errors to survive that bar thee from all sympathies of good after the miserable interest thou holdst in their protraction when the grave has swallowed up thy memory and thyself dost thou desire the bane that poisons earth to twine its roots around thy coffined clay spring from thy bones and blossom on thy tomb that of its fruit thy babes may eat and die note secures edition thus do the generations of the earth go to the grave and issue from the womb surviving still the imperishable change that renovates the world even as the leaves which the keen frostwind of the waning year has scattered on the forest soil and heaped for many seasons there though long they choke loading with loathsome rottenness the land all germs of promise yet when the tall trees from which they fell shorn of their lovely shapes lie level with the earth to moulder there they fertilize the land they long deformed till from the breathing lawn a forest springs of youth integrity and loveliness like that which gave it life to spring and die thus suicidal selfishness that blights the fairest feelings of the opening heart is destined to decay whilst from the soil shall spring all virtue all delight all love and judgement cease to wage unnatural war with passions unsubduable array twinsister of religion selfishness rival in crime and falsehood aping all the wanton horrors of her bloody play yet frozen unimpassioned spiritless shunning the light and owning not its name compelled by its deformity to screen with flimsy veil of justice and of right its unattractive lineaments that scare all save the brood of ignorance at once the cause and the effect of tyranny unblushing hardened sensual and vile dead to all love but of its abjectness with heart impassive by more noble powers than unshared pleasure sordid gain or fame despising its own miserable being which still it longs yet fears to disenthrall hence commerce springs the venal interchange of all that human art or nature yield which wealth should purchase not but want demand and natural kindness hasten to supply from the full fountain of its boundless love for ever stifled drained and tainted now commerce beneath whose poisonbreathing shade no solitary virtue dares to spring but poverty and wealth with equal hand scatter their withering curses and unfold the doors of premature and violent death to pining famine and fullfed disease to all that shares the lot of human life which poisoned body and soul scarce drags the chain that lengthens as it goes and clanks behind commerce has set the mark of selfishness the signet of its allenslaving power upon a shining ore and called it gold before whose image bow the vulgar great the vainly rich the miserable proud the mob of peasants nobles priests and kings and with blind feelings reverence the power that grinds them to the dust of misery but in the temple of their hireling hearts gold is a living god and rules in scorn all earthly things but virtue since tyrants by the sale of human life heap luxuries to their sensualism and fame to their widewasting and insatiate pride success has sanctioned to a credulous world the ruin the disgrace the woe of war his hosts of blind and unresisting dupes the despot numbers from his cabinet these puppets of his schemes he moves at will even as the slaves by force or famine driven beneath a vulgar master to perform a task of cold and brutal drudgery hardened to hope insensible to fear scarce living pulleys of a dead machine mere wheels of work and articles of trade that grace the proud and noisy pomp of wealth the harmony and happiness of man yields to the wealth of nations that which lifts his nature to the heaven of its pride is bartered for the poison of his soul the weight that drags to earth his towering hopes blighting all prospect but of selfish gain withering all passion but of slavish fear extinguishing all free and generous love of enterprise and daring even the pulse that fancy kindles in the beating heart to mingle with sensation it destroys leaves nothing but the sordid lust of self the grovelling hope of interest and gold unqualified unmingled unredeemed even by hypocrisy and statesmen boast of wealth the wordy eloquence that lives after the ruin of their hearts can gild the bitter poison of a nations woe can turn the worship of the servile mob to their corrupt and glaring idol fame from virtue trampled by its iron tread although its dazzling pedestal be raised amid the horrors of a limbstrewn field with desolated dwellings smoking round the man of ease who by his warm fireside to deeds of charitable intercourse and bare fulfilment of the common laws of decency and prejudice confines the struggling nature of his human heart is duped by their cold sophistry he sheds a passing tear perchance upon the wreck of earthly peace when near his dwellings door the frightful waves are driven when his son is murdered by the tyrant or religion drives his wife raving mad but the poor man whose life is misery and fear and care whom the morn wakens but to fruitless toil who ever hears his famished offsprings scream whom their pale mothers uncomplaining gaze for ever meets and the proud rich mans eye flashing command and the heartbreaking scene of thousands like himself he little heeds the rhetoric of tyranny his hate is quenchless as his wrongs he laughs to scorn the vain and bitter mockery of words feeling the horror of the tyrants deeds and unrestrained but by the arm of power that knows and dreads his enmity the iron rod of penury still compels her wretched slave to bow the knee to wealth and poison with unprofitable toil a life too void of solace to confirm the very chains that bind him to his doom nature impartial in munificence has gifted man with allsubduing will matter with all its transitory shapes lies subjected and plastic at his feet that weak from bondage tremble as they tread how many a rustic milton has passed by stifling the speechless longings of his heart in unremitting drudgery and care how many a vulgar cato has compelled his energies no longer tameless then to mould a pin or fabricate a nail how many a newton to whose passive ken those mighty spheres that gem infinity were only specks of tinsel fixed in heaven to light the midnights of his native town yet every heart contains perfections germ the wisest of the sages of the earth that ever from the stores of reason drew science and truth and virtues dreadless tone were but a weak and inexperienced boy proud sensual unimpassioned unimbued with pure desire and universal love compared to that high being of cloudless brain untainted passion elevated will which death who even would linger long in awe within his noble presence and beneath his changeless eyebeam might alone subdue him every slave now dragging through the filth of some corrupted city his sad life pining with famine swoln with luxury blunting the keenness of his spiritual sense with narrow schemings and unworthy cares or madly rushing through all violent crime to move the deep stagnation of his soul might imitate and equal but mean lust has bound its chains so tight around the earth that all within it but the virtuous man is venal gold or fame will surely reach the price prefixed by selfishness to all but him of resolute and unchanging will whom nor the plaudits of a servile crowd nor the vile joys of tainting luxury can bribe to yield his elevated soul to tyranny or falsehood though they wield with bloodred hand the sceptre of the world all things are sold the very light of heaven is venal earths unsparing gifts of love the smallest and most despicable things that lurk in the abysses of the deep all objects of our life even life itself and the poor pittance which the laws allow of liberty the fellowship of man those duties which his heart of human love should urge him to perform instinctively are bought and sold as in a public mart of undisguising selfishness that sets on each its price the stampmark of her reign even love is sold the solace of all woe is turned to deadliest agony old age shivers in selfish beautys loathing arms and youths corrupted impulses prepare a life of horror from the blighting bane of commerce whilst the pestilence that springs from unenjoying sensualism has filled all human life with hydraheaded woes falsehood demands but gold to pay the pangs of outraged conscience for the slavish priest sets no great value on his hireling faith a little passing pomp some servile souls whom cowardice itself might safely chain or the spare mite of avarice could bribe to deck the triumph of their languid zeal can make him minister to tyranny more daring crime requires a loftier meed without a shudder the slavesoldier lends his arm to murderous deeds and steels his heart when the dread eloquence of dying men low mingling on the lonely field of fame assails that nature whose applause he sells for the gross blessings of a patriot mob for the vile gratitude of heartless kings and for a cold worlds good word viler still there is a nobler glory which survives until our being fades and solacing all human care accompanies its change deserts not virtue in the dungeons gloom and in the precincts of the palace guides its footsteps through that labyrinth of crime imbues his lineaments with dauntlessness even when from powers avenging hand he takes its sweetest last and noblest title death the consciousness of good which neither gold nor sordid fame nor hope of heavenly bliss can purchase but a life of resolute good unalterable will quenchless desire of universal happiness the heart that beats with it in unison the brain whose ever wakeful wisdom toils to change reasons rich stores for its eternal weal this commerce of sincerest virtue needs no mediative signs of selfishness no jealous intercourse of wretched gain no balancings of prudence cold and long in just and equal measure all is weighed one scale contains the sum of human weal and one the good mans heart how vainly seek the selfish for that happiness denied to aught but virtue blind and hardened they who hope for peace amid the storms of care who covet power they know not how to use and sigh for pleasure they refuse to give madly they frustrate still their own designs and where they hope that quiet to enjoy which virtue pictures bitterness of soul pining regrets and vain repentances disease disgust and lassitude pervade their valueless and miserable lives but hoaryheaded selfishness has felt its deathblow and is tottering to the grave a brighter morn awaits the human day when every transfer of earths natural gifts shall be a commerce of good words and works when poverty and wealth the thirst of fame the fear of infamy disease and woe war with its million horrors and fierce hell shall live but in the memory of time who like a penitent libertine shall start look back and shudder at his younger years all touch all eye all ear the spirit felt the fairys burning speech oer the thin texture of its frame the varying periods painted changing glows as on a summer even when soulenfolding music floats around the stainless mirror of the lake reimages the eastern gloom mingling convulsively its purple hues with sunsets burnished gold then thus the spirit spoke it is a wild and miserable world thorny and full of care which every fiend can make his prey at will o fairy in the lapse of years is there no hope in store will yon vast suns roll on interminably still illuming the night of so many wretched souls and see no hope for them will not the universal spirit eer revivify this withered limb of heaven the fairy calmly smiled in comfort and a kindling gleam of hope suffused the spirits lineaments oh rest thee tranquil chase those fearful doubts which neer could rack an everlasting soul that sees the chains which bind it to its doom yes crime and misery are in yonder earth falsehood mistake and lust but the eternal world contains at once the evil and the cure some eminent in virtue shall start up even in perversest time the truths of their pure lips that never die shall bind the scorpion falsehood with a wreath of everliving flame until the monster sting itself to death how sweet a scene will earth become of purest spirits a pure dwellingplace symphonious with the planetary spheres when man with changeless nature coalescing will undertake regenerations work when its ungenial poles no longer point to the red and baleful sun that faintly twinkles there spirit on yonder earth falsehood now triumphs deadly power has fixed its seal upon the lip of truth madness and misery are there the happiest is most wretched yet confide until pure healthdrops from the cup of joy fall like a dew of balm upon the world now to the scene i show in silence turn and read the bloodstained charter of all woe which nature soon with recreating hand will blot in mercy from the book of earth how bold the flight of passions wandering wing how swift the step of reasons firmer tread how calm and sweet the victories of life how terrorless the triumph of the grave how powerless were the mightiest monarchs arm vain his loud threat and impotent his frown how ludicrous the priests dogmatic roar the weight of his exterminating curse how light and his affected charity to suit the pressure of the changing times what palpable deceit but for thy aid religion but for thee prolific fiend who peoplest earth with demons hell with men and heaven with slaves thou taintest all thou lookst upon the stars which on thy cradle beamed so brightly sweet were gods to the distempered playfulness of thy untutored infancy the trees the grass the clouds the mountains and the sea all living things that walk swim creep or fly were gods the sun had homage and the moon her worshipper then thou becamst a boy more daring in thy frenzies every shape monstrous or vast or beautifully wild which from sensations relics fancy culls the spirits of the air the shuddering ghost the genii of the elements the powers that give a shape to natures varied works had life and place in the corrupt belief of thy blind heart yet still thy youthful hands were pure of human blood then manhood gave its strength and ardour to thy frenzied brain thine eager gaze scanned the stupendous scene whose wonders mocked the knowledge of thy pride their everlasting and unchanging laws reproached thine ignorance awhile thou stoodst baffled and gloomy then thou didst sum up the elements of all that thou didst know the changing seasons winters leafless reign the budding of the heavenbreathing trees the eternal orbs that beautify the night the sunrise and the setting of the moon earthquakes and wars and poisons and disease and all their causes to an abstract point converging thou didst bend and called it god the selfsufficing the omnipotent the merciful and the avenging god who prototype of human misrule sits high in heavens realm upon a golden throne even like an earthly king and whose dread work hell gapes for ever for the unhappy slaves of fate whom he created in his sport to triumph in their torments when they fell earth heard the name earth trembled as the smoke of his revenge ascended up to heaven blotting the constellations and the cries of millions butchered in sweet confidence and unsuspecting peace even when the bonds of safety were confirmed by wordy oaths sworn in his dreadful name rung through the land whilst innocent babes writhed on thy stubborn spear and thou didst laugh to hear the mothers shriek of maniac gladness as the sacred steel felt cold in her torn entrails religion thou wert then in manhoods prime but age crept on one god would not suffice for senile puerility thou framedst a tale to suit thy dotage and to glut thy miserythirsting soul that the mad fiend thy wickedness had pictured might afford a plea for sating the unnatural thirst for murder rapine violence and crime that still consumed thy being even when thou heardst the step of fate that flames might light thy funeral scene and the shrill horrent shrieks of parents dying on the pile that burned to light their children to thy paths the roar of the encircling flames the exulting cries of thine apostles loud commingling there might sate thine hungry ear even on the bed of death but now contempt is mocking thy gray hairs thou art descending to the darksome grave unhonoured and unpitied but by those whose pride is passing by like thine and sheds like thine a glare that fades before the sun of truth and shines but in the dreadful night that long has lowered above the ruined world throughout these infinite orbs of mingling light of which yon earth is one is wide diffused a spirit of activity and life that knows no term cessation or decay that fades not when the lamp of earthly life extinguished in the dampness of the grave awhile there slumbers more than when the babe in the dim newness of its being feels the impulses of sublunary things and all is wonder to unpractised sense but active steadfast and eternal still guides the fierce whirlwind in the tempest roars cheers in the day breathes in the balmy groves strengthens in health and poisons in disease and in the storm of change that ceaselessly rolls round the eternal universe and shakes its undecaying battlement presides apportioning with irresistible law the place each spring of its machine shall fill so that when waves on waves tumultuous heap confusion to the clouds and fiercely driven heavens lightnings scorch the uprooted oceanfords whilst to the eye of shipwrecked mariner lone sitting on the bare and shuddering rock all seems unlinked contingency and chance no atom of this turbulence fulfils a vague and unnecessitated task or acts but as it must and ought to act even the minutest molecule of light that in an april sunbeams fleeting glow fulfils its destined though invisible work the universal spirit guides nor less when merciless ambition or mad zeal has led two hosts of dupes to battlefield that blind they there may dig each others graves and call the sad work glory does it rule all passions not a thought a will an act no working of the tyrants moody

error thou requirst no prayers or praises the caprice of mans weak will belongs no more to thee than do the changeful passions of his breast to thy unvarying harmony the slave whose horrible lusts

up and the fair oak whose leafy dome affords a temple where the vows of happy love are registered are equal in thy sight no love no hate thou cherishest revenge and favouritism and worst desire of fame thou knowst not all that the wide world contains are but thy passive instruments and thou regardst them all with an impartial eye whose joy or pain thy nature cannot feel because thou hast not human sense because thou art not human mind yes when the sweeping storm of time has sung its deathdirge oer the ruined fanes and broken altars of the almighty fiend whose name usurps thy honours and the blood through centuries clotted there has floated down the tainted flood of ages shalt thou live unchangeable a shrine is raised to thee which nor the tempestbreath of time nor the interminable

mother went to see an atheist burned she took me there the darkrobed priests were met around the pile the multitude was gazing silently and as the culprit passed with dauntless mien tempered disdain in his unaltering eye mixed with a quiet smile shone calmly forth the thirsty fire crept round his manly limbs his resolute eyes were scorched to blindness soon his deathpang rent my heart the insensate mob uttered a cry of triumph and i wept weep not child cried my mother for that man has said there is no god fairy there is no god nature confirms the faith his deathgroan sealed let heaven and earth let mans revolving race his ceaseless generations tell their tale let every part depending on the chain that links it to the whole point to the hand that grasps its term let every seed that falls in silent eloquence unfold its store of argument infinity within infinity without belie creation the exterminable spirit it contains is natures only god but human pride is skilful to invent most serious names to hide its ignorance the name of god has fenced about all crime with holiness himself the creature of his worshippers whose names and attributes and passions change seeva buddh foh

of peace even whilst their hands are red with guiltless blood murdering the while uprooting every germ of truth exterminating spoiling all making the earth a slaughterhouse o spirit through the sense by which thy inner nature was apprised of outward shows vague dreams have rolled and varied reminiscences have waked tablets that never fade all things have been imprinted there the stars the sea the earth the sky even the unshapeliest lineaments of wild and fleeting visions have left a record there to testify of earth these are my empire for to me is given the wonders of the human world to keep and fancys thin creations to endow with manner being and reality therefore a wondrous phantom from the dreams of human errors dense and purblind faith i will evoke to meet thy questioning ahasuerus rise a strange and woeworn wight arose beside the battlement and stood unmoving there his inessential figure cast no shade upon the golden floor his port and mien bore mark of many years and chronicles of untold ancientness were legible within his beamless eye yet his cheek bore the mark of youth freshness and vigour knit his manly frame the wisdom of old age was mingled there with youths primaeval dauntlessness and inexpressible woe chastened by fearless resignation gave an awful grace to his allspeaking brow spirit is there a god ahasuerus is there a god ay an almighty god and vengeful as almighty once his voice was heard on earth earth shuddered at the sound the fieryvisaged firmament expressed abhorrence and the grave of nature yawned to swallow all the dauntless and the good that dared to hurl defiance at his throne girt as it was with power none but slaves survived coldblooded slaves who did the work of tyrannous omnipotence whose souls no honest indignation ever urged to elevated daring to one deed which gross and sensual self did not pollute these slaves built temples for the omnipotent fiend gorgeous and vast the costly altars smoked with human blood and hideous paeans rung through all the longdrawn aisles a murderer heard his voice in egypt one whose gifts and arts had raised him to his eminence in power accomplice of omnipotence in crime and confidant of the allknowing one these were jehovahs words from an eternity of idleness i god awoke in seven days toil made earth from nothing rested and created man i placed him in a paradise and there planted the tree of evil so that he might eat and perish and my soul procure wherewith to sate its malice and to turn even like a heartless conqueror of the earth all misery to my fame the race of men chosen to my honour with impunity may sate the lusts i planted in their heart here i command thee hence to lead them on until with hardened feet their conquering troops wade on the promised soil through womans blood and make my name be dreaded through the land yet everburning flame and ceaseless woe shall be the doom of their eternal souls with every soul on this ungrateful earth virtuous or vicious weak or strong even all shall perish to fulfil the blind revenge which you to men call justice of their god the murderers brow quivered with horror god omnipotent is there no mercy must our punishment be endless will long ages roll away and see no term oh wherefore hast thou made in mockery and wrath this evil earth mercy becomes the powerful be but just o god repent and save one way remains i will beget a son and he shall bear the sins of all the world he shall arise in an unnoticed corner of the earth and there shall die upon a cross and purge the universal crime so that the few on whom my grace descends those who are marked as vessels to the honour of their god may credit this strange sacrifice and save their souls alive millions shall live and die who neer shall call upon their saviours name but unredeemed go to the gaping grave thousands shall deem it an old womans tale such as the nurses frighten babes withal these in a gulf of anguish and of flame shall curse their reprobation endlessly yet tenfold pangs shall force them to avow even on their beds of torment where they howl my honour and the justice of their doom what then avail their virtuous deeds their thoughts of purity with radiant genius bright or lit with human reasons earthly ray many are called but few will i elect do thou my bidding moses even the murderers cheek was blanched with horror and his quivering lips scarce faintly uttered o almighty one i tremble and obey o spirit centuries have set their seal on this heart of many wounds and loaded brain since the incarnate came humbly he came veiling his horrible godhead in the shape of man scorned by the world his name unheard save by the rabble of his native town even as a parish demagogue he led the crowd he taught them justice truth and peace in semblance but he lit within their souls the quenchless flames of zeal and blessed the sword he brought on earth to satiate with the blood of truth and freedom his malignant soul at length his mortal frame was led to death i stood beside him on the torturing cross no pain assailed his unterrestrial sense and yet he groaned indignantly i summed the massacres and miseries which his name had sanctioned in my country and i cried go go in mockery a smile of godlike malice reillumed his fading lineaments i go he cried but thou shalt wander oer the unquiet earth eternally the dampness of the grave bathed my imperishable front i fell and long lay tranced upon the charmed soil when i awoke hell burned within my brain which staggered on its seat for all around the mouldering relics of my kindred lay even as the almightys ire arrested them and in their various attitudes of death my murdered childrens mute and eyeless skulls glared ghastily upon me but my soul from sight and sense of the polluting woe of tyranny had long learned to prefer hells freedom to the servitude of heaven therefore i rose and dauntlessly began my lonely and unending pilgrimage resolved to wage unweariable war with my almighty tyrant and to hurl defiance at his impotence to harm beyond the curse i bore the very hand that barred my passage to the peaceful grave has crushed the earth to misery and given its empire to the chosen of his slaves these have i seen even from the earliest dawn of weak unstable and precarious power then preaching peace as now they practise war so when they turned but from the massacre of unoffending infidels to quench their thirst for ruin in the very blood that flowed in their own veins and pitiless zeal froze every human feeling as the wife sheathed in her husbands heart the sacred steel even whilst its hopes were dreaming of her love and friends to friends brothers to brothers stood opposed in bloodiest battlefield and war scarce satiable by fates last deathdraught waged drunk from the winepress of the almightys wrath whilst the red cross in mockery of peace pointed to victory when the fray was done no remnant of the exterminated faith survived to tell its ruin but the flesh with putrid smoke poisoning the atmosphere that rotted on the halfextinguished pile yes i have seen gods worshippers unsheathe the sword of his revenge when grace descended confirming all unnatural impulses to sanctify their desolating deeds and frantic priests waved the illomened cross oer the unhappy earth then shone the sun on showers of gore from the upflashing steel of safe assassination and all crime made stingless by the spirits of the lord and bloodred rainbows canopied the land spirit no year of my eventful being has passed unstained by crime and misery which flows from gods own faith ive marked his slaves with tongues whose lies are venomous beguile the insensate mob and whilst one hand was red with murder feign to stretch the other out for brotherhood and peace and that they now babble of love and mercy whilst their deeds are marked with all the narrowness and crime that freedoms young arm dare not yet chastise reason may claim our gratitude who now establishing the imperishable throne of truth and stubborn virtue maketh vain the unprevailing malice of my foe whose bootless rage heaps torments for the brave adds impotent eternities to pain whilst keenest disappointment racks his breast to see the smiles of peace around them play to frustrate or to sanctify their doom thus have i stood through a wild waste of years struggling with whirlwinds of mad agony yet peaceful and serene and selfenshrined mocking my powerless tyrants horrible curse with stubborn and unalterable will even as a giant oak which heavens fierce flame had scathed in the wilderness to stand a monument of fadeless ruin there yet peacefully and movelessly it braves the midnight conflict of the wintry storm as in the sunlights calm it spreads its worn and withered arms on high to meet the quiet of a summers noon the fairy waved her wand ahasuerus fled fast as the shapes of mingled shade and mist that lurk in the

glorious destiny joy to the spirit came through the wide rent in times eternal veil hope was seen beaming through the mists of fear earth was no longer hell love freedom health had given their ripeness to the manhood of its prime and all its pulses beat symphonious to the planetary spheres then dulcet music swelled concordant with the lifestrings of the soul it throbbed in sweet and languid beatings there catching new life from transitory death like the vague sighings of a wind at even that wakes the wavelets of the slumbering sea and dies on the creation of its breath and sinks and rises fails and swells by fits was the pure stream of feeling that sprung from these sweet notes and oer the spirits human sympathies with mild and gentle motion calmly flowed joy to the spirit came such joy as when a lover sees the chosen of his soul in happiness and witnesses her peace whose woe to him were bitterer than death sees her unfaded cheek glow mantling in first luxury of health thrills with her lovely eyes which like two stars amid the heaving main sparkle through liquid bliss then in her triumph spoke the fairy queen i will not call the ghost of ages gone to unfold the frightful secrets of its lore the present now is past and those events that desolate the earth have faded from the memory of time who dares not give reality to that whose being i annul to me is given the wonders of the human world to keep space matter time and mind futurity exposes now its treasure let the sight renew and strengthen all thy failing hope o human spirit spur thee to the goal where virtue fixes universal peace and midst the ebb and flow of human things show somewhat stable somewhat certain still a lighthouse oer the wild of dreary waves the habitable earth is full of bliss those wastes of frozen billows that were hurled by everlasting snowstorms round the poles where matter dared not vegetate or live but ceaseless frost round the vast solitude bound its broad zone of stillness are unloosed and fragrant zephyrs there from spicy isles ruffle the placid oceandeep that rolls its broad bright surges to the sloping sand whose roar is wakened into echoings sweet to murmur through the heavenbreathing groves and melodize with mans blest nature there those deserts of immeasurable sand whose agecollected fervours scarce allowed a bird to live a blade of grass to spring where the shrill chirp of the green lizards love broke on the sultry silentness alone now teem with countless rills and shady woods cornfields and pastures and white cottages and where the startled wilderness beheld a savage conqueror stained in kindred blood a tigress sating with the flesh of lambs the unnatural famine of her toothless cubs whilst shouts and howlings through the desert rang sloping and smooth the daisyspangled lawn offering sweet incense to the sunrise smiles to see a babe before his mothers door sharing his mornings meal with the green and golden basilisk that comes to lick his feet those trackless deeps where many a weary sail has seen above the illimitable plain morning on night and night on morning rise whilst still no land to greet the wanderer spread its shadowy mountains on the sunbright sea where the loud roarings of the tempestwaves so long have mingled with the gusty wind in melancholy loneliness and swept the desert of those ocean solitudes but vocal to the seabirds harrowing shriek the bellowing monster and the rushing storm now to the sweet and manymingling sounds of kindliest human impulses respond those lonely realms bright gardenisles begem with lightsome clouds and shining seas between and fertile valleys resonant with bliss whilst green woods overcanopy the wave which like a toilworn labourer leaps to shore to meet the kisses of the flowrets there all things are recreated and the flame of consentaneous love inspires all life the fertile bosom of the earth gives suck to myriads who still grow beneath her care rewarding her with their pure perfectness the balmy breathings of the wind inhale her virtues and diffuse them all abroad health floats amid the gentle atmosphere glows in the fruits and mantles on the stream no storms deform the beaming brow of heaven nor scatter in the freshness of its pride the foliage of the eververdant trees but fruits are ever ripe flowers ever fair and autumn proudly bears her matron grace kindling a flush on the fair cheek of spring whose virgin bloom beneath the ruddy fruit reflects its tint and blushes into love the lion now forgets to thirst for blood there might you see him sporting in the sun beside the dreadless kid his claws are sheathed his teeth are harmless customs force has made his nature as the nature of a lamb like passions fruit the nightshades tempting bane poisons no more the pleasure it bestows all bitterness is past the cup of joy unmingled mantles to the goblets brim and courts the thirsty lips it fled before but chief ambiguous man he that can know more misery and dream more joy than all whose keen sensations thrill within his breast to mingle with a loftier instinct there lending their power to pleasure and to pain yet raising sharpening and refining each who stands amid the evervarying world the burthen or the glory of the earth he chief perceives the change his being notes the gradual renovation and defines each movement of its progress on his mind man where the gloom of the long polar night lowers oer the snowclad rocks and frozen soil where scarce the hardiest herb that braves the frost basks in the moonlights ineffectual glow shrank with the plants and darkened with the night his chilled and narrow energies his heart insensible to courage truth or love his stunted stature and imbecile frame marked him for some abortion of the earth fit compeer of the bears that roamed around whose habits and enjoyments were his own his life a feverish dream of stagnant woe whose meagre wants but scantily fulfilled apprised him ever of the joyless length which his short beings wretchedness had reached his death a pang which famine cold and toil long on the mind whilst yet the vital spark clung to the body stubbornly had brought all was inflicted here that earths revenge could wreak on the infringers of her law one curse alone was spared the name of god nor where the tropics bound the realms

human will an article of trade or he was changed with christians for their gold and dragged to distant isles where to the sound of the fleshmangling scourge he does the work of allpolluting luxury and wealth which doubly visits on the tyrants heads the longprotracted fulness of their woe or he was led to legal butchery to turn to worms beneath that burning sun where kings first leagued against the rights of men and priests first traded with the name of god even where the milder zone afforded man a seeming shelter yet contagion there blighting his being with unnumbered ills spread like a

millenniums had withstood the tide of human things his stormbreath drove in sand across that desert where their stones survived the name of him whose pride had heaped them there yon monarch in his solitary pomp was but the mushroom of a summer day that his lightwinged footstep pressed to dust time was the king of earth all things gave way before him but the fixed and virtuous will the sacred

the refraction of the rays by the atmosphere and their reflection from other bodies light consists either of vibrations propagated through a subtle medium or of numerous minute particles repelled in all directions from the luminous body its velocity greatly exceeds that of any substance with which we are acquainted observations on the eclipses of jupiters satellites have demonstrated that light takes up no more than minutes seconds in passing from the sun to the earth a distance of miles some idea may be gained of the immense distance of the fixed stars when it is computed that many years would elapse before light could reach this earth from the nearest of them yet in one year light travels miles which is a distance times greater than that of the sun from the earth whilst round the chariots way innumerable systems rolled the plurality of worlds the indefinite immensity of the universe is a most awful subject of contemplation he who rightly feels its mystery and grandeur is in no danger of seduction from the falsehoods of religious systems or of deifying the principle of the universe it is impossible to believe that the spirit that pervades this infinite machine begat a son upon the body of a jewish woman or is angered at the consequences of that necessity which is a synonym of itself all that miserable tale of the devil and eve and an intercessor with the childish mummeries of the god of the jews is irreconcilable with the knowledge of the stars the works of his fingers have borne witness against him the nearest of the fixed stars is inconceivably distant from

expense of the necessaries of his neighbour a system admirably fitted to produce all the varieties of disease and crime which never fail to characterize the two extremes of opulence and penury a

that he has gained the title of a patriot by yielding to the impulses of vanity the show and pomp of courts adduce the same apology for its continuance and many a fete has been given many a woman has eclipsed her beauty by her dress to benefit the labouring poor and to encourage trade who does not see that this is a remedy which aggravates whilst it palliates the countless diseases of society the poor are set to labour for what not the food for which they famish not the blankets for want of which their babes are frozen by the cold of their miserable hovels not those comforts of civilization without which civilized man is far more miserable than the meanest savage oppressed as he is by all its insidious evils within the daily and taunting prospect of its innumerable benefits assiduously exhibited before him no for the pride of power for the miserable isolation of pride for the false pleasures of the hundredth part of society no greater evidence is afforded of the wide extended and radical mistakes of civilized man than this fact those arts which are essential to his very being are held in the greatest contempt employments are lucrative in an inverse ratio to their usefulness see rousseau de linegalite parmi les hommes note the jeweller the toyman the actor gains fame and wealth by the exercise of his useless and ridiculous art whilst the cultivator of the earth he without whom society must cease to subsist struggles through contempt and penury and perishes by that famine which but for his unceasing exertions would annihilate the rest of mankind i will not insult common sense by insisting on the doctrine of the natural equality of man the question is not concerning its desirableness but its practicability so far as it is practicable it is desirable that state of human society which approaches nearer to an equal partition of its benefits and evils should caeteris paribus be preferred but so long as we conceive that a wanton expenditure of human labour not for the necessities not even for the luxuries of the mass of society but for the egotism and ostentation of a few of its members is defensible on the ground of public justice so long we neglect to approximate to the redemption of the human race labour is required for physical and leisure for moral improvement from the former of these advantages the rich and from the latter the poor by the inevitable conditions of their respective situations are precluded a state which should combine the advantages of both would be subjected to the evils of neither he that is deficient in firm health or vigorous intellect is but half a man hence it follows that to subject the labouring classes to unnecessary labour is wantonly depriving them of any opportunities of intellectual improvement and that the rich are heaping up for their own mischief the disease lassitude and ennui by which their existence is rendered an intolerable burthen english reformers exclaim against sinecures but the true pension list is the rentroll of the landed proprietors wealth is a power usurped by the few to compel the many to labour for their benefit the laws which support this system derive their force from the ignorance and credulity of its victims they are the result of a conspiracy of the few against the many who are themselves obliged to purchase this preeminence by the loss of all real comfort the commodities that substantially contribute to the subsistence of the human species form a very short catalogue they demand from us but a slender portion of industry if these only were produced and sufficiently produced the species of man would be continued if the labour necessarily required to produce them were equitably divided among the poor and still more if it were equitably divided among all each mans share of labour would be light and his portion of leisure would be ample there was a time when this leisure would have been of small comparative value it is to be hoped that the time will come when it will be applied to the most important purposes those hours which are not required for the production of the necessaries of life may be devoted to the cultivation of the understanding the enlarging our stock of knowledge the refining our taste and thus opening to us new and more exquisite sources of enjoyment it was perhaps necessary that a period of monopoly and oppression should subsist before a period of cultivated equality could subsist savages perhaps would never have been excited to the discovery of truth and the invention of art but by the narrow motives which such a period affords but surely after the savage state has ceased and men have set out in the glorious career of discovery and invention monopoly and oppression cannot be necessary to prevent them from returning to a state of barbarism godwins enquirer essay see also pol jus book chapter it is a calculation of this admirable author that all the conveniences of civilized life might be produced if

iam saepe homines patriam carosquo parentes prodiderunt vitare acherusia templa petentes lucretius even love is sold not even the intercourse of the sexes is exempt from the despotism of positive institution law pretends even to govern the indisciplinable wanderings of passion to put fetters on the clearest deductions of reason and by appeals to the will to subdue the involuntary affections of our nature love is inevitably consequent upon the perception of loveliness love withers under constraint its very essence is liberty it is compatible neither with obedience jealousy nor fear it is there most pure perfect and unlimited where its votaries live in confidence equality and unreserve how long then ought the sexual connection to last what law ought to specify the extent of the grievances which should limit its duration a husband and wife ought to continue so long united as they love each other any law which should bind them to cohabitation for one moment after the decay of their affection would be a most intolerable tyranny and the most unworthy of toleration how odious an usurpation of the right of private judgement should that law be considered which should make the ties of friendship indissoluble in spite of the caprices the inconstancy the fallibility and capacity for improvement of the human mind and by so much would the fetters of love be heavier and more unendurable than those of friendship as love is more vehement and capricious more dependent on those delicate peculiarities of imagination and less capable of reduction to the ostensible merits of the object the state of society in which we exist is a mixture of feudal savageness and imperfect civilization the narrow and unenlightened morality of the christian religion is an aggravation of these evils it is not even until lately that mankind have admitted that happiness is the sole end of the science of ethics as of all other sciences and that the fanatical idea of mortifying the flesh for the love of god has been discarded i have heard indeed an ignorant collegian adduce in favour of christianity its hostility to every worldly feeling the first christian emperor made a law by which seduction was punished with death if the female pleaded her own consent she also was punished with death if the parents endeavoured to screen the criminals they were banished and their estates were confiscated the slaves who might be accessory were burned alive or forced to swallow melted lead the very offspring of an illegal love were involved in the consequences of the sentence gibbons decline and fall etc volume page see also for the hatred of the primitive christians to love and even marriage page but if happiness be the object of morality of all human unions and disunions if the worthiness of every action is to be estimated by the quantity of pleasurable sensation it is calculated to produce then the connection of the sexes is so long sacred as it contributes to the comfort of the parties and is naturally dissolved when its evils are greater than its benefits there is nothing immoral in this separation constancy has nothing virtuous in itself independently of the pleasure it confers and partakes of the temporizing spirit of vice in proportion as it endures tamely moral defects of magnitude in the object of its indiscreet choice love is free to promise for ever to love the same woman is not less absurd than to promise to believe the same creed such a vow in both cases excludes us from all inquiry the language of the votarist is this the woman i now love may be infinitely inferior to many others the creed i now profess may be a mass of errors and absurdities but i exclude myself from all future information as to the amiability of the one and the truth of the other resolving blindly and in spite of conviction to adhere to them is this the language of delicacy and reason is the love of such a frigid heart of more worth than its belief the present system of constraint does no more in the majority of instances than make hypocrites or open enemies persons of delicacy and virtue unhappily united to one whom they find it impossible to love spend the loveliest season of their life in unproductive efforts to appear otherwise than they are for the sake of the feelings of their partner or the welfare of their mutual offspring those of less generosity and refinement openly avow their disappointment and linger out the remnant of that union which only death can dissolve in a state of incurable bickering and hostility the early education of their children takes its colour from the squabbles of the parents they are nursed in a systematic school of illhumour violence and falsehood had they been suffered to part at the moment when indifference rendered their union irksome they would have been spared many years of misery they would have connected themselves more suitably and would have found that happiness in the society of more congenial partners which is for ever denied them by the despotism of marriage they would have been separately useful and happy members of society who whilst united were miserable and rendered misanthropical by misery the conviction that wedlock is indissoluble holds out the strongest of all temptations to the perverse they indulge without restraint in acrimony and all the little tyrannies of domestic life when they know that their victim is without appeal if this connection were put on a rational basis each would be assured that habitual illtemper would terminate in separation and would check this vicious and dangerous propensity prostitution is the legitimate offspring of marriage and its accompanying errors women for no other crime than having followed the dictates of a natural appetite are driven with fury from the comforts and sympathies of society it is less venial than murder and the punishment which is inflicted on her who destroys her child to escape reproach is lighter than the life of agony and disease to which the prostitute is irrecoverably doomed has a woman obeyed the impulse of unerring nature society declares war against her pitiless and eternal war she must be the tame slave she must make no reprisals theirs is the right of persecution hers the duty of endurance she lives a life of infamy the loud and bitter laugh of scorn scares her from all return she dies of long and lingering disease yet she is in fault she is the criminal she the froward and untamable child and society forsooth the pure and virtuous matron who casts her as an abortion from her undefiled

population of london meanwhile the evil is twofold young men excluded by the fanatical idea of chastity from the society of modest and accomplished women associate with these vicious and miserable beings destroying thereby all those exquisite and delicate sensibilities whose existence coldhearted worldlings have denied annihilating all genuine passion and debasing that to a selfish feeling which is the excess of generosity and devotedness their body and mind alike crumble into a hideous wreck of humanity idiocy and disease become perpetuated in their miserable offspring and distant generations suffer for the bigoted morality of their forefathers chastity is a monkish and evangelical superstition a greater foe to natural temperance even than unintellectual sensuality it strikes at the root of all domestic happiness and consigns more than half of the human race to misery that some few may monopolize according to law a system could not well have been devised more studiously hostile to human happiness than marriage i conceive that from the abolition of marriage the fit and natural arrangement of sexual connection would result i by no means assert that the intercourse would be promiscuous on the contrary it appears from the relation of parent to child that this union is generally of long duration and marked above all others with generosity and selfdevotion but this is a subject which it is perhaps premature to discuss that which will result from the abolition of marriage will be natural and right because choice and change will be exempted from restraint in fact religion and morality as they now stand compose a practical code of misery and servitude the genius of human happiness must tear every leaf from the accursed book of god ere man can read the inscription on his heart how would morality dressed up in stiff stays and finery start from her own disgusting image should she look in the mirror of nature to the red and baleful sun that faintly twinkles there the north polar star to which the axis of the earth in its present state of obliquity points it is exceedingly probable from many considerations that this obliquity will gradually diminish until the equator coincides with the ecliptic the nights and days will then become equal on the earth throughout the year and probably the seasons also there is no great extravagance in presuming that the progress of the perpendicularity of the poles may be as rapid as the progress of intellect or that there should be a perfect identity between the moral and physical improvement of the human species it is certain that wisdom is not compatible with disease and that in the present state of the climates of the earth health in the true and comprehensive sense of the word is out of the reach of civilized man astronomy teaches us that the earth is now in its progress and that the poles are every year becoming more and more perpendicular to the ecliptic the strong evidence afforded by the history of mythology and geological researches that some event of this nature has taken place already affords a strong presumption that this progress is not merely an oscillation as has been surmised by some late astronomers laplace systeme du monde bones of animals peculiar to the torrid zone have been found in the north of siberia and on the banks of the river ohio plants have

nature volume page necessity thou mother of the world he who asserts the doctrine of necessity means that contemplating the events which compose the moral and material universe he beholds only an immense and uninterrupted chain of causes and effects no one of which could occupy any other place than it does occupy or act in any other place than it does act the idea of necessity is obtained by our experience of the connection between objects the uniformity of the operations of nature the constant conjunction of similar events and the consequent inference of one from the other mankind are therefore agreed in the admission of necessity if they admit that these two circumstances take place in voluntary action motive is to voluntary action in the human mind what cause is to effect in the material universe the word liberty as applied to mind is analogous to the word chance as applied to matter they spring from an ignorance of the certainty of the conjunction of antecedents and consequents every human being is irresistibly impelled to act precisely as he does act in the eternity which preceded his birth a chain of causes was generated which operating under the name of motives make it impossible that any thought of his mind or any action of his life should be otherwise than it is were the doctrine of necessity false the human mind would no longer be a legitimate object of science from like causes it would be in vain that we should expect like effects the strongest motive would no longer be paramount over the conduct all knowledge would be vague and undeterminate we could not predict with any certainty that we might not meet as an enemy tomorrow him with whom we have parted in friendship tonight the most probable inducements and the clearest reasonings would lose the invariable influence they possess the contrary of this is demonstrably the fact similar circumstances produce the same unvariable effects the precise character and motives of any man on any occasion being given the moral philosopher could predict his actions with as much certainty as the natural philosopher could predict the effects of the mixture of any particular chemical substances why is the aged husbandman more experienced than the young beginner because there is a uniform undeniable necessity in the operations of the material universe why is the old statesman more skilful than the raw politician because relying on the necessary conjunction of motive and action he proceeds to produce moral effects by the application of those moral causes which experience has shown to be effectual some actions may be found to which we can attach no motives but these are the effects of causes with which we are unacquainted hence the relation which motive bears to voluntary action is that of cause to effect nor placed in this point of view is it or ever has it been the subject of popular or philosophical dispute none but the few fanatics who are engaged in the herculean task of reconciling the justice of their god with the misery of man will longer outrage common sense by the supposition of an event without a cause a voluntary action without a motive history politics morals criticism all grounds of reasonings all principles of science alike assume the truth of the doctrine of necessity no farmer carrying his corn to market doubts the sale of it at the market price the master of a manufactory no more doubts that he can purchase the human labour necessary for his purposes than that his machinery will act as they have been accustomed to act but whilst none have scrupled to admit necessity as influencing matter many have disputed its dominion over mind independently of its militating with the received ideas of the justice of god it is by no means obvious to a superficial inquiry when the mind observes its own operations it feels no connection of motive and action but as we know nothing more of causation than the constant conjunction of objects and the consequent inference of one from the other as we find that these two circumstances are universally allowed to have place in voluntary action we may be easily led to own that they are subjected to the necessity common to all causes the actions of the will have a regular conjunction with circumstances and characters motive is to voluntary action what cause is to effect but the only idea we can form of causation is a constant conjunction of similar objects and the consequent inference of one from the other wherever this is the case necessity is clearly established the idea of liberty applied metaphorically to the will has sprung from a misconception of the meaning of the word power what is power id quod potest that which can produce any given effect to deny power is to say that nothing can or has the power to be or act in the only true sense of the word power it applies with equal force to the lodestone as to the human will do you think these motives which i shall present are powerful enough to rouse him is a question just as common as do you think this lever has the power of raising this weight the advocates of freewill assert that the will has the power of refusing to be determined by the strongest motive but the strongest motive is that which overcoming all others ultimately prevails this assertion therefore amounts to a denial of the will being ultimately determined by that motive which does determine it which is absurd but it is equally certain that a man cannot resist the strongest motive as that he cannot overcome a physical impossibility the doctrine of necessity tends to introduce a great change into the established notions of morality and utterly to destroy religion reward and punishment must be considered by the necessarian merely as motives which he would employ in order to procure the adoption or abandonment of any given line of conduct desert in the present sense of the word would no longer have any meaning and he who should inflict pain upon another for no better reason than that he deserved it would only gratify his revenge under pretence of satisfying justice it is not enough says the advocate of freewill that a criminal should be prevented from a repetition of his crime he should feel pain and his torments when justly inflicted ought precisely to be proportioned to his fault but utility is morality that which is incapable of producing happiness is useless and though the crime of damiens must be condemned yet the frightful torments which revenge under the name of justice inflicted on this unhappy man cannot be supposed to have augmented even at the long run the stock of pleasurable sensation in the world at the same time the doctrine of necessity does not in the least diminish our disapprobation of vice the conviction which all feel that a viper is a poisonous animal and that a tiger is constrained by the inevitable condition of his existence to devour men does not induce us to avoid them lass sedulously or even more to hesitate in destroying them but he would surely be of a hard heart who meeting with a serpent on a desert island or in a situation where it was incapable of injury should wantonly deprive it of existence a necessarian is inconsequent to his own principles if he indulges in hatred or contempt the compassion which he feels for the criminal is unmixed with a desire of injuring him he looks with an elevated and dreadless composure upon the links of the universal chain as they pass before his eyes whilst cowardice curiosity and inconsistency only assail him in proportion to the feebleness and indistinctness with which he has perceived and rejected the delusions of freewill religion is the perception of the relation in which we stand to the principle of the universe but if the principle of the universe be not an organic being the model and prototype of man the relation between it and human beings is absolutely none without some insight into its will respecting our actions religion is nugatory and vain but will is only a mode of animal mind moral qualities also are such as only a human being can possess to attribute them to the principle of the universe is to annex to it properties incompatible with any possible definition of its nature it is probable that the word god was originally only an expression denoting the unknown cause of the known events which men perceived in the universe by the vulgar mistake of a metaphor for a real being of a word for a thing it became a man endowed with human qualities and governing the universe as an earthly monarch governs his kingdom their addresses to this imaginary being indeed are much in the same style as those of subjects to a king they acknowledge his benevolence deprecate his anger and supplicate his favour but the doctrine of necessity teaches us that in no case could any event have happened otherwise than it did happen and that if god is the author of good he is also the author of evil that if he is entitled to our gratitude for the one he is entitled to our hatred for the other that admitting the existence of this hypothetic being he is also subjected to the dominion of an immutable necessity it is plain that the same arguments which prove that god is the author of food light and life prove him also to be the author of poison darkness and death the widewasting earthquake the storm the battle and the tyranny are attributable to this hypothetic being in the same degree as the fairest forms of nature sunshine liberty and peace but we are taught by the doctrine of necessity that there is neither good nor evil in the universe otherwise than as the events to which we apply these epithets have relation to our own peculiar mode of being still less than with the hypothesis of a god will the doctrine of necessity accord with the belief of a future state of punishment god made man such as he is and than damned him for being so for to say that god was the author of all good and man the author of all evil is to say that one man made a straight line and a crooked one and another man made the incongruity a mahometan story much to the present purpose is recorded wherein adam and moses are introduced disputing before god in the following manner thou says moses art adam whom god created and animated with the breath of life and caused to be worshipped by the angels and placed in paradise from whence mankind have been expelled for thy fault whereto adam answered thou art moses whom god chose for his apostle and entrusted with his word by giving thee the tables of the law and whom he vouchsafed to admit to discourse with himself how many years dost thou find the law was written before i was created says moses forty and dost thou not find replied adam these words therein and adam rebelled against his lord and transgressed which moses confessing dost thou therefore blame me continued he for doing that which god wrote of me that i should do forty years before i was created nay for what was decreed concerning me fifty thousand years before the creation of heaven and earth sales prelim disc to the koran page there is no god this negation must be understood solely to affect a creative deity the hypothesis of a pervading spirit coeternal with the universe remains unshaken a close examination of the validity of the proofs adduced to support any proposition is the only secure way of attaining truth on the advantages of which it is unnecessary to descant our knowledge of the existence of a deity is a subject of such importance that it cannot be too minutely investigated in consequence of this conviction we proceed briefly and impartially to examine the proofs which have been adduced it is necessary first to consider the nature of belief when a proposition is offered to the mind it perceives the agreement or disagreement of the ideas of which it is composed a perception of their agreement is termed belief many obstacles frequently prevent this perception from being immediate these the mind attempts to remove in order that the perception may be distinct the mind is active in the investigation in order to perfect the state of perception of the relation which the component ideas of the proposition bear to each which is passive the investigation being confused with the perception has induced many falsely to imagine that the mind is active in belief that belief is an act of volition in consequence of which it may be regulated by the mind pursuing continuing this mistake they have attached a degree of criminality to disbelief of which in its nature it is incapable it is equally incapable of merit belief then is a passion the strength of which like every other passion is in precise proportion to the degrees of excitement the degrees of excitement are three the senses are the sources of all knowledge to the mind consequently their evidence claims the strongest assent the decision of the mind founded upon our own experience derived from these sources claims the next degree the experience of others which addresses itself to the former one occupies the lowest degree a graduated scale on which should be marked the capabilities of propositions to approach to the test of the senses would be a just barometer of the belief which ought to be attached to them consequently no testimony can be admitted which is contrary to reason reason is founded on the evidence of our senses every proof may be referred to one of these three divisions it is to be considered what arguments we receive from each of them which should convince us of the existence of a deity st the evidence of the senses if the deity should appear to us if he should convince our senses of his existence this revelation would necessarily command belief those to whom the deity has thus appeared have the strongest possible conviction of his existence but the god of theologians is incapable of local visibility d reason it is urged that man knows that whatever is must either have had a beginning or have existed from all eternity he also knows that whatever is not eternal must have had a cause when this reasoning is applied to the universe it is necessary to prove that it was created until that is clearly demonstrated we may reasonably suppose that it has endured from all eternity we must prove design before we can infer a designer the only idea which we can form of causation is derivable from the constant conjunction of objects and the consequent inference of one from the other in a case where two propositions are diametrically opposite the mind believes that which is least incomprehensible it is easier to suppose that the universe has existed from all eternity than to conceive a being beyond its limits capable of creating it if the mind sinks beneath the weight of one is it an alleviation to increase the intolerability of the burthen the other argument which is founded on a mans knowledge of his own existence stands thus a man knows not only that he now is but that once he was not consequently there must have been a cause but our idea of causation is alone derivable from the constant conjunction of objects and the consequent inference of one from the other and reasoning experimentally we can only infer from effects causes exactly adequate to those effects but there certainly is a generative power which is effected by certain instruments we cannot prove that it is inherent in these instruments nor is the contrary hypothesis capable of demonstration we admit that the generative power is incomprehensible but to suppose that the same effect is produced by an eternal omniscient omnipotent being leaves the cause in the same obscurity but renders it more incomprehensible d testimony it is required that testimony should not be contrary to reason the testimony that the deity convinces the senses of men of his existence can only be admitted by us if our mind considers it less probable that these men should have been deceived than that the deity should have appeared to them our reason can never admit the testimony of men who not only declare that they were eyewitnesses of miracles but that the deity was irrational for he commanded that he should be believed he proposed the highest rewards for faith eternal punishments for disbelief we can only command voluntary actions belief is not an act of volition the mind is even passive or involuntarily active from this it is evident that we have no sufficient testimony or rather that testimony is insufficient to prove the being of a god it has been before shown that it cannot be deduced from reason they alone then who have been convinced by the evidence of the senses can believe it hence it is evident that having no proofs from either of the three sources of conviction the mind cannot believe the existence of a creative god it is also evident that as belief is a passion of the mind no degree of criminality is attachable to disbelief and that they only are reprehensible who neglect to remove the false medium through which their mind views any subject of discussion every reflecting mind must acknowledge that there is no proof of the existence of a deity god is an hypothesis and as such stands in need of proof the onus probandi rests on the theist sir isaac newton says hypotheses non fingo quicquid enim ex phaenomenis non deducitur hypothesis vocanda est et hypothesis vel metaphysicae vel physicae vel qualitatum occultarum seu mechanicae in philosophia locum non habent to all proofs of the existence of a creative god apply this valuable rule we see a variety of bodies possessing a variety of powers we merely know their effects we are in a state of ignorance with respect to their essences and causes these newton calls the phenomena of things but the pride of philosophy is unwilling to admit its ignorance of their causes from the phenomena which are the objects of our senses we attempt to infer a cause which we call god and gratuitously endow it with all negative and contradictory qualities from this hypothesis we invent this general name to conceal our ignorance of causes and essences the being called god by no means answers with the conditions prescribed by newton it bears every mark of a veil woven by philosophical conceit to hide the ignorance of philosophers even from themselves they borrow the threads of its texture from the anthropomorphism of the vulgar words have been used by sophists for the same purposes from the occult qualities of the peripatetics to the effluvium of boyle and the crinities or nebulae of herschel god is represented as infinite eternal incomprehensible he is contained under every predicate in non that the logic of ignorance could fabricate even his worshippers allow that it is impossible to form any idea of him they exclaim with the french poet pour dire ce quil est il faut etre luimeme lord bacon says that atheism leaves to man reason philosophy natural piety laws reputation and everything that can serve to conduct him to virtue but superstition destroys all these and erects itself into a tyranny over the understandings of men hence atheism never disturbs the government but renders man more clearsighted since he seas nothing beyond the boundaries of the present life bacons moral essays la premiere theologie de lhomme lui

ainsi ils ne font quassigner une denomination vague a une cause ignoree a laquelle leur paresse ou les bornes de leurs connaissances les forcent de sarreter toutes les fois quon nous dit que dieu est lauteur de quelque phenomene cela signifie quon ignore comment un tel phenomene a pu soperer par le secours des forces ou des causes que nous connaissons dans la nature cest ainsi que le commun des hommes dont lignorance est la partage attribue a la divinite non seulement les effets inusites qui las frappent mais encore les evenemens les plus simples dont les causes sont les plus faciles a connaitre pour quiconque a pu les mediter en un mot lhomme a toujours respecte les causes inconnues des effets surprenans que son ignorance lempechait de demeler ce fut sur les debris de la nature que

restlessness to rove the globe from pole to pole when our lord was wearied with the burthen of his ponderous cross and wanted to rest before the door of ahasuerus the unfeeling wretch drove him away with brutality the saviour of mankind staggered sinking under the heavy load but uttered no complaint an angel of death appeared before ahasuerus and exclaimed indignantly barbarian thou hast denied rest to the son of man be it denied thee also until he comes to judge the world a black demon let loose from hell upon ahasuerus goads him now from country to country he is denied the consolation which death affords and precluded from the rest of the peaceful grave ahasuerus crept forth from the dark cave of mount carmel he shook the dust from his beard and taking up one of the skulls heaped there hurled it down the eminence it rebounded from the earth in shivered atoms this was my father roared ahasuerus seven more skulls rolled down from rock to rock while the infuriate jew following them with ghastly looks exclaimed and these were my wives he still continued to hurl down skull after skull roaring in dreadful accents and these and these and these were my children they could die

more dreadful then let it thunder upon me command a hurricane to sweep me down to the foot of carmel that i there may lie extended may pant and writhe and die this fragment is the translation of part of some german work whose title i have vainly endeavoured to discover i picked it up dirty and torn some years ago in lincolnsinn fields i will beget a son and he shall bear the sins of all the world a book is put into our hands when children called the bible the purport of whose history is briefly this that god made the earth in six days and there planted a delightful garden in which he placed the first pair of human beings in the midst of the garden he planted a tree whose fruit although within their reach they were forbidden to touch that the devil in the shape of a snake persuaded them to eat of this fruit in consequence of which god condemned both them and their posterity yet unborn to satisfy his justice by their eternal misery that four thousand years after these events the human race in the meanwhile having gone unredeemed to perdition god engendered with the betrothed wife of a carpenter in judea whose virginity was nevertheless uninjured and begat a son whose name was jesus christ and who was crucified and died in order that no more men might be devoted to hellfire he bearing the burthen of his fathers displeasure by proxy the book states in addition that the soul of whoever disbelieves this sacrifice will be burned with everlasting fire during many ages of misery and darkness this story gained implicit belief but at length men arose who suspected that it was a fable and imposture and that jesus christ so far from being a god was only a man like themselves but a numerous set of men who derived and still derive immense emoluments from this opinion in the shape of a popular belief told the vulgar that if they did not believe in the bible they would be damned to all eternity and burned imprisoned and poisoned all the unbiassed and unconnected inquirers who occasionally arose they still oppress them so far as the people now become more enlightened will allow the belief in all that the bible contains is called christianity a roman governor of judea at the instance of a priestled mob crucified a man called jesus eighteen centuries ago he was a man of pure life who desired to rescue his countrymen from the tyranny of their barbarous and degrading superstitions the common fate of all who desire to benefit mankind awaited him the rabble at the instigation of the priests demanded his death although his very judge made public acknowledgement of his innocence jesus was sacrificed to the honour of that god with whom he was afterwards confounded it is of importance therefore to distinguish between the pretended character of this being as the son of god and the saviour of the world and his real character as a man who for a vain attempt to reform the world paid the forfeit of his life to that overbearing tyranny which has since so long desolated the universe in his name whilst the one is a hypocritical daemon who announces himself as the god of compassion and peace even whilst he stretches forth his bloodred hand with the sword of discord to waste the earth having confessedly devised this scheme of desolation from eternity the other stands in the foremost list of those true heroes who have died in the glorious martyrdom of liberty and have braved torture contempt and poverty in the cause of suffering humanity since writing this note i have some reason to suspect that jesus was an ambitious man who aspired to the throne of judea the vulgar ever in extremes became persuaded that the crucifixion of jesus was a supernatural event testimonies of miracles so frequent in unenlightened ages were not wanting to prove that he was something divine this belief rolling through the lapse of ages met with the reveries of plato and the reasonings of aristotle and acquired force and extent until the divinity of jesus became a dogma which to dispute was death which to doubt was infamy christianity is now the established religion he who attempts to impugn it must be contented to behold murderers and traitors take precedence of him in public opinion though if his genius be equal to his courage and assisted by a peculiar coalition of circumstances future ages may exalt him to a divinity and persecute others in his name as he was persecuted in the name of his predecessor in the homage of the world the same means that have supported every other popular belief have supported christianity war imprisonment assassination and falsehood deeds of unexampled and incomparable atrocity have made it what it is the blood shed by the votaries of the god of mercy and peace since the establishment of his religion would probably suffice to drown all other sectaries now on the habitable globe we derive from our ancestors a faith thus fostered and supported we quarrel persecute and hate for its maintenance even under a government which whilst it infringes the very right of thought and speech boasts of permitting the liberty of the press a man is pilloried and imprisoned because he is a deist and no one raises his voice in the indignation of outraged humanity but it is ever a proof that the falsehood of a proposition is felt by those who use coercion not reasoning to procure its admission and a dispassionate observer would feel himself more powerfully interested in favour of a man who depending on the truth of his opinions simply stated his reasons for entertaining them than in that of his aggressor who daringly avowing his unwillingness or incapacity to answer them by argument proceeded to repress the energies and break the spirit of their promulgator by that torture and imprisonment whose infliction he could command analogy seems to favour the opinion that as like other systems christianity has arisen and augmented so like them it will decay and perish that as violence darkness and deceit not reasoning and persuasion have procured its admission among mankind so when enthusiasm has subsided and time that infallible controverter of false opinions has involved its pretended evidences in the darkness of antiquity it will become obsolete that miltons poem alone will give permanency to the remembrance of its absurdities and that men will laugh as heartily at grace faith redemption and original sin as they now do at the metamorphoses of jupiter the miracles of romish saints the efficacy of witchcraft and the appearance of departed spirits had the christian religion commenced and continued by the mere force of reasoning and persuasion the preceding analogy would be inadmissible we should never speculate on the future obsoleteness of a system perfectly conformable to nature and reason it would endure so long as they endured it would be a truth as indisputable as the light of the sun the criminality of murder and other facts whose evidence depending on our organization and relative situations must remain acknowledged as satisfactory so long as man is man it is an incontrovertible fact the consideration of which ought to repress the hasty conclusions of credulity or moderate its obstinacy in maintaining them that had the jews not been a fanatical race of men had even the resolution of pontius pilate been equal to his candour the christian religion never could have prevailed it could not even have existed on so feeble a thread hangs the most cherished opinion of a sixth of the human race when will the vulgar learn humility when will the pride of ignorance blush at having believed before it could comprehend either the christian religion is true or it is false if true it comes from god and its authenticity can admit of doubt and dispute no further than its omnipotent author is willing to allow either the power or the goodness of god is called in question if he leaves those doctrines most essential to the wellbeing of man in doubt and dispute the only ones which since their promulgation have been the subject of unceasing cavil the cause of irreconcilable hatred if god has spoken why is the universe not convinced there is this passage in the christian scriptures those who obey not god and believe not the gospel of his son shall be punished with everlasting destruction this is the pivot upon which all religions turn they all assume that it is in our power to believe or not to believe whereas the mind can only believe that which it thinks true a human being can only be supposed accountable for those actions which are influenced by his will but belief is utterly distinct from and unconnected with volition it is the apprehension of the agreement or disagreement of the ideas that compose any preposition belief is a passion or involuntary operation of the mind and like other passions its intensity is precisely proportionate to the degrees of excitement volition is essential to merit or demerit but the christian religion attaches the highest possible degrees of merit and demerit to that which is worthy of neither and which is totally unconnected with the peculiar faculty of the mind whose presence is essential to their being christianity was intended to reform the world had an allwise being planned it nothing is more improbable than that it should have failed omniscience would infallibly have foreseen the inutility of a scheme which experience demonstrates to this age to have been utterly unsuccessful christianity inculcates the necessity of supplicating the deity prayer may be considered under two points of view as an endeavour to change the intentions of god or as a formal testimony of our obedience but the former case supposes that the caprices of a limited intelligence can occasionally instruct the creator of the world how to regulate the universe and the latter a certain degree of servility analogous to the loyalty demanded by earthly tyrants obedience indeed is only the pitiful and cowardly egotism of him who thinks that he can do something better than reason christianity like all other religions rests upon miracles prophecies and martyrdoms no religion ever existed which had not its prophets its attested miracles and above all crowds of devotees who would bear patiently the most horrible tortures to prove its authenticity it should appear that in no case can a discriminating mind subscribe to the genuineness of a miracle a miracle is an infraction of natures law by a supernatural cause by a cause acting beyond that eternal circle within which all things are included god breaks through the law of nature that he may convince mankind of the truth of that revelation which in spite of his precautions has been since its introduction the subject of unceasing schism and cavil miracles resolve themselves into the following question see humes essay volume page whether it is more probable the laws of nature hitherto so immutably harmonious should have undergone violation or that a man should have told a lie whether it is more probable that we are ignorant of the natural cause of an event or that we know the supernatural one that in old times when the powers of nature were less known than at present a certain set of men were themselves deceived or had some hidden motive for deceiving others or that god begat a son who in his legislation measuring merit by belief evidenced himself to be totally ignorant of the powers of the human mind of what is voluntary and what is the contrary we have many instances of men telling lies none of an infraction of natures laws those laws of whose government alone we have any knowledge or experience the records of all nations afford innumerable instances of men deceiving others either from vanity or interest or themselves being deceived by the limitedness of their views and their ignorance of natural causes but where is the accredited case of god having come upon earth to give the lie to his own creations there would be something truly wonderful in the appearance of a ghost but the assertion of a child that he saw one as he passed through the churchyard is universally admitted to be less miraculous but even supposing that a man should raise a dead body to life before our eyes and on this fact rest his claim to being considered the son of god the humane society restores drowned persons and because it makes no mystery of the method it employs its members are not mistaken for the sons of god all that we have a right to infer from our ignorance of the cause of any event is that we do not know it had the mexicans attended to this simple rule when they heard the cannon of the spaniards they would not have considered them as gods the experiments of modern chemistry would have defied the wisest philosophers of ancient greece and rome to have accounted for them on natural principles an author of strong common sense has observed that a miracle is no miracle at secondhand he might have added that a miracle is no miracle in any case for until we are acquainted with all natural causes we have no reason to imagine others there remains to be considered another proof of christianity prophecy a book is written before a certain event in which this event is foretold how could the prophet have foreknown it without inspiration how could he have been inspired without god the greatest stress is laid on the prophecies of moses and hosea on the dispersion of the jews and that of isaiah concerning the coming of the messiah the prophecy of moses is a collection of every possible cursing and blessing and it is so far from being marvellous that the one of dispersion should have been fulfilled that it would have been more surprising if out of all these none should have taken effect in deuteronomy chapter verse where moses explicitly foretells the dispersion he states that they shall there serve gods of wood and stone and the lord shall scatter thee among all people from the one end of the earth even to the other and there thou shalt serve other gods which neither thou nor thy fathers have known even gods of wood and stone the jews are at this day remarkably tenacious of their religion moses also declares that they shall be subjected to these curses for disobedience to his ritual and it shall come to pass if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe to do all the commandments and statutes which i command thee this day that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee is this the real reason the third fourth and fifth chapters of hosea are a piece of immodest confession the indelicate type might apply in a hundred senses to a hundred things the fiftythird chapter of isaiah is more explicit yet it does not exceed in clearness the oracles of delphos the historical proof that moses isaiah and hosea did write when they are said to have written is far from being clear and circumstantial but prophecy requires proof in its character as a miracle we have no right to suppose that a man foreknew future events from god until it is demonstrated that he neither could know them by his own exertions nor that the writings which contain the prediction could possibly have been fabricated after the event pretended to be foretold it is more probable that writings pretending to divine inspiration should have been fabricated after the fulfilment of their pretended prediction than that they should have really been divinely inspired when we consider that the latter supposition makes god at once the creator of the human mind and ignorant of its primary powers particularly as we have numberless instances of false religions and forged prophecies of things long past and no accredited case of god having conversed with men directly or indirectly it is also possible that the description of an event might have foregone its occurrence but this is far from being a legitimate proof of a divine revelation as many men not pretending to the character of a prophet have nevertheless in this sense prophesied lord chesterfield was never yet taken for a prophet even by a bishop yet he uttered this remarkable prediction the despotic government of france is screwed up to the highest pitch a revolution is fast approaching that revolution i am convinced will be radical and sanguinary this appeared in the letters of the prophet long before the accomplishment of this wonderful prediction now have these particulars come to pass or have they not if they have how could the earl have foreknown them without inspiration if we admit the truth of the christian religion on testimony such as this we must admit on the same strength of evidence that god has affixed the highest rewards to belief and the eternal tortures of the neverdying worm to disbelief both of which have been demonstrated to be involuntary the last proof of the christian religion depends on the influence of the holy ghost theologians divide the influence of the holy ghost into its ordinary and extraordinary modes of operation the latter is supposed to be that which inspired the prophets and apostles and the former to be the grace of god which summarily makes known the truth of his revelation to those whose mind is fitted for its reception by a submissive perusal of his word persons convinced in this manner can do anything but account for their conviction describe the time at which it happened or the manner in which it came upon them it is supposed to enter the mind by other channels than those of the senses and therefore professes to be superior to reason founded on their experience admitting however the usefulness or possibility of a divine revelation unless we demolish the foundations of all human knowledge it is requisite that our reason should previously demonstrate its genuineness for before we extinguish the steady ray of reason and common sense it is fit that we should discover whether we cannot do without their assistance whether or no there be any other which may suffice to guide us through the labyrinth of life see lockes essay on the human understanding book chapter on enthusiasm for if a man is to be inspired upon all occasions if he is to be sure of a thing because he is sure if the ordinary operations of the spirit are not to be considered very extraordinary modes of demonstration if enthusiasm is to usurp the place of proof and madness that of sanity all reasoning is superfluous the mahometan dies fighting for his prophet the indian immolates himself at the chariotwheels of brahma the hottentot worships an insect the negro a bunch of feathers the mexican sacrifices human victims their degree of conviction must certainly be very strong it cannot arise from reasoning it must from feelings the reward of their prayers if each of these should affirm in opposition to the strongest possible arguments that inspiration carried internal evidence i fear their inspired brethren the orthodox missionaries would be so uncharitable as to pronounce them obstinate miracles cannot be received as testimonies of a disputed fact because all human testimony has ever been insufficient to establish the possibility of miracles that which is incapable of proof itself is no proof of anything else prophecy has also been rejected by the test of reason those then who have been actually inspired are the only true believers in the christian religion mox numine viso virgineei tumuere sinus innuptaque mater arcano stupuit compleri viscera partu auctorem paritura suum mortalia corda

itself him still from hope to hope the bliss pursuing which from the exhaustless lore of human weal draws on the virtuous mind the thoughts that rise in timedestroying infiniteness gift with selfenshrined eternity etc time is our consciousness of the succession of ideas in our mind vivid sensation of either pain or pleasure makes the time seem long as the common phrase is because it renders us more acutely conscious of our ideas if a mind be conscious of an hundred ideas during one minute by the clock and of two hundred during another the latter of these spaces would actually occupy so much greater extent in the mind as two exceed one in quantity if therefore the human mind by any future improvement of its sensibility should become conscious of an infinite number of ideas in a minute that minute would be eternity i do not hence infer that the actual space between the birth and death of a man will ever be prolonged but that his sensibility is perfectible and that the number of ideas which his mind is capable of receiving is indefinite one man is stretched on the rack during twelve hours another sleeps soundly in his bed the difference of time perceived by these two persons is immense one hardly will believe that half an hour has elapsed the other could credit that centuries had flown during his agony thus the life of a man of virtue and talent who should die in his thirtieth year is with regard to his own feelings longer than that of a miserable priestridden slave who dreams out a century of dulness the one has perpetually cultivated his mental faculties has rendered himself master of his thoughts can abstract and generalize amid the lethargy of everyday business the other can slumber over the brightest moments of his being and is unable to remember the happiest hour of his life perhaps the perishing ephemeron enjoys a longer life than the tortoise dark flood of time roll as it listeth thee i measure not by months or moments thy ambiguous course

page and condorcet esquisse dun tableau historique des progres de lesprit humain epoque no longer now he slays the lamb that looks him in the face i hold that the depravity of the physical and moral nature of man originated in his unnatural habits of life the origin of man like that of the universe of which he is a part is enveloped in impenetrable mystery his generations either had a beginning or they had not the weight of evidence in favour of each of these suppositions seems tolerably equal and it is perfectly unimportant to the present argument which is assumed the language spoken however by the mythology of nearly all religions seems to prove that at some distant period man forsook the path of nature and sacrificed the purity and happiness of his being to unnatural appetites the date of this event seems to have also been that of some great change in the climates of the earth with which it has an obvious correspondence the allegory of adam and eve eating of the tree of evil and entailing upon their posterity the wrath of god and the loss of everlasting life admits of no other explanation than the disease and crime that have flowed from unnatural diet milton was so well aware of this that he makes raphael thus exhibit to adam the consequence of his disobedience immediately a place before his eyes appeared sad noisome dark a lazarhouse it seemed wherein were laid numbers of all diseased all maladies of ghastly spasm or racking torture qualms of heartsick agony all feverous kinds convulsions epilepsies fierce catarrhs intestine stone and ulcer colic pangs demoniac frenzy moping melancholy and moonstruck madness pining atrophy marasmus and widewasting pestilence dropsies and asthmas and jointracking rheums and how many thousands more might not be added to this frightful catalogue the story of prometheus is one likewise which although universally admitted to be allegorical has never been satisfactorily explained prometheus stole fire from heaven and was chained for this crime to mount caucasus where a vulture continually devoured his liver that grew to meet its hunger hesiod says that before the time of prometheus mankind were exempt from suffering that they enjoyed a vigorous youth and that death when at length it came approached like sleep and gently closed their eyes again so general was this opinion that horace a poet of the augustan age writes audax omnia perpeti gens humana ruit per vetitum nefas audax iapeti genus ignem fraude mala gentibus intulit post ignem aetheria domo subductum macies et nova febrium terris incubuit cohors semotique prius tarda necessitas lethi corripuit gradum how plain a language is spoken by all this prometheus who represents the human race effected some great change in the condition of his nature and applied fire to culinary purposes thus inventing an expedient for screening from his disgust the horrors of the shambles from this moment his vitals were devoured by the vulture of disease it consumed his being in every shape of its loathsome and infinite variety inducing the soulquelling sinkings of premature and violent death all vice rose from the ruin of healthful innocence tyranny superstition commerce and inequality were then first known when reason vainly attempted to guide the wanderings of exacerbated passion i conclude this part of the subject with an extract from mr newtons defence of vegetable regimen from whom i have borrowed this interpretation of the fable of prometheus making allowance for such transposition of the events of the allegory as time might produce after the important truths were forgotten which this portion of the ancient mythology was intended to transmit the drift of the fable seems to be this man at his creation was endowed with the gift of perpetual youth that is he was not formed to be a sickly suffering creature as we now see him but to enjoy health and to sink by slow degrees into the bosom of his parent earth without disease or pain prometheus first taught the use of animal food primus bovem occidit prometheus plin nat hist lib sect and of fire with which to render it more digestible and pleasing to the taste jupiter and the rest of the gods foreseeing the consequences of these inventions were amused or irritated at the shortsighted devices of the newlyformed creature and left him to experience the sad effects of them thirst the necessary concomitant of a flesh diet perhaps of all diet vitiated by culinary preparation ensued water was resorted to and man forfeited the inestimable gift of health which he had received from heaven he became diseased the partaker of a precarious existence and no longer descended slowly to his grave return to nature cadell but just disease to luxury succeeds and every death its own avenger breeds the fury passions from that blood began and turned on man a fiercer savage man man and the animals whom he has infected with his society or depraved by his dominion are alone diseased the wild hog the mouflon the bison and the wolf are perfectly exempt from malady and invariably die either from external violence or natural old age but the domestic hog the sheep the cow and the dog are subject to an incredible variety of distempers and like the corruptors of their nature have physicians who thrive upon their miseries the supereminence of man is like satans a supereminence of pain and the majority of his species doomed to penury disease and crime have reason to curse the untoward event that by enabling him to communicate his sensations raised him above the level of his fellowanimals but the steps that have been taken are irrevocable the whole of human science is comprised in one question how can the advantages of intellect and civilization be reconciled with the liberty and pure pleasures of natural life how can we take the benefits and reject the evils of the system which is now interwoven with all the fibres of our being i believe that abstinence from animal food and spirituous liquors would in a great measure capacitate us for the solution of this important question it is true that mental and bodily derangement is attributable in part to other deviations from rectitude and nature than those which concern diet the mistakes cherished by society respecting the connection of the sexes whence the misery and diseases of unsatisfied celibacy unenjoying prostitution and the premature arrival of puberty necessarily spring the putrid atmosphere of crowded cities the exhalations of chemical processes the muffling of our bodies in superfluous apparel the absurd treatment of infants all these and innumerable other causes contribute their mite to the mass of human evil comparative anatomy teaches us that man resembles frugivorous animals in everything and carnivorous in nothing he has neither claws wherewith to seize his prey nor distinct and pointed teeth to tear the living fibre a mandarin of the first class with nails two inches long would probably find them alone inefficient to hold even a hare after every subterfuge of gluttony the bull must be degraded into the ox and the ram into the wether by an unnatural and inhuman operation that the flaccid fibre may offer a fainter resistance to rebellious nature it is only by softening and disguising dead flesh by culinary preparation that it is rendered susceptible of mastication or digestion and that the sight of its bloody juices and raw horror does not excite intolerable loathing and disgust let the advocate of animal food force himself to a decisive experiment on its fitness and as plutarch recommends tear a living lamb with his teeth and plunging his head into its vitals slake his thirst with the steaming blood when fresh from the deed of horror let him revert to the irresistible instincts of nature that would rise in judgement against it and say nature formed me for such work as this then and then only would he be consistent man resembles no carnivorous animal there is no exception unless man be one to the rule of herbivorous animals having cellulated colons the orangoutang perfectly resembles man both in the order and number of his teeth the orangoutang is the most anthropomorphous of the ape tribe all of which are strictly frugivorous there is no other species of animals which live on different food in which this analogy exists cuvier lecons danat comp tom pages reess cyclopaedia article man in many frugivorous animals the canine teeth are more pointed and distinct than those of man the resemblance also of the human stomach to that of the orangoutang is greater than to that of any other animal the intestines are also identical with those of herbivorous animals which present a larger surface for absorption and have ample and cellulated colons the caecum also though short is larger than that of carnivorous animals and even here the orangoutang retains its accustomed similarity the structure of the human frame then is that of one fitted to a pure vegetable diet in every essential particular it is true that the reluctance to abstain from animal food in those who have been long accustomed to its stimulus is so great in some persons of weak minds as to be scarcely overcome but this is far from bringing any argument in its favour a lamb which was fed for some time on flesh by a ships crew refused its natural diet at the end of the voyage there are numerous instances of horses sheep oxen and even woodpigeons having been taught to live upon flesh until they have loathed their natural aliment young children evidently prefer pastry oranges apples and other fruit to the flesh of animals until by the gradual depravation of the digestive organs the free use of vegetables has for a time produced serious inconveniences for a time i say since there never was an instance wherein a change from spirituous liquors and animal food to vegetables and pure water has failed ultimately to invigorate the body by rendering its juices bland and consentaneous and to restore to the mind that cheerfulness and elasticity which not one in fifty possesses on the present system a love of strong liquors is also with difficulty taught to infants almost every one remembers the wry faces which the first glass of port produced unsophisticated instinct is invariably unerring but to decide on the fitness of animal food from the perverted appetites which its constrained adoption produces is to make the criminal a judge in his own cause it is even worse it is appealing to the infatuated drunkard in a question of the salubrity of brandy what is the cause of morbid action in the animal system not the air we breathe for our fellowdenizens of nature breathe the same uninjured not the water we drink if remote from the pollutions of man and his inventions the necessity of resorting to some means of purifying water and the disease which arises from its adulteration in civilized countries is sufficiently apparent see dr lambes reports on cancer i do not assert that the use of water is in itself unnatural but that the unperverted palate would swallow no liquid capable of occasioning disease for the animals drink it too not the earth we tread upon not the unobscured sight of glorious nature in the wood the field or the expanse of sky and ocean nothing that we are or do in common with the undiseased inhabitants of the forest something then wherein we differ from them our habit of altering our food by fire so that our appetite is no longer a just criterion for the fitness of its gratification except in children there remain no traces of that instinct which determines in all other animals what aliment is natural or otherwise and so perfectly obliterated are they in the reasoning adults of our species that it has become necessary to urge considerations drawn from comparative anatomy to prove that we are naturally frugivorous crime is madness madness is disease whenever the cause of disease shall be discovered the root from which all vice and misery have so long overshadowed the globe will lie bare to the axe all the exertions of man from that moment may be considered as tending to the clear profit of his species no sane mind in a sane body resolves upon a real crime it is a man of violent passions bloodshot eyes and swollen veins that alone can grasp the knife of murder the system of a simple diet promises no utopian advantages it is no mere reform of legislation whilst the furious passions and evil propensities of the human heart in which it had its origin are still unassuaged it strikes at the root of all evil and is an experiment which may be tried with success not alone by nations but by small societies families and even individuals in no cases has a return to vegetable diet produced the slightest injury in most it has been attended with changes undeniably beneficial should ever a physician be born with the genius of locke i am persuaded that he might trace all bodily and mental derangements to our unnatural habits as clearly as that philosopher has traced all knowledge to sensation what prolific sources of disease are not those mineral and vegetable poisons that have been introduced for its extirpation how many thousands have become murderers and robbers bigots and domestic tyrants dissolute and abandoned adventurers from the use of fermented liquors who had they slaked their thirst only with pure water would have lived but to diffuse the happiness of their own unperverted feelings how many groundless opinions and absurd institutions have not received a general sanction from the sottishness and intemperance of individuals who will assert that had the populace of paris satisfied their hunger at the everfurnished table of vegetable nature they would have lent their brutal suffrage to the proscriptionlist of robespierre could a set of men whose passions were not perverted by unnatural stimuli look with coolness on an auto da fe is it to be believed that a being of gentle feelings rising from his meal of roots would take delight in sports of blood was nero a man of temperate life could you read calm health in his cheek flushed with ungovernable propensities of hatred for the human race did muley ismaels pulse beat evenly was his skin transparent did his eyes beam with healthfulness and its invariable concomitants cheerfulness and benignity though history has decided none of these questions a child could not hesitate to answer in the negative surely the bilesuffused cheek of buonaparte his wrinkled brow and yellow eye the ceaseless inquietude of his nervous system speak no less plainly the character of his unresting ambition than his murders and his victories it is impossible had buonaparte descended from a race of vegetable feeders that he could have had either the inclination or the power to ascend the throne of the bourbons the desire of tyranny could scarcely be excited in the individual the power to tyrannize would certainly not be delegated by a society neither frenzied by inebriation nor rendered impotent and irrational by disease pregnant indeed with inexhaustible calamity is the renunciation of instinct as it concerns our physical nature arithmetic cannot enumerate nor reason perhaps suspect the multitudinous sources of disease in civilized life even common water that apparently innoxious pabulum when corrupted by the filth of populous cities is a deadly and insidious destroyer lambes reports on cancer who can wonder that all the inducements held out by god himself in the bible to virtue should have been vainer than a nurses tale and that those dogmas by which he has there excited and justified the most ferocious propensities should have alone been deemed essential whilst christians are in the daily practice of all those habits which have infected with disease and crime not only the reprobate sons but those favoured children of the common fathers love omnipotence itself could not save them from the consequences of this original and universal sin there is no disease bodily or mental which adoption of vegetable diet and pure water has not infallibly mitigated wherever the experiment has been fairly tried debility is gradually converted into strength disease into healthfulness madness in all its hideous variety from the ravings of the fettered maniac to the unaccountable irrationalities of illtemper that make a hell of domestic life into a calm and considerate evenness of temper that alone might offer a certain pledge of the future moral reformation of society on a natural system of diet old age would be our last and our only malady the term of our existence would be protracted we should enjoy life and no longer preclude others from the enjoyment of it all sensational delights would be infinitely more exquisite and perfect the very sense of being would then be a continued pleasure such as we now feel it in some few and favoured moments of our youth by all that is sacred in our hopes for the human race i conjure those who love happiness and truth to give a fair trial to the vegetable system reasoning is surely superfluous on a subject whose merits an experience of six months would set for ever at rest but it is only among the enlightened and benevolent that so great a sacrifice of appetite and prejudice can be expected even though its ultimate excellence should not admit of dispute it is found easier by the shortsighted victims of disease to palliate their torments by medicine than to prevent them by regimen the vulgar of all ranks are invariably sensual and indocile yet i cannot but feel myself persuaded that when the benefits of vegetable diet are mathematically proved when it is as clear that those who live naturally are exempt from premature death as that nine is not one the most sottish of mankind will feel a preference towards a long and tranquil contrasted with a short and painful life on the average out of sixty persons four die in three years hopes are entertained that in april a statement will be given that sixty persons all having lived more than three years on vegetables and pure water are then in perfect health more than two years have now elapsed not one of them has died no such example will be found in any sixty persons taken at random seventeen persons of all ages the families of dr lambe and mr newton have lived for seven years on this diet without a death and almost without the slightest illness surely when we consider that some of those were infants and one a martyr to asthma now nearly subdued we may challenge any seventeen persons taken at random in this city to exhibit a parallel case those who may have been excited to question the rectitude of established habits of diet by these loose remarks should consult mr newtons luminous and eloquent essay return to nature or defence of vegetable regimen cadell when these proofs come fairly before the world and are clearly seen by all who understand arithmetic it is scarcely possible that abstinence from aliments demonstrably pernicious should not become universal in proportion to the number of proselytes so will be the weight of evidence and when a thousand persons can be produced living on vegetables and distilled water who have to dread no disease but old age the world will be compelled to regard animal flesh and fermented liquors as slow but certain poisons the change which would be produced by simpler habits on political economy is sufficiently remarkable the monopolizing eater of animal flesh would no longer destroy his constitution by devouring an acre at a meal and many loaves of bread would cease to contribute to gout madness and apoplexy in the shape of a pint of porter or a dram of gin when appeasing the longprotracted famine of the hardworking peasants hungry babes the quantity of nutritious vegetable matter consumed in fattening the carcase of an ox would afford ten times the sustenance undepraving indeed and incapable of generating disease if gathered immediately from the bosom of the earth the most fertile districts of the habitable globe are now actually cultivated by men for animals at a delay and waste of aliment absolutely incapable of calculation it is only the wealthy that can to any great degree even now indulge the unnatural craving for dead flesh and they pay for the greater licence of the privilege by subjection to supernumerary diseases again the spirit of the nation that should take the lead in this great reform would insensibly become agricultural commerce with all its vice selfishness and corruption would gradually decline more natural habits would produce gentler manners and the excessive complication of political relations would be so far simplified that every individual might feel and understand why he loved his country and took a personal interest in its welfare how would england for example depend on the caprices of foreign rulers if she contained within herself all the necessaries and despised whatever they possessed of the luxuries of life how could they starve her into compliance with their views of what consequence would it be that they refused to take her woollen manufactures when large and fertile tracts of the island ceased to be allotted to the waste of pasturage on a natural system of diet we should require no spices from india no wines from portugal spain france or madeira none of those multitudinous articles of luxury for which every corner of the globe is rifled and which are the causes of so much individual rivalship such calamitous and sanguinary national disputes in the history of modern times the avarice of commercial monopoly no less than the ambition of weak and wicked chiefs seems to have fomented the universal discord to have added stubbornness to the mistakes of cabinets and indocility to the infatuation of the people let it ever be remembered that it is the direct influence of commerce to make the interval between the richest and the poorest man wider and more unconquerable let it be remembered that it is a foe to everything of real worth and excellence in the human character the odious and disgusting aristocracy of wealth is built upon the ruins of all that is good in chivalry or republicanism and luxury is the forerunner of a barbarism scarce capable of cure is it impossible to realize a state of society where all the energies of man shall be directed to the production of his solid happiness certainly if this advantage the object of all political speculation be in any degree attainable it is attainable only by a community which holds out no factitious incentives to the avarice and ambition of the few and which is internally organized for the liberty security and comfort of the many none must be entrusted with power and money is the completest species of power who do not stand pledged to use it exclusively for the general benefit but the use of animal flesh and fermented liquors directly militates with this equality of the rights of man the peasant cannot gratify these fashionable cravings without leaving his family to starve without disease and war those sweeping curtailers of population pasturage would include a waste too great to be afforded the labour requisite to support a family is far lighter than is usually supposed it has come under the authors experience that some of the workmen on an embankment in north wales who in consequence of the inability of the proprietor to pay them seldom received their wages have supported large families by cultivating small spots of sterile ground by moonlight in the notes to pratts poem bread or the poor is an account of an industrious labourer who by working in a small garden before and after his days task attained to an enviable state of independence the peasantry work not only for themselves but for the aristocracy the army and the manufacturers the advantage of a reform in diet is obviously greater than that of any other it strikes at the root of the evil to remedy the abuses of legislation before we annihilate the propensities by which they are produced is to suppose that by taking away the effect the cause will cease to operate but the efficacy of this system depends entirely on the proselytism of individuals and grounds its merits as a benefit to the community upon the total change of the dietetic habits in its members it proceeds securely from a number of particular cases to one that is universal and has this advantage over the contrary mode that one error does not invalidate all that has gone before let not too much however be expected from this system the healthiest among us is not exempt from hereditary disease the most symmetrical athletic and longlived is a being inexpressibly inferior to what he would have been had not the unnatural habits of his ancestors accumulated for him a certain portion of malady and deformity in the most perfect specimen of civilized man something is still found wanting by the physiological critic can a return to nature then instantaneously eradicate predispositions that have been slowly taking root in the silence of innumerable ages indubitably not all that i contend for is that from the moment of the relinquishing all unnatural habits no new disease is generated and that the predisposition to hereditary maladies gradually perishes for want of its accustomed supply in cases of consumption cancer gout asthma and scrofula such is the invariable tendency of a diet of vegetables and pure water those who may be induced by these remarks to give the vegetable system a fair trial should in the first place date the commencement of their practice from the moment of their conviction all depends upon breaking through a pernicious habit resolutely and at once dr trotter asserts that no drunkard was ever reformed by gradually relinquishing his dram see trotter on the nervous temperament animal flesh in its effects on the human stomach is analogous to a dram it is similar in the kind though differing in the degree of its operation the proselyte to a pure diet must be warned to expect a temporary diminution of muscular strength the subtraction of a powerful stimulus will suffice to account for this event but it is only temporary and is succeeded by an equable capability for exertion far surpassing his former various and fluctuating strength above all he will acquire an easiness of breathing by which such exertion is performed with a remarkable exemption from that painful and difficult panting now felt by almost every one after hastily climbing an ordinary mountain he will be equally capable of bodily exertion or mental application after as before his simple meal he will feel none of the narcotic effects of ordinary diet irritability the direct consequence of exhausting stimuli would yield to the power of natural and tranquil impulses he will no longer pine under the lethargy of ennui that unconquerable weariness of life more to be dreaded than death itself he will escape the epidemic madness which broods over its own injurious notions of the deity and realizes the hell that priests and beldams feign every man forms as it were his god from his own character to the divinity of one of simple habits no offering would be more acceptable than the happiness of his creatures he would be incapable of hating or persecuting others for the love of god he will find moreover a system of simple diet to be a system of perfect epicurism he will no longer be incessantly occupied in blunting and destroying those organs from which he expects his gratification the pleasures of taste to be derived from a dinner of potatoes beans peas turnips lettuces with a dessert of apples gooseberries strawberries currants raspberries and in winter oranges apples and pears is far greater than is supposed these who wait until they can eat this plain fare with the sauce of appetite will scarcely join with the hypocritical sensualist at a lordmayors feast who declaims against the pleasures of the table solomon kept a thousand concubines and owned in despair that all was vanity the man whose happiness is constituted by the society of one amiable woman would find some difficulty in sympathizing with the disappointment of this venerable debauchee i address myself not only to the young

eighteen when he wrote queen mab he never published it when it was written he had come to the decision that he was too young to be a judge of controversies and he was desirous of acquiring that sobriety of spirit which is the characteristic of true heroism but he never doubted the truth or utility of his opinions and in printing and privately distributing queen mab he believed that he should further their dissemination without occasioning the mischief either to others or himself that might arise from publication it is doubtful whether he would himself have admitted it into a collection of his works his severe classical taste refined by the constant study of the greek poets might have discovered defects that escape the ordinary reader and the change his opinions underwent in many points would have prevented him from putting forth the speculations of his boyish days but the poem is too beautiful in itself and far too remarkable as the production of a boy of eighteen to allow of its being passed over besides that having been frequently reprinted the omission would be vain in the former edition certain portions were left out as shocking the general reader from the violence of their attack on religion i myself had a painful feeling that such erasures might be looked upon as a mark of disrespect towards the author and am glad to have the opportunity of restoring them the notes also are reprinted entire not because they are models of reasoning or lessons of truth but because shelley wrote them and that all that a man at once so distinguished and so excellent ever did deserves to be preserved the alterations his opinions underwent ought to be recorded for they form his history a series of articles was published in the new monthly magazine during the autumn of the year written by a man of great talent a fellowcollegian and warm friend of shelley they describe admirably the state of his mind during his collegiate life inspired with ardour for the acquisition of knowledge endowed with the keenest sensibility and with the fortitude of a martyr shelley came among his fellowcreatures congregated for the purposes of education like a spirit from another sphere too delicately organized for the rough treatment man uses towards man especially in the season of youth and too resolute in carrying out his own sense of good and justice not to become a victim to a devoted attachment to those he loved he added a determined resistance to oppression refusing to fag at eton he was treated with revolting cruelty by masters and boys this roused instead of taming his spirit and he rejected the duty of obedience when it was enforced by menaces and punishment to aversion to the society of his fellowcreatures such as he found them when collected together in societies where one egged on the other to acts of tyranny was joined the deepest sympathy and compassion while the attachment he felt for individuals and the admiration with which he regarded their powers and their virtues led him to entertain a high opinion of the perfectibility of human nature and he believed that all could reach the highest grade of moral improvement did not the customs and prejudices of society foster evil passions and excuse evil actions the oppression which trembling at every nerve yet resolute to heroism it was his illfortune to encounter at school and at college led him to dissent in all things from those whose arguments were blows whose faith appeared to engender blame and hatred during my existence he wrote to a friend in i have incessantly speculated thought and read his readings were not always well chosen among them were the works of the french philosophers as far as metaphysical argument went he temporarily became a convert at the same time it was the cardinal article of his faith that if men were but taught and induced to treat their fellows with love charity and equal rights this earth would realize paradise he looked upon religion as it is professed and above all practised as hostile instead of friendly to the cultivation of those virtues which would make men brothers can this be wondered at at the age of seventeen fragile in health and frame of the purest habits in morals full of devoted generosity and universal kindness glowing with ardour to attain wisdom resolved at every personal sacrifice to do right burning with a desire for affection and sympathy he was treated as a reprobate cast forth as a criminal the cause was that he was sincere that he believed the opinions which he entertained to be true and he loved truth with a martyrs love he was ready to sacrifice station and fortune and his dearest affections at its shrine the sacrifice was demanded from and made by a youth of seventeen it is a singular fact in the history of society in the civilized nations of modern times that no false step is so irretrievable as one made in early youth older men it is true when they oppose their fellows and transgress ordinary rules carry a certain prudence or hypocrisy as a shield along with them but youth is rash nor can it imagine while asserting what it believes to be true and doing what it believes to be right that it should be denounced as vicious and pursued as a criminal shelley possessed a quality of mind which experience has shown me to be of the rarest occurrence among human beings this was his unworldliness the usual motives that rule men prospects of present or future advantage the rank and fortune of those around the taunts and censures or the praise of those who were hostile to him had no influence whatever over his actions and apparently none over his thoughts it is difficult even to express the simplicity and directness of purpose that adorned him some few might be found in the history of mankind and some one at least among his own friends equally disinterested and scornful even to severe personal sacrifices of every baser motive but no one i believe ever joined this noble but passive virtue to equal active endeavours for the benefit of his friends and mankind in general and to equal power to produce the advantages he desired the worlds brightest gauds and its most solid advantages were of no worth in his eyes when compared to the cause of what he considered truth and the good of his fellowcreatures born in a position which to his inexperienced mind afforded the greatest facilities to practise the tenets he espoused he boldly declared the use he would make of fortune and station and enjoyed the belief that he should materially benefit his fellowcreatures by his actions while conscious of surpassing powers of reason and imagination it is not strange that he should even while so young have believed that his written thoughts would tend to disseminate opinions which he believed conducive to the happiness of the human race if man were a creature devoid of passion he might have said and done all this with quietness but he was too enthusiastic and too full of hatred of all the ills he witnessed not to scorn danger various disappointments tortured but could not tame his soul the more enmity he met the more earnestly he became attached to his peculiar views and hostile to those of the men who persecuted him he was animated to greater zeal by compassion for his fellowcreatures his sympathy was excited by the misery with which the world is burning he witnessed the sufferings of the poor and was aware of the evils of ignorance he desired to induce every rich man to despoil himself of superfluity and to create a brotherhood of property and service and was ready to be the first to lay down the advantages of his birth he was of too uncompromising a disposition to join any party he did not in his youth look forward to gradual improvement nay in those days of intolerance now almost forgotten it seemed as easy to look forward to the sort of millennium of freedom and brotherhood which he thought the proper state of mankind as to the present reign of moderation and improvement illhealth made him believe that his race would soon be run that a year or two was all he had of life he desired that these years should be useful and illustrious he saw in a fervent call on his fellowcreatures to share alike the blessings of the creation to love and serve each other the noblest work that life and time permitted him in this spirit he composed queen mab he was a lover of the wonderful and wild in literature but had not fostered these tastes at their genuine sources the romances and chivalry of the middle ages but in the perusal of such german works as were current in those days under the influence of these he at the age of fifteen wrote two short prose romances of slender merit the sentiments and language were exaggerated the composition imitative and poor he wrote also a poem on the subject of ahasuerus being led to it by a german fragment he picked up dirty and torn in lincolns inn fields this fell afterwards into other hands and was considerably altered before it was printed our earlier english poetry was almost unknown to him the love and knowledge of nature developed by wordsworth the lofty melody and mysterious beauty of coleridges poetry and the wild fantastic machinery and gorgeous scenery adopted by southey composed his favourite reading the rhythm of queen mab was founded on that of thalaba and the first few lines bear a striking resemblance in spirit though not in idea to the opening of that poem his fertile imagination and ear tuned to the finest sense of harmony preserved him from imitation another of his favourite books was the poem of gebir by walter savage landor from his boyhood he had a wonderful facility of versification which he carried into another language and his latin schoolverses were composed with an ease and correctness that procured for him prizes and caused him to be resorted to by all his friends for help he was at the period of writing queen mab a great traveller within the limits of england scotland and ireland his time was spent among the loveliest scenes of these countries mountain and lake and forest were his home the phenomena of nature were his favourite study he loved to inquire into their causes and was addicted to pursuits of natural philosophy and chemistry as far as they could be carried on as an amusement these tastes gave truth and vivacity to his descriptions and warmed his soul with that deep admiration for the wonders of nature which constant association with her inspired he never intended to publish queen mab as it stands but a few years after when printing alastor he extracted a small portion which he entitled the daemon of the world in this he changed somewhat the versification and made other alterations scarcely to be called improvements some years after when in italy a bookseller published an edition of queen mab as it originally stood shelley was hastily written to by his friends under the idea that deeply injurious as the mere distribution of the poem had proved the publication might awaken fresh persecutions at the suggestion of these friends he wrote a letter on the subject printed in the examiner newspaper with which i close this history of his earliest work to the editor of the examiner sir having heard that a poem entitled queen mab has been surreptitiously published in london and that legal proceedings have been instituted against the publisher i request the favour of your insertion of the following explanation of the affair as it relates to me a poem entitled queen mab was written by me at the age of eighteen i daresay in a sufficiently intemperate spirit but even then was not intended for publication and a few copies only were struck off to be distributed among my personal friends i have not seen this production for several years i doubt not but that it is perfectly worthless in point of literary composition and that in all that concerns moral and political speculation as well as in the subtler discriminations of metaphysical and religious doctrine it is still more crude and immature i am a devoted enemy to religious political and domestic oppression and i regret this publication not so much from literary vanity as because i fear it is better fitted to injure than to serve the sacred cause of freedom i have directed my solicitor to apply to chancery for an injunction to restrain the sale but after the precedent of mr southeys wat tyler a poem written i believe at the same age and with the same unreflecting enthusiasm with little hope of success whilst i exonerate myself from all share in having divulged opinions hostile to existing sanctions under the form whatever it may be which they assume in this poem it is scarcely necessary for me to protest against the system of inculcating the truth of christianity or the excellence of monarchy however true or however excellent they may be by such equivocal arguments as confiscation and imprisonment and invective and slander and the insolent violation of the most sacred ties of nature and society sir i am your obliged and obedient servant percy b shelley pisa june of the following pieces the original poetry by victor and

in the punctuation of the original edition is here retained a person complained that whenever he began to write he never could arrange his ideas in grammatical order which occasion suggested the idea of the following lines here i sit with my paper my pen and my ink first of this thing and that thing and tother thing think then my thoughts come so pellmell all into my mind that the sense or the subject i never can find this word is wrong placed no regard to the sense the present and future instead of past tense then my grammar i want o dear what a bore i think i shall never attempt to write more with patience i then my thoughts must arraign have them all in due order like mutes in a train like them too must wait in due patience and thought or else my fine works will all come to nought my wit toos so copious it flows like a river but disperses its waters on black and white never like smoke it appears independent and free but ah luckless smoke it all passes like thee then at length all my patience entirely lost my paper and pens in the fire are tossed but come try again you must never despair our murrays or enticks are not all so rare implore their assistance theyll come to your aid perform all your business without being paid theyll tell you the present tense future and past which should come first and which should come last this murray will do then to entick repair to find out

junius be sharp or as plato be sage the pattern or satire to all of the age but stop a mad author i mean not to turn nor with thirst of applause does my heated brain burn sufficient that sense wit and

complains it bids me step forward and just hold the reins my excuse shall be humble and faithful and true such as i fear can be made but by few of writers this age has abundance and plenty three score

you that pleasure is vain when it promises sunshine how often comes rain so when to fond hope every blessing is nigh how oft when we smile it is checked with a sigh when hope gay deceiver in pleasure

truth by all boys learned at schools now adieu my dear hattie im sure i must tire for if i do you may throw it into the fire so accept the best love of your cousin and friend which brings this nonsensical rhyme to an end april note mischievousmischevious song cold cold is the blast when december is howling cold are the damps on a dying mans brow stern are the seas when the wild waves are rolling and sad is the grave where a loved one lies low but colder is scorn from the being who loved thee more stern is the sneer from the friend who has proved thee more sad are the tears when their sorrows have moved thee which mixed with groans anguish and wild madness flow and ah poor has felt all this horror full long the fallen victim contended with fate till a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow she sought her babes food at her ruiners gate another had charmed the remorseless betrayer he turned laughing aside from her moans and her prayer she said nothing but wringing the wet from her hair crossed the dark mountain side though the hour it was late twas on the wild height of the dark penmanmawr that the form of the wasted reclined she shrieked to the ravens that croaked from afar and she sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind i call not yon rocks where the thunder peals rattle i call not yon clouds where the elements battle but thee cruel i call thee unkind then she wreathed in her hair the wild flowers of the mountain and deliriously laughing a garland entwined she bedewed it with tears then she hung oer the fountain and leaving it cast it a prey to the wind ah go she exclaimed when the tempest is yelling tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling but i left a pitiless outcast my dwelling my garments are torn so they say is my mind not long lived but over her grave waved the desolate form of a stormblasted yew around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave but spirits of peace steep her slumbers in dew then stay thy swift steps mid the dark mountain heather though chill blow the wind and severe is the weather for perfidy traveller cannot bereave her of the tears to the tombs of the innocent due july song come harriet sweet is the hour soft zephyrs breathe gently around the anemones nightboding flower has sunk its pale head on the ground tis thus the worlds keenness hath torn some mild heart that expands to its blast tis thus that the wretched forlorn sinks poor and neglected at last the world with its keenness and woe has no charms or attraction for me its unkindness with grief has laid low the heart which is faithful to thee the high trees that wave past the moon as i walk in their umbrage with you all declare i must part with you soon all bid you a tender adieu then harriet dearest farewell you and i love may neer meet again these woods and these meadows can tell how soft and how sweet was the strain april song despair ask not the pallid strangers woe with beating heart and throbbing breast whose step is faltering weak and slow as though the body needed rest whose wildered eye no object meets nor cares to ken a friendly glance with silent grief his bosom beats now fixed as in a deathlike trance who looks around with fearful eye and shuns all converse with man kind as though some one his griefs might spy and soothe them with a kindred mind a friend or foe to him the same he looks on each with equal eye the difference lies but in the name to none for comfort can he fly twas deep despair and sorrows trace to him too keenly given whose memory time could not efface his peace was lodged in heaven he looks on all this world bestows the pride and pomp of power as trifles best for pageant shows which vanish in an hour when torn is dear affections tie sinks the soft heart full low it leaves without a parting sigh all that these realms bestow june song sorrow to me this worlds a dreary blank all hopes in life are gone and fled my high strung energies are sank and all my blissful hopes lie dead the world once smiling to my view showed scenes of endless bliss and joy the world i then but little knew ah little knew how pleasures cloy all then was jocund all was gay no thought beyond the present hour i danced in pleasures fading ray fading alas as drooping flower nor do the heedless in the throng one thought beyond the morrow give they court the feast the dance the song nor think how short their time to live the heart that bears deep sorrows trace what earthly comfort can console it drags a dull and lengthened pace till friendly death its woes enroll the sunken cheek the humid eyes een better than the tongue can tell in whose sad breast deep sorrow lies where memorys rankling traces dwell the rising tear the stifled sigh a mind but ill at ease display like blackening clouds in stormy sky where fiercely vivid lightnings play thus when souls energy is dead when sorrow dims each earthly view when every fairy hope is fled we bid ungrateful world adieu august song hope and said i that all hope was fled that sorrow and despair were mine that each enthusiast wish was dead had sank beneath pale miserys shrine seest thou the sunbeams yellow glow that robes with liquid streams of light yon distant mountains craggy brow and shows the rocks so fair so bright tis thus sweet expectations ray in softer view shows distant hours and portrays each succeeding day as dressed in fairer brighter flowers the vermeil tinted flowers that blossom are frozen but to bud anew then sweet deceiver calm my bosom although thy visions be not true yet true they are and ill believe thy whisperings soft of love and peace god never made thee to deceive tis sin that bade thy empire cease yet though despair my life should gloom though horror should around me close with those i love beyond the tomb hope

be heaven will not smile upon the work of hell ah no for heaven cannot smile on me fate envious fate has sealed my wayward destiny i sought the cold brink of the midnight surge i sighed beneath its wave to hide my woes the rising tempest sung a funeral dirge and on the blast a frightful yell arose wild flew the meteors oer the maddened main wilder did grief athwart my bosom glare stilled was the unearthly howling and a strain swelled mid the tumult of the battling air twas like a spirits song but yet more soft and fair i met a maniac like he was to me i said poor victim wherefore dost thou roam and canst thou not contend with agony that thus at midnight thou dost quit thine home ah there she sleeps cold is her bloodless form and i will go to slumber in her grave and then our ghosts whilst raves the maddened storm will sweep at midnight oer the wildered wave wilt thou our lowly beds with tears of pity lave ah no i cannot shed the pitying tear this breast is cold this heart can feel no more but i can rest me on thy chilling bier can shriek in horror to the tempests roar the spectral horseman what was the shriek that struck fancys ear as it sate on the ruins of time that is past hark it floats on the fitful blast of the wind and breathes to the pale moon a funeral sigh it is the benshies moan on the storm or a shivering fiend that thirsting for sin seeks murder and guilt when virtue sleeps winged with the power of some ruthless king and sweeps oer the breast of the prostrate plain it was not a fiend from the regions of hell that poured its low moan on the stillness of night it was not a ghost of the guilty dead nor a yelling vampire reeking with gore but aye at the close of seven years end that voice is mixed with the swell of the storm and aye at the close of seven years end a shapeless shadow that sleeps on the hill awakens and floats on the mist of the heath it is not the shade of a murdered man who has rushed uncalled to the throne of his god and howls in the pause of the eddying storm this voice is low cold hollow and chill tis not heard by the ear but is felt in the soul tis more frightful far than the deathdaemons scream or the laughter of fiends when they howl oer the corpse of a man who has sold his soul to hell it tells the approach of a mystic form a white courser bears the shadowy sprite more thin they are than the mists of the mountain when the clear moonlight sleeps on the waveless lake more pale his cheek than the snows of nithona when winter rides on the northern blast and howls in the midst of the leafless wood yet when the fierce swell of the tempest is raving and the whirlwinds howl in the caves of inisfallen still secure mid the wildest war of the sky the phantom courser scours the waste and his rider howls in the thunders roar oer him the fierce bolts of avenging heaven pause as in fear to strike his head the meteors of midnight recoil from his figure yet the wildered peasant that oft passes by with wonder beholds the blue flash through his form and his voice though faint as the sighs of the dead the startled passenger shudders to hear more distinct than the thunders wildest roar then does the dragon who chained in the caverns to eternity curses the champion of erin moan and yell loud at the lone hour of midnight and twine his vast wreaths round the forms of the daemons then in agony roll his deathswimming eyeballs though wildered by death yet never to die then he shakes from his skeleton folds the nightmares who shrieking in agony seek the couch of some fevered wretch who courts sleep in vain then the tombless ghosts of the guilty dead in horror pause on the fitful gale they float on the swell of the eddying tempest and scared seek the caves of gigantic where their thin forms pour unearthly sounds on the blast that sweets the breast of the lake and mingles its swell with the moonlight air melody to a scene of former times art thou indeed forever gone forever ever lost to me must this poor bosom beat alone or beat at all if not for thee ah why was love to mortals given to lift them to the height of heaven or dash them to the depths of hell yet i do not reproach thee dear

text and its punctuation in the case of every poem published during shelleys lifetime the text of this edition is based upon that of the editio princeps or earliest issue wherever our text deviates verbally from this exemplar the word or words of the editio princeps will be found recorded in a footnote in like manner wherever the text of the poems first printed by mrs shelley in the posthumous poems of or the poetical works of is modified by manuscript authority or otherwise the reading of the earliest printed text has been subjoined in a footnote shelleys punctuation or what may be presumed to be his has been retained save in the case of errors whether of the transcriber or the printer overlooked in the revision of the proofsheets and of a few places where the pointing though certainly or seemingly shelleys tends to obscure the sense or grammatical construction in the following notes the more important textual difficulties are briefly discussed and the readings embodied in the text of this edition it is hoped sufficiently justified an attempt has also been made to record the original punctuation where it is here departed from the daemon of the world part the following paragraph relating to this poem closes shelleys preface to alastor etc the fragment entitled the daemon of the world is a detached part of a poem which the author does not intend for publication the metre in which it is composed is that of samson agonistes and the italian pastoral drama and may be considered as the natural measure into which poetical conceptions expressed in harmonious language necessarily fall lines the editor has added a comma at the end of these lines and a period for the comma of after by line lines the editio princeps has a comma after and line and heaven line the daemon of the world part printed by mr forman from a copy in his possession of queen mab corrected by shelleys hand see the shelley library pages for a detailed history and description of this copy

store and dawns for draws found in shelleys note on the corresponding passage of queen mab see editors note on this passage shelleys comma after infiniteness line is omitted as tending to obscure the construction alastor or the spirit of solitude preface for the concluding paragraph see editors note on the daemon of the world part conducts o sleep to thy etc line the shelley texts have conduct here which forman and dowden retain the suggestion that shelley may have written deaths blue vaults line need not in the face of the dark gate of death line be seriously considered conduct must therefore be regarded as a fault in grammar that shelley actually wrote conduct is not impossible for his grammar is not seldom faulty see for instance revolt of islam dedication line but it is most improbable that he would have committed a solecism so striking both to eye and ear rossetti and woodberry print conducts etc the final s is often a vanishing quantity in shelleys manuscripts or perhaps the compositors hand was misled by his eye which may have dropped on the words conduct to thy etc seven lines above of wave ruining on wave etc line for ruining the text of poetical works both editions has running an overlooked misprint surely rather than a conjectural emendation for an example of ruining as an intransitive falling in ruins or simply falling in streams see paradise lost

shelley volume page the revolt of islam the revised text of this poem is given here as being that which shelley actually published in order to reconvert the text of the revolt of islam into that of laon and cythna the reader must make the following alterations in the text at the end of the preface add in the personal conduct of my hero and heroine there is one circumstance which was intended to startle the reader from the trance of ordinary life it was my object to break through the crust of those outworn opinions on which established institutions depend i have appealed therefore to the most universal of all feelings and have endeavoured to strengthen the moral sense by forbidding it to waste its energies in seeking to avoid actions which are only crimes of convention it is because there is so great a multitude of artificial vices that there are so few real virtues those feelings alone which are benevolent or malevolent are essentially good or bad the circumstance of which i speak was introduced however merely to accustom men to that charity and toleration which the exhibition of a practice widely differing from their own has a tendency to promote the sentiments connected with and characteristic of this circumstance have no personal reference to the writer shelleys note nothing indeed can be more mischievous than many actions innocent in themselves which might bring down upon individuals the bigoted contempt and rage of the multitude i had a little sister whose fair eyes to love in human life this sister sweet what thoughts had sway over my sisters slumber as if they did ten thousand years outnumber and left it vacant twas her brothers face i had a brother once but he is dead my own sweet sister looked with joy did quail the common blood which ran within our frames with such close sympathies for to each other had high and solemn hopes the gentle might of earliest love and all the thoughts which smother cold evils power now linked a sister and a brother and such is natures modesty that those dream ye that god thus builds for man in solitude what then is god ye mock yourselves and give what then is god some moonstruck sophist stood and that men say god has appointed death on all who scorn his will to wreak immortal wrath men say they have seen god and heard from god or known from others who have known such things and that his will is all our law a rod to scourge us into slaves that priests and kings and it is said that god will punish wrong and his red hells undying snakes among will bind the wretch on whom he fixed a stain for it is said god rules both high and low and man is made the captive of his brother to curse the rebels to their god did they by god and nature and necessity the stanza contains ten lines lines as follows there was one teacher and must ever be they said even god who the necessity of rule and wrong had armed against mankind his slave and his avenger there to be and hell and awe which in the heart of man is god itself the priests its downfall knew as day by day their altars lovelier grew till they were left alone within the fane on fire almighty god his hell on earth has spread of their almighty god the armies wind in sad procession each among the train o god almighty thou alone hast power and oromaze and christ and mahomet he was a christian priest from whom it came to quell the rebel atheists a dire guest to wreak his fear of god in vengeance on mankind his cradled idol and the sacrifice of god to gods own wrath that islams creed and thrones which rest on faith in god nigh overturned of god may be appeased he ceased and they with storms and shadows girt sate god alone as hush hark come they yet god god thine hour is near men brought their atheist kindred to appease the threshold of gods throne and it was she ye turn to god for aid in your distress swear by your dreadful god we swear we swear truly for self thus thought that christian priest indeed a woman god has sent his other victim here will i stand up before gods golden throne and cry o lord to thee did i betray an atheist but for me she would have known in torment and in fire have atheists gone how atheists and republicans can die aught but a lifeless clod until revived by thee dedic so rossetti the shelley editions and read clog which is retained by forman dowden and woodberry rossettis happy conjecture clod seems to forman a doubtful emendation as shelley may have used clog in its figurative sense of weight encumbrance hardly as here in a poetical figure that would be to use a metaphor within a metaphor shelley compares his heart to a concrete object if clog is right the word must be taken in one or other of its two recognized literal senses a wooden shoe or a block of wood tied round the neck or to the leg of a horse or a dog again it is of others hearts not of his own that shelley here deplores the icy coldness and weight besides how could he appropriately describe his heart as a weight or encumbrance upon the free play of impulse and emotion seeing that for shelley above all men the heart was itself the main source and spring of all feeling and action that source he complains has been dried up its emotions desiccated by the crushing impact of other hearts heavy hard and cold as stone his heart has become withered and barren like a lump of earth parched with frost a lifeless clod compare summer and winter lines it was a winter such as when birds die in the deep forests and the fishes lie stiffened in the translucent ice which makes even the mud and slime of the warm lakes a wrinkled clod as hard as brick etc etc the word revived suits well with clod but what is a revived clog finally the first two lines of the following stanza seem decisive in favour of roseettis word if any one wonders how a misprint overlooked in could after twentyone years still remain undiscovered in let him consider the case of clog in lambs parody on southeys and coleridges dactyls lamb letter to coleridge july sorely your dactyls do drag along limpfooted sad is the measure that hangs a clog round em so etc etc here the misprint clod which in appeared in moxons edition of the letters of charles lamb has through five successive editions and under many editors including fitzgerald ainger and macdonald held its ground even to the present day and this notwithstanding the preservation of the true reading clog in the texts of talfourd and carew hazlitt here then is the case of a palpable misprint surviving despite positive external evidence of its falsity over a period of thirtysix years and walked as free etc ded walked is one of shelleys occasional grammatical laxities forman well observes that walkedst the right word here would naturally seem to shelley more heinous than a breach of syntactic rule rossetti and after him dowden print walk forman and woodberry follow the early texts here the text follows the punctuation of the editio princeps with two exceptions a comma is inserted after scale line on the authority of the bodleian manuscript locock and after neck line to indicate the true construction mrs shelleys text has a semicolon after plumes line which rossetti adopts forman departs from the pointing of shelleys edition here placing a period at the close of line and a dash after blended line what life what power was etc the editio princeps wants the commas here and now we are embarked the mountains hang and frown over the starry deep that gleams below a vast and dim expanse as oer the waves we go with woodberry i substitute after embarked a dash for the comma of the editio princeps with rossetti i restore to below a comma which i believe to have been overlooked by the printer of that edition shelleys meaning i take to be that a vast and dim expanse of mountain hangs frowning over the starry deep that gleams below it as we pass over the waves as king and lord and god the conquering fiend did own so forman dowden the editio princeps has a full stop at the close of the line where according to mr locock no point appears in the bodleian manuscript blackwinged demon forms etc the bodleian manuscript exhibits the requisite hyphen here and in goldenpinioned the threedots point employed by shelley to indicate a pause longer than that of a full stop is introduced into these two lines on the authority of the bodleian manuscript in both cases it replaces a dash in the editio princeps see list of punctual variations below mr locock reports the presence in the manuscript of what he justly terms a characteristic comma after soon mine shook beneath the wide emotion for emotion the bodleian manuscript has commotion locock perhaps the fitter word here deep slumber fell on me my dreams were fire the dash after fire is from the bodleian manuscript where moreover the somewhat misleading but indubitably shelleyan comma after passion editio princeps is wanting locock i have added a dash to the comma after cover in order to clarify the sense and shared in fearless deeds with evil men with forman and dowden i substitute here a comma for the full stop of the editio princeps see also list of punctual variations below stanza the spirit whom i loved in solitude sustained his child the comma here important as marking the sense as well as the rhythm of the passage is derived from the bodleian manuscript locock i looked and we were sailing pleasantly swift as a cloud between the sea and sky beneath the rising moon seen far away mountains of ice etc the editio princeps has a comma after sky and a semicolon after away a pointing followed by forman dowden and woodberry by transposing these points as in our text however a much better sense is obtained and luckily this better sense proves to be that yielded by the bodleian manuscript where mr locock reports there is a semicolon after sky a comma after moon and no point whatsoever after away girt by the deserts of the universe so the bodleian manuscript anticipated by woodberry rossetti had substituted a comma for the period of editio princeps hymns which my soul had woven to freedom strong the source of passion whence they rose to be triumphant strains which etc the editio princeps followed by forman has passion whence mrs shelley poetical works both editions prints strong the source of passion whence they rose to be triumphant strains which etc but pale were calm with passion thus subdued etc with rossetti dowden woodberry i add a comma after but to the pointing of the editio princeps mrs shelley poetical works both editions prints but pale were calm with passion thus subdued etc methought that grate was lifted etc shelleys and mrs shelleys editions have gate which is retained by forman but cf dowden and woodberry follow rossetti in printing grate where her own standard etc so mrs shelley poetical works both editions beneath whose spires which swayed in the red flame shelleys and mrs shelleys editions give red light here an oversight perpetuated by forman the rhymewords name and frame notwithstanding with rossetti dowden woodberry i print red flame an obvious emendation proposed by fleay when the waves smile as sudden earthquakes light many a volcanoisle thus sudden unexpected feast was spread etc with forman dowden woodberry i substitute after isle a comma for the full stop of editions retained by rossetti the passage is obscure perhaps shelley wrote lift many a volcanoisle the plain becomes studded in an instant with piles of corpses even as the smiling surface of the sea will sometimes become studded in an instant with many islands uplifted by a sudden shock of earthquake the editio princeps punctuates thus and words it gave gestures and looks such as in whirlwinds bore which might not be withstood whence none could save all who approached their sphere like some calm wave vexed into whirlpools by the chasms beneath this punctuation is retained by forman rossetti dowden woodberry place a comma after gave and gestures and adopting the suggestion of mr ac bradley enclose line which mightcould save in parentheses thus construing which might not be withstood and whence none could save as adjectival clauses qualifying whirlwinds and taking bore as a transitive verb governing all who approached their sphere this which i believe to be the true construction is perhaps indicated quite as clearly by the pointing adopted in the text a pointing moreover which on metrical grounds is i think preferable to that proposed by mr bradley i have added a dash to the comma after sphere to indicate that it is cythna herself and not all who approached etc that resembles some calm wave etc which dwell in lakes when the red moon on high pause ere it wakens tempest here when the moon pause is clearly irregular but it appears in editions and is undoubtedly shelleys phrase rossetti cites a conjectural emendation by a certain cd campbell mauritius which the red moon on high pours eve it wakens tempest but cf julian and maddalo lines meanwhile the sun paused ere it should alight over the horizon of the mountains and prince athanase lines when the curved moon then lingering in the west paused in yon waves her mighty horns to wet etc time imparted such power to me i became fearlesshearted etc with woodberry i replace with a dash the comma editio princeps after me retained by forman deleted by rossetti and dowden shelleys and formans punctuation leaves the construction ambiguous with woodberrys the two clauses are seen to be parallel the latter being appositive to and explanatory of the former while with dowdens the clauses are placed in correlation time imparted such power to me that i became fearlesshearted of love in that lorn solitude etc all editions prior to have lone solitude etc the important emendation lorn was first introduced into the text by forman from shelleys revised copy of laon and cythna where lone is found to be turned into lorn by the poets own hand and hate is throned on high with fear her mother etc so the editio princeps forman dowden woodberry following the text of laon and cythna read fear his mother forman refers to where fear figures as a female and hate as her mate and foe but consistency in such matters was not one of shelleys characteristics and there seems to be no need for alteration here mrs shelley and rossetti follow the editio princeps the ship fled fast till the stars gan to fail and round me gathered etc the editio princeps has no comma after and mrs shelley places a full stop at fail and reads all round me gathered etc words which the lore of truth in

his wife dated friday august to dussebes meta men pleiona tiktei sphetera d eikota genna lines this passage from the words more bright to the close of line is wanting in the editio princeps its place being supplied by asterisks the lacuna in the text is due no doubt to the timidity of ollier the publisher whom shelley had authorised to make excisions from the notes in poetical works the lines as they appear in our text are restored in galignanis edition of coleridge shelley and keats paris however they had already appeared though with the substitution of wise for bright line and of

first to mr rossetti we owe the reconstruction of this fragmentary drama out of materials partly published by mrs shelley in partly recovered from manuscript by himself the bracketed words are presumably supplied by mr rossetti to fill actual lacunae in the manuscript those queried represent indistinct writing mr rossettis additions to the text are indicated in the footnotes in one or two instances mr forman and dr garnett have restored the true reading the list of dramatis personae is mr formans the triumph of life lines this grammatically incoherent passage is thus conjecturally emended by rossetti fled back like eagles to their native noon for those who put aside the diadem of earthly thrones or gems whether of athens or jerusalem were neither mid the mighty captives seen etc in the case of an incomplete poem lacking the authors final corrections however restoration by conjecture is to say the least of it gratuitous line the words even as the deeds of others not as theirs and then are wanting in editions and were recovered by dr garnett from the boscombe manuscript mrs shelleys note here runs there is a chasm here in the manuscript which it is impossible to fill it appears from the context that other shapes pass and that rousseau still stood beside the dreamer mr forman thinks that the chasm is filled up by the words restored from the manuscript by dr garnett mr ac bradley writes it seems likely that after writing i have sufferedpain shelley meant to strike out the words between known and i and to fill up the gap in such a way that i would be the last word of the line beginning may well be known miscellaneous poems to mrs shelley tentatively assigned this fragment to it seems not improbable that it was addressed at this time june to mary godwin dowden life woodberry suggests that harriet answers as well or better to the situation described on death these stanzas occur in the esdaile manuscript along with others which shelley intended to print with queen mab in but the text was revised before publication in to the poem beginning oh there are spirits in the air was addressed in idea to coleridge whom he never knew writes mrs shelley mr bertram dobell mr rossetti and professor dowden however incline to think that we have here an address by shelley in a despondent mood to his own spirit lines these appear to be antedated by a year as they evidently allude to the death of harriet shelley in november another fragment to music to mr forman we owe the restoration of the true text here food of love mrs shelley printed god of love marenghi lines the rossetti version of these lines is white bones and locks of dun and yellow hair and ringed horns which buffaloes did wear the words locks of dun line are cancelled in the manuscript shelleys failure to cancel the whole line was due mr locock rightly argues to inadvertence merely instead of buffaloes the manuscript gives the buffalo and it supplies the wonderful line locock which closes the stanza in our text and with which mr locock aptly compares mont blanc line save when the eagle brings some hunters bone and the wolf tracks her there ode to liberty lines on the suggestion of his brother mr alfred forman the editor of the library edition of shelleys poems mr buxton forman printed these lines as follows a glorious people vibrated again the lightning of the nations liberty from heart to heart etc the testimony of shelleys autograph in the harvard college manuscript however is final against such a punctuation lines we follow mrs shelleys punctuation in shelleys edition there is no stop at the end of line and a semicolon closes line ode to naples in mrs shelleys editions the various sections of this ode are severally headed as follows epode alpha epode alpha strophe alpha strophe beta antistrophe alpha gamma antistrophe beta gamma antistrophe beta gamma antistrophe alpha gamma epode gamma epode gamma in the manuscript mr locock tells us the headings are very doubtful many of them being vaguely altered with pen and pencil shelley evidently hesitated between two or three alternative ways of indicating the structure and corresponding parts of his elaborate song hence the chaotic jumble of headings printed in editions so far as the epodes are concerned the headings in this edition are those of editions which may be taken as supported by the manuscript locock as to the remaining sections mr lococks examination of the manuscript leads him to conclude that shelleys final choice was strophe strophe antistrophe antistrophe antistrophe alpha antistrophe alpha this in itself would be perfectly appropriate but it would be inconsistent with the method employed in designating the epodes i have therefore adopted in preference a scheme which if it lacks manuscript authority in some particulars has at least the merit of being absolutely logical and consistent throughout mr locock has some interesting remarks on the metrical features of this complex ode on the th line of antistrophe a line of the ode aghast she pass from the earths disk which exceeds by one foot the th lines of the two corresponding divisions strophe and antistrophe b he observes happily enough that aghast may well have been intended to disappear mr locock does not seem to notice that the closing lines of these three answering sections hail hail all hail thou shalt be great all hail art thou of all these hopes o hail increase by regular lengths two three four iambi nor does he seem quite to grasp shelleys intention with regard to the rhyme scheme of the other triple group strophe antistrophe a antistrophe b that of strophe may be thus expressed aabc ddbc acd bc between this and antistrophe a the second member of the group there is a general correspondence with in one particular a subtle modification the scheme now becomes aabc ddbc acb dc ie the rhymes of lines and are transposed god line answering to the halfway rhymes of lines and gawd and unawed instead of as in strophe to the rhymeendings of lines and and vice versa fate line answering to desolate and state lines and instead of to the halfway rhymes aforesaid as to antistrophe b that follows antistrophe a so far as it goes but after line it breaks off suddenly and closes with two lines corresponding in length and rhyme to the closing couplet of antistrophe b the section immediately preceding which however belongs not to this group but to the other mr locock speaks of line as a rhymeless line rhymeless it is not for shore its rhymetermination answers to bower and power the halfway rhymes of lines and respectively why mr locock should call line an unmetrical line i cannot see it is a decasyllabic line with a trochee substituted for an iambus in the third foot around me gleamed many a

appears under the title of the black canon of elmham or saint edmonds eve stockdale the publisher of victor and cazire detected the imposition and communicated his discovery to shelley when with all the ardour natural to his character he shelley expressed the warmest resentment at the imposition practised upon him by his coadjutor and entreated me to destroy all the copies of which about one

on the sea a scene which wildered fancy viewed a sensitive plant in a garden grew a shovel of his ashes took a widow bird sate mourning a woodman whose rough heart was out of tune ah faint are her limbs and her footstep is weary ah grasp the dire dagger and couch the fell spear ah quit me not yet for the wind whistles shrill ah sister desolation is a delicate thing ah sweet is the moonbeam that sleeps on yon fountain alas for liberty alas good friend what profit can you see alas this is not what i thought life was ambition power and avarice now have hurled amid the desolation of a city among the guests who often stayed an old mad blind despised and dying king and canst thou mock mine agony thus calm and earnest to explore within around and ever as he went he swept a lyre and if my grief should still be dearer to me and like a dying lady lean and pale and many there were hurt by that strong boy and peter bell when he had been and said i that all hope was fled and that i walk thus

dreamed that miltons spirit rose and took i faint i perish with my love i grow i fear thy kisses gentle maiden i hated thee fallen tyrant i did groan i love thee baby for thine own sweet sake i loved alas our life is love i met a traveller from an antique land i mourn adonis dead loveliest adonis i pant for the music which is divine i rode one evening with count maddalo i sate beside a sages bed i sate beside the steersman then and gazing i sing the glorious power with azure eyes i stood upon a heavencleaving turret i stood within the city disinterred i weep for adonais he is dead i went into the deserts of dim sleep i would not be a king enough if gibbets axes confiscations chains if i esteemed you less envy would kill if i walk in autumns even in the cave which wild weeds cover in the sweet solitude of this calm place inter marmoreas leonorae pendula colles is it that in some brighter sphere is it the eternal triune is it he is not today enough why do i peer it is not blasphemy to

day of many days o bacchus what a world of toil both now o happy earth reality of heaven o mary dear that you were here o mighty mind in whose deep stream this age o pillow cold and wet with tears o slavery thou frost of the worlds prime o that a chariot of cloud were mine o that mine enemy had written o thou bright sun beneath the dark blue line o thou immortal deity o thou who plumed with strong desire o universal mother who dost keep o wild west wind thou breath of autumns being o world o life o time offspring of jove calliope once more oh did you observe the black canon pass oh take the pure gem to where southerly breezes oh there are spirits of the air oh what is the gain of restless care on a battletrumpets blast on a poets lips i slept on the brink of the night and the morning once early in the morning one sung of thee who left the tale untold one word is too often profaned orphan hours the year is dead our boat is asleep on serchios stream our spoil is won out of the eastern shadow of the earth over the utmost hill at length i sped palaceroof of cloudless nights pan loved his neighbour echo but that child people of england ye who toil and groan peter bells one two and three place for the marshal of the masque poet of nature thou hast wept to know prince athanase had one beloved friend rarely rarely comest thou reach me that handkerchief my brain is hurt returning from its daily quest my spirit rome has fallen ye see it lying rough wind that moanest loud sacred goddess mother earth see yon opening flower serene in his unconquerable might shall we roam my love she comes not yet i left her even now she left me at the silent time she saw me not she heard me not alone she was an aged woman and the years silence oh well are death and sleep and thou silver key of the fountain of tears sing muse the son of maia and of jove sleep sleep on forget thy pain so now my summer task is ended mary so we sate joyous as the morning ray stern stern is the voice of fates fearful command such hope as is the sick despair of good such was zonoras and as daylight finds summer was dead and autumn was expiring sweet spirit sister of that orphan one sweet star which gleaming oer the darksome scene swift as a spirit hastening to his task swifter far than summers flight swiftly walk oer the western wave tell me thou star whose wings of light that matter of the murder is hushed up that night we anchored in a woody bay that time is dead for ever child the awful shadow of some unseen power the babe is at peace within the womb the billows on the beach are leaping around it the cold earth slept below the curtain of the universe the deathbell beats the death knell is ringing the devil i safely can aver the devil now knew his proper cue the elements respect their makers seal the everlasting universe of things the fierce beasts of the woods and wildernesses the fiery mountains answer each other the fitful alternations of the rain the flower that smiles today the fountains mingle with the river the gentleness of rain was in the wind the golden gates of sleep unbar the joy the triumph the delight the madness the keen stars were twinkling the odour from the flower is gone the old man took the oars and soon the bark the pale stars are gone the pale stars of the morn the pale the cold and the moony smile the path through which that lovely twain the rose that drinks the fountain dew the rude wind is singing the season was the childhood of sweet june the serpent is shut out from paradise the sleepless hours who watch me as i lie the spider spreads her webs whether she be the starlight smile of children the sweet looks the stars may dissolve and the fountain of light the sun is set the swallows are asleep the sun is warm the sky is clear the sun makes music as of old the transport of a fierce and monstrous gladness the viewless and invisible consequence the voice of the spirits of air and of earth the warm sun is failing the bleak wind is wailing the waters are flashing the wind has swept from the wide atmosphere the world is dreary the world is now our dwellingplace the worlds great age begins anew then weave the web of the mystic measure there is a voice not understood by all there is a warm and gentle atmosphere there late was one within whose subtle being there was a little lawny islet there was a youth who as with toil and travel these are two friends whose lives were undivided they die the dead return not misery those whom nor power nor lying faith nor toil thou art fair and few are fairer thou art the wine whose drunkenness is all thou living light that in thy rainbow hues thou supreme goddess by whose power divine thou wert not cassius and thou couldst not be thou wert the morning star among the living thrice three hundred thousand years thus to be lost and thus to sink and die thy beauty hangs around thee like thy countrys curse is on thee darkest crest thy dewy looks sink in my breast thy little footsteps on the sands thy look of love has power to calm tis midnight now athwart the murky air tis the terror of tempest the rags of the sail to me this worlds a dreary blank to the deep to the deep to thirst and find no fill to wail and wander tremble kings despised of man twas at the season when the earth upsprings twas at this season that prince athanase twas dead of the night when i sat in my dwelling twas dead of the night when i sate in my dwelling unfathomable sea whose waves are years unrisen splendour of the brightest sun vessels of heavenly medicine may the breeze victorious wrong with vulture scream wake the serpent not lest he was there a human spirit in the steed we are as clouds that veil the midnight moon we come from the mind we join the throng we meet not as we parted we strew these opiate flowers wealth and dominion fade into the mass weave the dance on the floor of the breeze weep not my gentle boy he struck but me what alive and so bold o earth what art thou presumptuous who profanest what mary is when she a little smiles what men gain fairly that they should possess what think you the dead are what thoughts had sway oer cythnas lonely slumber what was the shriek that struck fancys ear when a lover clasps his fairest when may is painting with her colours gay when passions trance is overpast when soft winds and sunny skies when the lamp is shattered when the last hope of trampled france had failed when winds that move not its calm surface sweep where art thou beloved tomorrow where mans profane and tainting hand whose is the love that gleaming through the world why is it said thou canst not live wild pale and wonderstricken even as one wilt thou forget the happy hours within a cavern of mans trackless spirit worlds on worlds are rolling ever would i were the winged cloud ye congregated powers of heaven who share ye dorian woods and waves lament aloud ye gentle visitations of calm thought ye hasten to the grave what seek ye there ye who intelligent the third heaven move ye wildeyed muses sing the twins of jove yes all is past swift time has fled away yes often when the eyes are cold and dry yet look on me take not thine eyes away you said that spirits spoke but it was thee your call was as a winged car
