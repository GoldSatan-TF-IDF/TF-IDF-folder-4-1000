johnny and the bomb by terry prachett i would like to thank the meteorological office the royal mint and my old friend bernard pearson who if he doesnt know something always knows a man who does for their help in the research for this book when historical details are wrong its my fault for not listening but who knows what really happened in the other leg of the trousers of time after the bombs it was nine oclock in the evening in blackbury high street it was dark with occasional light from the full moon behind streamers of wornout cloud the wind was from the southwest and there had been another thunderstorm which freshened the air and made the cobbles slippery a policeman moved very slowly and sedately along the street here and there if someone was very close they might have seen the faintest line of light around a blackedout window from within came the quiet sounds of people living their lives the mufed notes of a piano as someone practiced scales over and over again and the munnur and occasional burst of laughter from the wireless some of the shop windows had sandbags piled in front of them a poster outside one shop urged people to dig for victory as if it were some kind of turnip on the horizon in the direction of slate the thin beams of searchlights tried to pry bombers out of the clouds the policeman turned the corner and walked up the next street his boots seeming very loud in the stillness the beat took him up as far as the methodist chapel and in theory would then take him down paradise street but it didnt do that tonight because there was no paradise street any more not since last night there was a lorry parked by the chapel light leaked out from the tarpaulin that covered the back he banged on it you cant park that ere gents he said i fine you one mug of tea and we shall say no more about it eh the tarpaulin was pushed back and a soldier jumped out there was a brief vision of the interior a warm tent of orange light with a few soldiers sitting around a little stove and the air thick with cigarette smoke the soldier grinned gius a mug and a wad for the sergeant he said to someone in the lorry a tin mug of scalding black tea and a brickthick sandwich were handed out much obliged said the policeman taking them he leaned against the lorry hows it going then he said havent heard a bang its a pounder said the soldier went right down through the cellar floor you lot took a real pounding last night eh want a look is it safe course not said the soldier cheerfully thats why were here right come on he pinched out his cigarette and put it behind his ear i thought you lotd be guarding it said the policeman its two in the morning and its been pissing down said the soldier whos going to steal an unexploded bomb yes but the sergeant looked in the direction of the ruined street there was the sound of bricks sliding someone is by the sound of it he said what weve got warning signs up said the soldier we only knocked off for a brewup oi their boots crunched on the rubble that had been strewn across the road it is safe isnt it said the sergeant not if someone drops a dirty great heap of bricks on it no oi you the moon came out from behind the clouds they could make out a figure at the other end of what remained of the street near the wall of the pickle factory the sergeant skidded to a halt oh no he whispered its mrs tachyon the soldier stared at the small figure that was dragging some sort of cart through the rubble whos she lets just take it quietly shall we said the policeman grabbing his arm he shone his torch and set his face into a sort of mad friendly grin that you mrs tachyon he said its me sergeant bourke bit chilly to be out at this time of night eh got a nice warm cell back at the station yes i daresay there could be a big hot mug of cocoa for you if you just come along with me how about that cant she read all them warning signs is she mental said the soldier under his breath shes right by the house with the bomb in the cellar yes no shes just different said the sergeant bit touched he raised his voice you just stay where you are love and well come and get you dont want you hurting yourself on all this junk do we here has she been looting said the soldier she could get shot for that pinching stuff from bombed out houses noones going to shoot mrs tachyon said the sergeant we know her see she was in the cells the other night whatd she done nothing we let her kip in a spare cell in the station if its a nippy night i gave her a tanner and pair of ole boots what belong to me mum only yesterday well look at her shes old enough to be your granny poor old biddy mrs tachyon stood and watched them owlishly as they walked very cautiously towards her the soldier saw a wizened little woman wearing what looked like a party dress with layers of other clothes on top and a woolly hat with a bobble on it she was pushing a wire cart on wheels it had a metal label on it tesco he said whats that dunno where she gets half her stuff muttered the sergeant the trolley seemed to be full of black bags but there were other things which glittered in the moonlight i know where she got that stuff muttered the soldier thats been pinched from the pickle factory oh half the town was in there this morning said the sergeant a few jars of gherkins wont hurt yeah but you cant have this sort of thing ere you missus you just let me have a look at he reached towards the trolley some sort of demon all teeth and glowing eyes erupted from it and clawed the skin off the back of his hand blast ere help me get hold of but the sergeant had backed away thats guilty that is he said i should come away if i was you mrs tachyon cackled thunderbirds are go she chortled wot no bananas thats what you think my old dollypot she hauled the trolley round and trotted off dragging it behind her hey dont go in therethe soldier shouted the old woman hauled the trolley over a pile of bricks a piece of wall collapsed behind her the last brick hit something far below which went boink the soldier and the policeman froze in midrun the moon went behind a cloud again in the darkness there was a ticking sound it was far off and a bit mufed but in that pool of silence both men heard it all the way up their spines the sergeants foot which had been in the air came down slowly how longve you got if it starts to tick he whispered there was noone there the soldier was accelerating away the policeman ran after him and was halfway up the ruins of paradise street before the world behind him suddenly became full of excitement it was nine oclock in the evening in blackbury high street in the window of the electrical shop nine tvs showed the same picture nine televisions projected their flickering screens at the empty air a newspaper blew along the deserted pavement until it wrapped around the stalks in an ornamental flowerbed the wind caught an empty lager tin and bowled it across the pavement until it hit a drain the high street was what blackbury district council called a pedestrian precinct and amenity area although noone was quite sure what the amenities were or even what an amenity was perhaps it was the benches cunningly designed so that people wouldnt sit on them for too long and make the place untidy or maybe it was the flowerbeds which sprouted a regular crop of the hardy perennial crisp packet it couldnt have been the ornamental trees theyd looked quite big and leafy on the original drawings a few years ago but what with cutbacks and one thing and another noone had actually got around to planting any the sodium lights made the night cold as ice the newspaper blew on again and wrapped itself around a yellow litter bin in the shape of a fat dog with its mouth open something landed in an alleyway and groaned tick tick tick tickety boo ow national health service the interesting thing about worrying about things thought johnny maxwell was the way there was always something new to worry about his friend kirsty said it was because he was a natural worrier but that was because she didnt worry about anything she got angry instead and did things about it whatever it was he really envied the way she decided what it was and knew exactly what to do about it almost instantly currently she was saving the planet most evenings and foxes at weekends johnny just worried usually they were the same old worries school money whether you could get aids from watching television and so on but occasionally one would come out of nowhere like a christmas number one and knock all the others down a whole division right now it was his mind its not exactly the same as being ill said yoless whod read all the way through his mothers medical encyclopedia its not being ill at all if lots of bad things have happened to you its healthy to be depressed said johnny thats sense isnt it what with the business going down the drain and dad pushing off and mum just sitting around smoking all the time and everything i mean going around smiling and saying oh its not so bad that would be mental thats right said yoless whod read a bit about psychology as well my bran went mental said bigmac she ow sorry said yoless i wasnt looking where i put my foot but fairs fair you werent either its just dreams said johnny its nothing mad although he had to admit it was dreams during the day too dreams so real that they filled his eyes and ears the planes the bombs and the fossil fly why that thered be these nightmares and in the middle of it thered be the fly it was a tiny one in a piece of amber hed saved up for it and done a science project on it but it wasnt even scarylooking it was just a fly from millions of years ago why was that in a nightmare huh school teachers why couldnt they be like they were supposed to be and just chuck things at you if you werent paying attention instead they all seemed to have been worrying about him and sending notes home and getting him to see a specialist although the specialist wasnt too bad and at least it got him out of maths one of the notes had said he was disturbed well who wasnt disturbed he hadnt shown it to his mum things were bad enough as it was you getting on all right at your grandads said yoless its not too bad grandad does the housework most of the time anyway hes good at fried bread and surprise surprise whats that you know that stall on the market that sells tins thatve got the labels off yes well he buys loads of those and youve got to eat them once theyre opened yuk oh pineapple and meatballs isnt too bad they walked on through the evening street the thing about all of us johnny thought the sad thing is that were not very good actually thats not the worst part the worst part is were not even much good at being not much good take yoless when you looked at yoless you might think he had possibilities he was black technically but he never said yo and only said check it out in the supermarket and the only person he ever called a mother was his mother yoless said it was racial stereotyping to say all black kids acted like that but however you looked at it yoless had been born with a defective cool trainspotters were cooler than yoless if you gave yoless a baseball cap hed put it on the right way round thats how well yoless was sometimes he actually wore a tie now bigmac bigmac was good he was good at maths sort of it made the teachers wild you could show bigmac some sort of horrible equation and hed say x and hed be right but he never knew why its just what it is hed say and that was no good knowing the answers wasnt what maths was about maths was about showing how you worked them out even if you got them wrong bigmac was also a skinhead bigmac and bazza and skazz were the last three skinheads in blackbury at least the last three who werent someones dad and he had love and hat on his knuckles but only in biro because when hed gone to get tattooed he fainted and he bred tropical fish as for wobbler wobbler wasnt even a nerd he wanted to be a nerd but they wouldnt let him join he had a nerd pride badge and he messed around with computers what wobbler wanted was to be a kid in milkbottlebottom glasses and a deformed anorak who could write amazing software and be a millionaire by the time he was twenty but hed probably settle for just being someone whose computer didnt keep smelling of burning plastic every time he touched it and as for johnny if you go mad do you know youve gone mad if you dont how do you know youre not mad it wasnt a bad film wobbler was saying theyd been to screen w at the blackbury odeon they generally went to see any film that promised to have laser beams in it somewhere but you cant travel in time without messing things up said yoless thats the whole point said bigmac thats what you want to do i wouldnt mind joining the police if they were time police youd go back and say hey are you adolf hitler and when he said achtung thats me ja kablooeee with the pumpaction shotgun end of problem yes but supposing you accidentally shot your own grandfather said yoless patiently i wouldnt he doesnt look a bit like adolf hitler anyway youre not that good a shot said wobbler you got kicked out of the paintball club didnt you only cos they were jealous that they hadnt thought of a paintball hand grenade before i showed them how it was a tin of paint bigmac a twolitre tin well yeah but in contex it was a hand grenade they said you might at least have loosened the lid a bit sean stevens needed stitches i didnt mean actually shooting your actual grandfather said yoless loudly i mean messing things up so maybe youre not actually born or your time machine never gets invented like in that film where the robot is sent back to kill the mother of the boy whos going to beat the robots when he grows up good one that said bigmac strafing the silent shops with an invisible machine gun but if he never got born how did they know hed existed said yoless didnt make any sense to me how come youre such an expert said wobbler well ive got three shelves of star trek videos said yoless anorak alert nerd trainspotter anyway said yoless if you changed things maybe youd end up not going back in time and there you would be back in time i mean except you never went in the first place so you wouldnt be able to come back on account of not having gone or even if you could get back youd get back to another time like a sort of parallel dimension because if the thing you changed hadnt happened then you wouldnt have gone so you could only come back to somewhere you never went and there youd be stuck they tried to work this out huh youd have to be mad even to understand time travel said wobbler eventually job opportunity for you there johnny said bigmac bigmac said yoless in a warning voice its all right said johnny the doctor said i just worry about things too much what kind of loony tests did you have said bigmac big needles and electric shocks and that no bigmac sighed johnny they dont do that they just ask you questions what like are you a loony its be sound to go a long way back in time said wobbler back to the dinosaurs no chance of killing your grandad then unless hes really old dinosaursd be all right great said bigmac then i could wipe em out with my plasma rifle oh yes yeah said wobbler rolling his eyes thatd explain a lot why did the dinosaurs die out sixtyfive million years ago because bigmac couldnt get there any earlier but you havent got a plasma rifle said johnny if wobbler can have a time machine then i can have a plasma rifle oh all right and a rocket launcher a time machine thought johnny that would be something you could get your life exactly as you wanted it if something nasty turned up you could just go back and make sure that it didnt you could go wherever you wanted and nothing bad would ever have to happen around him the boys conversation as their conversations did took on its own peculiar style anyway noones proved the dinosaurs did die out oh yeah right sure theyre still around are they i mean praps they only come out at night or are camouflaged or something a brickfinished stegosaurus a bright red number brontosaurus hey neat idea theyd go round pretending to be a bus right and people could get on but they wouldnt get off again ooooeeeoooo nah false noses false noses and beards then just when people arent expecting it unk nothing on the pavement but a pair of shoes and a really big bloke in a mac shuffling away paradise street thought johnny paradise street was on his mind a lot these days especially at night i bet if you asked the people there if time travel was a good idea theyd say yes i mean no one knows what happened to the dinosaurs but we know what happened to paradise street i wish i could go back to paradise street something hissed they looked around there was an alleyway between the charity clothes shop and the video library the hissing came from there except now it had changed into a snarl it wasnt at all pleasant it went right into his ears and right through johnnys modern brain and right down into the memories built into his very bones when an early ape had cautiously got down out of its tree and wobbled awkwardly along the ground trying out this new standing upright idea all the younger apes were talking about this was exactly the kind of snarl it hated to hear it said to every muscle in the body run away and climb something and possibly throw down some coconuts too theres something in the alley said wobbler looking around in case there were any trees handy a werewolf said bigmac wobbler stopped why should it be a werewolf he said i saw this film curse of the revenge of the werewolf said bigmac and someone heard a snarl like that and went into a dark alley and next thing he was lying there with all his special effects spilling out on the pavement huh quavered wobbler theres no such things as werewolves you go and tell it then johnny stepped forward there was a shopping trolley lying on its side just inside the alley but that wasnt unusual herds of shopping trolleys roamed the streets of blackbury while hed never seen one actually moving he sometimes suspected that they trundled off as soon as his back was turned bulging carrier bags and black plastic dustbin liners lay around it and there was a number of jars one of them had broken open and there was a smell of vinegar one of the bundles was wearing trainers you didnt see that very often a terrible monster pulled itself over the top of the trolley and spat at johnny it was white but with bits of brown and black as well it was scrawny it had three and a half legs but only one ear its face was a mask of absolute determined evil its teeth were jagged and yellow its breath as nasty as a pepper spray johnny knew it well so did practically everyone else in blackbury hello guilty he said taking care to keep his hands by his sides if guilty was here and the shopping trolley was here he looked down at the bundle with the trainers i think somethings happened to mrs tachyon he said the others hurried up it only looked like a bundle because mrs tachyon tended to wear everything she owned all at once this was a woolly hat about twelve jerseys and a pink ra skirt then bare pipe cleaner legs down to several pairs of football socks and the huge trainers is that blood said wobbler ur said bigmac yuk i think shes alive said johnny im sure i heard a groan er i know first aid said yoless uncertainly kiss of life and stuff kiss of life mrs tachyon yuk said bigmac yoless looked very worried what seemed simple when you did it in a nice warm hall with the instructor watching seemed a lot more complicated in an alleyway especially with all the woolly jumpers involved whoever invented first aid hadnt had mrs tachyon in mind yoless knelt down gingerly he patted mrs tachyon vaguely and something fell out of one of her many pockets it was fish and chips wrapped in a piece of newspaper shes always eating chips said bigmac my brother says she picks thrownaway papers out of the bin to see if theres any chips still in em yuk er said yoless desperately as he tried to find a way of administering first aid without actually touching anything finally johnny came to his rescue and said i know how to dial yoless sagged with relief yes yes thats right he said im pretty sure you mustnt move people on account of breaking bones or the crust said wobbler mrs tachyon mrs tachyon had always been there as long as johnny could remember she was a bag lady before people knew what bag ladies were although strictly speaking she was a trolley woman it wasnt a normal supermarket trolley either it looked bigger the wires looked thicker and it hurt like mad when mrs tachyon pushed it into the small of your back which she did quite a lot it wasnt that she did it out of nastiness well it probably wasnt but other people just didnt exist on planet tachyon fortunately one wheel squeaked and if you didnt get accustomed to moving away quickly when you heard the squee squee squee coming the monologue was another warning mrs tachyon talked all the time you could never be quite certain who she was talking to i sez thats what you sez is it thats what you think an i could get both hands in yer mouth and still wind wool i sez oh yes tell sid yer so skinny yer can close one eye and yerd look like a needle i sez oh yes they done me out of it tell that to the boys in khaki thats a pelter or i dont know what is but quite often it was just a mumble with occasional triumphant shouts of i told em and thats what you think the trolley with its squeaky wheel could turn up behind you at any hour of the day or night no one knew when to expect it nor did anyone know what was in all those bags mrs tachyon tended to rummage a lot in bins and things so no one wanted to find out sometimes shed disappear for weeks on end no one knew where she went then just when everyone was beginning to relax thered be the squee squee squee behind them and the stabbing pain in the small of the back mrs tachyon picked things out of the gutter that was probably how shed acquired guilty with his fur like carpet underlay broken teeth and boomerang shaped backbone when guilty walked which wasnt often since he preferred to ride in the trolley he tended to go around in circles when he ran usually because he was trying to fight something the fact that he only had one and a half legs in front meant that sooner or later his back legs would overtake him and by then he was always in such a rage that hed bite his own tail even dss the rabid dog owned by syd the crusty which once ate a police alsatian would run away at the sight of guilty spinning towards him frantically biting himself the ambulance drove off blue light flashing guilty watched johnny from the trolley going crosseyed with hatred the ambulance man said she looked as if shed been hit by something said wobbler who was also watching the cat it was never a good idea to take your eye off guilty whatre we going to do with all this stuff said johnny yeah cant leave it said bigmac thatd be littering but its her stuff said johnny dont look at me said bigmac some of those bags squelch and theres the cat said johnny yeah we ought to kill the cat said bigmac it took all the skin off my hand last week johnny cautiously pulled the trolley upright guilty clung to it hissing he likes you said bigmac how can you tell youve still got both eyes you could take it along to the rspca in the morning said yoless i suppose so said johnny but what about the trolley we cant just leave it here yeah lets push it off the top of the multistorey said bigmac johnny prodded a bag it moved a bit and then flowed back with an unpleasant oozing noise yknow my brother said mrs tachyon killed her husband years ago and then went mental and they never found his body said bigmac they looked at the bags none of them is big enough for a dead body said yoless who wasnt allowed to watch horror movies not a whole one no said bigmac yoless took a step back i heard she stuck his head in the oven said wobbler very messy messy said yoless it was a microwave oven get it if you put a shut up said yoless i heard shes really really rich said bigmac stinking rich said wobbler look ill just ill just put in it in my grandads garage said johnny i dont see why we have to do it said yoless theres supposed to be care in the community or something he doesnt keep much in there now and then in the morning oh well the morning was another day and while youve got it you could have a rummage to see if theres any money said bigmac johnny glanced at guilty who snarled no i like a hand with all its fingers on he said you lot come with me id feel a right clod pushing this by myself the fourth wheel squeaked and bounced as he pushed the trolley down the street looks heavy said yoless there was a snigger from beside him well they say mr tachyon was a very big man just shut up bigmac its me he thought as the procession went down the street its like on the lottery only its the opposite theres this big finger in the sky and it comes through your window and flicks you on the ear and says its you har har har and you get up and think youre going to have a normal day and suddenly youre in charge of a trolley with one squeaky wheel and an insane cat here said wobbler these fish and chips are still warm what said johnny you picked up her actual fish and chips wobbler backed away well yeah why not shame to let them go to waste they might have got her spit on em said bigmac yuk they havent even been unwrapped actually said wobbler but he did stop unwrapping them put them in the trolley wobbler said johnny dunno who wraps fish and chips in newspaper round here said wobbler tossing the package onto the pile in the trolley hong kong henry doesnt whered she get them sir john was normally awakened at half past eight every morning by a butler who brought him his breakfast another butler who brought him his clothes a third butler whose job it was to feed adolf and stalin if necessary and a fourth butler who was basically a spare at nine oclock his secretary came and read him his appointments for today when he did so this morning though he found him still staring at his plate with a strange expression adolf and stalin swam contentedly in the tank by his desk five different kinds of pill some biscuits made of cardboard and a glass of orange juice with all the excitement removed said sir john mats the point of being the richest man in the world i am still the richest man in the world arent i yes sir john well whats the point if it all boils down to pills for breakfast he drummed his fingers on the table well ive had enough dyhear tell hickson to get the car out which car sir john the bentley mich bentley sir john oh one i havent used lately he can choose and find blackbury on the map we own a burger bar there dont we er i think so sir john wasnt that the one where you personally chose the site you said you just knew it would be a good one er but today youve got appointments to see the chairman of cancel em all im going to blackbury dont tell em im coming call it a lightning inspection the secret of success in business is to pay attention to the little details am i right people get underdone burgers or the fries turn out to be too soggy and before you know where you are the entire business is down around your ears er if you say so sir john right ill be ready in twenty minutes er you could perhaps leave it until tomorrow only the committee did ask that no the old mars slapped the table its got to be today todays when it all happens you see mrs tachyon the trolley johnny and the rest of them its got to be today otherwise he pushed away the dull yet healthy breakfast otherwise its this for the rest of my life the secretary was used to sir johns moods and tried to lighten things a little blackbury he said thats where you were evacuated during the war wasnt it and you were the only person to escape when one of the streets got bombed me and two goldfish called adolf and stalin thats right thats where it all started said sir john getting up and going over to the window go on jump to it the secretary didnt go straightaway one of his jobs was to keep an eye on sir john the old boy was acting a bit odd people had said hed taken to reading very old newspapers and books with words like time and physics in the title and sometimes he even wrote angry letters to very important scientists when youre the richest man in the world people watch you very closely adolf and stalin said sir john to the whole world in general of course these two are only their descendants it turned out that adolf was female or was it stalin outside the window the gardens stretched all the way to some rolling hills that sir johns landscape gardener had imported specially blackbury said sir john staring at them thats where it all started the whole thing there was a boy called johnny maxwell and mrs tachyon and a cat i think he turned are you still here sorry sir john said the secretary backing out and shutting the door behind him thats where it all started said sir john and thats where its all going to end johnny always enjoyed those first few moments in the morning before the day leapt out at him his head was peacefully full of flowers clouds kittens his hand still hurt horrible bits of last night rushed out from hiding and bounced and gibbered in front of him there was a shopping trolley full of unspeakable bags in the garage there was also a spray of milk across the wall and ceiling where guilty had showed what he thought of people who tried to give him an unprovoked meal johnny had had to use the biggest elastoplast in the medicine tin afterwards he got up dressed and went downstairs his mother wouldnt be up yet and his grandad was definitely in the front room watching saturday morning tv johnny opened the garage door and stepped back hurriedly in case a ball of maddened fur came spinning out nothing happened the dreadful trolley stood in the middle of the floor there was no sign of guilty it was johnny thought just like those scenes in films where you know the monster is in the room somewhere he jumped sideways just in case guilty was about to drop out of the ceiling it was bad enough seeing the wretched cat not seeing it was worse he scurried out and shut the door quickly then went back into the house he probably ought to tell someone official the trolley belonged to mrs tachyon so it might be stealing if he kept it as he went back inside the phone rang there were two ways he could tell firstly the phone rang then his grandfather shouted phone because he never answered the phone if he thought there was a chance it could be answered by someone else johnny picked it up can i speak to said yoless in his speaking to parents voice its me yoless said johnny hey you know mrs tachyon of course i well my mum was on duty at the hospital last night shes got horrible bruises and everything mrs tachyon i mean not my mum someone really had a go at her she said my mum not mrs tachyon she said we ought to tell the police what for we might have seen something anyway er someone might think it was us us but we called the ambulance i know that er and youve got her stuff well we couldnt just leave it there i know that but well we did have bigmac with us and that was it really it wasnt that bigmac was actually evil hed happily fire imaginary nuclear missiles at people but he wouldnt hurt a fly unless perhaps it was a real hard biker fly whichs given him serious grief however he did have a problem with cars especially big fast ones with the keys still in the ignition and he was a skinhead his boots were so big that it was quite hard for him to fall over according to sergeant comely of blackbury police station bigmac was guilty of every unsolved crime in the town whereas in real life he was probably only guilty of ten per cent maximum he looked like trouble no one looking at bigmac would think he was innocent of anything and wobbler too yoless added and wobbler would admit to anything if you got him frightened enough all the great unsolved mysteries of the world the bermuda triangle the marie celeste the loch ness monster could be sorted out in about half an hour if you leaned a bit on wobbler ill go by myself then said johnny simpler that way yoless sighed with relief thanks the phone rang just as johnny put it down again it started saying hello hello before he got it to his ear er hello he said is that you said a female voice it wasnt exactly an unpleasant one but it had a sharp penetrating quality it seemed to be saying that if you werent you then it was your fault johnny recognized it instantly it was the voice of someone who dialed wrong numbers and then complained that the phone was answered by people she didnt want to speak to yes er yes hello kirsty its kasandra actually oh right said johnny hed have to make a note kirsty changed her name about as often as she changed her clothes although at least these days she was sticking to ones beginning with k have you heard about old mrs tachyon i think so said johnny guardedly apparently a gang of yobs beat her up last night she looked as though a bombd hit her hello hello hello im still here said johnny someone had filled his stomach with ice dont you think thats shameful er yes one of them was black johnny nodded dismally at the phone yoless had explained about this sort of thing hed said that if one of his ancestors had joined attila the huns huge horde of millions of barbarians and helped them raid ancient rome people wouldve definitely remembered that one of them was black and this was yoless who collected brass bands had a matchbox collection and was a known spod er he said it was us i mean we didnt beat her up but we found her i got the ambulance and yoless tried yoless was definitely thinking about first aid didnt you tell the police no honestly i dont know what would happen if i wasnt around youve got to tell them now ill meet you at the police station in half an hour you know how to tell the time the big hand is yes said johnny miserably its only two stops on the bus from your house you know about catching buses yes yes yes of course i you need money thats the round stuff you find in your pockets ciao actually after hed been to the toilet he felt a bit better about it all kirs kasandra took charge of things she was the most organized person johnny knew in fact she was so organized that she had too much organization for one person and it overflowed in every direction he was her friend more or less anyway he wasnt sure hed ever been given a choice in the matter kirs kasandra wasnt good at friends she told him so herself shed said it was because of a character flaw only because she was kikasandra she thought it was a character flaw in everyone else the more she tried to help people by explaining to them how stupid they were the more they just wandered off for no reason at all the only reason johnny hadnt was that he knew how stupid he was but sometimes not often when the light was right and she wasnt organizing anything hed look at kikasandra and wonder if there werent two kinds of stupidity the basic el thicko kind that he had and a highly specialized sort that you only got when you were stuffed too full of intelligence hed better tell grandad where he was going he thought just in case the power went off or the tv broke down and he wondered where johnny had gone im just off to he began and then said im just off out right said grandad without taking his eyes off the set hah look there he goes right in the gunge tank nothing much was going on in the garage after a while guilty crawled out from his nest among the black plastic sacks and took up his usual position in the front of the cart where he was wont to travel on the off chance that he could claw somebody a fly banged on the window pane for a while and then went back to sleep and the bags moved they moved like frogs in oil slithering very slowly around each other they made a rubbery squeaky noise like a clever conjurer trying to twist an animal out of balloons there were other noises too guilty didnt pay them much attention because you couldnt attack noises and besides he was pretty well used to them by now they werent very clear they might have been snatches of music they might have been voices they might have been a radio left on but slightly off station and two rooms away or the distant roar of a crowd johnny met kasandra outside the police station youre lucky ive got some spare time she said come on sergeant comely was on the desk he looked up as johnny and kasandra came in then looked back at the book he was writing in and then looked up again slowly you er hello sergeant comely said johnny what is it this time seen any aliens lately weve come about mrs tachyon sergeant said kasandra oh yes kasandra turned to johnny go on she said tell him er said johnny well me and wobbler and yoless and bigmac wobbler and yoless and bigmac and i said kasandra sergeant comely looked at her all five of you he said i was just correcting his grammar said kasandra do you do that a lot said the sergeant he looked at johnny does she do that a lot all the time said johnny good grief well go on you not her when sergeant comely had been merely pc comely hed visited johnnys school to show everyone how nice the police were and had accidentally locked himself into his own handcuffs he was also a member of the blackbury morris men johnny had actually seen him wearing bells around his knees and waving two hankies in the air these were important things to remember at a time like this well we were proceeding along he began and no jokes twenty minutes later they walked slowly down the steps of the police station well that wasnt too bad said kasandra its not as though you were arrested or anything have you really got her trolley oh yes i liked the look on his face when you said youd bring guilty in he went quite pale i thought whats nextofkin mean he said shed got no nextof kin relatives said kasandra basically it means relatives none at all that isnt unusual yes said johnny but generally theres a cousin in australia you dont know about is there well apparently ive got a cousin in australia and i didnt know about her till last month so it cant be that unusual the state of mrs tachyon is a terrible indictment on society said kasandra whats indictment mean it means its wrong that shes got no relatives i dont think you can get them from the governm no that shes got no home and just wanders around the place living on what she can find something ought to be done well i suppose we could go and see her said johnny shes only in st marks what good would that do well it might cheer her up a bit do you know you start almost every sentence with well well going hospital visiting wont do anything about the disgusting neglect of street people and the mentally ill will it probably not she just might be a bit cheered up i suppose kasandra walked in silence for a moment its just that ive got a thing about hospitals if you must know theyre full of sick people we could take her something she likes and shed probably be glad to know that guilty is okay they smell bad too said kasandra not listening to him that horrible disinfectant smell when youre up close to mrs tachyon you wont notice youre just going on about it because you know i hate hospitals arent you i just think we ought to do it anyway i thought you did things like this for your duke of edinburgh award or whatever it was yes but there was some point in that we could go towards the end of visiting time so we wont be there very long thats what everyone else does oh all right said kasandra wed better take her something too you have to like grapes you mean johnny tried to picture mrs tachyon eating grapes it didnt work ill think about it the garage door swung back and forth slowly inside the garage there was a concrete floor it was old and cracked and soaked in oil animal footprints crossed it embedded in the concrete suggesting that a dog had run across it when it was being laid this happens in every patch of wet concrete everywhere there were also a couple of human footprints fossilized in time and now filled with black grease and dust in other words it was more or less like any piece of concrete there was also a tool bench most of a bicycle upside down and surrounded by tools and bits of bike in a haphazard manner which suggested that someone had mastered the art of taking a bike to bits without succeeding in the craft of putting it back together again a lawnmower entangled in a garden hosepipe which is what always happens in garages and isnt at all relevant a trolley overflowing with plastic bags of all kinds but most particularly six large black ones a small pile of jars of pickles where johnny had carefully stacked them last night the remains of some fish and chips as far as guilty was concerned catfood only happened to other cats a pair of yellow eyes watching intently from the shadows under the bench and that was all bags of time to be honest about it johnny didnt much like hospitals either mostly the people hed gone to visit in them were not going to come out again and no matter how they tried to cheer the place up with plants and pictures it never looked friendly after all noone was there because they wanted to be but kirsty was good at finding out things and getting harassed people to give her answers and it didnt take long to find mrs tachyons ward thats her isnt it she said kasandra pointed along the line of beds one or two of them didnt have visitors around them but there was no mistaking the one belonging to mrs tachyon she was sitting up in bed in a hospital nightgown and her woolly hat over which she had a pair of hospital headphones mrs tachyon stared intently in front of her and jigged happily among the pillows she looks happy enough said kasandra whats she listening to i couldnt say for sure said the nurse all i know is the headphones arent plugged in are you relatives no were kasandra began its a sort of project said johnny you know like weeding old peoples gardens and that sort of thing the nurse gave him an odd look but the magic project word did its usual helpful stuff she sniffed can i smell vinegar she said kasandra glared at johnny he tried to look innocent weve just brought some grapes he said showing her the bag mrs tachyon didnt look up as they dragged chairs over to her bed johnny had never spoken to her in his life except to say sorry when she rammed him with her trolley he wasnt sure how to start now kasandra leaned over and pulled one earphone aside hello mrs tachyon she said mrs tachyon stopped jigging she turned a beady eye on kasandra and then on johnny she had a black eye and her stained white hair looked frizzled at the front but there was something horribly unstoppable about mrs tachyon indeed thats what you think she said call again tomorrow baker and well take a crusty one poor old biddy is it thats what you think millennium hand and shrimp free teeth and corsets maybe for them as likes it but not me thank you so much wot no bananas i had a house oh yes but its all black men now hats are they treating you all right said kasandra dont you worry right as rain and twice as ninepence hah tick tick bang id like to see them try theres puddings of course i remember when it was all fields but would they listen kasandra looked at johnny i think shes a bit confused she said she doesnt understand anything im saying but we dont understand anything shes saying either said johnny who felt confused all the time in any case mrs tachyon adjusted her headphones and started to boogie again i dont believe this said kasandra excuse me she pulled the headphones off the woolly hat and listened to them the nurse was right she said theres nothing at all mrs tachyon bounced up and down happily one born every minute she chortled then she winked at johnny it was a bright knowing wink from planet tachyon to planet johnny weve brought you some grapes mrs tachyon he said thats what you think grapes said johnny firmly he opened the bag exposing the steaming greaseproof fish and chip paper inside her eyes widened a scrawny hand shot out from under the covers grabbed the packet and disappeared under the blanket again him and his coat she said dont mention it er im keeping your trolley safe and guilty is all right although i dont think hes eaten anything apart from some chips and my hand i blame mr chamberlain said mrs tachyon a bell tinkled oh dear thats the end of visiting time my word dont the hours just fly past what a shame said kasandra standing up quickly nice to have met you mrs tachyon sorry we have to be going come on johnny lady muck said mrs tachyon she nodded at johnny whats the word on the street mister man johnny tried to think like mrs tachyon er no parking he suggested thats what you think themes bags of time mister man mind me bike where your mind goes the rest of yours bound to follow here today and gone yesterday doing its the trick eh johnny stared it was as though he had been listening to a lot of static on the radio and then just for a second there was this one clear signal the other mrs tachyon came back hes mixing sugar with the sand mr mcphee she said thats what you think what did you have to go and give her them for kasandra hissed as she strode out of the ward she needs a proper healthy balanced diet not hot chips what did you give her them for well i thought hot chips would be exactly what someones like whod got used to cold chips anyway she didnt get any supper last night hey there was something very odd about she is very odd you dont like her much do you well she didnt even say thank you but i thought she was an unfortunate victim of a repressive political system said johnny thats what you said when we were coming here yes all right but courtesy doesnt cost anything actually come on lets get out of here hello said someone behind them theyve found out about the chips muttered kirsty as she and johnny turned around but it wasnt a nurse bearing down on them unless the hospital had a plain clothes division it was a young woman in glasses and a worried hairstyle she also had boots that would have impressed bigmac and a clipboard um do you two know mrs er tachyon she said is that her name i suppose so said johnny i mean thats what everyone calls her its a very odd name said the woman i suppose its foreign we dont actually know her said kasandra we were just visiting her out of social concern the woman looked at her good grief she said she glanced at her clipboard do you know anything about her she said anything at all like what said johnny anything where she lives where she comes from how old she is anything not really said johnny shes just around you know she must sleep somewhere dont know theres no records of her anywhere theres no records of anyone called tachyon anywhere said the woman her voice suggesting that this was a major criminal offence are you a social worker said kasandra yes im ms partridge i think ive seen you talking to bigmac said johnny bigmac whos bigmac er simon wrigley i think oh yes said ms partridge darkly simon the one who wanted to know how many cars he had to steal to get a free holiday in africa and he said you said youd only send him if cannibalism was still yes yes said ms partridge hurriedly when shed started the job less than a year ago shed firmly believed that everything that was wrong with the world was the fault of big business and the government she believed even more firmly now that it was all the fault of bigmac he was dead impressed he said but you dont actually know anything about mrs tachyon do you said the social worker she had a trolley full of junk but noone seems to know where it is actually kasandra began i dont know where it is either said johnny firmly its be very helpful if we could find it its amazing what they hoard said ms partridge when i was in bolton there was an old lady whod saved every well miss the bus said kasandra sorry we cant help miss partridge come on johnny she pulled him out of the building and down the steps you have got the trolley havent you she said you told me yes but i dont see why people should take it away from her or poke around in it you wouldnt want people poking around in your stuff my mother said she was married to an airman in the second world war and he never came back and she went a bit strange my grandad said he and his friends used to tip up her trolley when he was a boy he said they did it just to hear her swear kasandra hesitated what how old is your grandad dunno about sixtyfive and how old is mrs tachyon would you say its hard to tell under all those wrinkles sixty doesnt that strike you as odd what are you dense or something shes younger than your grandfather oh well perhaps there was another mrs tachyon that isnt very likely is it so youre saying shes a hundred years old of course not theres bound to be a sensible explanation whats your grandfathers memory like hes good at television programs youll be watching and then hell say something like hey him the one in the suit he was the policemen in that program you know the one with the man with the curly hair couple of years ago you know and if you buy anything he can always tell you that you could get it for sixpence and still have change when he was a lad everyones grandad does that said kasandra severely sorry havent you looked in the bags no but shes got some odd stuff how do you mean well there are these jars of pickles well old people like pickles yes but these are kind of new and old at the same time and there was fish and chips wrapped up in a newspaper well noone wraps up fish and chips in newspaper these days but they all looked fresh i had a look because i thought i might as well give the fish to the cat and the newspaper johnny stopped what could he say that he knew that front page he knew every word of it hed found the same one on the microfiche in the library and the librarian had given him a copy to help him with his history project hed never seen it apart from the copy and the fuzzy image on the screen and suddenly there it was unfolded in front of him greasy and vinegary but undoubtedly new well lets have a look at them at least that cant hurt kasandra was like that when all else failed she tried being reasonable the big black car sped up the motorway there were two motorcyclists in front and two more behind and another car trailing behind them containing some serious men in suits who listened to little radios a lot and wouldnt even trust their mothers sir john sat by himself in the back of the black car with his hands crossed on his silvertopped walking stick and his chin on his hands there were two screens in front of him which showed him various facts and figures to do with his companies around the world beamed down to him from a satellite which he also owned there were also two fax machines and three telephones sir john sat and stared at them then he reached over and pressed the button that operated the drivers intercom hed never liked hickson much the man had a red neck on the other hand he was the only person there was to talk to right now do you believe its possible to travel in time hickson couldnt say sir said the chauffeur without turning his head its been done you know if you say so sir times been changed yes sir of course you wouldnt know about it because you were in the time that it changed into good thing for me then sir did you know that when you change time you get two futures heading off side by side must have missed that in school sir like a pair of trousers definitely something to think about sir john sir john stared at the back of the mans neck it really was very red and had unpleasant little patches of hair on it he hadnt hired the man of course he had people who had people who had people who did things like that it had never occurred to them to employ a chauffeur with an interest in something else besides what the car in front was doing take the next left turn he snapped were still twenty miles from blackbury sir do what youre told right now the car skidded spun half around and headed up the offramp with smoke coming from its tires turn left but theres traffic coming sir john if they havent got good brakes they shouldnt be on the road good you see turn right thats just a lane ill lose my job sir john sir john sighed hickson id like to lose all our little helpers if you can get me to blackbury by myself i will personally give you a million pounds im serious the chauffeur glanced at his mirror why didnt you say sir hold on to something sir as the car plunged down between high hedges all three of the telephones started to ring sir john stared at them for a while then he pressed the button that wound down the nearest window and one by one threw them out the fax machine followed after some effort he managed to detach the two screens and they went out too exploding very satisfactorily when they hit the ground he felt a lot better for that men in black the bus rumbled along the road towards johnnys house theres no sense in getting excited about mrs tachyon said kasandra if shes really been a bag lady here for years and years then theres a whole range of perfectly acceptable explanations without having to resort to farfetched ones whats an acceptable explanation said johnny he was still wrapped up in the puzzle of the newspaper shes an alien possibly thats acceptable or she could be an atlantean from atlantis you know the continent that sank under the sea thousands of years ago the inhabitants were said to be very longlived they could breathe underwater dont be silly they sailed away just before it sank and built stonehenge and the pyramids and so on they were scientifically very advanced actually johnny looked at her with his mouth open you expected this sort of thing from bigmac and the others but not from kikasandra who was already doing alevels at fourteen years old i didnt know that he said it was hushed up by the government ali kasandra was good at knowing things that were hushed up by the government especially considering that they had been well hushed up they were always slightly occult when giant footprints had appeared around the town centre during some snow last year there had been two theories there was kikasandras which was that it was bigfoot and johnnys which was that it was a combination of bigmac and two giant rubber feet a wow at parties from the joke emporium in penny street kikasandras theory had the backing of so many official sources in the books shed read that it practically outweighed johnnys which was merely based on watching him do it johnny thought about the atlanteans whod all be two metres tall in greek togas and golden hair leaving the sinking continent in their amazing golden ships and on the deck of one of them mrs tachyon ferociously wheeling her trolley or you could imagine attila the huns barbarians galloping across the plain and in the middle of the line of horsemen mrs tachyon on her trolley off her trolley too what happens said kasandra is that if you see a ufo or a yeti or something like that you get a visit from the men in black they drive around in big black cars and menace people whove seen strange things they say theyre working for the government but theyre really working for the secret society that runs everything how dyou know all this everyone knows its a wellknown fact ive been waiting for something like this ever since the mysterious rain of fish we had in september said kasandra you mean when there was that gas leak under the tropical fish shop yes we were told it was a leak under the tropical fish shop said kasandra darkly what of course it was the gas leak they found the shopkeepers wig in the telephone wires in the high street everyone had guppies in their gutters the two might have been coincidentally connected said kasandra reluctantly and you still believe that those crop circles last year werent made by bigmac even though he swears they were all right perhaps some of them might have been made by bigmac but who made the first ones eh bazza and skazz of course they read about em in the paper and decided we should have some too they didnt necessarily make all of them johnny sighed as if life wasnt complicated enough people had to set out to make it worse it had been difficult enough before hed heard about spontaneous combustion you could be sitting peacefully in your chair minding your own business and next minute whoosh you were just a pair of shoes with smoke coming out hed taken to keeping a bucket of water in his bedroom for some weeks after reading about that and then there were all these programs about aliens swooping down on people and taking them away for serious medical examinations in their flying saucers if you were captured and taken away by aliens but then they messed around with your brain so you forgot about them and they had time travel so they could put you back exactly where you were before theyd taken you away how would you know it was a bit of a worry kasandra seemed to think all this sort of thing was interesting instead of some kind of a nuisance kasandra he said yes what i wish youd go back to kirsty horrible name sounds like someone who makes scones i didnt mind kimberly hah i now realize that was a name with trainee hairdresser written all over it although klymenystra was a bit over the top when was that about a fortnight ago i was probably feeling a bit gothy at the time the bus pulled up at the end of johnnys road and they got off the garages were in a little culdesac around the back of the houses they werent used much at least for cars most of grandads neighbors parked in the street so that they could enjoy complaining about stealing one anothers parking spaces you havent even peeked in the bags said kasandra as johnny fished in his pockets for the garage key no i mean supposing they were full of old knickers or something he pushed open the door the trolley was where he left it there was something odd about it that he couldnt quite put his finger on it was clearly standing in the middle of the floor but managed to give the impression of moving very fast at the same time as though it were a still frame from a movie kasandraformerlykirsty looked around bit of a dump she said whys that bike upside down over there its mine said johnny it got a puncture yesterday i havent managed to repair it yet kasandra picked up one of the jars of pickle from the bench the label was sooty she wiped it and turned it towards the light blackbury preserves ltd goldmedal empire brand mustard pickle she read six premier awards grand prix de foire internationale des conichons nancy festival of pickles manchester danzig pokelnfest supreme prize michigan state fair gold medal madras bonza feed award sydney made from the finest ingredients and then theres a picture of some sort of crazed street kid jumping about and it says underneath up in the air leaps little tim blackbury pickles have bitten him very clever well theyre pickles so what theyre from the old pickle factory said johnny it got blown up during the war at the same time as paradise street pickles havent been made here for more than fifty years oh no said kasandra you dont mean were in a town where no pickles are made thats creepy that is you dont have to be sarcastic its just odd was all i meant kasandra shook the jar then she picked up another sooty jar of gherkins which sloshed as she turned it over theyve kept well then she said i tried one this morning said johnny it was nice and crunchy and what about this out of his pocket came the newspaper that had wrapped mrs tachyons fish and chips he spread it out its an old newspaper said johnny i mean its very old but not old thats all stuff about the second world war but it doesnt look old or feel old or smell old its yes i know its probably one of those reprinted newspapers you can get for the day you were born my father got me one for wrapping fish and chips said johnny its odd i must admit said kasandra she turned and looked at him as though seeing him for the first time ive waited years for something like this she said havent you for something like mrs tachyons trolley try to pay attention will you sorry havent you ever wondered whatd happen if a flying saucer landed in your garden or you found some sort of magical item that let you travel in time or some old cave with a wizard thatd been asleep for a thousand years well as a matter of fact i did once find an old cave with ive read books and books about that sort of thing and theyre full of unintelligent children who go around saying gosh they just drift along having an adventure for goodness sake they never seem to think of it as any kind of opportunity theyre never prepared well i am johnny tried to imagine whatd happen if kirsty was ever kidnapped by aliens youd probably end up with a galactic empire where everyone had sharp pencils and always carried a small torch in case of emergencies or theyd make a million robot copies whod fly around the universe telling everyone not to be stupid and forcing them to be sensible this is obviously something very odd she said possibly mystic possibly a time machine of some sort and that was the thing about her she arrived at an explanation she didnt mess around with uncertainty didnt you think that she said a time machine a time shopping trolley well what other explanation fits the facts apart from possibly she was kidnapped by aliens and brought here at the speed of light which is something they do a lot for some reason but there might be something else im sure youve thought of it she glanced at her watch no hurry she added sarcastically take your time well no rush well a time machined have flashing lights why youve got to have flashing lights what for johnny wasnt going to give in to flash he said really well who says a time machine has to look like anything said kasandra in a superior tone of voice or at least an even more superior voice than the one she usually used or has to be powered by electricity yoless says you cant have time machines because everyoned keep changing the future said johnny oh so whats the alternative how come she turned up with this new old newspaper and all these new old pickle jars all right but i dont go leaping to great big conclusions in fact he did he knew he did all the time but there was something about the way kasandra argued that automatically made you take the other side he waved a hand at the trolley i mean he said do you really think something could just press the oh the handle or the bags or something and suddenly its hello norman the conqueror he thumped his hand down on a black bag the world flashed in front of his eyes there was concrete under his feet but there were no walls at least not much in the way of walls they were one brick high a man cementing the new row looked up very slowly blimey he said how did you get there then he seemed to get a grip on himself hey that concretes still fred you come here a spaniel sitting by the man barked at johnny and rushed forward jumping up at johnny and knocking him back against the trolley there was another flash it was red and blue and it seemed to johnny that he was squashed very flat and then pulled out again there were walls and the shopping trolley was still in the middle of the floor as was kasandra staring at him you vanished for a moment she said as if hed done something wrong what happened i i dont know how should i know said johnny move your feet she said very slowly he did they met a very slight obstacle a tiny ridge in the floor he looked down oh theyre just the footprints in the cement he said theyve been there ages kasandra knelt down to look at the footprints hed been standing in they were ingrained with dust and dirt but she made him take off his trainer and held it upside down by the print it matched exactly see she said triumphantly youre standing in your own footprints johnny stepped gingerly aside and looked at the footprints where hed been standing there was no doubt theyd been there a long time where did you go back in time i think there was a man building this place and a dog a dog said kasandra her voice suggested that she would have seen something much more interesting oh well its a start she shifted the trolley it was standing in four small grooves in the concrete they were dirty and oily theyd been there a long time too this said kirsty is no ordinary shopping trolley its got tesco written on it johnny pointed out hopping up and down as he replaced his shoe and a squeaky wheel obviously its still switched on or something kirsty went on ignoring him and thats time travel is it said johnny i thought its be more exciting you know battles and monsters and things and its not much fun if all we can do is dont touch it kasandra prodded a bag the air flickered and changed kasandra looked around her the garage hadnt changed in any way except who repaired your bike she said johnny turned his bike was no longer upside down with a wheel off but leaning against the wall both tires quite full you see i notice things said kasandra i am remarkably observant we must have gone into the future when youve mended it johnny wasnt sure hed torn three inner tubes already plus hed also lost the thingy from the inside of the valve probably no time machine could ever go so far into the future that hed be good at cycle repair lets have a look round said kirsty obviously where we go is controlled by some factor i havent discovered yet if were in the fixture the important thing is to find out which horses are going to win races and so on why so we can bet money on them and become rich of course i dont know how to bet one problem at a time johnny looked though the grimy window the weather didnt look very different there were no flying cars or other definite signs of futurosity but guilty was no longer under the bench grandad has a racing paper he said feeling a bit lightheaded lets go then what into my house of course supposing i meet me well youve always been good at making friends reluctantly johnny led the way out of the garage garden paths in the future he noted were made of some gritty grey substance which was amazingly like cracked concrete back doors were an excitingly futuristic faded blue colour with little dried flakes where the paint had bubbled up it was locked but his ancient key still fitted there was a rectangle on the floor consisting of spiky brown hairs he wiped his feet on it and looked at the time measurement module on the wall it said ten past three the future was amazingly like the present now weve got to find a newspaper said kirsty it wont be a lot of help said johnny grandad keeps them around until hes got time to read them they go back months anyway everythings normal this doesnt look very futuristic to me dont you even have a calendar yes theres one on my bedside clock i just hope im at school thats all according to the clock it was the third of october the day before yesterday said johnny mind you it could be the clock it doesnt work very well yuk you sleep in here said kirsty looking around with an expression like a vegetarian in a sausage factory yes its my room kirsty ran her hand over his desk which was fairly crowded at the moment whatre all these photocopies and photos and things thats the project im doing in history were doing the second world war so im doing blackbury in the war he tried to get between her and the desk but kirsty was always interested in things people didnt want her to see hey this is you isnt it she said grabbing a sepia photograph since when did you wear a uniform and a puddingbasin haircut johnny tried to grab it and thats grandad when he was a bit older than me he mumbled i tried to get him to talk about the war like the teacher said but he tells me to shut up about it youre so local arent you said kirsty i cant imagine much happening here something did happen said johnny he pulled out mrs tachyons chip paper and jabbed at the front page with his finger at pm on may bombs real bombs they called it the blackbury blitz and this is the paper from the day after look he rummaged among the stuff on his desk and pulled out a photocopy see i got a copy of the same page out of the library but this papers real its new if she is from the past why does she wear an old rara skirt and trainers said kirsty johnny glared angrily at her she had no right not to care about paradise street nineteen people got killed in one night he said there wasnt any warning the only bombs that fell on blackbury in the whole of the war the only survivors were two goldfish in a bowl it got blown into a tree and still had water in it all the people got killed kirsty picked up a felttipped pen but it didnt write because it had dried up johnny had a worldclass collection of pens that didnt work she had this infuriating habit of appearing not to notice him when he was excited about something you know youve still got thomas the tank engine on your wallpaper she said what have i gosh i hadnt realized said johnny with what he hoped was sarcasm its okay to have thomas the tank engine when youre seven and its quite cool to have it when youre nineteen but its not cool at thirteen honestly if i wasnt here to help from time to time you just wouldnt have a clue grandad put it up a couple of years ago said johnny this was my room when i stayed with them you know grandparents its thomas the tank engine until you die then there was the click of the front door opening your grandad hissed kirsty he always goes shopping in town on thursdays whispered johnny and mums at work who else has got a key only me someone started to climb the stairs but i cant meet me said johnny id remember wouldnt i yoless says if you meet yourself the whole universe explodes id remember that happening kirsty picked up the bedside lamp and glanced at the design on it good grief the mister men youve still got mister shutupshutupshutup whatre you going to do with it dont worry you wont feel a thing i learned how to do this in selfdefense classes the door handle turned the door opened a fraction downstairs the phone rang the handle clicked back footsteps went downstairs again johnny heard the phone picked up a distant voice said oh hi wobbler kirsty looked at johnny and raised her eyebrows wobbler phoned said johnny about going to the movies yest tomorrow i just remembered were you on the phone long dont think so and i went to get a sandwich afterwards wheres your phone in the front room lets go then kirsty opened the door and darted down the stairs with johnny trailing behind her his coat was on the coat rack he was also wearing it he stood and stared come on hissed kirsty she was almost at the bottom when the door started to open johnny opened his mouth to say oh yes i remember i had to go and get my wallet to see if id got any money he desperately wanted not to meet himself if the entire universe exploded people would be bound to blame him afterwards and there was a flash in front of his eyes the black car slid surreptitiously out of a side road just before a sign indicating that it was about to enter blackbury nearly there sir john good what time are we in er quarter past eleven sir that wasnt what i meant if time was a pair of trousers what leg would we be in it occurred to hickson the chauffeur that this might be quite a difficult million pounds to earn they all got mixed up today you see said a voice from the seat behind him right sir i if i see any trousers sir you just tell me what leg to drive down the truth is out of here johnny was still on the stairs kirsty was still in front of him the door was shut his coat wasnt on the coat rack the blackbury shopper which was delivered on fridays and stayed on the hall table until someone threw it away was indeed on the table weve time traveled again havent we said kirsty calmly i think were back to where we started possibly i saw the back of my own head whispered johnny my actual own back of my own head without mirrors or anything noones ever done that since the spanish inquisition how can you be so calm about this im just acting calm said kirsty this is even worse wallpaper isnt it looks like an indian restaurant she opened the front door and slammed it again you know i said that if you started getting too interested in mysterious occult things these men in black cars turn up yes well look through the letterbox will you johnny levered it open with a finger there was a car pulling up outside it was black utterly black black tires black wheels black headlights even the windows were darker than a pair of mafia sunglasses here and there were bits of chrome but they only made the blackness blacker by comparison it stopped johnny could just make out the shadow of the driver behind the tinted glass s just coincidence he said your grandad often gets visitors like this does he kasandra demanded well he didnt someone came round on thursday to collect his football pools coupon and that was about it grandad was not one for the social whirl the car door opened a man got out he was wearing a black chauffeurs uniform the car door shut it shut with the kind of final heavy thonk that only the most expensive car doors can achieve because they are lined with money johnny let go of the letterbox and jumped back a few seconds later someone banged heavily on the door run whispered kasandra where the back door come on we havent done anything wrong how do you know kasandra opened the back door and humied down the path and into the garage dragging johnny behind her the trolley was still in the middle of the floor get ready to open the big doors and dont stop for anything why open the doors now johnny opened them because practically anything was better than arguing with kirsty the little garage area was empty except for someone washing their car johnny was nearly knocked aside as the trolley rattled out with kasandra pushing determinedly on the handle it rattled across the concrete and lurched uncertainly into the alleyway that led to the next road didnt you see that program about the flying saucer that crashed and these mysterious men turned up and hushed it all up said kasandra no well did you even hear about the flying saucer crashing no see all right but in that case how come there was a tv program about it then a car edged around the corner into the road i cant waste time answering silly questions said kasandra come on she shoved the trolley as hard as she could it rolled down the sloping pavement the squeaky wheel bouncing and juddering over the slabs the car turned the corner very slowly as though driven by someone who didnt know the area very well johnny caught up with kirkasandra and clung to the handle because the trolley was rocking all over the pavement the trolley under its heavy load began to pick up speed try to hold it back im trying are you johnny risked a look behind the car seemed to be catching up he jumped onto the trolley what are you playing at said kirsty who was far too worried to remember any new names now come on he grabbed her hand and pulled her up on the other side of the cart now she was no longer holding the handle it surged forward do you think this is really a time machine he said as the rushing wind made the bags flutter it must be dyou see that film where the car travelled in time when it went at eightyeight miles an hour they looked down the wheels were screaming smoke was coming out of the axles they looked up the hill the car was catching them up they looked down the hill there were the traffic lights the blackbury bypass was a solid wall of thundering traffic then they looked up into each others frightened faces the lights are red the lights are red i dont want to die said kirsty i havent even been to university one hundred metres ahead sixteenwheeled lorriies barrelled onwards taking a million english razor blades from sheffield to italy and coming the other way a million italian razor blades from rome to england the trolley was without a shadow of a doubt going to smash right into the middle of them the air flickered and there were no lorries or rather there were lorries snorting and hissing and waiting at the lights the lights ahead of johnny were green the trolley rolled through wheels screaming johnny looked up into the puzzled faces of the drivers then he risked a look behind the black car had vanished there were no other turnings off the hill wherever it had gone it hadnt got there by any means known to normal cars he met kristys eyes where did it go she said and what happened with the lights did we travel in time again youre wearing your mac said johnny you were wearing your old coat but now youre wearing your mac somethings changed she looked down and then back up at him beside the crossroads was the neil armstrong shopping mall johnny pointed to it we can make this go into the car park he shouted the big black bentley jerked to a halt at the side of the road they just vanished said hickson staring over the top of the wheel that wasnt this time travel stuff was it i mean they just vanished i think they went from one now to another now said sir john is that like these trousers you were going on about sir i suppose you could say they went from one knee to the other one to another hickson turned around in his seat are you serious sir i saw this scientist on tv you know the one in the wheelchair and there was all this stuff about other universes all crammed in and hed know the proper way of talking about it said sir john for the rest of us its easier to think about trousers what shall we do now sir oh i think we wait until they come back to our now how longs that going to be about two seconds i think in the shopping mall a joke was going wrong make me er said bigmac make me one with pickle and onion rings and fries make me one with extra salad and fries please said yoless wobbler took a long look at the girl in the cardboard hat make me one with everything he said because im going to become a muslim bigmac and yoless exchanged glances buddhist said yoless patiently its buddhist make me one with everything because im going to become a buddhist its buddhists that want to be one with everything singing om and all that you mucked it up you were practicing all the way down here and you still mucked it up buddhists wouldnt have the burger said the girl theyd have the jumbo beanburger or just fries and a salad they stared at her vegetarianism said the girl i may have to wear a paper hat but i havent got a cardboard brain thank you she glared at wobbler you want a bun with everything you want fries with that er yes there you go have a day the boys took their burgers and wandered back out into the mall we do this every saturday said bigmac yes said wobbler and every saturday we work out a joke yes and you always mess up the punch line well its something to do and there wasnt much else to do at the mall sometimes there were displays and things at christmas thered been a nice tableau of reindeers and dolls of many countries that really moved to music but bigmac had found out where the controls were and speeded up everything four times and a norwegians head had gone through the window of the cookie shop on the second floor all there was today in the way of entertainment were the people selling plastic window frames and someone else trying to get people to try a new artificial baked potato mix the boys sat down by the ornamental pond and watched out for the security guards you could always tell where bigmac was in the mall by watching the flow of the security guards several of whom had been hit by bits of disintegrating scandinavian and bore a grudge as far as anyone knew bigmac had never been guilty of anything other than the occasional confused approach to the ownership of other peoples cars but he had an amazing way of looking as though he was thinking about committing some rather daft crime probably with a can of spray paint his camouflage jacket didnt help it might have worked in a jungle but it tended to stand out when the background was the olde card and cookie shoppe old johnny may be a bit of a nerd but its always interesting when hes around said wobbler stuff happens yeah but he hangs around with kimberly or kirsty or whoever she is today and she gives me the creeps said yoless shes weird she always looks at me as if i havent answered a question properly her brother told me everyone expects her to go to university next year said bigmac yoless shrugged you dont have to be dumb to be weird he said if youre brainy you can be even weirder its all that intelligence looking for something to do thats what i think well johnnys weird said bigmac well he is its amazing the stuff that goes on in his head maybe he is a bit mental its amazing the stuff that goes on outside his head said wobbler hes just there was a crash somewhere in the mall and people started to shout a shopping trolley rolled at high speed up the aisle with shoppers running to get out of the way it had a plastic window frame hanging on the front and was splashed with artificial potato johnny and kirsty were hanging on either side he waved at them as he drifted past help us get this out of the back door thats old mrs tachyons trolley isnt it said yoless who cares said bigmac he put his burger down on the edge of the pond where it was surreptitiously picked up by wobbler and ran after the trolley someones chasing us johnny panted as they caught up brilliant said bigmac who some people in a big black car said johnny only theyve vanished oh an invisible big black car said yoless i see them all the time said bigmac are you going to stand around all day kirsty demanded its probably got some kind of special shield come on the trolley wasnt massively heavy although the piles of bags did weigh it down but it did need a lot of steering even with all of them helping or johnny thought later perhaps because of all of them helping it skidded and wobbled as they tried to keep it in a straight line if we can get out of the other doors were in the high street said johnny and it cant go in there because theres bollards and things i wish i had my fivemegawatt laser cannon said bigmac as they fought the trolley round a corner you havent got a laser cannon said yoless i know thats why i wish i had one ow wobbler leapt back it bit me he screamed guilty stuck his head out of the heap of bags and hissed at johnny security guards were strolling towards them there were five kids arguing around a trolley bigmac was among them and as yoless would have pointed out one of them was black this sort of thing attracts attention this trolley might be a time machine said johnny and that car kirsty thinks someones after it i mean me i mean us great how do we make it work said bigmac a time machine said yoless ali yes wheres this invisible car got to said wobbler we cant go out of the other doors said kirsty flatly theres a couple of guards there johnny stared at the black dustbin liners then he picked one up and undid the string for a moment his fingers felt cold and the air was full of faint whispers the mall vanished it vanished above them and around them and below them they landed in a heap on the grass about a metre below where theyd been standing the trolley landed on top of them one wheel slamming into the small of johnnys back bags bounced out and guilty took the opportunity to scratch bigmacs ear and then there was silence except for bigmac swearing johnny opened his eyes the ground sloped up all around him there were low bushes at the tap if i asked what happened said yoless from somewhere under bigmac whatd you say i think we may have travelled in time said johnny dyou get an electric feeling said wobbler clutching his jaw like all your teeth standing on end which way did we go said yoless still talking in his deliberate voice are we talking dinosaurs or mutant robots i want to know this before i open my eyes kirsty groaned oh dear its going to be that kind of adventure after all she hissed sitting up its just the sort of thing i didnt want to happen me and four token boys oh dear oh dear its only a mercy we havent got a dog she sat up and brushed some grass off her coat anyone got the least idea of where we are ali said yoless i see theres grass that means no dinosaurs i saw that in a film grass didnt evolve until after there were dinosaurs johnny stood up his head was aching he walked to the edge of the little hollow theyd landed in and looked out really someones been paying attention said kirsty well that narrows it down to some time in the last sixty million years proper time travellers have proper digital readouts wobbler grumbled no grass what did dinosaurs eat then you only get digital time machine clocks in america said bigmac i saw a film about a time machine in victorian england and it just had light bulbs they ate other dinosaurs didnt they youre not allowed to call them dinosaurs any more said yoless its speciesist you have to call them prepetroleum persons yeah said bigmac one million years pc get it cos there was this film called one million years bc but kristys mouth was open do you lot go on like this all the time she said yes you do ive noticed it before actually rather than face up to facts you start yakking on about weird things when are we may the twentyfirst said johnny sitting down next to her just gone half past three oh yes said kirsty and how come youre so sure i went and asked a man who was walking his dog said johnny did he say what year johnny met kristys gaze no he said but i know what year they climbed out of the hollow and pushed their way through the bushes a scrubby field stretched away below them there were some allotment gardens at the bottom end of the field and then a river and then the town of blackbury it was definitely blackbury there was the familiar rubber boot factory chimney there were a few other tall chimneys as well hed never seen those before the man with the dog was watching them from some way off so was the dog neither of them seemed particularly jurassic although the dog looked somewhat suspicious wha said wobbler here whats been happening what have you done i told you wed travelled in time said kirsty werent you listening i thought it was just some trick i thought you were just messing about he gave johnny a very worried look this is just messing about isnt it yes wobbler relaxed its messing about with time travel said johnny wobbler looked scared again sorry but thats blackbury all right its just smaller i think were where the mall is going to be how do we get back said yoless it just sort of happens i think youre just doing it with hallucinations arent you said wobbler never a boy to let go of hope its probably the smell from the trolley well come round in a minute and have a headache and itll all be all right it just sort of happens said yoless he was using his careful voice again the voice that said there was something nasty on his mind how do you get back theres a flash and there you are said kirsty and youre back where you left of course not only if you didnt move otherwise you go back to wherever where you are now is going to be then there was silence while they all worked this out you mean said bigmac that if you walk a couple of metres youll be a couple of metres away from where you started when you get back yes even if theres been something built there said yoless yes no i dont know so said yoless still speaking very slowly if theres a lot of concrete what happens they all looked at kirsty she looked at johnny i dont know he said probably you kind of get lumped together yuk said bigmac there was a wail from wobbler sometimes when it involved something horrible his mind worked very fast i dont want to end up with just my arms sticking out of a concrete wall oh i dont think its happen like that said yoless wobbler relaxed but not much how would it happen then he said what i think would happen is see all the atoms in your body right and all the atoms in the wall would be trying to be in the same place at the same time and theyd all smash together suddenly and and what said kirsty and er bang goodnight europe said yoless you cant argue with nuclear physics sorry my arms wouldnt end up sticking out of a wall said wobbler who hadnt quite caught up no said yoless not a wall near here anyway said bigmac grinning dont wind him up said yoless severely this is serious it could happen to any of us we dropped when we landed right does that mean that if we suddenly go back now well be sticking out of the floor of the mall causing an instant atomic explosion they make enough fuss when you drop a coke tin said johnny wheres wobbler gone said kirsty wobbler was a disappearing shape heading for the allotments he shouted something whatd he say she said he said im off home said johnny yeah but said bigmac where hes running now if were where the mall is will be then over theres the shopping estate that field hes running across he squinted thats where currys is going to be how will we know were about to go back said yoless theres a sort of flicker for a moment said johnny then zap er whatll happen if he comes out where theres a fridge or something is that as bad as a concrete wall i dont know much about fridge atoms said yoless they might not be as bad as concrete atoms but i shouldnt think anyone around here would need new wallpaper ever again wow an atomic wobbler said bigmac lets get the trolley and go after him said johnny we dont need it leave it here said kirsty no its mrs tachyons theres just one thing i dont understand said yoless as they hauled the trolley across the field theres millions of things i dont understand said johnny what what what are you going on about now televisions algebra how skinless sausages hold together chinese said johnny i dont understand any of them the trolleys got no works said yoless theres no time machinery maybe the time is in the bags said johnny oh right bags of time you cant just shove time in a bag maybe mrs tachyon didnt know that shes always picking up odds and ends of stuff you cant pick up time actually times what you pick things up in said kirsty my granny saves string said bigmac in the manner of someone who wants to make a contribution really well you cant pick up the odd halfhour and knot it on to another ten minutes youve got spare in case you havent noticed said kirsty honestly dont they teach you any physics at your school fridge atoms was bad enough what on earths a fridge atom the smallest possible particle of fridge said yoless perhaps you could save time johnny thought rebelliously you could waste it it could run through your fingers and you could put a stitch in it of course perhaps that was only a manner of speaking and it all depended on how you looked at it but mrs tachyon looked at things in a corkscrew kind of way he remembered touching a bag had time leaked out something had hissed through his fingers you cant have the smallest possible particle of fridge itd just be iron atoms and so on a fridge molecule then one atom of everything you need to make a fridge said yoless you couldnt ha well all right you could have one atom of everything you need to make a fridge but that wouldnt make it a fridge molecule because she rolled her eyes what am i saying youve got me thinking like that now the rest of the universe said that time wasnt an object it was just natures way of preventing everything from happening at once and mrs tachyon had said thats what you think the path across the field led through the allotments they looked like allotments everywhere with the occasional old man who looked exactly like the old men who worked on allotments they wore the special old mans allotment trousers one by one they stopped digging as the trolley bumped along the path they turned and watched in a silent allotment way its probably yolesss coat theyre looking at kirsty hissed purple green and yellow its plastic right plastic hasnt been around for long of course it might be bigmacs heavy mental tshirt theyre planting beans and hoeing potatoes thought johnny and tonight theres going to be a crop of great big bomb craters i cant see the bypass said bigmac and theres no tv tower on blackdown theres all those extra factory chimneys though said yoless i dont remember any of those and wheres the traffic noise its may thought johnny i know it there was a very narrow stone bridge over the river johnny stopped in the middle of it and looked back the way theyd come a couple of the allotment men were still watching them beyond them was the sloping field theyd arrived in it wasnt particularly pretty it had that slightly grey tint that fields get when theyre right next to a town and know that its only a matter of time before theyre under concrete i remember when all this was buildings he said to himself whatre you going on about now oh nothing i recognize some of this said bigmac this is river street thats old patels shop on the corner isnt it but the sign over the window said smoke woodbines j wilkinson woodbines said bigmac its a kind of cigarette obviously said kirsty a car went past it was black but not the dire black of the one on the hill it had mud and rust marks on it it looked as though someone had started out with the idea of making a very large mobile jelly mould and had changed their mind about halfway through when it was slightly too late johnny saw the driver crane his head to stare at them it was hard to tell much from the people on the streets there were a lot of overcoats and hats in a hundred shades of boredom we shouldnt hang around said kirsty people are looking at us lets go and see if we can get a newspaper i want to know when we are its so gloomy perhaps its the depression said johnny my grandads always going on about when he was growing up in the depression no tv everyone wearing oldfashioned clothes no decent cars said bigmac no wonder everyone was depressed oh god said kirsty look try to be careful will you any little thing you do could seriously affect the future understand they entered the corner shop leaving bigmac outside to guard the trolley it was dark inside and smelled of floorboards johnny had been on a school visit once to a sort of theme park that showed you what things had been like in the all purpose olden days it had been quite interesting although everyone had been careful not to show it because if you werent careful theyd sneak education up on you while your guard was down the shop was a bit like that only it had things the school one hadnt shown like the cat asleep in the sack of dog biscuits and the smell it wasnt only floorboards in it there was paraffin in it and cooking and candles a small lady in glasses looked at them carefully yes what can i do for you she said she nodded at yoless sambos with you dear is he she added the olden days guilty lay on top of the bags and purred bigmac watched the traffic there wasnt a lot a couple of women met one another as they were both crossing the street and stood there chatting in the middle of the road although occasionally one of them would turn to look at bigmac he folded his arms over heavy mental and then a car pulled up right in front of him the driver got out glanced at bigmac and walked off down the street bigmac stared at the car hed seen ones like it on television normally in those costume dramas where one car and two women with a selection of different hats keep going up and down the same street to try to fool people that this isnt really the present day the keys were still in the ignition bigmac wasnt a criminal he was just around when crimes happened this was because of stupidity that is other peoples stupidity mainly other peoples stupidity in designing cars that could go from mph in ten seconds and then selling them to even more stupid people who were only interested in dull things like fuel consumption and what colour the seats were what was the point in that that wasnt what a car was for the keys were still in the ignition as far as bigmac was concerned he was practically doing people a favour by really seeing what their cars could do and no way was that stealing because he always put the cars back if he could and they were often nearly the same shape youd think peopled be proud to know their car could do mph along the blackbury bypass instead of complaining all the time the keys were still in the ignition there were a million places in the world where the keys could have been but in the ignition was where they were old cars like this probably couldnt go at any speed at all the keys were still in the ignition firmly invitingly in the ignition bigmac shifted uncomfortably he was aware that there were people in the world who considered it wrong to take cars that didnt belong to them but however you looked at it the keys were still in the ignition johnny heard kristys indrawn breath it sounded like concorde taking off in reverse he felt the room grow bigger rushing away on every side with yoless all by himself in the middle of it then yoless said yes indeed im with them lawdy lawdy the old lady looked surprised my word you speak english very well she said i learned it from my grandfather said yoless his voice as sharp as a knife he ate only very educated missionaries sometimes johnnys mind worked fast normally it worked so slowly that it embarrassed him but just occasionally it had a burst of speed hes a prince he said prince sega said yoless all the way from nintendo said johnny hes here to buy a newspaper said kirsty who in some ways did not have a lot of imagination johnny reached into his own pocket and then hesitated only we havent got any money he said yes we have ive got a least two pou kirsty began we havent got the right money said johnny meaningfully it was pounds and shillings and pence in those days not pounds and pee pee said the woman she looked from one to the other like someone who hopes that itll all make sense if they pay enough attention johnny craned his head there were a few newspapers still on the counter even though it was the afternoon one was the times he could just make out the date may oh you have a paper dear said the old woman giving up i dont suppose i shall sell any more today thank you very much said johnny grabbing a paper and hurrying the other two out of the shop sambo said yoless when they were outside what said kirsty oh that never mind about that give me that newspaper my grandad came here in said yoless in the same plonking hollow voice he said little kids thought his colourd come off if he washed yes well i can see youre upset but thats just how things were its all changed since then said kirsty turning the pages then hasnt even happened yet said yoless im not stupid ive read old books were back in golliwog history plucky niggers and hooray for the empire she called me sambo look said kirsty still reading the newspaper this is the olden days she didnt mean it you know nastily its just how she was brought up you people cant expect us to rewrite history you know johnny suddenly felt as though hed stepped into a deep freeze it was almost certainly the you people sambo had been an insult but you people was worse because it wasnt even personal he had never seen yoless so angry it was a kind of rigid brittle anger how could someone as intelligent as kirsty be so dumb what she needed to do now was say something sensible well im certainly glad youre here said yoless sarcasm gleaming on his words sos you can explain all this to me all right dont go on about it she said without looking up its not that important it was amazing johnny thought kirsty had a sort of talent for striking matches in a firework factory yoless took a deep breath johnny patted him on the arm she didnt mean it you know nastily he said its just how she was brought up yoless sagged and nodded coldly you know were in the middle of a war dont you said kirsty thats what weve ended up in world war two it was very popular around this time johnny nodded may the twentyfirst not many people cared or even knew about it now just him and the librarian at the public library whod helped him find the stuff for the project and a few old people it was ancient history after all the olden days and here he was and so was paradise street until tonight are you all right said yoless he hadnt even known about it until hed found the old newspapers in the library it was it was as if it hadnt counted it had happened but it wasnt a proper part of the war and worse things had happened in a lot of other places nineteen people hardly mattered but hed imagined it happening in his town it was horribly easy the old men would go home from their allotments the shops would shut there wouldnt be many lights in any case because of the blackout but bit by bit the town would go to sleep and then a few hours later itd happen itd happen tonight wobbler wheezed along the road and he did wobble it wasnt his fault he was fat hed always said it was just his genetics he had too many of them he was trying to run but most of the energy was getting lost in the wobbling he was trying to think too but it wasnt happening very clearly they hadnt gone time travelling it was just a windup they were always trying to wind him up hed get home and have a sit down and its all be all right and this was home sort of everything was smaller somehow the trees in the street were the wrong size and the cars were wrong the houses looked newer and this was gregory road hed been along it millions of times you went along halfway and turned into into a man was clipping a hedge he wore a high collar and tie and a pullover with a zigzag pattern he was also smoking a pipe when he saw wobbler he stopped clipping and took his pipe out of his mouth can i help you son he said i er i was looking for seeley crescent whispered wobbler the man smiled well im councillor edward seeley he said but ive never heard of a seeley crescent he called over his shoulder to a woman who was weeding a flowerbed have you heard of a seeley crescent mildred theres a big chestnut tree on the corner wobbler began weve got a chestnut tree said mr seeley pointing to what looked like a stick with a couple of leaves on it he smiled it doesnt look much at the moment but just you come back in fifty years time eh wobbler stared at it and then at him it was a wide garden here with a field beyond it it struck him that it was quite wide enough for a road if one day someone wanted to build a road i will he said are you all right young man said mrs seeley wobbler realized that he wasnt panicking any more hed run out of panic it was like being in a dream afterwards it all sounded daft but while you were in the dream you just got on with it it was like a rocket taking off there was a lot of noise and worry and then you were in orbit floating free and able to look down on everything as if it werent real it was an amazing feeling wobbler had spent a large part of his life being frightened of things in a vague kind of way there were always things he should have been doing or shouldnt have done but here it all didnt seem to matter he wasnt even born yet in a way anyway so absolutely nothing could be his fault im fine he said thank you very much for asking ill just be off back into town he could feel them watching him as he wandered back down the road this was his home town there were all sorts of clues that told him so but all sorts of other things were strange there were more trees and fewer houses more factory chimneys and fewer cars a lot less colour too it didnt look much fun he was pretty certain noone here would even know what a pizza was ere mister said a hoarse voice he looked down a boy was sitting by the side of the road it was almost certainly a boy but its short trousers reached almost to its ankles it had a pair of glasses with one lens blanked out with brown paper its hair had been cut apparently with a lawnmower and its nose was running and its ears stuck out noone had ever called wobbler mister before except teachers when they wanted to be sarcastic yes he said which ways london said the boy there was a cardboard suitcase next to him held together with string wobbler thought for a moment back that way he said pointing dunno why theres no road signs our ron says they took em all down so jerry wont know where he was said the boy he had a line of small stones on the kerb beside him every so often hed pick one up and throw it with great accuracy at a tin can on the other side of the road whos jerry one eye looked at him with deep suspicion the germans said the boy only i wants em to come here and blow up mrs density a bit why are we fighting the germans said wobbler are you n american our dad says the americans ought to fight only theyre waitin to see whos winnin er wobbler decided it might be best to be american for a bit yes sure garn say something american er right on republican microsoft spiderman have a nice day this demonstration of transatlantic origins seemed to satisfy the small boy he threw another stone at the tin can our mam said ive got to stop along of mrs densitys and the foods all rubbish said the boy you know what she makes me drink milk i dint mind the proper milk at home but round here you know what it comes out of a cows bum i seen it they took us to a farm with all muck all over the place and you know what you know how eggs come out urrr and she makes us go to bed at seven oclock and i miss our main and im going home ive had enough of being vacuated it can really make your arm ache said wobbler i had it done for tetanus our ron says its good fun going down the underground station when the siren goes off the boy went on our ron says the school got hit an none of the kids has to go any more it seemed to wobbler that it didnt matter what he said the boy was really talking to himself another stone turned the can upside down huh said the boy like to see em hit the school here they just pick on us just cos were from london and you know what that atterbury kid pinched my piece of shrapnel our ron give it me our rons a copper he gets a chance to pick up really good stuff for me you dont get shrapnel round here huh whats shrapnel said wobbler are you a loony its bits of bomb our ron says alf harvey got a whole collection an a bit off a heinkel our ron said alf harvey found a real nazi ring with an actual finger still in it the boy looked wistful as though unfairly shut off from untold treasures huh our ron says other kids down our street have gone back home and i reckon im old enough too so im goin wobbler had never bothered much with history as far as he was concerned it was something that had happened to other people he vaguely remembered a tv program with some film shot back in the days when people were so poor they could only afford to be in black and white kids with labels round their necks waiting at railway stations every single adult wearing a hat evacuees that was it sent out from the big cities sos they wouldnt get bombed it said what years this he said the boy looked at him sideways youre a spy incha he said standing up you dont know anyfink about nuffink you aint american cos i seen em on the pictures if youre n american wheres your gun dont be daft americans dont all have guns said wobbler lots of them dont have guns well some dont anyway our ron said there was something in the paper about german parachuters landing disguised as nuns said the boy backing away seems to me you couldve been a parachuter if it was a big parachute all right im english said wobbler oh yeah whos the prime minster then wobbler hesitated i dont think weve done that at school he said you dont get no lessons in knowing about winston churchill said the boy dismissively hah youre just trying to mess me around said wobbler cos i know for a fact weve never had a black prime minister you dont know nuffink said the boy grabbing his battered suitcase and youre fat i dont have to stand here listening to you said wobbler heading off down the road spy spy spy said the boy oh shut up an you wobble i saw that goering on the newsreels you look jus like him an youre dressed up all funny spy spy spy wobbler sighed he was fairly used to this only not so much these days because once hed just been fat and now he was big and fat and youre stupid he said but at least i could get slimmer biting sarcasm didnt work spy spy spy nasty nasty nazi wobbler tried walking faster im goin to tell mrs density an she can telephone our ron and he can come an arrest you shouted the boy jumping along behind him wobbler tried walking faster still hes got a gun our ron a man went by slowly on his bike hes a spy said the boy pointing at wobbler im arresting him for our ron the man just grinned at wobbler and pedalled onwards our ron says you spies send morse code messages to nazi submarines by flashing torches said the boy were twenty miles from the sea said wobbler whod almost broken into a run you could stand on something high nyer nyer nyer spy spy spy it was just plain stupid thought bigmac as he watched the two plumes of steam in front of him what kind of idiots built a car without power steering or synchromesh gears and put in brakes apparently operated by string he was practically doing the world a favour by taking the car off the road not just off the road in fact but over the pavement and across a flowerbed and into the alderman bowler memorial horsetrough the plumes of steam were quite pretty really there were little rainbows in them well now said a voice as someone opened a car door what do we have here i think i banged my head said bigmac a large hand encircled his arm and pulled him out of the car bigmac looked up into two round faces that had policeman written all over them there was room for quite a lot of things to be written all over them they were very large faces that is dr roberts car they said and you my lad are in for it whats your name simon wrigley mumbled bigmac ms partridge knows all about me she does does she and whos she bigmac blinked at the two faces which miraculously flowed together and became one hed quite liked ms partridge she was nasty the two social workers hed had before had made out that he was wet whereas ms partridge made it clear that if she had her way bigmac would have been strangled at birth you could respect someone like that they didnt make you feel like some kind of a useless nerd something prodded at his memory when is this he said rubbing his head you can start by telling me where you live the policeman leaned closer there was something about bigmac that bothered him what do you mean when is this he said what year the policeman had fairly fixed ideas about what should happen to car thieves but they usually knew what year it was its he said and straightened up his eyes narrowed whos the captain of the england cricket team he said bigmac blinked what how should i know who won the boat race last year what boat race the policeman looked again and whats that on your belt bigmac blinked again and looked down i didnt nick it he said quickly its only a transistor anyway whats that wire going into your ear dont be daft its only the earphone the policemans hand landed on his shoulder with the kind of thud that suggested it wasnt going to let go in a hurry you come along with me fritz he said i wasnt born yesterday bigmacs brain drifted into focus he looked at the uniform and at the crowd behind it and it began to dawn on him that he was all alone and a long long way from home i wasnt born yesterday either he said does that help johnny kirsty and yoless sat in a little garden as far as johnny could tell it was where part of the ring road and a traffic island were going to be one day now it contained a bench and some geraniums theyll blow up paradise street tonight said johnny wheres that said yoless here its where the sports centre was will be i mean never heard of it yes i did say it got blown up and you know the funny thing about it theres something funny about it said kirsty it was by accident the germans had meant to bomb the big goods yard at slate but they got a bit lost and the weather turned bad and they saw the railway yards here and dropped all their bombs and went home everyone was in bed because the air raid sirens didnt go off in time all right all right i know youve told me before and all about adolf and stalin its very sad but you shouldnt get worked up about it said kirsty its history that sort of thing happens in history arent you listening it hasnt happened yet this is now its going to happen tonight they stared at the geraniums why havent we gone back yet said kirsty weve been here ages how should i know said johnny maybe the further you go the longer you stay and we just happened to go to somewhere you know all about said yoless thats a bit strange in my opinion it had worried johnny too everything felt real but maybe hed just gone mad and taken everyone else with him i dont want to stay here thats definite said yoless being little black sambo wasnt my idea of a full life johnny stood up and grasped the handles of the trolley im going to see paradise street he said thats a very bad idea said kirsty i told you anything you do affects the future im only going to have a look oh yes i find that very hard to believe actually shes right said yoless trying to keep up you shouldnt mess around with time i read this book where a man went right back in time and trod on on a dinosaur and changed the whole future a dinosaur said kirsty i think it was a dinosaur maybe they had small ones huh or he was a very big man perhaps said kirsty the trolley bumped off the pavement rattled across a road and clanked up the pavement on the other side whatre you going to do said kirsty knock on peoples doors and say excuse me some bombers are going to bomb this street tonight why not because theyll lock you up thats why said yoless right said kirsty itll be just like the man who trod on yolesss dinosaur it may have been some sort of insect now i come to think of it said yoless anyway theres nothing you can do its already happened otherwise how come you know about it you cant mess up history the trolley stopped so quickly that they ran into the back of johnny why does everyone always talk like that he said its stupid you would really watch someone run over by a car because thats what was supposed to happen would you everything we do changes the future all the time so we ought to do whats right dont shout people are looking at us said kirsty the trolley bumped over the kerb and started to bounce on some cobbles they were already out of the town centre and there was paradise street it wasnt very long there were only ten terraced houses on either side and some of them were boarded up the far end was a pair of double wooden gates to a factory theyd once been painted green but time and the weather had turned the colour into a sort of mossy grey someone had chalked a set of goalposts on the doors and half a dozen small boys in kneelength shorts were kicking a ball about johnny watched them as they scuffled and perpetrated fouls that would have gladdened the heart of any football manager about halfway along the street a young man was repairing a motorcycle tools lay on a piece of sacking on the pavement the football emerged from a complicated tackle hit the spanners and almost knocked the bike over turn it up you little devils said the man pushing the ball away you never said anything about children said kirsty so quietly that johnny nearly didnt hear her johnny shrugged its all going to get blown up said yoless johnny nodded there wasnt very much detail in the local paper he said they didnt used to put very much in in case the enemy read it it was all to do with something they called the war effort you know not wanting to let the enemy know youd been hurt there was a photo of a lady with her thumb up saying blackbury can take it mister hitler but there was hardly anything else about the raid until a couple of years afterwards you mean the government hushed it up said kirsty makes sense i suppose said yoless gloomily i mean you dont want to say to the enemy hey you missed your target have another go the football slammed against the factory gates rattling them there didnt seem to be any teams the ball just went everywhere surrounded by a mob of small boys i dont see what we could do said kirsty her voice sounded uneasy now what just now you were telling me i shouldnt do anything said johnny its different when you see people isnt it yes i suppose it wouldnt work if we just told someone theyd say how do you know and then youd probably get shot as a spy said yoless they used to shoot spies heavy mental the man in the khaki uniform turned bigmacs transistor radio over and over in his hands bigmac watched nervously there was a police sergeant in the room and bigmac was familiar with policemen but there was a soldier standing by the door and he had a gun in a holster and the one sitting down looked tired but had a very sharp expression bigmac was not the fastest of thinkers but it had dawned on him that this was unlikely to be the kind of situation where you got let off with a caution lets start again said the seated soldier who had introduced himself as captain harris your name is bigmac hesitated he wanted to say you get ms partridge shell sort it all out its not my fault she says im socially dysfunctional but there was an expression on the captains face that suggested that this might be a very unfortunate move simon wrigley and you say you are fourteen years old and live in captain harris glanced at his notes the joshua chen clement block which is near here you say you can see it easily said bigmac trying to be helpful or you could do if it was here the captain and the police sergeant glanced at one another its not here said the captain yes i dont know why said bigmac tell me again what heavy mental is said the captain theyre a neopunk thrash band said bigmac a music band er yes and we would have heard them on the wireless perhaps i shouldnt think so said bigmac their last single was im going to rip off your head and spit down the hole rip off your head said the policeman who was taking notes and spit down the hole said bigmac helpfully this watch of yours with the numbers on it said the captain i see its got little buttons too what happens if i press them the policeman tried to move away a little the one on the left lights it up so you can see it in the dark said bigmac really and why would you want to do that when you wake up in the night and want to know what time it is bigmac suggested after some deep thought i see and the other button oh thats to tell you what time it is in another country everyone suddenly seemed very interested what other country said the captain sharply its stuck on singapore said bigmac the captain laid it down very carefully the sergeant wrote out a label and tied it to the watch strap then the captain picked up bigmacs jacket what is this made of he said i dunno some kind of plastic said bigmac they sell them down the market the captain pulled it this way and that how is it made ali i know that said bigmac i read about it you mix some chemicals together and you get plastic easy in camouflage colours said the captain bigmac licked his lips he was sure that he was in deep trouble so there was no sense in pretending thats just to make you look hard he said hard i see said the captain and his eyes didnt give away whether he really saw or not he held up the back of the jacket and pointed to two words done rather badly in biro what exactly are blackbury skins he said er thats me and bazza and skazz er skinheads a kind of gang clang said the captain er yes skinheads er the haircut said bigmac looks like an ordinary military haircut to me said the sergeant and these said the captain pointing to the swastikas en either side of the name gang badges are they also to make you look hard er its just you know adolf hitler and that said bigmac all the men were staring at him its just decoration said bigmac the captain put the coat down very slowly its nothing to get excited about said bigmac where i come from you can buy badges and things down the market you can get gestapo knives thats enough said the captain now listen to me youll make it easier on yourself if you tell me the truth right now i want your name the names of your contacts everything a unit is coming from headquarters and they arent as patient as i am do you understand he stood up and started to put bigmacs labelled belongings into a sack hey thats my stuff mumbled bigmac lock him up you cant lock me up just for some old car we can for spying said captain harris oh yes we can he strode out of the room spying said bigmac me are you one of them hitler youths said the sergeant conversationally i saw you lot on the newsreel waving all them torches nasty pieces of work i thought like boy scouts gone bad i havent spied for anyone shouted bigmac i dont know how to spy i dont even like germany my brother got sent home from munich for stitching up one of their football supporters with a scaffolding pole even though it wasnt his fault such rocksolid evidence of antigermanic feeling did not seem to impress the sergeant you can get shot you know he said for the first offence the door was still open bigmac could hear noises in the corridor someone was talking on the phone somewhere in the distance bigmac wasnt an athlete if there was an olympic sick note event he would have been in the british team he wouldve won the metres ive got asthma the halfmarathon lurk in the changing rooms and the freestyle got to go to the doctor but his boots dug into the floor and he rose out of his chair like a missile going off his feet barely touched the table top he went past the policemans shoulder with his legs already making running motions fear gave him superhuman acceleration ms partridge might make cutting remarks but she wasnt allowed to use bullets however much she wanted to bigmac landed in the doorway turned at random put his head down and charged it was a hard head it hit someone around belt level there was a shout and a crash he saw another gap and headed for it there was another crash and the sound of a telephone smashing on the floor someone yelled at him to halt or theyd fire bigmac didnt stop to find out whatd happened he just hoped that a pair of s doc martens that had been practically bought legally by his brother off a man with a lorry full of them were much better for dodging and running than huge police boots whoever had been shouting stop or theyd fire fired there was a crack and a clang somewhere ahead of bigmac but he turned down a corridor ran under the outstretched arms of another policeman and out into a yard a policeman was standing next to a jurassic bicycle a huge machine that looked as if it were made of drainpipes welded together bigmac went past him in a blur grabbed the handlebars swung onto the saddle and rammed his feet onto the pedals ere whatre you doin the policemans voice faded behind him the bike swung out into the lane behind the station it was a cobbled street the saddle was solid leather bigmacs trousers were very thin no wonder everyone was very depressed he thought trying to cycle standing up nyer nyer nyer spy spy spy shut up said wobbler why dont you run away to london aint gonna run away to london now said the boy slot more fun catchin spies here they were back in the heart of the town now the boy trailed behind wobbler pointing him out to passersby admittedly noone seemed to be about to arrest him but he was getting some odd looks my brother rons a policeman said the boy hell come up from london and shoot you with his gun go away sharnt opposite the entrance to paradise street was a small church it was a nonconformist chapel according to yoless it had a shutup wet sunday look a couple of elderly evergreen trees on either side of the door looked as though itd take a shovel just to get the soot off their leaves the three of them sat on the steps watching the street a woman had come out and was industriously scrubbing her doorstep did this chapel get hit said kirsty you mean will i dont think so pity its still here i mean in said yoless only its just used as a social hall you know for keepfit classes and stuff i know cos i come here for morns dance practice every wednesday will i mean you said kirsty you do morris dancing with sticks and hankies and stuff you theres something wrong said yoless coldly well no no of course not but its just an unusual interest for someone of your yoless let her squirm for a bit and then said height he dropped the word like a weight kirsty shut her mouth yes she said another woman appeared next door to the one scrubbing her front doorstep and started scrubbing her doorstep what are we going to do said kirsty im thinking said yoless somewhere in the distance a bell went off and kept on going off im thinking too said johnny im thinking we havent seen bigmac for ages good said kirsty he might be in some trouble i mean said johnny what do you mean might be said yoless and we havent seen wobbler either said johnny oh you know wobbler hes probably hiding somewhere another woman opened the door on the other side of the street and entered the doorstepscrubbing competition kirsty straightened up whyre we acting so miserable she said were nineties people we should be able to think of something we could we could we could ring up adolf hitler yoless suggested cant remember his phone number sorry but directory inquiries in germanyre bound to know johnny stared glumly at the shopping trolley he hadnt expected time travel to be this hard he thought of all those wasted lessons when they could have been telling him what to do if some mad woman left him a trolley full of time school never taught you anything that was useful in real life there probably wasnt a single text book that told you what to do if it turned out you were living next door to elvis presley he looked down the length of paradise street and felt time streaming past him yoless and kirsty faded away he could feel them there though as insubstantial as dreams as the light faded from the sky and the footballers went indoors and the wind got up and the clouds rolled in from the southwest and the town went to sleep and the bombers came out of the east and fire rained down on the houses and the allotments and the people and the goalposts chalked on the wall and all the nice clean white doorsteps captain harris turned bigmacs watch over amazing he said and it says made in japan fiendishly cunning said the police sergeant the captain picked up the radio japanese again he said why why put it on the back see here made in japan i thought it was all rice said the sergeant thats what my dad said he was out there captain harris fiddled one of the tiny headphones into his ear and moved a switch he listened to the hiss that was due to be replaced by radio blackbury in fortyeight years time and nodded its doing something he said his thumb touched the wave change switch and he blinked its the home service he said clear as a bell we could have the back off it in no time said the sergeant no said sergeant harris this has got to go to the ministry the men in white coats can have a look at it how can you get valves to fit in this wheres the aerial very small feet said the sergeant sorry sergeant thats what my dad said japanese the women very small feet he said so maybe theyve got small hands too just a thought the sergeant tried to extend his line of technological speculation good for making small things you know like ships in bottles the captain put the tiny radio back in the box ive seen people do them said the sergeant still anxious to be of assistance you get a bottle then you get a lot of very thin thread hes the best actor ive ever seen i know that said captain harris you could really think he was just a stupid boy but this stuff i just cant believe it its all very odd weve got every man out after him said the sergeant and the inspector has called out the army from west underton well have him in no time the captain sealed the box with sticky tape i want this guarded he said well keep an eye on it in the main office no i want it secure well theres an empty cell actually theres someone in it but ill soon have em out more secure than that the sergeant scratched an ear theres the lost property cupboard he said but theres important stuff in it lost property cupboard havent you got a safe no whatd happen if the crown jewels were found in the gutter then wed put em in the lost property cupboard said the sergeant promptly and then ring up the king if his name was in them of course look its a good thick door and theres only one key and ive got it all right take out whats in there and put it in your cell and put the box in the cupboard said the captain chief inspector wont like that very important stuff lost property tell him we can cooperate in a very friendly fashion now or if he prefers he can take a call from the chief constable in two minutes said captain harris putting his hand on the phone one way or the other hmm the sergeant looked worried you serious about this sir he said oh yes that stuffs not going to go off bang or anything is it im not sure i dont think so five minutes later the sergeant walked down to the cells with his arms full of the contents of the cupboard and a put upon expression on his face he put them on a bench in the corridor and fished out his keys then he pulled aside the hatch in a cell door you all right old girl thats what you think talk about a blue pencil you can tell hes a lad cant yeh mister shadwell yes yes said the sergeant opening the door the old lady sat on the bed she was so short that her feet swung several inches above the floor and there was a cat on her lap it growled when it saw the sergeant a slow rising growl which suggested that if there was any attempt to pick the cat up it was all going to end in claws the sergeant had long ago stopped worrying about how the cat could get into the cells it happened every time there wasnt room via the windows and it certainly couldnt have got in through the door but every night the old lady was in the cells the cat would be in there too in the morning finished your breakfast have you millennium hand and shrimp said mrs tachyon happily good then you just come along with me its a nice day outside said the sergeant beam me up scotty said mrs tachyon standing up and following him obediently the sergeant shook his head sadly she trailed behind him into the station yard where under a hit of canvas the sergeant had thrown over it the night before was a wire trolley loaded down with bags mrs tachyon looked at it noone nicked anything she said she was like that the sergeant thought mad as a hatter most of the time and then suddenly a sentenced come out at you like a razor blade in candy floss now then old love as if anyoned touch that lot he said as kindly as possible points win prizes hats the sergeant reached under the trolley and produced a pair of boots these belonged to my mum he said she was going to throw em out but i said theres still some good leather on them mrs tachyon snatched them out of his hand in seconds they were somewhere in the pile of bags on the trolley its a small step for a man said mrs tachyon yes theyre size sixes said the sergeant ah bisto its a great life if yer dont weaken but of course theyve put a bridge there now the sergeant looked down at the trolley dunno where you get this stuff from he said whatre these bags made of love looks like rubber or something obbly obbly ob weeeed said mrs tachyon i told them but noone listens to a teapot fab the sergeant sighed put his hand in his pocket and produced a sixpence get yourself a cup of tea and a bun he said hats thats what you think said mrs tachyon taking it dont mention it the sergeant headed back into the police station he was used to mrs tachyon when nights were cold youd sometimes hear a milk bottle smash on the step outside this was technically a crime and it meant that mrs tachyon was looking for somewhere warm for the night not on every cold night though that was a puzzler and no mistake last winter it had been very nippy indeed for quite a long time and the lads had got a bit worried it came as quite a relief when theyd heard the crash of breaking glass and the cry of i told em thats what you think mrs tachyon came and went and noone knew where she came from and you never found out where shed gone beam me up snotty mad as a hatter of course but strange too like after youd given her something you ended up feeling as if shed done you a favour he heard the rattle of the trolley behind him and then a sudden silence he turned around the trolley and mrs tachyon had gone johnny felt the hereness of here its happen here not in some faroff country full of odd names and foreign people with thick moustaches shouting slogans its happen here where there were public libraries and zebra crossings and people who did the football pools bombs would come crashing through roofs and ceilings and down to the cellars and turn the world white and it would happen because as yoless said it had happened it was going to have happened and he couldnt possibly stop it because if he did find some way of stopping it then he wouldnt know about it happening would he maybe mrs tachyon collected time johnny felt in a way that he couldnt quite put into words that time wasnt just something that was on clocks and calendars but lived in peoples heads too and if that meant you had to think like this no wonder she sounded mad are you all right said a voice a long way away miraculously the rubble became houses again the light came up the football rattled against the goal in the warm afternoon air kirsty waved a hand in front of his face are you okay i was just thinking said johnny i hate it when you switch off like that sorry johnny stood up we didnt come back here by accident he said i was thinking a lot about tonight and we ended up coming here just in time i dont know why but weve got to do something even if theres nothing we can do so im going to a bicycle came around the comer it was bouncing up and down on the cobbles and the skinny figure riding it was a mere blur it clanked to a halt in front of them they stared at the cyclist he was shaking so much he looked slightly out of focus bigmac urururshuddered bigmac how many fingers am i holding up said kirsty urururnnnineteen hhhide the bike why said kirsty i didnt do anything ali said yoless knowingly its like that is it he picked up the bike and wheeled it into the sooty shrubs like what said kirsty looking bewildered bigmac always never does anything said johnny thats right said yoless there cant be anyone in the whole universe whos got into so much trouble for things he didnt do in places he wasnt at that werent his fault thththey shot at me wow said yoless you mustve not done anything really big this time ththere was ththis ccar the ringing johnny had heard before started again somewhere behind the buildings ththats a police car said bigmac i tried to give them the slip down harold wilson drive and it wasnt there and one of them shot at me with an actual gun soldiers arent supposed to shoot people they dragged the trembling bigmac into the horrible bushes kirsty gave him her mac to stop him shivering all right game over i said game over he moaned lets pack it in all right lets go home i think we should try to tell people about the bombs johnny said someone might listen and if they ask how do you know youll say youre from will you maybe you could you know write a note said yoless slip it into someones letterbox oh yes said kirsty hotly what should we write go for a long walk perhaps or wear a very hard hat she stopped when she saw johnnys expression sorry she said i didnt mean that wobbler said yoless they turned wobbler was toiling along the street it took some effort for wobbler to manage a run but when he did so there was also something terribly unstoppable about him he spotted them and changed direction am i glad to see you he panted lets get out of here some loony kid chased me all the way down the hill he kept shouting out that i was a spy did he try to shoot you said bigmac he threw stones hah i got shot at said bigmac with a sort of pride all right said kirsty were all here lets go you know i dont know how said johnny the bags lay there in the trolley there were the words shop at tescos on a piece of metal on the front of the wire probably mr tesco just owned a tiny grocery shop or something back here johnny thought wildly or hadnt been born yet its your mind that works it said kirsty it must be you go where youre thinking oh come on said yoless thats like magic johnny stared at the trolley again i could try he said a police car went by a street away lets get somewhere more hidden said yoless good idea muttered bigmac a cinder path went around the back of the little church to an area with dustbins and a heap of dead flowers there was a small green door it opened easily in those in these days they didnt lock churches said yoless but theres silver candlesticks and stuff isnt there said bigmac anyone could walk right in and nick em dont said johnny they manhandled the trolley into a back room it contained a tea urn on a trestle table a pile of battered hymnbooks and not much else except the smell of old embroidery furniture polish and stale air which is known as the odour of sanctity there was no sign of any silver candlesticks anywhere bigmac shut that cupboard said yoless i was only looking johnny stared at the sacks all right he thought lets say theyre full of time its a daft idea after all theyre quite small sacks on the other hand how much space does time take up perhaps its compressed folded up mrs tachyon collects time like other old ladies collect string this is daft but there was a deep rumbling sound guilty had sat up in the trolley and was purring happily johnny took a sack and held it carefully by the neck it felt warm and he was sure it moved slightly under his grip this probably wont work he said should we hold on to the trolley said yoless i dont think so i dont know look are you all sure i really dont know what im doing yes but youve never really known what youre doing have you said kirsty thats right said yoless so youve had a lot of practice johnny shut his eyes and tried to think of the thought crept into his mind from somewhere outside its not a time its a place its a place where the model of the space shuttle on the ceiling hangs by a bit of red wool because you ran out of black thread and the models got streaks of glue on it because you always get it wrong somewhere its a place where your mum just smokes a lot and looks out of the window its a place where your grandad watches tv all day its where you want to be his mind began to go fuzzy at the edges he thought of thomas the tank engine wallpaper and the mr men lamp until they were so close he could almost taste them he could hear the place where grandad had hung the wallpaper wrong so that there was an engine that was half thomas and half james it hung like a beacon in his head he opened his eyes the images were still around him the others looked like ghosts they were staring at him he opened the bag just a fraction wobbler swallowed er he said he turned around and then just in case he looked behind the table er guys johnny bigmac yoless he swallowed again but sometimes you just had to face up to unpleasant facts and so he bravely said er kirsty noone answered there was noone there to answer he was all alone with the tea urn hey i was even holding on he said oi im still here very funny ha ha now joke over all right guys johnny youve left me behind all right it worked yes joke over ha ha ha all right please he opened the door and looked out into the shadowy yard i know youre only doing this to wind me up well it hasnt worked he moaned then he went back and sat on a bench with his hands on his lap after a while he fished out a grubby paper handkerchief and blew his nose he was about to throw it away when he stopped and glared at it it was probably the only paper handkerchief in the world i can see you peering out at me he said but his heart wasnt in it youre going to jump out any minute i know well its not working cos im not worried see lets all go home and get a burger eh good idea eh tell you what ive got some money i dont mind buyin em eh hey or we could go down the chinese and get a takeaway he stopped and looked exactly like someone whod realized that it was going to be a long long time before there were any beansprouts in this town or burgers come to that all there probably was to eat was meat and fish and stuff all right fair enough you can come out now a fly stirred on the windowsill and started to bang itself absentmindedly on the glass look its not funny any m more all right there was a movement of air behind him and a definite sensation that where there had been noone there was now someone wobbler turned around a huge relieved grin on his face ha i bet you thought youd got me going what the overs keepfit class was in full wheeze the tutor had long ago given up expecting everyone to keep up so she just pressed on in the hope that people would do what they could manage and if possible not actually die while on the premises and bend and bend and bend and do the best you can miss windex step and step and what she blinked johnny looked around the keepfit class after ten minutes of aerobics were not the most observant people one or two of them actually made space for the newcomers the tutor hesitated shed been brought up to believe in a healthy mind in a healthy body and since she was pretty sure she had a healthy body it was not possible she reasoned that a group of people and an overloaded shopping trolley could have suddenly appeared at the back of the old church hall they must have just come in she reasoned admittedly there was no actual door there but people certainly didnt just appear out of thin air where are we kirsty hissed same place whispered yoless different time even some of the slower fitness fans had caught up by now the whole class had stopped and turned around and were watching them with interest well say something said kirsty everyones looking er is this pottery said johnny what said the tutor were looking for beginners pottery said johnny it was a wild stab but every hall and but and spare room in blackbury seemed to have its time filled up with people doing weird hobbies or industriously learning russian a small light went on behind the tutors eyes she grabbed at the familiar words like a singer snatching a microphone thats thursdays she said in the red cross hall oh is it tch were always getting it wrong said johnny and after weve lugged all this clay up here too said yoless thats a nuisance isnt it bigmac dont look at me said bigmac they shot at me the tutor was staring from one to the other er yes well it can get pretty nasty in beginners pottery said johnny come on everyone they all grabbed hold of the trolley track suited figures limped politely out of the way as it squeaked its way across the floor bumped down the step and landed in the damp yard outside johnny pushed the door shut behind them and listened for a moment well then bend and stretch and wheeze and bend he straightened up it was amazing what you could get away with tenlegged aliens would be immediately accepted in blackbury if they were bright enough to ask the way to the post office and complain about the weather people had a way of just not seeing anything that common sense said they shouldnt see i bet somethings gone wrong said bigmac er said yoless no this has got to be the s said kirsty its the only period in history when you wouldnt be burned at the stake for wearing a green and purple tracksuit isnt it the bulk of the sports centre loomed opposite them five minutes ago thought johnny five of my minutes ago that was a street get your head round that er said yoless again they shot at me said bigmac a real bullet i heard it hit the actual wall er said yoless oh whats the matter with you said kirsty er wheres wobbler they looked around oh no said johnny they were wobblerless i aint going back said bigmac backing away not to get shot at he wouldnt have wandered off again would he said kirsty no said johnny he must still be there look get a grip will you said kirsty you said the church doesnt get hit hes okay yes but hes okay in sposing something goes wrong said bigmac he didnt come back this time sposing we go back and all get stuck ill get shot you think youve got problems said yoless id have to learn to play the banjo will you all stop panicking and think far a moment said kirsty this is time travel hes always going to be there whenever we go back of course we ought to go and get him but we dont have to rush of course it was true hed always be there thought johnny they could go back in ten years time and hed still be there just like something on a tape you could play it and fast forward and rewind and it would always be there and later that night the bombs would land in paradise street and that night would always be there forever every second always there like little fossils kirsty hauled the trolley away and pushed it down the steps towards the pavement his mum n dadll worry said yoless uncertainly no they wont said kirsty because we can bring him back to right here really why cant we see us doing it then said yoless you mean any minute were just going to pop up with wobbler and say hi us heres wobbler see you later oh good grief said kirsty i cant think about that you cant think about time travel with a logical mind yoless turned and looked at johnnys face oh no he said hes off again everythings there waiting johnny thought thats the thing about time it doesnt matter how long it takes to build a time machine we could all die out and evolution could start again with moles or something it could take millions of years but sooner or later someone will find out how to do it it might not even be a machine it might just be a way of understanding what time is like everyone was scared of lightning and then one day someone said look you can store it in little bottles and then it was just electricity but it wouldnt actually matter because once youd worked out how to use it everything would be there if someone ever finds a way of travelling in time ever in the entire history of the universe then they could be here today and then he thought of the bombers nosing through the clouds over the houses and the footballers and all those clean doorsteps uh he said you all right said yoless lets get a drink at least said kirsty shoving the trolley firmly towards the town centre and then she stopped johnny hadnt often seen her shocked kirsty normally dealt with the terrible and the unexpected by getting angry with it but now she stopped and went pale oh no she said the road from the old church led down the hill towards traffic lights at the bottom an overloaded shopping trolley with a boy and a girl clinging to it was hurtling down the other road as they watched it heeled over like a yacht tacking against the wind turned a full ninety degrees and plunged into the car park of the neil armstrong shopping mall a long black car followed it hed forgotten all about the car maybe there were secret societies maybe there were men in black in long black cars who said things like the truth is out there and came and found you if you got your hand trapped in the occult johnny could see a map in his head but it was a map of time theyd moved in time at his house but yoless was right you probably could move in time like a train on a track so you flipped over onto another track just a little bit further along you moved in space really and hed done it again when he thought they were going to die at the traffic lights and the black car had vanished because it didnt exist in this time he definitely hadnt seen it when hed looked behind him theyd come back to a time when it existed the car pulled to a halt outside the mall a feeling of absolute certainty stole over johnny he knew the answer later on with any luck hed find out what the question was but right now he was sure of the answer forget about secret societies forget about time police policemen had to have nice logical minds and to deal with time you needed a mind like mrs tachyon but there was someone else whod know where theyd be today wasnt there because supposing we didnt go back supposing maybe we went back and did things wrong he started to run johnny dodged across the road a car hooted at him across in the car park a man in black with black sunglasses and a peaked black hat got out of the car and burned into the mall johnny leapt over the low wall into the car park and weaved between shoppers and their trolleys and panted to a halt in front of the car it had stopped right in front of the entrance where noone was ever allowed to park in the bright sunlight it looked even blacker than johnny remembered its engine ticked occasionally as it cooled down on the hood was a silver ornament it looked very much like a hamburger if he squinted johnny could just make out a figure in the rear seat a mere shadow behind the darkness of the glass he ran around and snatched at the handle of the back door yanking it open all right i know youre in there who are you really most of the figure was in deep shade but there were a pair of hands visible resting on a black cane with a silver tip then the figure moved it unfolded slowly and became a large man in a coat that was half coat half cloak he emerged carefully making sure both feet were firmly on the ground before easing the rest of his body out of the car he was quite tall tall enough so that he was big rather than fat he wore a large black hat and had a short silvery beard he smiled at johnny and nodded at the others as they hurried up who am i he said well now why dont you guess you were always good at this sort of thing johnny looked at him and then at the car and then back up the hill to where the old church was just visible i think he said yes said the old man yes go on i think that i mean i dont know but i know im going to know i mean i think i know why youve come to find us yes johnny swallowed but we were he began the old man patted him on the shoulder call me sir john he said trousers of time there were differences in the mall one big difference certainly the burger bar had changed there were different shaped paper hats and the colour scheme was blue and white instead of red and yellow the old man led the way who is he hissed kirsty youll laugh if i tell you this is time travel im still trying to work out the rules sir john sat down heavily in a seat motioned them to sit down as well and then did the secondworst thing anyone could do in a fastfood restaurant he snapped his fingers at a waitress all the staff were watching them anxiously young lady said sir john wheezing slightly these people will have whatever they want i will have a glass of water thank you yes sir john said the waitress and hurried away youre not sposed to do that said bigmac hoarsely youre sposed to queue up no youre supposed to queue up said sir john i dont have to have you always been called sir john said johnny the man winked at him you know dont you he said youve worked it out youre right names are easily changed especially in wartime i thought it might be better i got the knighthood in for services to making huge amounts of money the waitress hurried back with the water and then produced a notebook and looked expectantly at them all with the bright brittle smile of someone who is expecting to be sacked at any moment ill have well ill have everything said yoless me too said bigmac cheeseburger said johnny chilli beanburger said kirsty and i want to know whats going on okay sir john beamed at her in a slightly distracting way then he nodded at the waitress make me one with everything he said slowly and carefully as if quoting something hed heard a long time ago because i want to become a muslim a buddhist said yoless without thinking you always muck up the punchl then his mouth dropped open do i said wobbler well i hung around for a while and you didnt come back said wobbler and then but we did i mean we will said kirsty this is where it gets difficult said wobbler patiently johnny knows supposing you didnt go back supposing you were scared to or you found that you couldnt the possibility exists and that means the future forks off in two different ways in one you went back in one you didnt now youve ended up in the future where you didnt go back ive been here since dont try to think too hard about this because itll make your brain hurt anyway first i stayed with mr and mrs seeley he continued id met them that first day their son was away in the navy and everyone thought i was an evacuee who was a bit daft and what with one thing and another theres too much to worry about in a big war for people to ask too many questions about one fat boy they were very nice people they sort of adopted me i suppose because their son got torpedoed but i moved away after a few years why said kirsty i didnt want to meet my own parents or anything like that said wobbler he still seemed out of breath history is full of patches as it is without causing any more trouble eh changing my name wasnt hard either in a war well records go missing people get killed everything gets shaken up a person can duck down and pop up somewhere else as someone else i was in the army for a few years after the war you said bigmac oh everyone had to be national service it was called out in berlin and then i came back and had to make a living would you like another milkshake i personally wouldnt if i were you i know how theyre made you couldve invented computers said bigmac really you think so the old man laughed whod have listened to a boy who hadnt even been to university besides well look at this he picked up a plastic fork and tapped it on the table see this he said we throw away millions of them every day after five minutes use theyre in the trash right yes of course said kirsty behind wobbler the staff were watching nervously like monks in some quiet monastery somewhere whove just had st peter drop in for tea a hundred years ago itd have been a marvel and now we throw them away without a second thought so how do you make one well you get some oil and ive think theres something about it in a book ive got right said wobbler leaning back you dont know i dont know either but i wouldnt bother with that id write science fiction said kirsty moon landings and stuff you probably could said wobbler a tired expression crossed his face and he started to pat the pockets of his coat as if looking for something but ive never had much of a way with words im afraid no i opened a hamburger bar johnny looked around and then started to grin thats right said wobbler in i knew it all you see thick shakes double smashers with cheesen egg paper hats for the staff red sauce in those little round plastic bottles that look like tomatoes oh yes i had three bars in the first year and ten the year after that theres thousands now other people just couldnt keep up i knew what would work you see birthday treats for the kids the willie wobbler clown willie wobbler said kirsty sorry they were more innocent times said wobbler and then i started other things soft toilet paper for a start honestly the stuff they had back in the s you could use as roofing felt and when that was going well i started to listen to people people with bright ideas like i think i could make a tape recorder really small so that people could carry it around and id say that might just catch on you know heres some money to get started or you know i think i know a way of making a machine to record television signals on tape so that people could watch them later and id say amazing whatever will they think of next heres some money why dont we form a company and build some and while were about it why dont we see if movies can be put on these tape thingies too thats dishonest said kirsty thats cheating i dont see why said wobbler people were amazed that id listen to them because everyone else thought they were crazy i made money but so did they are you a millionaire said bigmac oh no i was a millionaire back in im a billionaire now i think he snapped his fingers again the chauffeur in black who had silently appeared behind them stepped forward i am a billionaire arent i hickson yes sir john many times thought so and i think i own some island somewhere what was it called now tasmania i think wobbler patted his pockets again and finally brought out a slim silver case he flicked it open and took out two white pills which he swallowed he grimaced and sipped from his glass of water you havent touched your one with everything said johnny watching him oh i asked for it just to make the point said wobbler im not allowed to eat them good heavens i have a diet no sodium no cholesterol low starch no sugar he sighed even a glass of water is probably too exciting the manager of the burger bar had at last plucked up the courage to approach the table sir john he said this is a such an honour yes yes thank you please go away im talking to my friends wobbler stopped and smiled evilly fries all right bigmac properly crisp he said what about that milkshake yoless right sort of texture is it the boys glanced up at the manager who suddenly looked like a man praying to the god of everyone who has to work while wearing a namebadge saying my name is keith er theyre fine said bigmac great said yoless keith gave them a relieved grin theyre always good said yoless i expect said bigmac that theyll go on being good keith nodded hurriedly were genially in most saturdays added bigmac helpfully if you want us to make sure thank you keith you may go said wobbler he winked at bigmac as the man almost ran away i know i shouldnt do it he said but its about the only fun i get these days why did you come here said johnny quietly you know i couldnt resist doing a little checking said wobbler ignoring him i thought it might be interesting to watch myself growing up not interfering of course he stopped smiling and then i found i wasnt born id never been born nor was my father my mother lived in london and was married to someone else thats one thing about money you can buy any amount of private detectives thats nonsense said kirsty youre alive oh yes said wobbler i was born in another time in the leg of the trousers of time that we were all born in and then i went back in time with you all and something went wrong im not sure what so i had to come back the long way you could say i had to walk home im sure thats not logical said kirsty wobbler shrugged i dont think time is all that logical he said it bends itself around humans its probably full of loose ends whoever said it shouldnt be sometimes loose ends are necessary if they werent spaghetti would be merely an embarrassing experience he chuckled spoke to a lot of scientists about this damn fools idiots times in our heads any fool can see that youre ill arent you said johnny is it obvious you keep taking pills and your breathing doesnt sound right wobbler smiled again but this time there was no humour in it im suffering from life he said however im nearly cured look said kirsty in the voice of one who is trying to be reasonable against the odds we werent going to leave you there we were going to go back we will go back good said wobbler you dont mind because surely if we do you wont exist will you oh i will somewhere said wobbler thats right said johnny everything that happens stays happened somewhere theres lots of times side by side you always were a bit of an odd thinker said wobbler i remember that an imagination so big its outside your head now what was the other thing oh yes i think i have to give you this the chauffeur stepped forward er sir john you know the board did want there was a blur in the air wobblers silverheaded cane hit the table so hard that bigmacs fries flew into the air the crack echoed around the restaurant god damn it man im paying you and you will do what i say the board can wait im not dead yet i didnt get where i am today by listening to a lot of lawyers whining im having some time off go away wobbler reached into his jacket and took out an envelope he handed it to johnny im not telling you to go back he said ive got no right ive had a pretty good life one way and the other but said johnny through the glass doors of the mall he could see a car and four motorcycles pull up im sorry said wobbler the next word you were going to say was but said johnny men were hurrying up the steps oh yes but wobbler leaned forward and began speaking quickly if you go back ive written a letter to well youll know what to do with it i know i really shouldnt do it but who could pass up an opportunity like this he stood up or at least attempted to hickson rushed up as wobbler caught the edge of his chair but was waved away i never had any children said wobbler never got married dont know why really it just didnt seem right he leaned heavily on his stick and turned back to them i want to be young again he said somewhere we were going to go back said johnny honestly good but you see its not just a case of going back its going back and doing the right things and then he was gone walking heavily towards the men with the suits who closed in behind him bigmac was staring so much that a long rivulet of mustard tomato sauce special chilli relish and vivid green chutney had dripped out of his burger and down his sleeve without him noticing wow said yoless under his breath will we be like that one day what old probably said johnny i just cant get my head around old wobbler being old said bigmac sucking at his sleeve weve got to go and get him said johnny we cant let him get rich said yoless i dont think we can do anything about the old bit if we bring him back then he the old one wont exist here said kirsty no hell exist in this here but not in the other here i dont think hell be existing anywhere for very long anyway said johnny come on whats in the envelope said kirsty as they left johnny was surprised usually shed say something like lets see whats in this then while snatching it out of his hand its for wobbler said johnny hes written a letter to himself whats he say how do i know i dont open other peoples letters johnny shoved the envelope back into his inside pocket the keepfit club should have finished by now he said come on wait said kirsty if were going back to lets go prepared this time shall we yeah said bigmac armed no properly dressed i mean every little girl it was an hour later they met behind the church in the damp little yard where theyd left the trolley all right said kirsty where did you get that outfit johnny grandads got loads of stuff in the attic these are his old football shorts and he always wears old pullovers so i thought that was probably okay too and ive got my project stuff in this box in case it helps its genuine s its what they carried gasmasks in oh is that what they are said bigmac i thought people had rather big walkmans at least take the cap off you look like just william said kirsty whats this yoless me and bigmac went along to that theatre shop in wallace street said yoless what do you think he added uncertainly he shuffled round nervously he was wearing a broadbrimmed hat shoes with soles like two bumper cars parked side by side and tight trousers at least what could be seen of the trousers looked tight is that an overcoat said johnny critically its called a drape jacket said yoless bright red said kirsty yes i can see noone will notice you at all and those trousers you must have had to grease your feet to get them on it looks a bit stylish said johnny you know jazzy the man in the shop said its about right for the period said yoless defensively you look like youre about to play the saxophone said johnny i mean well ive never seen you looking so you know cool thats why its a disguise said yoless kirsty turned to bigmac and sighed bigmac why is it i get this feeling youve missed the point i told him said yoless but he wouldnt listen the man said they wore this in said bigmac defensively yes but dont you think that people might notice its a german uniform bigmac looked panicky is it i thought yoless was trying to wind me up i thought they had all swastikas and stuff thats the gestapo youre dressed up like an ordinary german soldier i cant help it its the only one they had left it was this or chain mail at least leave the jacket and helmet off all right then itll probably look like any other uniform whyve you wearing that fur coat kirsty said johnny you always say that wearing the skins of dead animals is murder yeah but she only says it to old ladies in fur coats muttered bigmac under his breath bet she never says it to hells angels in leather jackets i took some care said kirsty ignoring him she adjusted her hat and shoulder bag this is pretty accurate what even the shoulders yes shoulders were being worn wide do you have to go through doors sideways said yoless lets get on with it shall we whats worrying me is when old wobb i mean old old wobbler said weve got to do the right things to bring him back said yoless what things well have to find out said johnny he didnt say it was easy come on said bigmac opening the door i miss old wobbler why said kirsty cos i dont throw straight the keepfit people had long ago staggered home johnny shoved the trolley into the middle of the floor and stared at the sacks guilty was still asleep on a couple of them er said yoless this isnt magic is it i dont think so said johnny its probably just very very very strange science oh good said yoless er whats the difference who cares said kirsty get on with it guilty started to purr johnny picked up a bag it seemed to wriggle in his grasp with great care he loosened the string and concentrated it was easier this time before hed just been dragged along like a cork in a current this time he knew where he was going he could feel the time minds moved in time all the time all the sacks did was let your body come too just like mrs tachyon had said years spiralled into the bag like water down a plughole time sucked out of the room and then there were the pews and the scent of highly polished holiness and wobbler turning around with his mouth open what its all right its us said johnny are you all right said yoless wobbler might not have been the winner of the alleurope uptake speed trials but an expression of deep suspicion spread across his face as he looked at them whats up he said youre all looking at me as if id gone weird and whatre you all dressed up for whys bigmac wearing a german uniform see said yoless triumphantly i said so and does anyone listen weve just come back to fetch you said johnny theres no problem thats right no problem at all said yoless everythings fine yeah fine everythings fine said bigmac er youre not feeling old are you what after five minutes said wobbler ive brung you something said bigmac he took a square flat shape from his pocket it was rather battered but it was nevertheless the only styrofoam box currently existing on the planet it was a bigwob one with everything did you nick that said yoless well the old bloke said he wasnt going to eat it said bigmac so itd only get chucked away all right its not stealing if itd only get chucked away anyway it is his isnt it because youre not going to eat that are you said kirsty quickly its cold and greasy and its been in bigmacs pocket for heavens sake wobbler lifted out the bun i could eat it even if a giraffes licked it he said and bit into the cold bread hey this isnt bad whose is it he looked at the face printed on the box whos the old fart with the beard just some old fart said johnny yeah we dont know anything about him at all said bigmac wobbler gave them a suspicious look whats going on here he said look i cant explain now said johnny youre stuck here er apparently er somethings gone wrong er theres been a snag what kind of snag er quite a big one wobbler stopped eating it was that serious how big he said er youre not going to be born er wobbler stared at him then he stared at the half eaten burger am i eating this burger are these my teeth marks he demanded look its perfectly simple said kirsty youre alive here yes but when we first came back something must have happened which changed history everything anyone does changes history so theres two histories you were born in one but things have been changed and when we got back it was into a different history where you werent all we have to do is put things back the way they should be and then everything will be all right hah you havent got a shelf of star trek videos as well have you said wobbler kirsty looked as though someone had hit her well er i dont er what she said er one or two a few not many so what anyway i hardly ever look at them hey said yoless brightening up have you got that one where a mysterious force just shut up just shut up right now just because the programme happens to be an accurate reflection of late th century social concerns actually it doesnt mean you can go around winding people up just because theyve been taking an academic interest have you got a star trek uniform said yoless kirsty started to go red if any of you tell anybody else therell be big trouble said kirsty i mean it johnny opened the door of the church outside wednesday afternoon was turning into wednesday evening it was raining gently he took a deep breath of air it smelled of coal and pickles and jam with a hint of hot rubber people were making things all those chimneys noone made anything in blackbury in there was a factory that put together computers and some big warehouses and the department of road signs regional headquarters people just moved things around or added up numbers so i watch some science fiction films said a plaintive voice behind him at least i do it in a spirit of intelligent deconstruction i dont just sit there saying cor lasers brill noone said you did said yoless managing to sound infuriatingly reasonable youre not going to let me forget this are you said kirsty wont mention it ever again said yoless if we do may we be pulled apart by wild vegans said bigmac smirking no vegans are the people who dont eat animal products said yoless you mean vulcans vulcans are the ones with green blood will you lot shut up heres me not even being born and youre goin on about daft aliens said wobbler what did we do here that changed the future said johnny turning around practically everything i suppose said kirsty and bigmac left all his stuff at the police station they shot at me lets face it said yoless anything we do changes the future maybe we bumped into someone so he was five seconds late crossing the road and got hit by a car or something like treading on a dinosaur any little thing changes the whole of history thats daft said bigmac i mean rivers still flow the same way no matter how the little fish swim er said wobbler there was this kid he said it in the slow plonking tones of someone who is afraid that he might have come up with an important piece of evidence what kid said johnny just some kid said wobbler he was running away from home or something to home i mean all long shorts and bogeys up the nose what do you mean running to home oh he was goin on about being evacuated here and being fed up and running off back to london but he followed me back into town throwing stones at me cos he said i was a spy hes probably still outside smatter of fact he ran off down that road there paradise street said johnny what about it said wobbler looking worried its going to be bombed tonight said kirsty johnnys got a thing about it hah cant see any germans wanting to bomb him he was practically on their side said wobbler are you sure it was paradise street said johnny are you sure did you have any relatives there grandparents greatgrandparents how should i know that was ages ago johnny took a deep breath its right now iii dont know one of my grandads lives in spain and the other one died before i was born how said kirsty fell off a motorbike i think in wobbler brightened up see so thats all right oh wobbler wobbler its not all right said johnny get it into your head where did he live wobbler was trembling as he always did when life was getting too exciting i dunno london i think my dad said he came up here in the war and then later on he came back on a visit and met my grandma er er go on go on said johnny er er wobbler stuttered how old was he when he died said yoless er forty my dad said er hed bought the bike for his birthday so hes johnny subtracted in his head ten now er er you dont think he was that boy do you said yoless oh yes said wobbler finally giving up panic for anger i should have asked him should i hello are you going to be my grandad ps dont buy a motorbike johnny fished in his gas mask box and pulled out a crumpled folder stuffed with bits of paper did he mention any names he said flicking through the pages er er someone called mrs density said wobbler desperation throwing up a memory number eleven said johnny pulling out a photocopy of a newspaper clipping lived there with her daughter gladys i got all the names for my project my grans name was gladys said wobbler you mean because he didnt run off back to london hes going to die tonight and im not going to be born could be said yoless whatll happen to me youll just have to stay here said johnny no ways this is the olden days its awful i went past a cinema and its all old movies in black and white and there was this cafe and you know what theyd got chalked on a board in front meat and two veg what kind of food is that even hong kong henrys takeaway tells you what kind of meat everyone dresses like someone out of eastern europe id go round the bend here my grandad always goes on about how they used to have so much fun when he was a kid even though they didnt have anything said bigmac yes but everyones grandad says that said kirsty its compulsory its like where they say p for a chocolate bar when i was young you could get one and still have change out of sixpence i think they had fun said johnny because they didnt know they didnt have anything well i know said wobbler i know about food thats more than two colours and stereo systems and decent music and and all kinds of stuff i want to go home they all looked at johnny you got us into this said yoless me its your imagination said kirsty its too big for your head just like sir j she stopped just like ive always said she corrected herself and it drags everyone else along with it i dont know how but it does you got all worked up about paradise street and now here we are you said it didnt make any difference if the street got bombed or not said johnny you said it was just history i dont want to be history moaned wobbler all right you win said kirsty what do you want us to do johnny shuffled the papers well what i found out for my project was that there was a big storm you see the weather got very bad and the bombers mustve seen blackbury and dropped their bombs anyway and turned around that used to happen there was there is an air raid siren it was supposed to go off if bombers were near he said only it didnt why not the folder shut with a snap lets start by finding out said johnny it was on a pole on the roof in the high street it didnt look very big thats all it is said yoless looks like a giant yoyo thats an airraid siren all right said kirsty i saw a picture in a book how dthey work set off by radar or something im sure thats not been invented yet said johnny well how then maybe theres a switch somewhere itd be somewhere safe then said yoless somewhere where people wouldnt be able to set it off for a laugh their joint gaze travelled down the pole across the roof down the wall past the blue lamp and stopped when it met the words police station oh dear said yoless they sat down on a bench by a civic flowerbed opposite the door a policeman came out and stood in the sunshine watching them back its a good job we left bigmac to guard the trolley said yoless yes said johnny hes always been allergic to policemen kirsty sighed honestly you boys havent got a clue she stood up crossed the road and began to talk to the policeman they could hear the conversation it went like this excuse me officer he gave her a friendly smile yes little lady out in your mums clothes are you kristys eyes narrowed oh dear said johnny under his breath whats the matter said yoless well you know you and wouldnt sambo thats kirsty and words like little lady i was just wondering said the little lady through clenched teeth how that big siren works oh i shouldnt worry your head about that love said the policeman its very complicated you wouldnt understand look for something to hide behind said johnny like another planet then his mouth dropped open as kirsty won a medal its just that i get so worried she said and managed a simper or what she probably thought was a simper im sure mr hitlers bombers are going to come one night and the siren wont go off i cant get to sleep for worrying the policeman laid a hand on the shoulder of the girl who had left blackbury karate club because no boy would dare come within two metres of her oh we cant have that love he said he pointed see up there on blackdown well mr hodder and his very brave men are up there every night keeping a lookout if any planes come near here tonight hell ring the station in a brace of shakes dont you worry but supposing the phone doesnt work oh then hell be down here on his bike in no time bike a bike thats all its a motorbike said the policeman giving her the nervous looks everyone eventually gave kirsty she just stared at him its a blackbury phantom he added still further in a tone of voice that suggested this should impress even a girl oh really oh thats a relief said kirsty i feel a lot better for knowing that really thats right theres nothing for you to worry about love said the policeman happily ill just go off and play with my dolls i expect said kirsty thats a good idea have a tea party said the policeman who apparently didnt know withering scorn when he heard it kirsty crossed the road and sat down on the seat yes i expect i should have a party with all my dollies she said glaring at the flowers yoless looked at johnny over her head what he said did you hear what that ridiculous policeman said said kirsty honestly its obvious that the stupid man thinks that just because im female ive got the brains of a baby i mean good grief imagine living in a time when people could even think like that without being prosecuted imagine living in a time when a bomb could come through your ceiling said johnny mind you my father said he lived in the shadow of the atomic bomb all through the sixties said kirsty i think that was why he wore flares hah dollies pink dresses and pink ribbons dont worry your head about that girlie this is the dark ages yoless patted her on the arm he didnt mean it you know nastily he said its just how he was brought up you people cant expect us to rewrite history you know kirsty frowned at him is that sarcasm she said who me said yoless innocently all right all right youve made your point whats so special about a blackbury phantom anyway they used to make them here said johnny they were quite famous i think grandad used to have one they raised their eyes to the dark shape of blackdown it had loomed over the town even back in but then it had a tv mast thats it said kirsty men just sitting on hills and listening well blackbury wasnt very important said johnny we made jam and pickles and rubber boots and that was about it i wonder whats going to go wrong tonight said yoless we could climb up there and find out said johnny lets go and get the others hang on said kirsty think will you how do you know we might not cause whats going to go wrong tonight johnny hesitated for a moment he looked like a statue then he said no if we start thinking like that well never do anything weve already messed up the future once everything we do affects the future it always has it always will so what lets get the others running into time there was no question of using the roads not with the police still looking for a bigmac who with a wardrobe of costumes to chose from had chosen to go back in time wearing a german soldiers uniform theyd have to use the fields and footpaths which meant well have to leave the trolley said yoless we can shove it in the bushes here that means well be stuck here if anything goes wrong said bigmac well im not lugging it through mud and stuff what if someone finds it theres guilty said kirsty hes better than a guard dog the cat that was better than a guard dog opened one eye and yawned it was true noone would want to be bitten by that mouth it would be like being savaged by a plague laboratory then he curled into a more comfortable ball yes but it belongs to mrs tachyon said johnny weakly hey were not thinking sensibly again said kirsty all we have to do is go back to go up to blackdown on the bus then come back in time again and well be up there no shouted wobbler his face was bright red with terror im not stopping here by myself again im stuck here remember supposing you dont come back of course well come back said johnny we came back this time didnt we yes but supposing you dont supposing you get run over by a lorry or something whatll happen to me johnny thought about the long envelope in his inside pocket yoless and bigmac were looking at their feet even kirsty was looking away here said wobbler suspiciously this is time travel right do you know something horrible we dont know anything said bigmac absolutely right said kirsty what us we dont know a thing said johnny miserably especially about burgers said bigmac kirsty groaned bigmac wobbler glared at them oh yes he muttered its wind up ole wobbler time again right well im going to stay with the trolley right its not going anywhere without me right he stared from one to the other daring them to disagree all right ill stay with you said bigmac ill probably only get shot anyway if i go anywhere whatre you going to do up on blackdown anyway said wobbler find this mr hodder and tell him to listen really carefully wash out his ears eat plenty of carrots theyre for good eyesight said yoless helpfully my granny said they used to believe carrots helped you see in who cares i dont know what we can do said johnny but something must have gone wrong right maybe the message didnt get through well have to make sure it does look said kirsty the sun had already set leaving an afterglow in the sky and there were clouds over blackdown dark clouds thunderstorm she said they always start up there there was a growl in the distance blackbury was a lot smaller once they were in the hills a lot of it wasnt there at all wouldnt it be great if we could tell everyone what theyre going to do wrong said johnny when they paused for breath nooned listen said yoless supposing someone turned up in and said they were from and started telling everyone what to do theyd get arrested wouldnt they johnny looked ahead of them the sunset sky lurked behind bars of angry cloud the listenersll be up at the tumps said kirsty theres an old windmill up there it was some kind of lookout post during the war is i mean why didnt you say so before said johnny its different when its now the tumps were five mounds on top of the down they grew heather and wortleberries it was said that dead kings were buried there in the days when your enemy was at arms length rather than ten thousand feet above your head the clouds were getting lower it was going to be one of those blackbury storms a sort of angry fog that hugged the hills you know what im thinking said kirsty telephone lines said johnny they go out in thunderstorms right but the policeman said there was a motorbike said yoless starts first time does it said johnny i remember my grandad said that before you were qualified to ride a blackbury phantom you had to learn to push it fifty metres cursing all the way he said they were great bikes when they got started how long is it till you know the bombs about an hour which means theyre already on the way johnny thought men have walked out onto airfields and loaded bombs onto planes with names like dormers and heinkels and other men have sat round in front of a big map of england only itd be in german and thered be crayon marks around slate blackbury probably wasnt even on the map and then theyd get up and walk out and get into the planes and take off and men on the planes would get out their maps and draw lines on them lines which crossed at slate your mission for tonight bomb the goods yard at slate and then the roar filled his ears the drone of the engines came up through his legs he could taste the oil and the sweat and the stale rubber smell of the oxygen mask his body shook with the throb of the engines and also with the thump of distant explosions one was very close and the whole aircraft seemed to slide sideways and he knew what the mission for tonight was your mission for tonight is to get home safely it always was another explosion shook the plane and someone grabbed him what its weird when you do that shouted kirsty above the thunder come on its dangerous out here havent you got enough sense to get out of the rain its starting to happen johnny whispered while the storm broke around him what is the future he blinked as the rain started to plaster his hair against his head he could feel time stretching out around him he could feel its slow movement as it carried forward all those grey bombs and those white doorsteps pulling them together like bubbles being swirled around a whirlpool they were all earned along by it you couldnt break out of it because you were part of it you couldnt steer a train wed better get him under cover shouted yoless as lightning hit something a little way off he doesnt look well at all they staggered on occasionally lurking under a windbent tree to get their breath back there was a windmill among the tumps it had been built on one of the mounds although the sails had long gone the others put their arms around johnny and ran through the soaking heather until they reached it and climbed the steps yoless hammered on the door it opened a fraction good lord said a voice it sounded like the voice of a young man whatre you a circus youve got to let us in said kirsty hes ill cant do that said the voice not allowed see do we look like spies shouted yoless please said kirsty the door started to close and then stopped well all right said the voice as unseen hands pulled the door open but mr hodder says to stand where we can see you okay come on in its happening said johnny who still had his eyes closed the telephone wont work whats he going on about can you try the telephone said kirsty why whats wrong with it said the boy we tested it out at the beginning of the shift just now has anyone been mucking about with it there was an older man sitting at a table he gave them a suspicious look which lingered for a while on yoless i reckon youd better try the station he said i dont like the sound of all this seems altogether a bit suspicious to me the first man reached out towards the phone there was a sound outside as lightning struck somewhere close it wasnt a zzzipppit was almost a gentle silken hiss as the sky was cut in half then the phone exploded bits of bakelite and copper clattered off the walls kristys hand flew to her head my hair stood on end so did mine said yoless and that doesnt often happen believe me he added lightning hit the wire said johnny i knew that not just here other stations on the hills too and now hell have trouble with the motorbike whats he going on about youve got a motorbike havent you said kirsty so what good grief man youve lost your telephone arent you supposed to do something about that the men looked at one another girls werent supposed to shout like kirsty tom nip down to doctor atkinsons and use his phone and tell the station ours has gone for a burton said mr hodder not taking his eyes off the three tell them about these kids too it wont start said johnny its the carburettor i think that always gives trouble the one called tom looked at him sideways there was a change in the air up until now the men had just been suspicious now they were uneasy too how did you know that he said johnny opened his mouth and shut it again he couldnt tell them about the feel of the time around him he felt that if he could only focus his eyes properly he could even see it the past and future were there just around some kind of corner bound up to the evertravelling now by a billion connections he felt that he could almost reach out and point not there or over there or up there but there at right angles to everywhere else theyre on their way he said theyll be here in half an hour what will whats he going on about blackburys going to be bombed tonight said kirsty thunder rolled again we think said yoless five planes said johnny he opened his eyes everything overlapped like a scene in a kaleidoscope everyone was staring at him but they were surrounded by something like fog when they moved images followed them like some kind of special effect its the storm and the clouds he managed to say they think theyre going to slate but theyll drop their bombs over blackbury oh yes and how dyou know this then they told you did they listen you stupid man said kirsty were not spies why would we tell you if we were mr hodder pulled open the door im going down to use the doctors phone he said then maybe we can sort out whats going on what about the bombers said kirsty the older man opened the door the thunder had rolled away to the northeast and there was no sound but the hiss of the rain what bombers he said and shut it behind him johnny sat down with his head in his hands blinking his eyes again to shut out the flickering images you lotd better get out said tom its against the rules having people in here johnny blinked there were more bombers in front on his eyes and they didnt go away he scrabbled at the playing cards on the table whatre these for he said urgently playing cards with bombers on them eh what oh thats for learning aircraft recognition said tom whod been careful to keep the table between him and johnny you plays cards with em and you sort of picks up the shapes like you learn subliminally said kirsty oh no you learn from playing with these here cards said tom desperately outside there was the sound of someone trying to start a motorbike johnny stood up all right he said i can prove it the next card the next card you show me the next card images filled his eyes if this is how mrs tachyon sees the world he thought no wonder she never seems all there because shes everywhere outside there was the sound of someone trying to start a motorbike even harder the next card will be the five of diamonds i dont see why i should have to play games the man glanced nervously at kirsty who had that effect on people scared she said he grabbed a card at random and held it up its the five of diamonds all right said yoless johnny nodded the next one the next one the next one will be the knave of hearts it was outside there was the sound of someone trying to start a motorbike very hard and swearing its a trick said the man one of you messed around with the pack shuffle them all you like said johnny and the next one you show me will be the ten of clubs how did you do that said yoless as the boy turned the card over and stared at it er it had felt like memory he told himself i remembered seeing it said johnny you remembered seeing it before you actually saw it said kirsty outside there was the sound of someone trying to start a motorbike very hard and swearing even harder er yes oh wow she said precognition youre probably a natural medium er im a size eleven said johnny but they werent listening kirsty had turned to tom you see she said now do you believe us i dont like this this isnt right he said anyway anyway theres no phone the door burst open all right roared mr hodder what did you kids do to my bike its the carburettor said johnny i told you here arthur you ought to listen to this this boy knows things kirsty glanced at her watch twenty minutes she said its more than two miles down to the town even if we ran im not sure we could do it whatre you talking about now said mr hodder there must be some kind of code said kirsty if you have to ring up and tell them to sound the siren what do you say dont tell them snapped mr hodder this is station bd said johnny his eyes looking unfocussed how did you know that did he tell you did you tell them no arthur come on said kirsty hurrying towards the door i got a county medal in athletics she elbowed the older man aside the thunder was growling away in the east the storm had settled down to a steady grey rain well never make it said yoless i thought you people were good at running said kirsty stepping out people of my height you mean you were right said the young man as johnny was dragged out into the night this is station bd i know said johnny i remembered you just telling me he staggered and grabbed at yoless to stay upright the world was spinning around him he hadnt felt like this since that business with the cider at christmas the voices around him seemed to be muffled and he couldnt be sure whether they were really there or voices he was remembering or words that hadnt even been spoken yet he felt that his mind was being shaken loose in time and it was only still here because his body was a huge great anchor its downhill all the way said kirsty and sped off yoless followed her far away down in the town a church clock began to strike eleven johnny tried to lumber into a run but the ground kept shifting under his feet why are we doing this he thought we know it happened ive got a copy of the paper in my pocket the bombs will land and the siren wont go off you cant steer a train thats what you think said a voice in his head he wished hed been better at this he wished hed been a hero from up ahead he heard yolesss desperate cry ive tripped over a sheep ive tripped over a sheep the lights of blackbury spread out below them there werent many of them the occasional smudge from a car the tiny gleam from a window where the moths had got at the blackout curtain a wind had followed the storm streamers of cloud blew across the sky here and there a star shone through they ran on yoless ran into another sheep in the blackness there was the crunch of heavy boots on the road behind them and tom caught them up if youre wrong theres going to be big trouble he panted what if were right said kirsty i hope youre wrong thunder rumbled again but the four runners plunged on in a bubble of desperate silence they were leaving the moor behind there were hedges on either side of the road now toms boots skidded to a halt listen they stopped there was the grumbling of the thunder and the hiss of the rain and behind the noises of the weather a faint and distant droning gravel flew up as the young man started to run again hed been moving fast before but now he flew down the road a large house loomed up against the night he leapt over the fence pounded across the lawns and started to hammer on the front door open up open up its an emergency johnny and the others reached the gate the droning was louder now we could have done something johnny thought i could have done something i couldve well there must have been something we thought it would be so easy just because were from the future what do we know about anything and now the bombers are nearly here and theres nothing we can do come on open up yoless found a gate and hurried through it there was a splash in the darkness i think ive stepped into some sort of pond said a damp voice tom stepped away from the house and groped on the ground for something maybe i can smash a window he mumbled er its quite deep said yoless damply and im caught up on some kind of fountain thing glass tinkled tom reached through the window beside the door there was a click and the door opened they heard him trip over something inside and then a weak light went on another click and this phones dead too the lightning mustve got the exchange wheres the next house said kirsty as tom hurtled down the path not till roberts road they ran after him yoless squelching slightly the drone was much louder now johnny could hear it above the sound of his own breath someone must notice it in the town he thought it fills the whole sky without saying anything they all began to run faster and at last the siren began to wail but the clouds were parting and the moon shone through and there were shadows nosing through the rags of cloud and johnny could feel the unseen shapes turning over and over as they drifted towards the ground first there was the allotment and then the pickle factory and then paradise street exploded gently like a row of roses opening the petals were orange tinged with black and unfolded one after another as the bombs fell along the street then the sounds arrived they werent bangs but crunches punches great wads of noise hammered into the head finally they died away leaving only a distant crackling and the rising sound of a fire bell oh no said kirsty tom had stopped he stood and stared at the distant flames the phone wasnt working he whispered i tried to get here but the phone wasnt working were time travellers said yoless this isnt supposed to happen johnny swayed slightly the feeling was like flu but much worse he felt as if he were outside his own body watching himself it was the hereness of here the nowness of now people survived by not paying any attention to feelings like this if you stopped and opened your head to them the world would roll over you like a tank paradise street was always going to be bombed it was being bombed it would have been bombed tonight was a fossil in time it was a thing somewhere it would always have happened you couldnt steer a train thats what you think somewhere flames flickered over the housetops more bells were ringing the bike wouldnt start mumbled tom the phone wouldnt work there was a storm i tried to get down here in time how could it have been my fault somewhere johnny felt it again the sense that he could reach out and go in directions not found on any map or compass but only on a clock it poured up from inside him until he felt that it was leaking out of his fingers he hadnt got the trolley or the bags but maybe he could remember how it felt weve got time he said are you mad said kirsty are you going to come or not said johnny where johnny took her hand and reached out for yoless with his other hand then he nodded towards tom who was still staring at the flames grab him too he said well need him when we get there where johnny tried to grin trust me he said someone has to he started to walk tom was dragged along with them like a sleepwalker faster said johnny or well never get there look the bombs have fallen said kirsty wearily its happened right it had to said johnny otherwise we couldnt get there before it did faster run he pushed forward dragging them after him i suppose we might be able to help panted yoless i know first aid first aid said kirsty you saw the explosions beside her the young man suddenly seemed to wake up he stared at the fire in the town and lurched forward and then they were all running all trying to keep up all causing the others to go faster and there was the road in that direction johnny took it the dark landscape lit up in shades of grey like a very old film the sky went from black to an inky purple and everything around them looked cold like crystal all the leaves and bushes glittering as if they were covered in frost he couldnt feel cold he couldnt feel anything johnny ran the road under his feet was sticky as though he was trying to sprint in treacle and the air filled with the noise hed last heard from the bags a great whispering rush of sound like a million radio stations slightly out of tune beside him yoless tried to say something but no words came out he pointed with his free hand instead blackbury lay ahead of them it wasnt the town he knew in and it wasnt the one from either it glowed johnny had never seen the northern lights hed read about them though the book said that on very cold nights sometimes the lights would come marching down from the north pole hanging in the sky like curtains of frozen blue fire that was how the town looked it gleamed as cold as starlight on a winter night he risked a glance behind there the sky was red a deep crimson that brightened to a ruby glow at its centre and he knew that if he stopped running it would all end the road would be a road again the sky would be the sky but if he just kept going in this direction he forced his legs to move onward pedalling in slow motion through the thick cold silent air the town got closer brighter now the others were pulling on his arms kirsty was trying to shout too but there was no sound here except the roar of all the tiny noises he snatched at their fingers trying to hold on and then the blue rushed towards him and met the red coming the other way and he was toppling forward onto the road he heard kirsty say im covered in ice johnny pushed himself to his feet and stared at his own arms ice crackled and fell off his sleeves as he moved yoless looked white frost steamed off his face what did we do what did we do said kirsty listen will you said yoless listen there was a whirring somewhere in the darkness and a clock began to strike johnny listened they were on the edge of town there was no traffic in the dark streets but there were no fires either there was the muffled sound of laughter from a nearby pub and the chink of glasses the clock went on striking the last note died away a cat yowled eleven oclock said kirsty but we heard eleven oclock when we were on the downs she turned and stared at johnny you took us back in time not back i think said johnny i think behind outside around across i dont know tom had managed to get to his knees what they could see of his face in the dusk said that here was a man to whom too much had happened and whose brain was floating loose weve got seven minutes said johnny huh said tom to get them to sound the siren shouted kirsty huh the bombs i saw the fires it wasnt my fault the phone they didnt but they will unless you do something right now on your feet right now shouted kirsty noone could resist a voice like that it went right through the brain and gave its commands directly to the muscles tom rose like a lift good now come on the police station was at the end of the street they reached the door in a group and fought one another to get through it there was an office inside with a counter running across it to separate the public from the forces of law and order a policeman was standing behind it he had been writing in a large book but now he was looking up with his mouth open hello tom he said whats going on youve got to sound the siren said johnny right now said kirsty the sergeant looked from one to the other and then at yoless where his gaze lingered for a while then he turned and glanced at a man in military uniform who was sitting writing at a desk in the office the sergeant was the sort of man who liked an audience if he thought he was going to be funny oh yes he said and why should i do that then theyre right sergeant said tom youve got to do it we ran all the way what off the down said the sergeant thats two miles that is sounds a bit fishy to me young man been round the back of the pub again have you hah remember that dormer bomber you heard last week he turned and smirked at the officer again a lorry on the slate road that was kristys patience which in any case was only visible with special scientific equipment came to an end dont you patronize us you ridiculous buffoon she screamed the sergeant went red and took a deep breath then it was let out suddenly hey where do you think youre going tom had scrambled over the desk the soldier stood up but was pushed out of the way the young man reached the switch and pulled it down you want fries with that wobbler and bigmac skulked behind the church theyve been gone a long time said bigmac its a long way up there said wobbler i bet somethings happened theyve been shot or something huh i thought you liked guns said wobbler i dont mind guns i dont like bullets said bigmac and i dont want to get stuck here with you weve got the time trolley said wobbler but do you know how to work it i reckon youve got to be half mental like johnny to work it i dont want to end up fighting romans or something you wont said bigmac he froze as he realized what hed said wobbler homed in what do you mean stuck here with you what does happen if i dont go home he said you lot went back to i wasnt there right oh you dont want to know any stuff like that said bigmac oh yeah you come in here and act cheeky the sergeant began be quiet snapped captain harris standing up why doesnt your siren work we tests it every tuesday and friday reglar said the sergeant theres a hole in the ceiling said yoless tom stood looking at the switch he was certain hed done his bit he wasnt sure how but hed done it and things that should be happening next werent happening it wasnt my fault he mumbled your man fired a gun said the sergeant we never did know where the bullet went we know now said the captain grimly its hit a wire somewhere theres got to be some other way said johnny it mustnt end like this not after everything look he pulled a crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket and held it up whats that said the captain its tomorrows newspaper said johnny if the siren doesnt go off the captain stared at it oh trying to pull our leg eh said the police sergeant nervously the captain turned his eyes from the paper to johnnys wrist he grabbed it where did you get this watch he snapped ive seen one like it before where do you come from boy here said johnny sort of but not now there was a moments silence then the captain nodded at the sergeant ring up the local newspaper will you he said its a morning paper isnt it someone should still be there youre not seriously please do it seconds ticked by as the policeman huddled over the big black phone he muttered a few words ive got mr stickers the chief compositor he said he says theyre just clearing the front page and what do we want the captain glanced at the paper and sniffed at it fish never mind is there an advertisement for johnsons cocoa in the bottom left hand corner of the page dont stare ask him there was some mumbling he says yes but the captain turned the page over on page two is there a single column story headed fined p for bike offence on the crossword is one down bird of stone we hear with three letters next to an advertisement for plants brushless shaving creams ask him the sergeant glared at him but spoke to the distant stickers roc said kirsty in an absentminded way the captain raised an eyebrow its a mythical bird i think said yoless in the same hypnotized voice spelled like rock but without a k we hear means it sounds the same he says yes said the sergeant he says thank you tell him to be ready in case no lets not be hasty just thank him there was a click when the sergeant put the phone down then the captain said do you know how long weve got three minutes said johnny can we get on the roof sergeant said the captain dunno but is there some other siren in the town theres a manky old windup thing we used to use but where is it its under the bench in the lost property cupboard but there was a leathery noise and suddenly the captain was holding a pistol you can argue with me afterwards he said you can report me to whomever you like but right now you can give me the keys or unlock the blasted cupboard or ill shoot the lock off and ive always wanted to try that believe me you dont believe these kids do sergeant in a sudden panic the sergeant fumbled in his pockets and trotted across the room you do believe us said kirsty im not sure said the captain as the sergeant dragged out something big and heavy thank you sergeant lets get it outside no im not sure at all young lady but i might believe that watch besides if im wrong then all that will happen is that ill look foolish and i daresay the sergeant will give you all a thick ear if im right then this wont happen he waved the paper i think so said johnny i dont even know if arty of this will happen bigmac was on the floor with wobbler on top of him wobbler might not know how to fight but he did know how to weigh get off said bigmac flailing around trying vicious streetfight punches on wobbler was like hitting a pillow im still alive in arent i said wobbler cos ive been born right so even if i never time travel back i ought to still be alive in right i bet you know something about me no no we never met you im alive then you do know something right get off i cant breathe come on tell me youre not supposed to know whats going to happen who says who says there was a yowl behind him wobbler turned his head bigmac looked up guilty the cat stretched lazily yawned and hopped down off the bags he padded confidently alongside the mossy wall moving in his lurching diagonal fashion and disappeared around the building wheres it going said wobbler how should i know get off f me the boys followed the cat who didnt seem at all bothered by their presence he stopped at the church door and lay down with his front paws outstretched first time ive seen him go away from the trolley said bigmac and then they heard it nothing the faint noises of the town didnt stop there was the sound of a piano from a pub somewhere a door opened and there was laughter a car went by slowly in the distance but suddenly the sounds were coming from a long way off as if there was some sort of thick invisible wall you know those bombs said wobbler not taking his eyes off the cat what bombs said bigmac the bombs johnnys been going on about yeah said bigmac can you remember what time he said it was pretty soon i think brilliant ive never seen anywhere bombed said bigmac guilty started to purr very loudly er you know my sister lives in canada said wobbler in a worried voice what about her whats she got to do with anything well she sent me a postcard once theres this cliff there right where the indians used to drive herds of buffalo over to kill them isnt geography wonderful yeah only there was this indian right and he wondered what the drive would look like from underneath and thats why its called headbashedin jump really they both turned and looked at the chapel this is still here in said bigmac i mean its not going to get bombed yeah but dont you think itd be better to be sort of behind it the wail of a siren rose and fell there were faint noises in paradise street someone must have moved a blackout curtain because light showed for a moment someone else shouted in a back garden somewhere great said bigmac all we need is popcorn but its going to happen to real people said wobbler aware that real people could include him no cos the sirens gone off theyll all be down their bomb shelters thats the whole point anyway itd happen anyway right its history okay itd be like going back to and watching the battle of whatever it was its not often you get to see an entire pickled onion factory blow up either people were certainly moving wobbler could hear them in the night a sound from this end of the street was exactly like someone walking into a tin bath in the darkness and then listen said bigmac uncertainly guilty sat up and looked alert there was a faint droning noise in the east brilliant said bigmac wobbler edged towards the side of the church this isnt television he mumbled the droning got closer wish id brought my camera said bigmac a door opened an avenue of yellow light spilled out into the night and a small figure dashed along it and came to a halt in the middle street it shouted our ronll get you the drone filled the sky bigmac and wobbler started running together they cleared the churchyard steps in one jump and pounded towards the boy who was dancing around waving a fist at the sky the aircraft were right overhead bigmac got to him first and lifted him off his feet then he skidded on the cobbles as he turned and headed back towards the church they were halfway there when they heard the whistling they were at the top of the steps when the first bomb hit the allotments they were jumping behind the wall when the second and third bombs hit the pickle factory they were landing on the grass as the bombs marched up the street and filled the air with a noise so loud it couldnt be heard and a light so white it came right through the eyelids and then the roar picked up the ground and shook it like a blanket that was the worst part wobbler said later and it was hard to find the worst part because all the others were so bad but the ground should be the ground there solid dependably under you it shouldnt drop away and then come back up and hit you so hard then there was a sound like a swarm of angry bees and then there was just the clink of collapsing brickwork and the crackle of fires wobbler raised his head very slowly ugh he said there were no leaves on the trees behind them and the trunks sparkled he got up very slowly and reached out it was glass bits of glass studded the whole trunk of the tree there were no leaves any more just glass beside him bigmac got to his feet like someone in a dream a flying pan had hit the church door so hard that it had been driven in halfway like a very domesticated martial arts weapon a stone doorstep had smashed a chunk out of the brickwork and everywhere there was glass crunching underfoot like permanent hail it glittered on the walls reflecting the fires in the ruins there seemed far too much to be from just a few house windows and then it began to rain first it rained vinegar and then it rained pickles there was red liquid all over bigmac he licked a finger and then held it up tomato sauce a gherkin bounced off wobblers head bigmac started to laugh people can start laughing for all sorts of reasons but sometimes they laugh because against all expectations theyre still alive and have a mouth left to laugh with you he tried to say you you you want fries with that it was the funniest thing wobbler had ever heard right now it was the funniest thing anyone had ever said anywhere he laughed until the tears ran down his face and mingled with the mustard pickle from somewhere in the shadows by the wall a small voice said ere did anyone get any shrapnel bigmac started to laugh on top of the laugh he was already laughing which caused a sound like a boiler trying not to burst what what whats shrapnel anyway he managed to say its its its bits of bomb you want fries with that said bigmac and almost collapsed with laughing the siren sang out again but this time it wasnt the rising and falling wail but one long tone which eventually died away theyre coming back said wobbler the laughter drained out of him as though a trapdoor had been opened nah thats the all clear said the voice by the wall dont you know nuffin wobblers grandfather stood up and looked down the length of what had once been paradise street cor he said obviously impressed there wasnt a whole house left standing roofs had gone windows had blown out half of the buildings had simply vanished into rubble which spilled across the street bells rang in the distance two fire engines skidded to a halt right outside the church an ambulance pulled up behind them you want bigmac began shut up will you said wobbler there were fires everywhere big fires little fires the pickle factory was well alight and smelled like the biggest fish and chip shop in the world people were running from every direction some of them were pulling at the rubble there was a lot of shouting i suppose everyone wouldve got out right said wobbler they would have got out wouldnt they the sirens wail slowed to a growl and then a clicking noise and then stopped johnny felt as though his feet werent exactly on the ground if he were any lighter hed float away they must have got out they had nearly a whole minute he said the sergeant had already headed toward paradise street the three of them had been left with tom and the captain who was watching johnny thoughtfully things pattered onto the roof of the police station and bounced down into the street yoless picked one up pickled onions he said they could see the flames over the rooftops so said the captain you were right a bit of an adventure yes and this is where i say well done chums isnt it he walked to the yard door and shut it then he turned i cant let you go he said you must know that you were with that other boy werent you the one with the strange devices there seemed no point in denying it yes said johnny i think you might know a lot of things things that we need and we certainly need them perhaps you know that he sighed i dont like this you may have saved some lives tonight but its possible that you could save a lot more do you understand we wont tell you anything said kirsty just name rank and serial number eh said the captain supposing we did know things said johnny it wouldnt do you any good and those things wont help either they wont make the war better theyll just make it different everything happens somewhere right now i think wed settle for different weve got some very clever men said the captain please captain it was tom yes they didnt have to do all this sir i mean they came and told us about the bombing didnt they and i dont know how they got me down here sir but they did s not right to put them in prison sir oh not prison said the captain a country house somewhere three square meals a day and lots of people wholl want to talk to them kirsty burst into tears now noones going to hurt you little girl said the captain he moved over and put his arm around her shaking shoulders johnny and yoless looked at one another and took a few steps backwards its all right said the captain we just need to know some things thats all things that may be going to happen well one thing sobbed kirsty one thing one thing thats going to happen is one thing is yes said the captain kirsty reached out and took his hand then her leg shot out and she pivoted hauling on the mans arm he somersaulted over her shoulder and landed on his back on the cobbles even as he tried to struggle upright she was spinning around again and caught him full in the chest with a foot he slumped backwards kirsty straightened her hat and nodded at the others chauvinist honestly its like being back with the dinosaurs shall we go she said tom backed away where do girls learn to do that he said at school said johnny youd be amazed kirsty reached down and took the captains pistol oh no said yoless not guns you can get into real trouble with guns i happen to be the under county champion said kirsty unloading the gun but im not intending to use it i just dont want him to get excited she threw the pistol behind some dustbins now are we going or what johnny looked around at tom sorry about this he said can you er explain things to him when he wakes up i wouldnt know how to start i dont know what happened myself good said kirsty firmly i mean did i run down here or not said tom i thought i saw the bombing but i mustve imagined it because it didnt happen until after we got here it was probably the excitement said yoless the mind plays strange tricks said kirsty they both glared at johnny dont look at me he said i dont know anything about anything up another leg what bigmac said afterwards was that hed never intended to help it had been like watching a film until hed seen people scrabbling at the wreckage then hed stepped through the screen fireman were pouring water on the flames people were pulling at fallen timbers or moving gingerly through each stricken house calling out names in a strange polite way in the circumstances yoohoo mr johnson excuse me mrs density are you there mrs williams anyone and wobbler said afterwards that he could remember three things one was the strange metallic clinking sound bricks make as piles of them slide around one was the smell of wet burnt wood and one was the bed the blast had taken off the roof and half the walls of a house but there was a double bed hanging out over the road it even still had the sheets on it it creaked up and down in the wind the two boys scrambled over the sliding rubble until they reached a back garden glass and bricks covered everything an elderly man wearing a nightshirt tucked into his trousers was standing and staring at the wreckage on his garden well thats my potatoes gone he said it was late frost last year and now this still said bigmac in a mad cheerful voice youve got a nice crop of pickled cucumbers cant abide em pickles give me wind fences had been laid flat sheds had been lifted up and dealt like cards across the gardens and as though the all clear had been the last trump people were rising out of the ground i just hope the others are still there said kirsty as they ran through the streets what do you think said yoless sorry i mean maybe theyre sitting quietly waiting for us or theyve got into some kind of trouble bets kirsty slowed down hang on a minute she said theres something ive got to know johnny yes he said hed been dreading this moment kirsty asked such penetrating questions what did we do back there i saw the bombs drop and im a very good observer but we got down to the police station before it happened so either im mad and im not mad or we ran through time said yoless look it was just a direction said johnny i just saw the way to go kirsty rolled her eyes can you do it again i dont think so i cant remember how i did it he was probably in a state of heightened awareness said yoless ive read about them what drugs said kirsty suspiciously me i dont even like coffee said johnny the world had always seemed so strange in any case that hed never dared try anything thatd make it even weirder but its an amazing talent think of the things you johnny shook his head he could remember seeing the way and he could remember the feelings but he couldnt remember the how it was as if he was looking at his memories behind thick amber glass come on he said and started running again but kirsty began i cant do it again said johnny itll never be the right time again bigmac and wobbler werent in trouble if only because there had been so much trouble just recently that there was for a while no more to get into this is an airraid shelter said bigmac i thought they were all you know steel and stuff big doors that go hiss lights flashing on and off you know he heaved on one end of a shed which had smashed into the airraid shelter belonging to no not just some corrugated iron and dirt with lettuces growing on top wobbler had rescued a shovel from the ruin of someones greenhouse and used it to heave bricks out of the way the shelter door opened and a middleaged woman staggered out she was wearing a floral pinny over a nightdress and holding a goldfish bowl with two fish in it a small girl was clinging to her skirts wheres michael the woman shouted where is he has anyone seen him i turned my back for two seconds to grab adolf and stalin and he was out the door like a kid in a green jersey said wobbler got glasses ears like the world cup hes looking for shrapnel hes safe she sagged with relief i dont know what id have told his mother you all right said bigmac im afraid your house is a bit flatter than it was mrs density looked at what was left of no oh well worse things happen at sea she said vaguely do they said bigmac mystified its just a blessing we werent in it said mrs density there was a clink of brickwork and a firemen slid down the debris towards them all right mrs density he said i reckon youre the last one fancy a nice cup of tea oh hello bill she said whore these lads then said the fireman we were just helping out said wobbler were you oh right well come away out of it the pair of you we reckon theres an unexploded one at number the fireman stared at bigmacs clothes for a moment and then shrugged he gently took the goldfish bowl from mrs density and put his other arm around her shoulders a nice cup of tea and a blanket he said just the thing eh come along luv the boys watched them slide and scramble through the fallen bricks you get bombed and they give you a cup of tea said bigmac i spose its better than getting bombed and never ever getting one again said wobbler anyway there eeeeyyyyooooowwwwmmmm screamed a voice behind them they turned wobblers grandfather was standing on a pile of bricks and looked like a small devil in the light of the fires he was covered in soot and was waving something through the air and making aeroplane noises that looks likebigmac began its a bit offf a bomb said the boy nearly the whole tail fin i dont know anyone whos got nearly a whole tail fin he zoomed the twisted metal through the air again er kid said wobbler the boy lowered the fin you know about motorbikes said wobbler oh no said bigmac you cant tell him anything about you just shut up said wobbler youve got a grandad yes but there has to be a warder there when i go an see him wobbler looked back at the boy dangerous things motorbikes he said im going to have a big one when i grow up said his grandfather with rockets on it an machine guns and everythin eeeooowwmmmm oh i wouldnt do that if i were you said wobbler in the special dumb voice for talking to children you dont want to go crashing it do you oh i wont crash said his grandfather confidently mrs densitys daughters a nice little girl isnt she said wobbler desperately shes all smelly and horrible eeeeeoowwmmm anyway youre fat mister he ran down the far side of the heap they saw his shadow darting between the firemen and heard the occasional voommrnm come on said bigmac lets get back to the church the man said they thought there was an unexploded bomb he just didnt want to listen said wobbler i wouldve listened yeah sure said bigmac well i would sure come on i couldve helped him if only hed listened i know stuff why wont he listen i could make life a lot easier for him all right i believe you now lets go shall we they reached the church just as johnny and the others came running up the street everyone all right said kirsty why are you covered in soot you two weve been rescuing people said wobbler proudly well sort of they looked at the wreck of paradise street people were standing around in small groups and sitting on the ruins some ladies in officiallooking hats had set up a table with a tea urn on it there were still a few small fires however and the occasional crash and tinkle as a highaltitude cocktail onion fell back to earth in a coating of ice johnny stared everyone got out johnny said wobbler watching him carefully i know the siren was just in time i know behind him johnny heard kirsty say i hope they get counselling we found out about that said bigmacs voice they get a nice cup of tea and told to cheer up because it could be worse thats all well theres biscuits too johnny watched the street the firelight almost made it look cheerful and his minds eye saw the other street it was here too happening at the same time there were the same fires and the same piles of rubble and the same fire engines but there were no people except the ones carrying stretchers were in a new time he thought everything you do changes everything and every time you move in time you arrive in a time a little bit different to the one you left what you do doesnt change the future just a future theres millions of places when the bombs killed everyone in paradise street but it didnt happen here the ghostly images faded away as the other time veered off into its own future johnny said yoless wed better get out of here yeah no point in staying said bigmac johnny turned okay he said are we going by trolley or are we going to walk said kirsty johnny shook his head trolley he said it was waiting where theyd left it but there was no sign of guilty oh no said kirsty were not going to look for a cat he went to watch the bombing said wobbler dont know what happened to him after that johnny gripped the handle of the trolley the bags creaked in the darkness dont worry about the cat he said cats find their own way home the golden threads club occupied the old church on friday mornings sometimes there was a folk singer or entertainment from local schools if this couldnt be avoided mainly there was tea and a chat this was usually about how things were worse now than they had ever been especially those golden days when you could buy practically anything for sixpence and still have change there was a change in the air and five figures appeared the golden threaders watched them suspiciously in case they broke into the streets of london they also noted that they were under thirty years old and therefore almost certainly criminals for one thing theyd apparently stolen a shopping trolley and one of them was black er said johnny is this the theatre group said kirsty the others were astonished at the quick thinking oh no wrong church hall very sorry they edged towards the door pushing the trolley the threaders watched them owlishly teacups cooling in their hands wobbler opened the door and ushered the others through it dont forget one of them was black said yoless as he stepped out he rolled his eyes sarcastically and waved his hands in the air wes goin to de carnivaaal some other now the air outside smelled of kirsty looked at her watch tenthirty on saturday morning she said not bad er your watch is at tenthirty on saturday morning said johnny that doesnt mean we are good point but i think we are anyway this all looks right looks fine to me said wobbler weve been out all night said yoless my mumll go spare tell her you stopped at my place and the phone was broken said wobbler i dont like lying are you going to tell her the truth yoless thought for a few agonized seconds your phone was broken right yeah and ill tell my mum i was staying at your place said wobbler i shouldnt think my grandads noticed im not in said johnny he always drops off in front of the telly my parents have a very modern outlook said kirsty my brother doesnt mind where i am so long as the police dont come round said bigmac before time travelling to any extent johnny thought you should always get your alibi sorted out he stared at the place where paradise street had been it was still the sports centre that hadnt changed but paradise street was still there underneath not underground just somewhere else another fossil did we change anything said kirsty well im back said wobbler and thats good enough for me but those people are alive when they ought tove been dead kirsty began and stopped when she saw johnnys expression all right not exactly ought but you know what i mean one of them mightve invented the zbomb or something whats the zbomb said bigmac how should i know it wasnt invented when we left someone in paradise street invented a bomb said johnny well all right not a bomb something else thatd change history any little thing and you know we left all bigmacs stuff in the police station ahem yoless removed his hat and produced a watch and a walkman the sergeant was so flustered he forgot to lock the cupboard after he got the siren out said yoless so i nipped in did you get the jacket chucked it in a dustbin that was mine said bigmac reproachfully well maybe thats all right kirsty conceded reluctantly but theres bound to be some other changes wed better find out pretty fast wed better have a bath too said wobbler your hands have got blood on them said johnny wobbler looked down vaguely oh yeah well we were pulling at smashedup walls and things he said you know in case there was anyone trapped you shouldve seen him grab his grandad said bigmac it was brilliant wobbler looked proud they met up an hour later in the mall the burger bar was back to the way it had always been noone said anything about it but from the way he sighed occasionally it was clear that bigmac was thinking of free burgers every week for the rest of his life that jogged johnnys memory oh yes said johnny er weve got this letter for you he pulled it out it was crumpled and covered in vinegar and sooty fingerprints er its for you he repeated someone asked us to give it to you yeah someone said yoless who we dont know who he was said bigmac a completely mysterious person so its no use you asking us questions wobbler gave them a suspicious look and ripped open the envelope go on whats he say said bigmac who said wobbler y this mysterious person said bigmac dumb stuff said wobbler read it yourself johnny took the paper that had been in the envelope it contained a list numbered from one to ten i eat healthy food in moderation he read an hours exercise every day is essential invest money wisely in a mixture of whats the point of all this junk its the sort of thing grandads say said wobbler whyd anyone want to tell me that youd have to be some kind of loony to go around telling people that this was one of those religious blokes that hang around in the mall right huh i thought it might be something important bigmac glanced at the burger bar again and sighed deeply there have been changes said kirsty clark street isnt clark street any more i noticed when i went past its evershott street thats frightening said bigmac oooeeeoooeee a street name was mysteriously changed i thought it was always evershott street said yoless me too said wobbler and that shop over there that used to sell cards and things now its a jewelers said kirsty insistently the boys craned around to look at it its always been a jewelers hasnt it said wobbler he yawned well youre an unobservant bunch i kirsty began hold on said johnny how did you get all those cuts on your hands wobbler you too bigmac well er i er wobblers eyes glazed we were messing around said bigmac werent we yeah messing around somewhere dont you remember kirsty began forget about it said johnny come on kirsty weve got to go where to visiting time weve got to see mrs tachyon kirsty waved a hand frantically at the other three but they dont seem to it doesnt matter come on they cant just forget said kirsty as they hurried out of the mall they cant just think oh it was all a dream i think its all sort of healing over said johnny didnt you see it happening back in tom didnt really believe anything that had happened i bet by now i mean a few hours after i bet theyre remembering i mean they remembered something different he ran all the way and got there just in time everyone was a bit shocked because of the bombing something like that people have to forget what really happened because well it didnt happen not here we can remember what really happened said kirsty perhaps thats because youre hyperintelligent and im megastupid said johnny oh i wouldnt say that said kirsty youre being a bit unfair oh good i meant i wouldnt go so far as to say hyper just very why do we have to see mrs tachyon someone ought to shes a timebaglady said johnny i think its all the same to her round the corner or theyre all just directions to her she goes where she likes shes mad theyd reached the hospital steps johnny trudged up them she probably is mad he thought or eccentric anyway i mean if she went to a specialist and he showed her all those cards and ink blots shed just nick them or something yes eccentric but she wouldnt do things like dropping bombs on paradise street you have to be sane to think of things like that shes totally round the bend but perhaps she gets a better view from there it was quite a cheerful thought in the circumstances mrs tachyon had gone the ward sister seemed quite angry about it do you know anything about this she demanded us said kirsty weve just come in know about what mrs tachyon had gone to the lavatory shed locked herself in and in the end theyd had to get someone to take the lock off in case shed fallen down in there she wasnt in there at all they were three floors up and the window was too small even for someone as skinny as mrs tachyon to climb through was there any toilet paper said johnny the sister gave him a look of deep suspicion the whole rolls gone she said johnny nodded that sounded like mrs tachyon and the headphones have vanished said the sister do you know about any of this youve been visiting her thats only been because its you know like a project said kirsty defensively there was the sound of sensible shoes behind them they turned out to belong to ms partridge the social worker ive phoned the police she said why said johnny well she oh its you well she needs help not that they were any help they said she always turns up johnny sighed mrs tachyon he suspected never needed help if she wanted help she just took it if she needed a hospital she went where there was one she could be anywhere now must have slipped out when noone was looking said ms partridge she couldnt said the sister stoutly we can see the door from here were very careful about that sort of thing then she must have vanished into thin air said ms partridge kirsty sidled closer to johnny while they argued and said out of the corner of her mouth where did you leave the trolley behind our garage said johnny dyou think shes taken it yes said johnny happily johnny was quiet on the bus home theyd gone to the library and hed wangled a photocopy of the local paper for the day after the raid there was a picture of people looking very cheerful in the ruins of paradise street of course things were pretty faded now but there was mrs density with her goldfish bowl and wobblers grandfather with his bit of bomb and just behind them grinning and holding his thumb up you could just make out wobbler it hadnt been a good photo to start with and it hadnt improved with age and he had soot all over his face but if you knew it was wobbler you could see it was him all right theyre all forgetting except me he thought i bet even if i showed them the paper theyd say oh yes that bloke looks like wobbler so what because they live here theyve always lived here in a way when you travel in time it really happens but its like a little loop in a tape you go round the loop and then carry on from where you were before and everything thats changed turns out to be history youve gone very quiet said kirsty i was just thinking said johnny i was thinking that if i showed the others this piece from the paper theyd say oh yeah that looks like ole wobbler so what kirsty leaned across oh yes she said well it does look like wobbler so what johnny stared out of the window i mean he said its wobbler in the paper remember remember what well yesterday she wrinkled her forehead didnt we go to some sort of party johnnys heart sank it all settles down he thought thats whats so horrible about time travel you come back to a different place you come back to the place where you didnt go in the first place and its not your place because here was where noone died in paradise street so heres where i didnt want to go back so i didnt so they didnt either when the newspaper picture was taken we were back there but now were back here we never went so they dont remember because here theres nothing to remember here we did something else hung on hung around here im remembering things that never happened its your stop said kirsty are you all right no said johnny and got off the bus it was raining heavily but he went and checked to see if the trolley was where hed left it it wasnt on the other hand maybe it had never been there at all when he went up to his bedroom he could hear the rain drumming on the roof hed vaguely hoped that he might have been a different person in this world but there it all was the same bedroom the same mess the same space shuttle on its bit of red wool the same stuff for the project all over the table he sat on his bed and watched the rain for a while he could feel the shadows in the air hovering around the corners of the room hed lost mrs tachyons paper somewhere that would have been proof but noone else would believe it he could remember it all the rain on the moor the thunderstorm the sting on his whole body when theyd run through time and it hadnt happened not exactly normal dull boring everyday life had just poured right in again johnny went through his pockets if only there was something his fingers touched a piece of card the sound of australian accents from downstairs suggested that his grandad was in he trailed downstairs and into the little front room grandad yes said his grandfather who was watching cobbers you know the war yes you know you said that before you went in the army you were a sort of aircraft spotter got a medal for it said his grandfather he picked up the remote control and switched off the set which never usually happened showed it you didnt i mustve done dont think so said johnny as diplomatically as possible before his grandfather had always told him not to go on about things his grandfather reached down beside his chair there was an old wickerwork sewing box there which had belonged to johnnys grandmother it hadnt been used for cotton and needles for a long time though it was full of old newspaper cuttings keys that didnt fit any door in the house stamps for one halfpenny in old money and all the other stuff that accumulates in odd corners of a house that has been lived in for a long time finally after much grunting he produced a small wooden box and opened it they said they never knew how i done it he said proudly but mr hodder and captain harris spoke up for me oh yes had to be possible they said otherwise i couldnt ve done it could i the phonesd got hit by lightning and the bike wouldnt start no matter what he yelled so i had to run all the way down into the town so they had to give it to me cos they spoke up johnny turned the silver medal over in his hands there was a yellowing bit of paper with it badly typed by someone who hadnt changed the ribbon on his typewriter for years gallant action he read ensuring the safety of the people of blackbury some men from the olympics came to see me after the war said his grandfather but i told them i didnt want any how did you do it said johnny they said someones watch mustve been wrong said grandad i dont know about that i just ran for it sall a bit of a blur now tell you the truth he put the medal back in the box beside it held together with an elastic band was a grubby pack of cards johnny took them out and removed the band they had aircraft on them johnny reached into his pocket and took out the five of clubs it was a lot less worn but there was no doubt that it was part of the pack he slipped it under the band and put the pack back in the box grandad and johnny sat and looked at one another for a moment there was no sound but the rain and the ticking of the mantelpiece clock johnny felt the time drip around them thick as amber then grandad blinked picked up the remote control and aimed it at the tv anyway weve all passed a lot of water under the bridge since those days he said and that was that the doorbell rang johnny trooped out into the hall the bell rang again urgently johnny opened the door oh he said gloomily hello kirsty rain had plastered her hair to her head i ran back from the next stop she said oh why she held up a pickled onion i found it in my pocket and i remembered we did go back not back said johnny its more like there the elation rose up inside him like a big pink cloud come on in everything even the pickles good i thought i ought to tell you rights do you think mrs tachyon will ever find her cat johnny nodded wherever he is he said the sergeant and the soldier picked themselves up off the ground and staggered towards the wreckage where the house had been that poor old biddy that poor old biddy said the sergeant dyou think she mightve got out in time said the soldier that poor old biddy she was sort of close to the wall moaned the soldier hopefully the house isnt there any more what do you think they scrambled through the damp ruins of paradise street oh god theres going to be hell to pay for this youre telling me you shouldnt ve left it unguarded that poor old biddy dyou know how much sleep weve had this past week do you and we lost corporal williams over in slate we knocked off for five minutes in the middle of the night thats all a crater lay in front of them something bubbled in the bottom she got any relatives said the soldier no noone been here ages my dad says he remembers seeing her about sometimes when he was a lad said the sergeant he removed his helmet poor old biddy he said thats what you think dinner dinner dinner dinner they turned a skinny figure wearing an old coat over a nightdress and a woolly hat ran along the road expertly steering a wire cart between the mounds of rubble dinner dinner the sergeant stared at the soldier how did she do that search me dinner dinner batman some way away guilty ambled in his sideways fashion through the back streets hed had an interesting morning hunting through the remains of paradise street and had passed some quality time during the afternoon in the ruins of the pickle factory where there were mice some of them fried it had been a good day around him blackbury went back to sleep there was still a terrible smell of vinegar everywhere by some miracle of preservation a large jar of pickled beetroot had been blown right across the town and landed unbroken and unnoticed in a civic flowerbed from whence it had bounced into the gutter guilty waited by it washing himself after a while he looked up as a familiar squeaking sound came around the corner and stopped a hand wearing a woolly glove with the fingers cut out reached down and picked up the jar there was a series of complicated unscrewing noises and then a sound like well like someone eating pickled beetroot until the juice ran down their chin ali said a voice and then belched thats the stuff to give the troops bromide thats what you think laugh i nearly brought a tractor guilty hopped up onto the trolley mrs tachyon reached up and adjusted the headphones under her bobble hat she scratched at a surgical dressing dratted thing shed have to get someone to take it off her but she knew a decent nurse over in then she scrabbled in her pockets and fished out the sixpence the sergeant had given her she remembered him giving it to her mrs tachyon remembered everything and had long ago given up wondering whether the things she remembered had already happened or not take life as it was going to come was her motto and if it didnt come go and fetch it the past and the future were all the same but you could get a good feed off of a sixpence if you knew the right way to do it she squinted at it in the grey light of dawn it was a bit old and grubby but the date was quite clear it said tea and buns thats what you think mr copper and she went back to and spent it on fish and chips and still had change the end
