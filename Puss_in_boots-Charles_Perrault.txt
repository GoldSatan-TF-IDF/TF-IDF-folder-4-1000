chapter one once upon a time there was a poor miller he lived in a small house together with his three sons the miller worked at the mill and his sons helped him the miller had no horse he used his donkey to bring wheat from the fields the years went by the miller grew old and died his sons decided to divide their fathers things among themselves that was easy he had almost nothing to leave to his sons only his mill his donkey and his cat im going to take the mill said the millers oldest son im going to take the donkey said the second and what about me asked the youngest son you you can take the cat laughed his brothers the young fellow was very much upset he went out of the house and sat down on the bench oh well he said in a sad voice my brothers have the mill and the donkey they can put them together and make enough money to live an honest life but what can i do i can eat the cat and i can make a hat out of his fur but then i have nothing i can die of hunger the cat was sitting on the bench too he was trying not to listen to his master but of course he heard all his words and he didnt like them at all he put on a serious face and said dont look so sad master im not a bad thing and i am more useful to you alive than dead i can prove that how so asked the cats master all you have to do is to give me a bag and get a pair of boots such as gentlemen wear in the woods im going to show you that youre lucky to have me its unusual that a cat can speak at all the millers son said to himself but then he started thinking this cats very good at catching rats and mice he played so many cunning tricks on them he never came home without a rat or a mouse he could hide in the wheat or pretend to be dead perhaps he can help me after all ok he said to the cat im going now to order the boots chapter two the millers son went to the best shoemaker in town the shoemaker made elegant shoes and boots for gentlemen i want to order a fine pair of very small boots they are for my cat said the young man ok said the shoemaker he was not surprised at all or perhaps just a little do have any money he asked here you are said the millers son he took his last silver coin out of his pocket and gave it to the shoemaker soon the boots were made the cat pulled them on he looked very nice in his elegant boots dont worry about the money master im going to bring you luck said the cat in boots he put the bag around his neck cats have no hands so he held the strings in his forepaws then he put some vegetables and a piece of bread into the bag the cat went to the woods there were many rabbits there so he lay down pretending to be dead the cat didnt move at all his plan was to wait for some foolish rabbit to come and look into his bag the cat didnt wait long soon a foolish young rabbit put his head inside the bag the cat closed the strings at once and caught him then very proud he went with the bag to the palace and asked to speak with the king the king agreed to see the unusual visitor the cat went upstairs to the kings room he came up to the king and made a low bow then he said sir here is a nice rabbit from the lands which belong to my noble master the marquis of carabas he decided to give his young master this title he told me to offer it to your majesty tell your master said the king politely that i thank him for this nice present im very pleased with his attention another time the cat went to a wheat field and hid among standing wheat he again held his bag open soon two fat partridges ran into the bag the cat drew the strings and caught them both the cat went to the kings palace again he gave the partridges to the king with the same message from his master as before the king received the gift his majesty was very pleased he even ordered to take the cat down into the kitchen and give him something to eat and drink the cat enjoyed the meal very much he sat in the kitchen for a long time talking about his rich master the marquis of carabas chapter three the cat in boots continued for two or three months to bring presents to the king every time he came to the palace and said your majesty heres another present from my master the marquis of carabas then one day one of the cats friends in the palace said to him the king wants to drive today in his carriage along the bank of the river his majesty is going to take his daughter with him the young princess was a very beautiful girl the cat in boots said to his master now you must do what i tell you the millers son knew nothing about the cats new plan but he was sad and unhappy thats why he agreed at once be it so he said tell me about your plan i dont ask much said the cat looking wise as cats can all you must do is to go and bathe in the river i know a good place then leave the rest to me only remember that you are no longer yourself but the marquis of carabas ok said the millers son its all the same to me he went to the bank of the river took off his clothes and went bathing the cat followed his master and hid his clothes under a great stone at that moment the king drove past that place in his carriage the cat began to shout at the top of his voice help help the marquis of carabas is drowning the king heard the shouts and put his head out of the carriage he recognized the cat guards he said help the marquis of carabas quick the guards ran to the river they quickly pulled the young man out of the water the cat came up to the kings carriage he made a low bow and gave his explanations my master went bathing he said and suddenly some thieves came they took all his clothes and ran away and now the marquis of carabas cant appear before your majesty and your beautiful daughter oh its not a problem at all said the king he ordered one of his guards to ride back to the palace and bring fine clothes for the marquis of carabas soon the guard brought a nice suit for the millers son the young man put it on and came up to the carriage to thank his majesty the millers son wasnt rich but he was a handsome and wellbuilt fellow in the kings elegant suit he looked like a real gentleman the beautiful princess admired the handsome young man very much the millers son looked at the girl several times and she fell in love with him the king was very happy to meet the marquis of carabas he asked the young gentleman to sit with him and his daughter in the carriage of course the millers son didnt refuse chapter four the marquis of carabas entered the carriage the cat in boots ran away fast he kept a long way ahead of the kings carriage he went on and on till he saw some mowers in a meadow the cat came up to them listen good people he said in a very firm voice the king is going to stop here and talk to you you must tell him that this meadow belongs to the marquis of carabas do that if you want to stay alive the kings carriage drove up to the meadow what a nice meadow and so much hay whose meadow is this he asked the mowers it belongs to the marquis of carabas sir they all cried with one voice trembling with fear you have a good meadow marquis said his majesty to the millers son the young man bowed and said as you see for yourself this is a very good meadow sir the crops of hay are high every year the cat went still on he was far ahead of the king and his companions finally he came to a wheat field there were some reapers on the field my good fellows he said to the reapers the king is going to stop here and talk to you you must tell him that this field belongs to the marquis of carabas do that if you want to stay alive the kings carriage arrived a few moments later what a beautiful wheat field good people whose field is this he asked the reapers it belongs to the marquis of carabas sir cried the reapers trembling with fear at this the king was pleased with the marquis more than ever the king continued his journey and the cat still ran on ahead of him he said the same thing to everyone the king drove past a new mill a beautiful garden houses more fields and meadows and all the people on his way said the same all those places belonged to the marquis of carabas finally the cat returned to the king he came up to the carriage and bowed your master is a very rich man said the king to the cat then he smiled to the young man and said my dear marquis isnt this your castle in that park it looks beautiful can we go there now the millers son didnt know what to say he looked at the cat the cat bowed and said my master the marquis of carabas is happy to invite you to the castle but your majesty please wait an hour im going to the castle at once to get everything ready for you no problem said the king and in the meantime we can visit your nice park my dear marquis he said to the young man i hope you have many flowers there my daughter is so fond of white roses chapter five the cat in boots ran to the castle it stood in the middle of a big park there were wonderful flowers everywhere in the park the castle itself was a beautiful high building with small towers the roofs were red the walls of the castle were made of white stone the windows were narrow but high the rooms on the ground floor had the highest windows and through the glass visitors could see elegant green curtains the castle belonged to a giant he was the richest giant in the country all the fields meadows and woods around the castle were part of his lands many people worked for him the cat already knew a lot about the giant he was a cruel man everyone was terribly afraid of him the cat put on a brave face and went to the castle with his boots on soon he arrived at the gate he asked a servant to speak to the giant i am a traveller he said i was not far from here i couldnt go so near the castle of such a noble gentleman without meeting him the giant heard this message and agreed to see the visitor he was going to have dinner so he was in a good mood please sit down and have dinner with me he said to the cat thank you sir said the cat but first i hope you can answer a question they say that you can change yourself into any animal a lion for example or an elephant thats true said the giant and i can prove it just now look whom do you see now and the giant changed himself into a big lion the cat was terribly frightened he even climbed up the curtain of course it wasnt easy to climb in boots but the lion was so big how can you be brave and keep still near such an awful animal a few moments later the lion changed back into the giant the cat came down im so sorry sir i was very frightened he said but do you know what i think it was easy for such a big gentleman as you to change yourself into a large animal but im afraid even you cant become a small animal such as a rat or a mouse its just impossible impossible cried the giant very angry see how its impossible at the same moment he changed himself into a mouse the mouse began to run about the floor it was part of the cats plan he jumped on the mouse at once and ate it so that was the end to the giant chapter six meanwhile the king his daughter and the marquis of carabas arrived at the castle the carriage drove over the drawbridge with a loud noise the cat heard the noise and ran out into the yard to meet the visitors welcome sir to the castle of the marquis of carabas he said in a loud voice your castle is so beautiful marquis said the king nothing could be finer than this yard and all these buildings its not a castle at all its a real palace lets go inside and look around if you dont mind the king got out of the carriage and went to the door the marquis without speaking gave his hand to the princess as soon as she got out of the carriage they followed the king the king and his companions went through several beautiful rooms and came into a great hall in the middle of the hall they saw a long table it was ready for dinner there were a lot of wonderful things on the table all of them were the giants favourite dishes why dont we have dinner now said the marquis please sit down the guests took their places everyone was hungry so the dinner started at once the king was happy his daughter was happy too the girl in fact was very much in love with the handsome and polite young man his majesty was a practical man too the marquis is a noble gentleman my daughter likes him and hes rich i think he can make a good husband for my daughter he thought after his sixth or seventh glass of wine soon the dinner was over the king looked across the table at the millers son do you like my daughter marquis he said yes sir said the young man you can marry her then if you want of course said the king thats your choice i am happy to do that said the marquis of carabas the princesss happy eyes said the same the millers son married the kings daughter the next day the young man was happy he was a rich noble gentleman now the giants castle belonged to him he had all the giants lands too and he had a beautiful wife the cat in boots became at once a great lord of course he stayed in the castle with the marquis and the princess he ordered more elegant boots for himself but he never ran after mice any more except for pleasure the end
